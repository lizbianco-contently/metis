At 10 o'clock, there is a meeting that will take place with the \nstaffs of Democrats and Republicans. They have already started writing \na proposed piece of legislation.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to three of \nOklahoma's finest heroes.\n  SGT Daniel Eshbaugh, of Norman, OK.\n  CWO Brady Rudolf, of Oklahoma City, OK.\n  And CPL Michael Thompson, of Harrah, OK.\n  They were among the soldiers who were killed on September 17, 2008 in \nTallil, Iraq, when their CH-47 Chinook helicopter crashed while en \nroute from Kuwait to Balad Air Base north of Baghdad.\n  SGT Eshbaugh, CWO Rudolf and CPL Thompson were members of Detachment \n1, Company B, 2nd Battalion, 149th Aviation, from Lexington, OK.\n  The unit, which is made up of approximately 200 Texas and Oklahoma \nGuard members, was mobilized in June and left for duty in Iraq in late \nAugust.\n  All three were on their second tour in Iraq.\n\n\n                          SGT DANIEL ESHBAUGH\n\n  SGT Dan Eshbaugh served as a flight engineer in the 149th.\n  He enlisted in the Air Force in 1982 and served for 10 years.\n  Dan joined the Oklahoma Army National Guard in 1998 and served until \n2000.\n  In 2002, he reenlisted in the Oklahoma Army National Guard and was \nmobilized in 2008.\n  Dan's first deployment was in 2003 in support of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom, spending 4 months in theater.\n  Dan leaves behind his wife Rachel and their two sons, Bryan and \nJordan.\n  He is also survived by his two daughters, Jessica and Ashley, and his \nmother, Bernadine.\n  Yesterday I talked with Dan's wife Rachel and she talked about Dan's \nlove for the Army, that it was his ``whole life''.\n  In addition to his deep love and commitment to our country, he also \nloved to hunt and loved sports.\n  I read through some of the comments written on Dan's on-line guest \nbooks.\n  Many people wrote about Dan's sense of humor, his ability to tell \ngood stories, and his love for his family.\n  It was obvious that Dan enjoyed spending time with his entire family \ntogether, at reunions, over meals, and watching sports.\n  I want to share excerpts from a few.\n\n       Danny . . . My Big Brother . . . Thank you for trying to \n     make peace in this insane world, so that our children can \n     have a safe place to someday raise their children. Ian and \n     Arden will always remember their Uncle Danny. I find comfort \n     in knowing that your spirit is together with Grandpa and Dad. \n     I know they have embraced you. The strength of three \n     generations of Eshbaugh's looking over us will be the \n     strength that we all hold in our hearts. I will love you \n     forever . . . your little sister Kimberlee.''\n       There are so many memories I have to cherish of my cousin \n     ``Danny''. He was so much fun to see when our families would \n     get together on visits to Grandma and Grampa's house when we \n     were young. . . . I will cherish these and all the memories \n     that I have. I am so proud to be your cousin.\n       We are proud of Dan's dedication and loyalty to protecting \n     this country. God grant us the wisdom to be worthy of his \n     ultimate sacrifice. Dan, may you, my brother Dan and my Dad \n     find your ``mansion'' up there overlooking a fully stocked \n     lake in that happy hunting ground.''\n\n       And from Dan's friends and the soldiers he served with the \n     entire family, nieces, nephews, and cousins, they all said \n     that Dan, or ``Danny'' as his family called him, was an \n     inspiration for all to follow and had a positive impact on \n     all who met him.\n\n\n                   Chief Warrant Officer Brady Rudolf\n\n  CWO Brady Rudolf served as a CH-47 ``Chinook'' pilot in the 149th and \nhad been in the National Guard for over 20 years.\n  Brady was also a pharmacist when not on duty.\n  In 2003, he deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom \nand spent 4 months in theater.\n  Brady is survived by his wife of 13 years, Jennifer, and their three \nsons Braden, Ty, and Nate.\n  Brady is also survived by his mother Nathalia and brother Dustin.\n  Last night, I spoke to Jennifer, Brady's wife, and we talked about \nBrady's love of flying, something, as a pilot myself, I can fully \nunderstand.\n  Jennifer also talked about his strong faith and commitment to Jesus.\n  Dustin Rudolf, Brady's brother, said Brady was a dedicated father, \nhusband and soldier who comes from a long line of servicemen in the \nRudolf family.\n  ``He was a great father, a great husband and just an all-around great \nhuman being. The sacrifice he gave for our freedom and what we live for \nhere in America is an awesome thing and he knew it and he lived it.''\n  Dustin also said that his brother was voted class clown by his \ngraduating class.\n  ``He was a jokester but he could be serious too when it mattered,'' \nDustin said.\n  ``He was a conscientious pilot who liked to take care of people. He \nwould give the shirt off his back for anyone.''\n  The following is from Brady's online journal:\n  One of his co-workers from the pharmacy wrote,\n\n       I worked with Brady for several years at the Pharmacy in \n     Newscastle. Of the many things I could say about him, these \n     seem the most important: He spoke with deep adoration and \n     love for his family and his faith in the Lord. He was always \n     proud of the smallest accomplishments and milestones his boys \n     achieved. . . . Thank you for allowing me to share in a small \n     part of his life. Because of Brady's love and faith in the \n     Lord, I was able to find my way back to my faith. Thank you, \n     Brady, for your service to our beloved country.\n\n  From a fellow classmate in pharmacy school:\n\n       We were in pharmacy school with Brady. He was an excellent \n     man of values and had a great love for his family. Brady was \n     an encouragement to be around.\n\n  And finally a friend wrote:\n\n       I remember Brady as a blonde-headed, bright eyed, fun-\n     loving All-American boy. His smile would light the room. It \n     is apparent that he grew up to be a man of such good \n     character-an All-American Hero! . . . May Brady's legacy of \n     service to others be carried on by each of us. Your family is \n     in my thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                          CPL MICHAEL THOMPSON\n\n  CPL Michael Thompson served as a door gunner in the 149th.\n  Michael graduated Kingston High School in 2003 and then enlisted in \nthe Army in 2004.\n  He left active-duty service and joined the Oklahoma Army National \nGuard in 2007.\n  Michael previously deployed to Iraq in 2005 and spent 11 months in \ntheater.\n  Michael is survived by his father Kory Thompson of Harrah, OK, his \nmother Angela Perry, his stepfather Richard Perry, and sister Jami.\n  Michael also leaves behind his fiancee, KC Colvin.\n  When I talked with Michael's mom Angela last night, she spoke about \nhow her son's love for people and how he was loved by everyone.\n  He never met a stranger he did not like and who did not like him; \neven the mailman loved Mikey, Mikey was the name he is affectionately \nknown by his many friends and family.\n  Mikey was full of personality and he loved to hunt and fish.\n  Family members said that he volunteered to go to Iraq because the \nArmy needed a qualified open-door machine gunner.\n  ``He was qualified for machine guns from his active duty in the \nmilitary before this,'' said Richard Perry, Michael's stepfather. ``He \nvolunteered to go to help out.''\n  CPT Travis Ward, an Oklahoma Guard helicopter pilot, said Michael \ntransferred into the Oklahoma Army National Guard at the first of the \nyear after serving in the infantry.\n  ``He made two drill weekends with us and on the second one, he heard \nthe rumor that the deploying units were looking for people to be door \ngunners.\n  ``As soon as he heard that, Michael came straight to me and asked if \nhe\n\n[[Page S9441]]\n\ncould volunteer. The very next weekend, he started with that unit. He \nwas a very excited young man and extremely enthusiastic.''\n  Here are some comments from Michael's online journal:\n\n       Job well done soldier! You were a true Patriot and warrior \n     keeping America strong . . . You are in Post everlasting now. \n     You will NEVER be forgotten. To the family I can only say \n     your son/husband/friend will forever be a hero. I salute you \n     . . .\n       John 15:13 says, ``Greater love hath no man than this--that \n     a man lay down his life for his friends.'' I feel so blessed \n     to have known Michael and even more so that he died \n     protecting our way of life as we know it. You will be missed \n     by all who knew you.\n       Mikey never met a stranger. His personality and love for \n     life was contagious! You will be greatly missed, and I feel \n     lucky to have met such a loved and loving person.\n\n  I am incredibly proud of these three men, who gave themselves fully \nto their families and their commitment to protecting our country.\n  They loved being soldiers and made the ultimate sacrifice for our \nfreedom.\n  Dan, Brady and Mikey were men of strong character, full of \npersonality and sense of humor, and courage in the face of war.\n  I want to salute each of you. You are our heroes. You are all \nincredible men, patriots, fathers, husbands, sons, grandsons, uncles, \nand friends. You are what this country is all about, we will never \nforget you.\n  This country will never be able to adequately repay you, or your \nfamilies, for your service and the sacrifice you have made to this \nnation.\n  I am honored to pay tribute to you today and know that our thoughts \nand prayers are with you and your families.\n  And to the loved ones, it is my understanding that all three of these \nheroes knew Jesus and knew the Lord well. I would say to you this: this \nis a wink of time that we are here. This is not goodbye to Dan, Brady, \nMikey; it is: We will see you later.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about a very important \nissue, and that is gun rights, the second amendment gun rights for our \ncountry.\n  As we are dealing with the financial stabilization program which is \nbeing negotiated, the continuing resolution, which will come over from \nthe House shortly, we do have time to talk about some of the other \nissues that are so important for our country.\n  I think the second amendment rights of people who live in the \nDistrict of Columbia are very important. There was a Supreme Court \ncase, a landmark ruling, that was made by the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States a couple months ago that said: The District of Columbia \ngun ban was unconstitutional.\n  Many of us in Congress helped with an amicus brief, a brief to the \nCourt signed by a majority of the Members of the House and the Senate, \nthat asked that the Court overturn this DC gun ban because it was the \nmost restrictive outright gun ban in all of America, and it clearly \nviolated the rights of the people of the District of Columbia.\n  The Court agreed. Now many of us who were hoping to pursue this right \nfor the people of the District of Columbia, which is under the auspices \nof Congress, waited to see what the District City Council would do. We \nhoped they would do the right thing and adhere to the Supreme Court \nruling, which affirmed that their ban on the ownership of handguns was \nunconstitutional.\n  The District then came out with an almost incomprehensible ordinance \nthat does continue to make it very difficult for someone to exercise \ntheir constitutional right to own a gun.\n  The District allows registration of pistols for use in self-defense \nwithin the applicant's home. So it does not allow the ownership of a \nhandgun in a person's business, to have self-defense in their business, \nbut it does allow it in the home.\n  But then the ordinance goes on to say that it is a policy of the \nDistrict of Columbia that firearms should be stored unloaded and either \ndisassembled or locked, which is the complete opposite result of the \noriginal ruling.\n  I do not think anyone in America would consider an unlocked, unloaded \ngun to be potentially used for self-defense if someone is entering \ntheir home illegally.\n  The firearm registration requirements are onerous. As a condition for \nregistration, the District requires applicants to pay separate, \nunlimited fees for filing their registration, applicants have their \nmandatory fingerprints processed, and have their handguns run through a \nballistic imaging process.\n  What we are trying to do now is say you would have the ability to own \na handgun for your personal use in your home for self-defense for you \nand your family. We also want to authorize DC residents to buy handguns \nfrom licensed dealers in Maryland or Virginia because, of course, there \nis only one gun dealer in the District of Columbia because there has \nbeen such a shortage of guns that a gun owner would sell because you \ncould not have one.\n  Because there is a current Federal law against interstate handgun \nsales, only Congress can authorize this. So the only way a person will \nhave the ability to buy from a licensed dealer--and a licensed dealer \nmust pass a record check by the National Instant Criminal Background \nCheck System; all of that would be enforced, but we do need to have the \nability for someone to have a reasonable place to go if they are going \nto buy a gun to protect themselves and their family.\n  The bottom line is, as soon as we have representation on the floor by \nboth parties, I intend to ask unanimous consent that we proceed to \nconsideration of the bill. Now, the bill is H.R. 6842. It passed the \nHouse overwhelmingly last week. We want to take up that bill. In fact, \nI have a letter to Senator Reid signed by 47 Members of the Senate, and \nI am asking that be submitted for the Record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 19, 2008.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid: On June 26, 2008. the Supreme Court \n     issued a landmark ruling affirming the Second Amendment right \n     to bear arms as an individual and constitutionally protected \n     right. In District of Columbia v. Heller. the court affirmed \n     that the District of Columbia's ban on ownership of handguns \n     was an unconstitutional restriction on that right. The \n     majority held ``that the District's ban on handgun possession \n     in the home violates the Second Amendment, as does its \n     prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home \n     operable for the purpose of immediate self-defense.''\n       For more than thirty years. the District of Columbia has \n     subjected residents to the most prohibitive gun control laws \n     of any city in the nation, requiring rifles and shotguns to \n     he registered, stored unloaded, and either locked or \n     disassembled. Despite the Court's ruling in June, the \n     District of Columbia city council has continued to exact \n     onerous and unconstitutional firearm regulations on law-\n     abiding residents.\n       This week, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 6842, \n     the National Capital Security and Safety Act. This bipartisan \n     bill was overwhelmingly approved with a vote 266-152.

Terhune\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to one of our \nbravest warriors who gave his life to defend us. U.S. Marine Corps CPT \nEric D. Terhune of Lexington, KY, was conducting a security patrol in \nthe Farah Province of Afghanistan on June 19, 2008, when he was killed \nby enemy small-arms fire. He was 34 years old.\n  For his heroism in service, Captain Terhune received several awards, \nmedals and decorations, including the Strike/Flight Air Medal, the \nMarine Corps Good Conduct Medal, two National Defense Service Medals \nand the Armed Forces Service Medal.\n  Those who knew Captain Terhune would describe him as a man committed \nto serving his country and proud to wear the uniform. In fact, as his \nuncle, David Terhune, puts it, since Eric was born in a Naval hospital \nin Quantico, VA, where his father was on active duty, ``Eric was born a \nMarine.''\n  Eric was also committed to his faith. When family members expressed \nworry about his dangerous job, he told them, ``If I live, it's \nwonderful. But if I die, it's absent from the body and present with the \nLord.''\n  Eric was raised in Lexington, attended Tates Creek Presbyteria Church \nand studied at Wheaton Academy in Wheaton, IL. As a kid he was active \nin everything from Cub Scouting and Boy Scouting to soccer and Little \nLeague baseball.\n  Eric was also a competitive swimmer who loved to hunt and scuba dive. \nAs a marine, he would dive to collect shells and sharks' teeth in the \nmany places the Corps sent him.\n  Once on a sail boat trip with his family, when it was Eric's turn to \ndo the dishes after dinner, he came up with a creative cleaning \nmethod--he threw them in the ocean, put on his scuba gear, and \nretrieved the dishes from the water.\n  Upon high school graduation, Eric enlisted in the same branch his \nfather and grandfather had once served in, the Marine Corps. After 4 \nyears as a noncommissioned officer and a reconnaissance sharpshooter, \nEric dreamt of becoming a Naval aviator like his dad.\n  This required a college degree. So with some encouragement from his \ngrandparents, Daniel and Joy Terhune, he used his GI bill benefits to \nenroll at Morehead State University.\n  At Morehead, Eric made the honor roll and competed on the varsity \nrifle team. ``There [was] no doubt . . . when Eric turned in his \ntargets from a rifle match, who pulled the trigger,'' his uncle David \nsays. ``He was an expert sharpshooter.''\n  Upon graduation, Eric received his commission as a second lieutenant \nin the Marine Corps. He then spent a year at Naval Air Station \nPensacola and earned his coveted wings of gold.\n  Eric flew the CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopter during his first tour in \nIraq. His friends in the Corps nicknamed him ``D-Ring,'' after the D-\nring located overhead in the helicopters he flew to be pulled in case \nof emergency.\n  His fellow marines spoke highly of Eric. His commanding officer, LTC \nRichard D. Hall, says,\n\n       ``D-Ring,'' as we all affectionately called him, and [as] \n     was his aviator's call-sign, was a Marine that everyone \n     liked; and I mean everybody. He had a gracious and kind \n     personality that was truly infectious; so much so, that I too \n     became infected by his wonderful persona.\n\n  MAJ Darby Wiler was Eric's staff platoon commander at The Basic \nSchool, where newly commissioned marine officers are sent for weapons, \ntactical, and leadership training. Major Wiler says, ``Eric's work \nethic was unparalleled amongst his peers.\n  ``Even in the midst of the most unpleasant circumstances that The \nBasic School had to offer, he was always upbeat, motivated, and ready \nto go,'' the major adds.\n  Eric volunteered for a second tour of Iraq, which he completed last \nNovember. When his ship, the U.S.S. Denver, arrived in Pearl Harbor, he \nwas allowed to give one family member the honor of joining him and his \ncrew for the final leg of the voyage home to San Diego. Eric chose his \ngrandfather.\n  ``That trip halfway across the Pacific Ocean together, eating \ntogether in the ward room, watching ships operations from the bridge, \nshowing his grandfather how to shoot an M-16, how to shoot a .50 \nCaliber machine gun . . . this was the greatest of bonding experiences \nfor both of them,'' says Eric's uncle David.\n  ``Eric has told me many times what a blast it was to share those days \nwith Dad. For Dad, it was an indescribable joy to see his grandson \nperforming as a Marine and standing tall as a Christian officer.''\n  After his two tours in Iraq, Eric expected to return to training to \nrequalify as a helicopter pilot. But then he learned the Marine Corps \nwas short of forward air controllers--an important position, \nresponsible for directing other aircraft in close air support and \nrequiring substantial experience.\n  ``He had a lot of conversations with his dad--`What do you think \nabout this Afghanistan thing?' '' David recalls. ``His dad laid out the \npros and cons, and Eric said, `Look, if you're in the Marine Corps, you \ndon't duck the fight.'\n  Eric volunteered and was deployed to Afghanistan in April of this \nyear with the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, \nI Marine Expeditionary Force, based out of Twentynine Palms, CA.\n  ``We have heard numerous reports of him volunteering to take the \nplace of some of his friends who had a wife and children,'' David says.\n  Eric brought the same work ethic he carried with him throughout his \ncareer to Afghanistan. CPT Carlos R. Cuevas who served alongside Eric \nin Afghanistan, remembers when he first met Eric.\n  ``I believe the first thing he asked me was, `Hey, Captain Cuevas, \ncan you tell me where the armory is and who I need to talk to get my \nweapon?' '' the captain remembers. ``As a fellow captain and Marine . . \n. I can tell you his professionalism and enthusiasm for his job was \nreadily apparent,'' the captain says.\n  ``He loved being a pilot, a Marine, and most of all serving alongside \nhis fellow Marines.''\n  Eric couldn't write or call his family often from Afghanistan, but \nthey were always happy when he did. On June 16 he sent what would be \nhis final e-mail.\n  ``He wrote and addressed each of his cousins by name, encouraging \nthem, affirming them, giving advice to them,'' says David. ``And [he] \nexpressed his longing to join us at our next family gathering.''\n  Three days after that e-mail, Mr. President, Eric was killed. And \nalthough nothing we say here today can alleviate the pain of his \nfamily, I know my colleagues join me in expressing our deepest \nsympathies to them for their tragic loss.\n  We are thinking of Eric's father and stepmother Paul and Carleen \nTerhune; his grandparents Daniel and Joy Terhune; his uncle and aunt \nDavid and Dotti Terhune; many beloved family members, including Dr. and \nMrs. Oliver Jeromin, Dr. and Mrs. Richard Colquitt, David W. Terhune, \nJr., Rebecca Joy Terhune, Bea Hansgen, and many others.\n  I will leave the final words to Eric's uncle David, who describes his \nnephew this way. Eric ``was, in the best sense of the word, an officer \nand a gentleman and a patriot,'' David says. ``I always admired his \nstrength and his power, but he was also gentle at the same time.''\n  Mr. President, this U.S. Senate honors CPT Eric D. Terhune as an \nofficer, a gentleman, and a patriot. We are grateful for his years of \nservice to our Nation and his great sacrifice. And we send our profound \nthanks to the Terhune family for giving their country this heroic \nmarine. It is only by men such as he that every American can stand tall \nand free.\n\n\n                  STAFF SERGEANT CHRISTOPHER N. HAMLIN\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to also honor another fallen member of our \nArmed Forces. This Nation is honored to have the finest arsenal of \nfreedom in the\n\n[[Page S9443]]\n\nworld in our Armed Forces. Today I pay tribute to one of those brave \nwarriors, SSG Christopher N. Hamlin of London, KY.\n  On May 4, 2007, Staff Sergeant Hamlin was tragically killed after an \nimprovised explosive device detonated near his vehicle as he was \nconducting combat operations in Baghdad. A soldier since 2001, who had \ndeployed to Afghanistan, Kosovo, and on multiple tours to Iraq, he was \n24 years old.\n  For his heroism during service, Staff Sergeant Hamlin received \nseveral awards, medals, and decorations, including the National Defense \nService Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, \nthe Purple Heart, and the Bronze Star Medal.\n  Chris packed a lot of life into his too short 24 years. Friends and \nfamily members remember his dedication to the uniform, his love of \neating crab legs, and his enjoyment watching NASCAR. He was also a \nwriter and sometimes a poet, who would send his work to friends back \nhome from Iraq.\n  ``Make every day count!'' Chris once wrote. ``Appreciate every moment \nand take from it everything that you possibly can, for you may never be \nable to experience it again.''\n  Those words, and others, from Chris's pen were remembered at his \nfuneral service in London.\n  ``He never quit at anything,'' says his mother, Autumn Hamlin. ``He \nsaid that he wanted to travel the world and not watch it on television. \nHe wanted to be right there.''\n  Chris grew up in Laurel County, KY, and liked hunting and fishing. At \nNorth Laurel High School, he was on the basketball, cross country and \ntrack teams and active in Junior ROTC, and he showed his eagerness to \nhelp others at a young age.\n  ``He'd be hanging around, waiting for basketball practice to start \nand he'd help the janitor clean the school,'' says CDR Kenneth \nVanourney, his ROTC instructor.\n  ``In basic training, he did a lot to help the other soldiers complete \ntheir training,'' adds Chris's stepfather, Otis Johnson. ``He was \nalready physically fit and he would finish the course early and go back \nto encourage the others to complete [it].''\n  Chris graduated from high school in 2001 and enlisted in the Army \nsoon after, heading to Fort Benning, GA, for basic \ntraining. Eventually, Chris trained as a sniper and took first place in \nhis training class while earning a near-perfect shooting score.\n\n  When Chris's enlistment was up, he reenlisted. The excellence he \nbrought to his job was rewarded as he rapidly advanced in rank.\n  ``In my 30 years in the Army, there have only been a handful of \ninfantrymen reach noncommissioned officer in five years or less,'' says \nBG Joe Orr, who spoke at Chris's funeral service.\n  The Brigadier General adds:\n\n       I have met very few five-year soldiers who have been on as \n     many deployments as Chris. He believed in what he was doing. \n     Not only serving his Nation, but serving the people of \n     Afghanistan and Iraq. He will live on in our Army for years \n     and years.\n\n  Chris's Army experience will also live on in the house of his \ngrandmother, Zola Hamlin. Chris often sent her mementoes of his \nexperiences around the world, including currency from the Holy Land, a \ntiny model of the Eiffel Tower, and a plastic bottle of sand from \nNormandy Beach with a picture of Chris standing on the beach taped to \nthe front. ``We've always been real close,'' Zola said.\n  Chris's stepfather Otis said Chris talked to him about perhaps \nattending the University of Kentucky after returning home. He was \nconsidering a career in law enforcement or as a corrections officer.\n  In Iraq, Commander Vanourney said Chris's caring nature came through \nas he made an effort to learn the names of the children who gathered \naround the American troops. He told me: ``I think we're making a \ndifference,'' the commander recalls.\n  Our sympathies go out to the many loved ones that Chris leaves behind \ntoday as I share his story with my fellow Senators. We are thinking of \nhis mother, Autumn Eve Hamlin; his father, Ronnie Veach; his \nstepfather, Otis Johnson; his grandparents, Zola Lewis Hamlin and \nThurman Jerome Hamlin; his aunt, April Hamlin Young; his uncle, John \nHamlin; his five half sisters, and many other beloved friends and \nfamily members. Chris was predeceased by his aunt, Dovey Lewis Hollins.\n  In a letter that Chris sent home to his family from Iraq with advice \nfor the people he missed back home, Chris wrote:\n\n       Everyone dies . . . but not everyone lives. Life may not \n     always be the party we hoped for, but for the while we are \n     here, we should dance. Right now I'm in Baghdad patrolling \n     the streets day and night, and I'm proud of my job.\n\n  This Senate is also proud of the job SSG Christopher N. Hamlin did. \nWe honor his service and his great sacrifice, and we extend to the \nHamlin family the thanks of a grateful nation for lending their country \nthis fine patriot and soldier.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9443-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9443-S9446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 6842\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 6842, a bill to \nrestore second amendment rights in the District of Columbia. I ask \nunanimous consent that the bill be read a third time and passed, and a \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  This is the bill that was passed by the House last week by an \noverwhelming margin, and I move my unanimous consent request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is an attempt to write the DC gun \nlaws and to take away the authority of the elected government of the \nDistrict of Columbia to write its own laws relative to firearms \nconsistent with the new Supreme Court decision. If the Senator from \nTexas were making such a proposal for the city of Dallas or the city of \nHouston or the city of San Antonio, it would have some credibility \nbecause that is her State. But to make this request that we would \noverrule the power of the elected government of DC to implement the \nSupreme Court decision is inappropriate.\n  On behalf of Senators who have signed a public letter in opposition \nto the bill that passed the House, Senators Lautenberg, Feinstein, \nMenendez, Mikulski, Akaka, Jack Reed, Ted Kennedy, John Kerry, Chris \nDodd, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Ben Cardin, and myself, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, let me just respond by saying that it \nis the prerogative of Congress to make laws that are directly \nappropriate for the District of Columbia. I have been on the DC \nAppropriations Subcommittee; I actually was chairman when Senator \nDurbin was ranking member, so he knows well that we pass laws for the \nDistrict of Columbia because it is the District of Columbia, and we all \nappropriate money for the city to function. We have introduced this \nbill because the District of Columbia failed to protect the second \namendment rights of the citizens of the city over which Congress has \nthe ultimate responsibility.\n  It is entirely within the role of Congress to address an issue where \na city is not protecting the constitutional rights of its constituents, \nover which the Congress has the authority. It would not be the same in \nthe city of Chicago or the city of Dallas or other cities in our \ncountry. The District of Columbia is a unique city in that it is \noverseen by Congress. Congress has acted in the past over many issues \nwhere the District has fallen short, and I would say Senator Durbin and \nI have done quite a bit to strengthen the government of the District of \nColumbia and make it more financially responsible.\n  So I am disappointed that the Senator has objected. I have submitted \nfor the Record a letter to Senator Reid from 47 of our Members who \nasked Senator Reid to let this bill come forward because, in fact, the \nDistrict of Columbia acted--and I waited. I did not pursue this until \nthe District of Columbia City Council acted because I hoped\n\n[[Page S9444]]\n\nthey would do the right thing. Unfortunately, they put up so many \nbarriers to a person's right to self-defense in their home by requiring \nthat a handgun be locked and unloaded, and that is not protection--not \nin Chicago, not in Dallas, not in Houston, and not in the District of \nColumbia--nor can we overcome the Federal law that does not allow \ninterstate sales of guns across State borders because in the District \nof Columbia, one should be able to go to Maryland or Virginia and buy \nfrom a licensed gun dealer to be able to pursue their right to protect \ntheir home and their family in the District of Columbia.\n  So the bill is necessary for the rights of the people of the District \nof Columbia over which Congress does have ultimate responsibility, and \nit is my hope that we will do what the House did overwhelmingly and \npass this bill and send it to the President. I will continue to pursue \nopportunities to make that happen. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I first came to this city over 40 years \nago as a student. It was a time before the District of Columbia had \nhome rule. There was a certain paternalism felt by Congress toward the \ncity of Washington, DC. Of course, the city of Washington, DC, does not \nhave a voting representative in the Senate, and the delegate, Eleanor \nHolmes Norton, who serves in the House, has limited authority to vote \nin committee but not on the floor. So DC does not have a voice in the \nHouse or Senate Chambers, despite the fact that some 600,000 taxpaying \nAmericans live in our Capital City. I think that is wrong. I have \nconsistently supported giving DC representation in Congress because I \nbelieve these Americans living in this city deserve the same rights to \nhave a vote and be heard as those who live in Chicago or Dallas or \nHouston. But that has been the course of history.\n  Many people who come to Congress, always longing to be a mayor, get a \nchance to be a mayor over the District of Columbia. So this poor \nCapital City has 535 would-be mayors in the House and Senate who want \nto write ordinances for the city of Washington, DC, some of whom have \nbeen mayors at home, some of whom have lost in elections for mayor, but \nthey are going to come here and be the mayor of Washington, DC, in \naddition to being a Member of the House and Senate.\n  There was another event that occurred shortly after I arrived in \nWashington--in fact, within a few weeks after I arrived--and that event \noccurred on November 22, 1963, in the city of Dallas, TX, when a great \nman and wonderful President, John Kennedy, was assassinated because \nanother man took a long-range rifle and shot at his motorcade as he \npassed through that city, mortally wounding the President of the United \nStates and claiming his life. It was a tragedy which those of us who \nlived through will never forget as long as we live, and it is a \nreminder that even if you recognize and respect rights under the second \namendment--and I do--there have to be reasonable limits in terms of \nfirearms and weapons. Otherwise, the Lee Harvey Oswalds of tomorrow can \nliterally menace those who visit this city.\n\n  I just left a meeting with the President of Afghanistan, a wonderful \nman who risks his life in Kabul every day to give his people in \nAfghanistan a chance for freedom. He is under heavy security and guard \nnot only in Afghanistan but in the United States. Are we going to put \nourselves in a position to say--as the bill that the Senator from Texas \nwanted to bring to the floor says--that we are going to repeal the \nDistrict of Columbia's laws on semiautomatic and assault weapons?\n  Are we going to now say that Congress will mandate that weapons which \ncould be dangerous for those who live here and those who visit here in \nthis Capital City, that we will decide in Congress which weapons will \nbe allowed and which will not be allowed? That is what this bill does. \nThat is exactly what it does. It goes much further than the Supreme \nCourt decision in DC v. Heller reached just a few weeks ago.\n  Let me be specific. The bill would severely undermine DC gun laws far \nbeyond the scope of that Supreme Court decision. That decision \ninvalidated the District of Columbia's handgun ban and found that the \nsecond amendment confers an individual right. I don't quarrel with \nthat, but it did not require the invalidation of all other types of \nlaws, as this bill does. In fact, Justice Scalia--no liberal--Justice \nAntonin Scalia, in the majority opinion in Heller, specifically noted \nthat a wide range of gun laws are ``presumptively lawful.'' Everything \nfrom laws ``forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places'' \nto ``conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.''\n  Justice Scalia, in acknowledging that the second amendment creates an \nindividual right to firearms, still made it clear that individual \njurisdictions--States, local units of government--would still have the \nauthority to forbid the carrying of firearms in sensitive places and to \nimpose conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\n  The bill that Senator Hutchison wants us to impose on the District of \nColumbia, however, repeals the prohibition of the District of Columbia \nof carrying guns in public, directly counter to the language of Justice \nScalia; repeals DC's gun registration requirements, though it is clear \nin the language of the Supreme Court decision that jurisdictions such \nas Washington have the right to impose conditions and qualifications on \nthe commercial sale of arms; repeals the requirement of the District of \nColumbia that guns are not sold to those who abuse them in crimes or \nthose who are mentally unstable. The provisions of the bill which \nSenator Hutchison would impose on the District of Columbia repeals \ntheir right to stop people with mental illness from buying firearms or \nthose with a history of commission of felonies. Does that make sense? \nDoes it make sense in Washington? Does it make sense in Chicago? Does \nit make sense in Dallas or Houston? It does not make sense.\n  To come here and say that we are going to write the DC gun law, we \nare going to decide the safety of 600,000 people and every visitor to \nthis city, is plain wrong. Give the city of Washington the same \nopportunity that the city of Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Chicago \nasks: to write laws consistent with this Supreme Court decision. They \nhave to. Ultimately, any effort to do otherwise is going to be \noverturned by that Court. But to impose, as the Childers bill would--\nRepresentative Childers of Mississippi introduced this bill--as this \nbill would, is to go too far.\n  I will object to this because I think this city of Washington, as \nwell as the cities of Chicago and Springfield, IL, which I represent, \nand the cities of Texas have the right to write their laws to protect \ntheir citizens. When we come here and impose on them requirements and \nrestrictions that are not being imposed on cities in our own State, it \ngoes too far.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think it was not quite accurate to \nsuggest that repealing the DC's gun ban and all of the onerous \nrestrictions put on it weren't replaced in the law to require that \nthere be licensed gun dealers from which you could purchase a gun.\n  Of course, they would be licensed with all the Federal requirements, \nall the State requirements in Maryland and the State of Virginia. Of \ncourse, that would be a part of this law.\n  I have to say, I am not understanding why the distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois continues to say the Congress does not have a right to \nimpose our will on the District of Columbia. I have the Constitution of \nthe United States. Article I gives the exclusive jurisdiction over the \nDistrict of Columbia to the Congress ``To exercise exclusive \nLegislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District. . . .''\n  The District of Columbia was created to be the seat of government \nover which Congress would have exclusive jurisdiction. It would not \napply to any other State where the Constitution says the States rights \nprevail. But the District of Columbia is a special city, which I know \nthe Senator from Illinois knows. It is not 535 people trying to usurp \nthe rights of the mayor. It is 535 people who are trying to exercise \nour responsibility to have laws in the District of Columbia that would \nadhere to\n\n[[Page S9445]]\n\nthe constitutional rights of the citizens here. It is our \nresponsibility, and that is what we are trying to do.\n  Of course, I know the Senator from Illinois knows it has been clearly \nupheld that preventing certain areas for the carriage of guns, \nqualifications on sales, bans on automatics have been declared \nreasonable. I know the Senator from Illinois knows that. Those would be \nprovided for, of course, because it is Federal law.\n  What we are trying to do is give the basic rights, which is our \nresponsibility as Congress, to the citizens of this District to keep \nand bear arms, to have the individual right to have a handgun in their \nhome to protect their families, not a handgun that is locked and \nunloaded, which is what the District of Columbia Council has put out as \nits response to the Supreme Court case that declared their ban \nunconstitutional; not to provide so many restrictions and costs on \nregistering a gun that it becomes very difficult and creates a \nrestriction on those second amendment rights; and last but not least, \ngiving them the right in this one instance to buy a gun across State \nlines because this District is bordered by Virginia and Maryland, where \nthere are gun dealers who are licensed, who do have the correct \nrestrictions and background checks in place to be able to do that \nbecause there are not gun dealers in the District of Columbia who would \ngive the proper access to people who would want to protect themselves \nand their homes.\n  When I look at the statistics in the District of Columbia, I look at \nthe person who is robbed and murdered in their home. I look at the \npoliceman who is shot in the face doing his duty in this District. I \nthink people should have the right in this District to protect their \nbusinesses with a handgun, which is barred by the District of Columbia, \nand to have a firearm in their homes unlocked and able to protect their \nfamilies from an intruder.\n  We did not get to bring up this legislation today. When the House of \nRepresentatives passes something 266 to 152, that makes a clear \nstatement that this Congress is trying to do the right thing to help \nthe District of Columbia residents have their second amendment rights.\n  I hope at some point the Senate will take up this bill that has been \npassed by the House overwhelmingly and send it to the President, who I \nknow will sign it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The assistant majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the police chief of the District of \nColumbia, Cathy Lanier, testified before the House of Representatives \nand said this bill, which Senator Hutchison is trying to impose on the \nDistrict of Columbia, would make it far more difficult for the \npolicemen in the District of Columbia and Federal agencies ``to ensure \nsafety and security in the Nation's capital,'' and she cited particular \nconcerns about providing security for the thousands of dignitaries, \nmotorcades, and special events that occur in our Nation's capital.\n  I wish to listen to those who are in uniform risking their lives in \nWashington, DC, to keep it safe for the people who live and visit here. \nThey should be given the opportunity to make sure the laws that are \nwritten are written in a way to be consistent with the Supreme Court \ndecision, consistent with the individual right to bear arms but also \nconsistent with the standards that Justice Scalia mentioned.\n  The Childers bill that Senator Hutchison would say must be the law of \nthe District of Columbia would repeal the District of Columbia's \nprohibition of carrying guns in public. That runs directly counter to \nthe language of Justice Scalia, who said that States and cities could \nimpose laws ``forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive \nplaces.'' Does that mean we would be prohibited from searching people \ncoming into the Capitol complex and taking their guns away under the \nHutchison provision? I am not sure I know the answer to that question, \nbut I think it is worth thinking about carefully before we consider \nimposing this gun ordinance from the House.\n  I am also concerned about the fact that this bill would repeal the \nright of Washington, DC, to regulate gun sales. I don't want guns to \nend up in the hands of the mentally ill and those with a history of \nfelonies, violent felonies. Does that make you feel safer?\n  My State of Illinois, similar to the State of Virginia, recently went \nthrough this tragic episode, where someone brought a gun into college \nlast year at Northern Illinois University, killing innocent people. It \nalso happened across the river at Virginia Tech.\n  Do I think in Illinois and in Virginia we want to make sure on \ncollege campuses and other sensitive places that people do not carry \nfirearms? Of course, I do. If I am going to send a child of mine or \ngrandchild to a university, the first thing I want is for them to come \nhome alive. If it means putting reasonable standards so people cannot \ncarry guns into those surroundings, we should do it. Why would we \ncreate a different circumstance for the District of Columbia? I went to \nschool at Georgetown University. If Georgetown wants to make certain \nthat students do not carry guns on to certain elements of the campus, I \nstand behind them and I will fight for them. It is consistent with the \nSupreme Court decision.\n  I wish to tell you something, the Childers bill that Senator \nHutchison would impose on Washington repeals Washington's right to \nprohibit the carrying of guns in public. That goes too far. To take \nthis provision that has been written by the gun lobby and impose it on \nthe District of Columbia and on all the people who live here is wrong.\n  The Senator is right; in the past, Congress has done just about \nanything you can think imaginable when it comes to imposing laws on the \nDistrict of Columbia. Many Members of Congress who never served as \nmayors get their chance to pick on this city right here, to write \nFederal legislation that they would never think of introducing back \nhome for their own hometowns. Let's do it for Washington; let's go \nahead and try a little experiment. That is not fair, it is not just, \nand it is not American.\n  These people in this town deserve a voice in their own future, to \nelect people who speak for them and represent them, as we do all across \nAmerica, to have a chance, as Delegate Norton has asked for, only 6 \nmonths to implement this new Supreme Court decision is not \nunreasonable. I know there are those who want it done today, and I am \nanxious to see it done, too, but I am not going to try to impose a law \non the District of Columbia that is unfair, that creates insecurity \nwhere we have been warned by the police chief that it makes it less \nsafe for visitors to the Nation's capital. That is irresponsible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter, dated September 22, 2008, to our majority leader from some of \nmy colleagues expressing concern about this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 22, 2008.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate.\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid: We are writing to express our concern \n     about H.R. 6842, the ``National Capital Security and Safety \n     Act,'' which would override the laws of the District of \n     Columbia on the ownership of firearms in the District. The \n     bill passed the House of Representatives on Wednesday, \n     September 17, and we understand it will be placed on the \n     Senate calendar without being referred to the Homeland \n     Security and Governmental Affairs Committee or the Judiciary \n     Committee.\n       This legislation would have a considerable impact on safety \n     and security in the nation's capital. In addition, we \n     understand that it makes at least one significant change to \n     federal criminal law. As a result, we are concerned about \n     proceeding to this bill without hearing from local and \n     federal law enforcement officials and other interested \n     parties. We also believe there should be an opportunity to \n     offer and debate amendments to this bill.\n       In short, this legislation is too important to consider \n     according to a truncated process. Thank you for your \n     attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n         Frank R. Lautenberg, Dianne Feinstein, Robert Menendez, \n           Barbara A. Mikulski, Daniel K. Akaka, Jack Reed, Ted \n           Kennedy, John F. Kerry, Chris Dodd, Hillary Rodham \n           Clinton, Ben Cardin.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to make sure the record shows \nthat, No. 1, it is the constitutional responsibility of Congress to \nassure that\n\n[[Page S9446]]\n\nthe District of Columbia residents have their second amendment rights. \nThat is our highest calling. It is our highest responsibility. It is \nnot usurping anyone's right in the District of Columbia City Council. \nIt is standing for the rights of the people of the District of \nColumbia, which is our responsibility to do.\n  Secondly, I want the record to be very clear that every gun dealer in \nthe District of Columbia--there is one--in the State of Virginia, and \nin the State of Maryland all have the same requirements that are \nFederal law that would have to be adhered to that would require a \nrecord check by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. \nThere would be no exceptions to that. Having the background check would \nbe essential for anyone to purchase a gun under our law or any law of \nthe United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9446-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9446-S9447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FINANCIAL CRISIS\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, in the next 48 to 96 hours, Members of \nthis Senate and Members of the House of Representatives will be called \nupon to make what may very well be the most important decision any of \nus have been asked to make, certainly domestically.\n  There have been a lot of reckless comments, a lot of sobering \ncomments, a lot of speeches made on this floor, a lot of accusations \nmade regarding the recovery or rescue supposedly by Secretary Paulson. \nBut it is very important for Members of this body to, first of all, \nmake sure that facts are reported accurately and, second of all, that \nwe give ourselves a chance to get this action right because there will \nbe no second chance.\n  Yesterday, two Senators--Senator Coburn from Oklahoma and Senator \nGregg from New Hampshire--made very eloquent, accurate, and sobering \nspeeches about the gravity of the economic situation we face but also \ncorrecting some of the accusations that have been made by some about \nthe recovery that has been proposed.\n  This morning, I was heartened to see two people in the media make \ncomments early on the morning news, which gave me hope that we are \nfinally coming to a point where people are going to report facts rather \nthan fantasy.\n  Ali Velshi, who is the economic reporter on CNN, in fielding a \nquestion from a listener who blamed the rescue we are talking about to \nbe a rescue of Wall Street, pointed out to that person that this is not \na rescue of Wall Street. We are giving a chance to provide liquidity to \nbanks, savings and loans, credit unions, and financial institutions of \nthe United States of America, not Wall Street.\n  And Boone Pickens, who was interviewed because ostensibly he has lost \nmillions of dollars of his multibillion assets in recent days, when \nasked about the consequences of us doing nothing, said very simply: \n``You must trust Mr. Paulson.''\n  I trust him. We must do what is right. Those are sobering comments. I \nthought what I would do for a little bit is set the record straight, or \nat least accurately, of some of the things that have gone on, some of \nthe things that are going on, and what the Paulson proposal can do when \nit is perfected to help us in a very difficult period of time.\n  As I said on the floor of this Senate on many occasions, the villain \nin this situation is very essentially Wall Street's investment banking \ncommunity and Moody's and Standard & Poor's, the rating agencies. They \ncreated subprime securities. Moody's and Standard & Poor's wrote them \nas investment grade. They sold them around the world. When those high-\nrisk, poorly qualified, high-yielding loans were made and began to be \ndefaulted on, the securities started losing their value, and they lost \nthem at a rapid rate. They became known as subprime securities or, as \nsome have called them, toxic assets.\n  The problem that faces the country today is the uncertainty of the \nvalue of those assets has plummeted their value to virtually zero. \nThere is no market. The American people yesterday, in looking for a \nplace to invest their money, were willing to take zero interest to buy \nTreasury bills, meaning they were looking for a place to park their \nmoney.\n  We are not in a time where there is any confidence in the investment \ncommunity and everybody is worried and concerned. Secretary Paulson's \nproposal is to spend up to--and I would use the word ``invest'' up to \nrather than ``spend''--$700 billion to purchase from financial \ninstitutions these mortgage-backed securities at a discounted price \nestablished by the Secretary. Assuming for a second the discounted \nprice is 50 percent, that $700 billion would actually take off the \nshelves $1.4 trillion in mortgage-backed security assets held currently \nby financial institutions--a significant amount of money. The minute \nthe Treasury begins to buy these entities and these securities, there \nare going to be people coming back to the market to buy them as well.\n\n  Think about this, Mr. President: If you buy a security at 50 cents on \nthe dollar, then you are reducing what the company paid for it--their \ninvestment--by 50 percent. If the default rate on mortgages--on \nsubprime loans--in the country is 12 or 15 percent, which in some cases \nit is, that is only 85 percent of 100, which means there is a 35-\npercent spread on those mortgages that are paid to maturity.\n  So with the strength of the country being able to buy those \nsecurities, hold those securities to maturity, there very possibly is a \nsignificant margin for the Treasury of the United States. The amount of \nthe investment made by this country will never be $700 billion. It will \nbe somewhere between $700 billion and whatever we recover from those \nsecurities upon their maturity, which could well be $500 billion, $600 \nbillion, $700 billion, even maybe possibly a margin above that.\n  So this is not an investment to save Wall Street. This is an \ninvestment to provide liquidity to the lending institutions that \nservice my citizens in Georgia and yours in Ohio and my colleague's in \nOklahoma, the people who now are struggling to be able to get credit \nfor their small business or for their car loan or for a mortgage.\n  I think it is also important to recognize that some of the actions \ntaken by the Fed and the Treasury in the weeks leading up to this \ndecision, which have been referred to also as Wall Street bailouts, \nhave been, in some cases, misreported. The Bear Stearns investment of \n$29 billion helped a transaction to be made that caused Bear Stearns to \nlose 90 percent of its value. That is not a bailout. AIG is paying the \ntaxpayers of the United States 8\\1/2\\ percent on a loan we made to AIG \nto allow it to liquidate itself--a loan, by the way, that the U.S. \nTreasury will make money on.\n  The proposal being made on those two is off the balance sheet for the \nUnited States. The $700 billion proposal is on the balance sheet, and \nit will create a liability, and during its maximum time it will raise \nthe debt. But as the securities are held to maturity, as they are sold \nat a price between the discount they are purchased for and the value \nthey ultimately are redeemed for, the Treasury will have a reduced and \ndiminished liability.\n  I am not here to sell the Secretary's proposal, and I am anxious to \nwait for the meeting this afternoon to see the final details, but I am \nsaying that words are important and loose lips at a time such as this \nin our country are very dangerous. For us to castigate a recommendation \nto save our economy--which, in fact, is a rescue and not a bailout--is \nwrong, and it is wrong for elected officials, such as myself or anyone \nelse, to take fast-and-loose facts and apply them to a situation that \nis the gravest we have faced in this country in a long time.\n  So I take the word of Boone Pickens to place confidence in those we \nhave entrusted to represent us--in this case, Secretary Paulson. I take \nsolace in the words of the President last night and the sobering \ncomments of Senator Judd Gregg on the floor of this Senate when he \nexplained accurately and correctly the financial effects of doing \nnothing in this situation.\n  Mr. President, we have 48 to 96 hours to make a decision. Let's make \nit on the facts. Let's make it in the best interests of the American \npeople. Let's\n\n[[Page S9447]]\n\nmake it in the best interests of Main Street because, after all, those \nare the people we serve--the ones who go to our banks, our savings and \nloans, who run our small businesses, and who are our next-door \nneighbors. They are the Americans we represent. They are the Georgians \nI represent. When I make a decision this weekend, it will be in their \nbest interest, their children's, and their lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9447-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9447-S9453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me first say that this has been a very \ndifficult subject, and I have the utmost respect for the Senator from \nGeorgia. As he said, I am looking forward to waiting and seeing a final \nproduct. I look at what is there right now, and I do have concerns. I \nhave concerns as to who the asset managers will be, what institutions \nwill be involved, and what types of assets. It would seem to me, as I \nread it, that as the $700 billion is paid down, other assets could be \npurchased, and I just wonder where it would end. I believe some new \nheads will come in and kind of look at these proposals and perhaps come \nup with something that will resolve a looming problem we all are \nconcerned about.\n  Today, my concern is on a different subject and one that is very \nimportant to me as an American citizen and as the ranking member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. The situation I am about to \ndiscuss reminds me of an old saying: Beware of wolves dressed in \nsheep's clothing. Today's so-called environmental movement can be \ndescribed in much the same way.\n  Campaigns to ``save a cuddly animal'' or ``protect the ancient \nforests'' are really disguised efforts to raise money for Democratic \npolitical campaigns. Take this ad, for example, displayed on the League \nof Conservation Voters'--or the LCV's--Web site. This is LCV's standard \ntext used to raise money for a nonprofit organization. In turn, the LCV \ntakes these donations, given to ``save the environment,'' and then uses \nthem to fund ads for Democratic candidates, such as Ben Lujan from New \nMexico. LCV, similar to other groups I will highlight later, disguises \nitself as an environmental group dedicated to saving the environment. \nYet, as shown by this political ad, it is simply an extension of the \nDemocratic political party.\n  In the fall of 2004, I came to the Senate floor to discuss this very \ntopic. This report and my remarks today are an update of the 2004 \nreport. Over the last several months, my staff has put considerable \ntime and effort into examining this deception. This examination has \nuncovered the tangled web of charitable and environmental \norganizations, political campaigns, and large foundations. \nEnvironmental groups are tax-exempt, IRS-registered, 501(c)(3) \ncharitable organizations, meaning that contributions to these groups \nare tax deductible. I think it is very important that people \nunderstand, because there is always confusion here, that a 501(c)(3) is \nnot supposed to be a political organization. It is a charitable \norganization. And there are many legitimate ones out there that deserve \nthe tax-exempt status they have.\n  These groups profess to be stewards of the environment and solicit \ncontributions from a variety of sources using these claims, but they \ndemonstrate more interest in hyping the extreme environmental scenarios \nto raise money for raw political purposes than working toward actual \nreal-world environmental change for the benefit of all Americans. Not \nsurprisingly, given these deceptions, these nonprofit groups are \ntightly affiliated with and fund the 501(c)(4) lobbying organizations \nand 527 organizations. And we all know that 501(c)(4) organizations and \n527 organizations are lobbying organizations that get involved in \npolitical campaigns.\n  With these intertwined organizations, it is extremely difficult to \ndifferentiate the source of funds and track their use. This problem is \nhighlighted in a report prepared by my staff which provides preliminary \nexamples based on the five most politically active environmental \ngroups. The report describes their activities, the foundations that \nprovide their financial support, and the interconnected web among these \norganizations.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks the staff report to which I just \nreferred.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, my staff is not the first to uncover this \nsham. A December 19, 2007, article in the Wall Street Journal \nhighlighted the very same problem, stating:\n\n       Because the IRS doesn't require 501(c) organizations to \n     detail election spending or to list contributors, it is \n     difficult to track their political activity.\n\n  The Journal analyzed data on 30 separate 501(c) groups active in \nelections from 2000 to 2006, culled from a variety of sources. The \ndata--this again is from the Wall Street Journal--showed that the 30 \norganizations spent at least $155 million on the 2006 elections, nearly \ntwice what they spent in 2000.\n  Environmental groups have become experts at duplicitous activity, \nskirting laws up to the edge of illegality and burying their political \nactivities under the guise of nonprofit environmental improvement. This \nchart demonstrates this interconnected ``enviro-family affair'' of \nnonprofits and their benefactors. As you can see, the six organizations \nat the bottom of this chart are all either 527 groups or political \n501(c)(4)s.\n  Let's take a look at the League of Conservation Voters, which is a \nposter child for this deceit. The LCV is an IRS-registered 501(c)3. \nContributions to the organization are tax deductible. However, \ncontributors should understand that LCV is a political organization \naffiliated with a 501(c)(4) organization, a political action committee, \nand a 527 organization. All three of these are political.\n  LCV represents itself as ``turning environmental values into national \npriorities,'' and much of its funds, even from its 501(c)(3) \norganization, goes to fund voter mobilization and education drives.\n  In each election cycle, LCV endorses political candidates. Since \n1996, LCV has published a ``Dirty Dozen'' list and bragged about its \neffectiveness in ousting candidates on the list. Not surprisingly, the \nlist singles out all Republican candidates, but they almost always \nthrow in one Democratic candidate--just one--to make it appear as if it \nis technically bipartisan. To date, 83 names have been placed on the \nLCV's ``Dirty Dozen,'' 74 of which are Republicans. By their bipartisan \nclaims, it would be expected that the LCV's support would be split \nevenly. The publishers of the ``Dirty Dozen'' list have yet to name \neven a dozen Democrats to their list in the last 12 years.\n  In 2006, LCV had two 527 groups, the League of Conservation Voters \nSSF and the League of Conservation Voters, Inc., SSF-527 II. These 527 \ngroups were fined by the Federal Election Commission for three \nviolations of Federal election law. One of the violations was that LCV \nknowingly accepted individual donations in excess of $5,000. LCV \ncollected over $6 million in donations during 2004 that violated the \n$5,000 individual maximum amount restriction, and the ultimate fine was \na total of $180,000 by the FEC.\n  According to an FEC press release, LCV received this fine for acting \nas a clear political committee and violating Federal election law. The \nWall Street Journal highlighted these violations in an article \npublished in December 2007. Following this incident, the LCV \nrestructured its organization into a 501(c)(4), which allows the \norganization to run with fewer disclosure restrictions.\n  LCV has a long history of direct involvement in political campaigns. \nIn 1996, LCV spent nearly $1.5 million in ads focused on defeating its \n``Dirty Dozen'' list targets of 11 Republicans and, oh yes, 1 Democrat. \nIn 1988, the LCV spent $2.3 million targeting its ``Dirty Dozen'' list \nof 12 Republicans and, oh yes, 1 Democratic candidate. In 2000, the LCV \nspent nearly $4 million, again targeting 11 Republicans and 1 Democrat \non its ``Dirty Dozen'' list. And I can't forget that in 2000, the LCV \nalso endorsed Al Gore for President--clearly a political endorsement. \nIn 2002, LCV once again targeted 11 Republican\n\n[[Page S9448]]\n\ncongressional candidates and 1 Democrat. Clearly there is a partisan \npattern here. LCV spends hundreds of thousands of dollars in \ncongressional contests against Republican candidates.\n  That same year, the group undertook its strongest single effort to \ndate, focused on my friend, Senator Allard, who will be speaking right \nafter me. The LCV claims to have budgeted $700,000 for that race--I am \ntalking about incumbent Senator Allard from Colorado--and hired a \ncampaign staff of 12 to coordinate phone banks and precinct walks. In \naddition, LCV ran television and radio advertisements against Senator \nAllard. Of course, as we all know, Senator Allard won in spite of that.\n  Altogether, the LCV reportedly spent $1.4 million in independent \nexpenditures during the 2002 election cycle. Of that total amount, LCV \nspent $1.3 million benefitting Democratic candidates while only \nspending $136,000 for Republican candidates. That again is the ratio we \nsee consistently, 10 to 1, to make it look as though it is not an arm \nof the Democratic Party. Two years later, in 2004, the ``Dirty Dozen'' \nlist contained twelve Republicans and one Democrat. LCV and its \naffiliates spent a new record total of $16 million during that year's \nelections targeting the 13 candidates. As in previous years, the 1 \nDemocrat on the list retained his seat while 4 of the 12 Republicans \nwere defeated. For the first time, in 2004, the LCV included a \nPresidential candidate on their list. The LCV endorsed Senator John \nKerry for President--again all political.\n  In 2006, the LCV chose 15 candidates for their ``Dirty Dozen'' list. \nThe list was comprised of 13 Republicans and 2 Democrats. While the two \nDemocrats on the ``Dirty Dozen'' list retained their seats, nine \nRepublicans lost their seats. The LCV and its affiliates used its \nextensive budget of $27 million on campaign activities.\n  The 2006 elections also highlighted the intertwined political \nactivities of LCV and other groups. A coalition of environmental \norganizations, that included LCV and the Sierra Club, worked together \nin 2006 to defeat their top target Richard Pombo, then chairman of the \nHouse Resources Committee. This coalition invested more than $1.7 \nmillion in the race to defeat him. If that figure alone is not \nstartling enough, then look at this chart that shows part of a Sierra \nClub press release that gloats about their activity in this House race. \nWe see that the Sierra Club invested $545,000 in this race and had \n643,000 contacts with voters, and sent 397,000 pieces of mail in this \nrace alone--Richard Pombo, in California.\n  At the time of this report, the LCV had yet to release a completed \nversion of the 2008 ``Dirty Dozen'' list. However, it has released the \nnames of nine individuals who will fill up the ranks of the completed \nlist. Of those nine, there is one Democrat joining the ``Dirty Dozen.'' \nI would be remiss not to mention that it looks like I will be on their \nlist this year. It should come as no surprise that for the 2008 \nPresidential election, the LCV has endorsed Senator Barack Obama for \nPresident.\n  As one individual who will be running, I am sure there will be a lot \nof money that will be in my race. I think it is kind of interesting \nthat in this day, when we are all concerned with what might be \nhappening on Wall Street and some of the people who have made huge \nsalaries and then turn around and have a defunct company, we see the \nEnvironmental Defense Fund's Fred Krupp receiving a salary of $357,000; \nSierra Club, Carl Pope, $207,000. I am hoping these contributors know \nthat not only are their contributions going to organizations that are \nnot doing anything about the environment, but they are paying very \nlarge salaries to large staffs.\n  While there is no means of calculating or anticipating what LCV will \nspend this year, as their budget has grown every election cycle, they \nwill most likely have at least the $27 million that they did in 2006.\n  LCV is certainly not the only organization doing this. The Sierra \nClub, which describes itself as ``America's oldest, largest, and most \ninfluential grassroots environmental organization,'' has a similar \nrecord of trickery. The Sierra Club Foundation is a 501(c)(3) tax-\nexempt organization with an affiliated 501(c)(4) group, Sierra Club. \nThere is also a 527 organization called the Sierra Club Voter Education \nFund, which claims to be a ``separate segregated fund of the Sierra \nClub.'' The Sierra Club Foundation does not claim affiliation with this \n527 organization, however the Sierra Club Voters Education Fund does \nnot have its own board of directors, officers or trustees.\n  In 2006, the Sierra Club 501(c) organizations brought in more than \n$110 million and spent nearly $104 million; the Sierra Club 527, the \nSierra Club Voter Education Fund, only brought in $60,000, but managed \nto spend nearly $1 million. That is pretty tricky.\n  Similar to LCV, the Sierra Club has a history of endorsing candidates \nfor political office. Most recently, the Sierra Club announced its \nsupport of Senator Obama's Presidential bid. While there is no reported \nactivity yet from the organization, the Sierra Club has been known to \nrun television and radio advertisements both supporting their candidate \nand criticizing the opposition. At the time of this report, Sierra Club \nhad announced its support of 13 candidates for seats in the United \nStates Senate. Of those 13 candidates, none are Republicans. The \norganization has also announced its endorsement of 156 candidates for \nthe U.S. House of Representatives. Of the candidates, four are \nRepublicans. Essentially, 98 percent of Sierra Club's endorsements \nfavor Democrat candidates.\n  Another example is the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n  The Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. is registered as a \n501(c)(3) organization. It is also affiliated with a 501(c)(4) \norganization, the NRDC Action Fund, and a 527 organization, the \nEnvironmental Accountability Fund. By having at least one of each \ncategory of tax-exempt organizations, these groups can transfer wealth \nthroughout their family of organizations and remain virtually \nundetected. In its 2006 tax filing, Natural Resources Defense Council, \nInc. transferred $98,801 to NRDC Action Fund, and NRDC Action Fund \ntransferred $124,500 to undisclosed ``other organizations'' that same \nyear.\n  Founded in 1970, NRDC purports to be the ``nation's most effective \nenvironmental action group'' whose mission is to ``[t]o safeguard the \nEarth: its people, its plants and animals and the natural systems on \nwhich all life depends.'' The NRDC claims to use grassroots efforts and \nthe power of legal and scientific expertise to achieve its goals, which \nthey describe frequently as ``independent.''\n  From 2001 through 2005, the NRDC reported on the Bush administration \nby creating the Bush Record. The Record categorized President Bush's \ntime in office as an administration that ``will cater to industries \nthat put America's health and natural heritage at risk.'' The NRDC \npredicted that Bush would continue ``to undermine environmental \nenforcement and weaken key programs.'' The organization gave up the \neffort and stopped tracking the administration's moves after President \nBush defeated Senator Kerry in the 2004 election. It is interesting, I \nremember the ``Clear Skies'' legislation that was the largest reduction \nof pollutants of any President in the history of America and it was \ndefeated by the Democrats in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee.\n  My staff examined two other organizations, Greenpeace and \nEnvironmental Defense Fund, and found similar patterns of partisan \nfund-raising and spending.\n  Greenpeace, like other environmental activist organizations, has \nstrong ties to other politically oriented groups. The chairman of the \nboard of directors, Donald Ross, is involved in multiple organizations, \nincluding the LCV, where he is a board member. Ross is also the founder \nof M+R, a campaign strategy firm whose clients include, among others: \nEnvironmental Defense Fund; LCV; and the Democratic Congressional \nCampaign Committee. Greenpeace is also a client of Earthjustice, the \nlegal entity that represents the Sierra Club, NRDC, and Environmental \nDefense Fund. Additionally, Greenpeace remains officially affiliated \nwith the Partnership Project, whose members also include Sierra Club, \nEnvironmental Defense Fund, NRDC and LCV. While Greenpeace may not make \na Dirty Dozen list, or endorse hundreds of Democratic candidates, it is \naffiliated with and supports the organizations that do. Furthermore, it\n\n[[Page S9449]]\n\nrepresents those affiliations to the rest of the world.\n  Environmental Defense Fund, EDF, describes itself as an organization \nthat ``is dedicated to protecting the environmental rights of all \npeople'' by using a scientific approach that is ``nonpartisan, cost-\neffective, and fair.'' Environmental Defense Fund is represented by its \nfamily of organizations, Environmental Defense, Inc., a 501(c)(3) \norganization, and Environmental Defense Action Fund, Inc., a 501(c)(4) \norganization.\n  EDF is also intimately connected with other environmental and \npolitical organizations. Trustee Frank Loy currently serves as one of \nSenator Obama's ``top environmental advisers'' for the 2008 \nPresidential campaign. This past year, trustee Douglas Shorenstein \ndonated $272,100 to Democratic political objectives, including the \nHillary Clinton and Al Franken campaigns. Trustee Joanne Woodward, wife \nof noted Hollywood star Paul Newman, donated significantly to both the \nClinton and Obama campaigns. Until 2006, Teresa Heinz, wife of Senator \nJohn Kerry served on the board of trustees for EDF. Heinz is also the \ncurrent chairman of Heinz Endowments, a part of the Heinz Family \nFoundation, one of the Nation's 25 largest charitable foundations. \nCurrent EDF trustee George Woodwell also serves on the board of the \nNRDC.\n  EDF reported raising $71.8 million for the 2006 calendar year, and \nreported receiving contributions totaling more than $94 million during \nthe 2006 IRS filing period. Of that amount, the organization spent \n$18.9 million to promote their stance on climate change issues, and \n$19.5 million collectively on land and ocean environmental issues.\n  In addition to the publicly professed alliances among these groups, \nthey are all connected by the foundations that provide them with a \nsignificant amount of funding.\n  The Heinz foundations are some of the largest contributors to these \nnonprofit environmental organizations, and, of course, Ms. Teresa Heinz \nKerry is either chairperson of the board of trustees or member of the \nboard of trustees on each foundation. In fact, Ms. Heinz Kerry oversees \nmore than $1.5 billion of Heinz foundation resources.\n  Last year alone, Heinz gave $160,000 to NRDC directly. Since 2002, \nHeinz has given a total of $740,000 to EDF, LCV, and NRDC specifically. \nOver the past 5 years, Heinz has also given $3.8 million to Tides. \nTides has donated significantly to all five of the mentioned \nenvironmental organizations, and receives a large portion of their \nfunding from foundations such as Heinz.\n  Another major supporter of environmental groups is the Turner \nFoundation, founded in 1990 by Ted Turner. The Turner Foundation \nsponsors special projects including the Partnership Project comprised \nof 20 national environmental groups. Since 2002, the Turner Foundation \nhas contributed more than $2.9 million to the Partnership Project. \nAdditionally, the Turner Foundation has given more than $1 million to \nthe NRDC, $778,875 to EDF, and $6.7 million to the LCV Education Fund.\n  The Pew Charitable Trust, which claims it is ``an independent non-\nprofit serving to inform the public on key issues,'' also gives \nsubstantially to environmental groups. Two of Pew's environmental \npriorities include global warming and wilderness protection.\n  Since 2002, Pew has given a substantial amount of money to \nenvironmental activist groups directly and through other private funds \nthat finance these groups. Pew contributed $431,000 to EDF, $900,000 to \nNRDC, and $700,000 to the Partnership Project, a joint venture of the \nNation's leading environmental groups. Additionally, Pew gave more than \n$7 million to the Tides Foundation. During that time, the Tides \nFoundation contributed a collective $1.8 million to the following \norganizations: EDF, LCV, Greenpeace, NRDC, and Sierra Club.\n  This tangled web of political financing and private dollars should be \ndisconcerting and even scary to American's concerned about transparency \nand honesty in our Government. Clearly, where these environmental \ngroups are concerned, there is no line between issue advocacy and \npolitical activity. And most disturbing is the fact that one cannot \ntell if these so-called environmental groups that claim to protect and \nconserve our environment, really spend any money on actually improving \nour environment.\n  Why is this important? Well, it is important because our environment \nis important to all of us. Despite what you may hear from these groups \nin their attack advertisements against President Bush and Republican \ncandidates across the Nation, our air is cleaner, water more drinkable, \nand our forests are becoming healthier. For instance, over the last 30 \nyears, we have cut air pollution in half.\n  This is also important because these wolves disguised in sheep's \nclothing are deceiving the America people. When an individual gives \ntheir hard-earned money to one of these organizations, most expect it \nto be used for the environmental cause they support, not political \ncampaigning.\n  It seems that it is more important to these groups to turn their once \nlaudable movement into a political machine misleading the American \npublic regarding their purely politically partisan agenda under the \nguise of environmental protection. Again, a wolf in sheep's clothing.\n  Our nation's first Chief of the U.S. Forest Service, Gifford Pinchot, \nsaid, ``Conservation means the wise use of the earth and its resources \nfor the lasting good of men.'' He also said that ``conservation is the \napplication of common sense to the common problems for the common \ngood.''\n  Those words ring true today. Unfortunately, it is clear to me that \nthe environmentalist movement is deaf to them. What we find now is the \nfleecing of the American public's pocketbooks by the environmental \nmovement for their political gain. We also find exhausting litigation, \ninstigation of false claims, misleading science, and scare tactics to \nfool Americans into believing disastrous environmental scenarios that \nare untrue.\n  Mr. President, especially in this election year, the American voter \nshould see these groups and their many affiliate organizations as they \nare: the newest insidious conspiracy of political action committees and \nperhaps the newest multi-million dollar manipulation of Federal \nelection laws.\n  As an American citizen concerned about our environment and our \ncountry, I am dismayed and saddened by this deception. If these groups \nactually used the hundreds of millions of dollars they raise for actual \nenvironmental improvement, just think how many whales and forests we \ncould save.\n  These wolves should be seen for what they really are: massive \ndemocratic political machines, disguised as environmental causes.\n  You know, I think a lot of people on this floor understand, both \nDemocratic and Republican, and the American people, there has been a \nwake-up call. When you look at what happened in the bill back in 2005 \nthat came forward on trying to put caps on the greenhouse gases and cap \nand trade, a very expensive system that would cost the American people \nover $300 billion a year.\n  At that time, there were only three Senators who came down to oppose \nthat bill. Yet this was overwhelmingly defeated. Then fast forward 3 \nyears to 2008. We had a similar bill on the floor of the Senate a few \nweeks ago. This time, 24 Senators, or 23, came down and joined me to \ntell the truth as to the economic destruction that would come should we \npass this legislation.\n  So I think that wake-up call is there. In spite of the millions of \ndollars that are channeled through 501(c)(3)s to defeat Republican \ncandidates, I think reason is winning.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                              INTRODUCTION\n\n       Environmental activism has become a multibillion dollar \n     industry in the U.S. campaigns to save the whales or stop \n     mining beg average Americans for their support through \n     donation of their hard earned dollars. These environmental \n     campaigns also receive millions from charitable foundations \n     such as the Pew Foundation, Turner Foundation, and Heinz \n     Foundation. But what most don't know when they donate to a \n     cause to ``save the rainforest'' or ``save the polar bear'' \n     is that their money could end up being used for partisan \n     activities that are only tangentially related, if related at \n     all, to the cause for which they are intended.\n       The majority of environmental activist groups present \n     themselves as objective, nonpartisan, nonprofit groups that \n     are dedicated to environmental integrity and protection. To \n     accomplish their goals, these groups typically set up \n     501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations\n\n[[Page S9450]]\n\n     with affiliated 501(c)(4) organizations. It is difficult to \n     detail these organizations' specific spending habits. On \n     December 19, 2007, the Wall Street Journal published an \n     article that documented just how difficult this process is, \n     and how political several 501(c) organizations were in the \n     last year. The article stated:\n       ``Because the IRS doesn't require 501(c) organizations to \n     detail election spending or to list contributors, it's \n     difficult to track their political activity. The Journal \n     analyzed data on 30 separate 501(c) groups active in \n     elections from 2000 to 2006, culled from a variety of \n     sources. The data show that the 30 organizations spent at \n     least $155 million on the 2006 elections, nearly twice what \n     they spent in 2000.''\n       As early as 1995, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \n     noticed a growing problem in today's non-profit sector. The \n     IRS published an educational document about the difficulties \n     in separating such non-profit organizations' nonpartisan \n     status from the legislative and political activities that \n     such organizations undertake. The report stated: ``[T]he work \n     of exempt organizations specialists reflects diverse ways in \n     which political agendas are forwarded. Today, political \n     agendas are being forged by political parties, candidates, \n     legislative caucuses, educational organizations, and \n     political action committees. When entities employed in this \n     process seek recognition of exemption under IRC 501(c)(3) or \n     501(c)(4), questions arise about the scope of political \n     campaign, legislative, and political educational activities \n     permitted under these sections.''\n       The IRS categorizes a broad issue that has become very \n     prominent among today's leading environmental activist \n     groups. For years, there has been public and political \n     scrutiny over the activities of major environmental activist \n     groups, such as Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), the Natural \n     Resources Defense Council (NRDC), and the League of \n     Conservation Voters (LCV), and their financial links to \n     charitable institutions, such as the Tides Foundation and \n     Heinz family foundations. These issues were brought to the \n     public's attention several years ago through various \n     publications such as the 2004 articles in The Hill and The \n     Washington Post.\n       This report will focus on the financial intricacies and \n     political ties of major environmental activist groups \n     including the League of Conservation Voters, the \n     Environmental Defense Fund, Greenpeace, the Natural Resources \n     Defense Council, and the Sierra Club, and the major \n     foundations that support them.\n\n\n                            501(c)s and 527s\n\n       The three different types of nonprofit groups analyzed in \n     this report are 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4), and 527 organizations, \n     all of which have tax-exempt status under the Internal \n     Revenue Code. A single group is often affiliated with other \n     types of organizations. For example, the League of \n     Conservation Voters, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) that is affiliated \n     with two 501(c)(4) organizations and two ``527 groups'' and a \n     political action committee (PAC). There are different \n     requirements and restrictions placed upon each group, as \n     analyzed below.\n       501(c)(3) nonprofits are tax-exempt organizations that can \n     participate in political issues, but not specific campaigns. \n     These organizations must be organized and operated for a \n     qualifying purpose (e.g., a charitable, educational, or \n     religious purpose) and serve the public interest. They are \n     commonly thought of as charitable organizations. The majority \n     of the funds raised by these organizations come from \n     individual donors and other public sources. The individual \n     donations are tax deductible for the donor as long as they \n     meet certain criteria. One such criterion is that the donor \n     must present receipts for amounts of more than two hundred \n     and fifty dollars. These organizations can lose their tax \n     exempt status by supporting or opposing a candidate and \n     engaging in campaign activities that are specifically linked \n     to election periods, such as a presidential primary election.\n       A 501(c)(3) can lobby on their issues, but lobbying cannot \n     be a substantial part of their activities. The organizations \n     can also educate the public and fund research that supports \n     their positions. However, 501(c)(3) organizations cannot \n     ``participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing \n     or distributing of statements), any political campaign on \n     behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public \n     office.'' Some examples of popular 501(c)(3)s are The \n     Salvation Army, United Way, and Habitat for Humanity. Any \n     funds transferred by the 501(c)(3) to an affiliated \n     organization cannot be used for impermissible purposes (e.g., \n     campaign activities).\n       Another type of tax-exempt organization is a 501(c)(4) \n     organization. These organizations are typically ``social \n     welfare organizations'' whose purpose is to promote the \n     common good and general human welfare. Unlike 501(c)(3) \n     organizations, donations to 501(c)(4) organizations are not \n     tax deductible. Under the scope of promoting the general \n     welfare, the 501(c)(4) organizations can engage in political \n     activities with fewer restrictions than a 501(c)(3). For \n     example, a 501(c)(4)'s general lobbying efforts are almost \n     unlimited. Additionally, a 501(c)(4) can promote a candidate \n     for office, as long as campaigning is not the organization's \n     primary purpose. A 501(c)(4) can generally receive and give \n     funds to both its affiliated 501(c)(3)s and 527s without \n     risking its tax-exempt status. Any transferred funds, \n     however, may be subject to tax if those funds are used for a \n     taxable purpose.\n       One of the most prominent examples of a 501(c)(4) campaign \n     is Moveon.org Civic Action, more commonly known as \n     Moveon.org. This organization, which began in 2002, is most \n     famous for its television and print advertisements \n     campaigning against the war in Iraq. The organization also \n     utilizes electronic mail and petitions to achieve its goals. \n     Under the scope of promoting the social welfare, Moveon.org \n     is legally able to become politically involved to campaign \n     for its goals and objectives.\n       Many 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) organizations also have \n     affiliated 527 political organizations. Because 527s are \n     political organizations, they can cross the partisan barrier \n     that is off-limits to 501(c)(3) organizations. For example, a \n     527 organization can attempt to directly influence the \n     election, appointment, or nomination of a particular \n     political candidate for public office. 527 political \n     organizations include the entities that are regulated as \n     political committees under federal election law, such as \n     political action committees (PACs). They also include \n     organizations that appear intended to influence federal \n     elections in ways that may be outside the scope of federal \n     election law and therefore are not regulated by the Federal \n     Election Commission (FEC). These latter organizations are \n     commonly referred to as ``527s'' or ``527 groups,'' and that \n     is how this report identifies them. A 501(c)(3) may not \n     transfer money to an affiliated 527 organization for campaign \n     activities, but a 501(c)(4) organization may be able to do so \n     without losing its tax-exempt status, although the funds may \n     be subject to tax.\n       A 527 group can conduct several partisan activities similar \n     to a PAC. However, unlike a PAC, a 527 group cannot have as \n     its major purpose the nomination or election of a federal \n     office candidate, cannot expressly advocate for election or \n     defeat of a clearly identified federal candidate, and cannot \n     contribute money directly to a candidate's campaign. 527 \n     groups can, however, utilize unregulated ``soft'' money to \n     highlight specific candidate's strengths or weaknesses, and \n     generally promote said candidate without specifically \n     endorsing his or her election. Therefore, a 527 group may be \n     able to essentially operate as a ``soft money'' PAC without \n     having to register with the FEC.\n       In recent history, 527s have received increased scrutiny \n     for not complying with IRS regulations, including donor \n     disclosure requirements. Consequently, some organizations may \n     have switched over to campaigning through their 501(c)(4) \n     organizations. The 501(c)(4) retains the ability to engage \n     in campaign activities but is not subject to donor \n     disclosure requirements.\n       It is the ability to shift funds easily among these \n     different organizations that has generated a stir of \n     political attention and has raised some very serious \n     questions about the validity of each. Supposed ``nonprofit, \n     nonpartisan organizations'' can shift funds very easily to \n     organizations formed for the sole purpose of partisan, \n     political activity. 501(c)(3) organizations can shift funds \n     to 501(c)(4) organizations, which can participate in partisan \n     activities, although the funds could not lawfully be used for \n     campaign activities. A 501(c)(4) can shift funds to a 527 \n     organization, often founded for political campaign purposes. \n     Clearly, without a system for tracking funding in these types \n     of organizations, a donor could contribute to a nonpartisan, \n     nonprofit organization and the donation could ultimately be \n     used for partisan political activities. While this practice, \n     if caught, would cause a 501(c)(3) organization to lose its \n     tax-exempt status, it is nearly impossible to detect these \n     funding shifts.\n       There are also questions about the exact scope and \n     limitations placed upon 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4)s, 527s and PACs. \n     With the existence of the 501(c)(4) and the PAC, what is the \n     point of the 527? With significant partisan campaign activity \n     undertaken by 501(c)(4) and 527 groups which are regulated by \n     the IRS, how do lawmakers control and police how much money \n     is actually being spent on campaigns, when the FEC's role in \n     regulating these organizations is often unclear?\n       Outlined below are several examples that highlight the \n     complexity of the web of nonprofit organizations and their \n     political activities.\n\n\n                     league of conservation voters\n\n       LCV represents itself as ``turning environmental values \n     into national priorities.'' The organization's mission is \n     ``to advocate for sound environmental policies and to elect \n     pro-environmental candidates who will adopt and implement \n     such policies.''\n       The LCV is registered as a 501(c)(4) organization, with \n     affiliations to several other organizations: the League of \n     Conservation Voters Education Fund, a 501(c)(3), which claims \n     to refrain from campaign activities, and the LCV \n     Accountability Project, another 501(c)(4) organization. These \n     affiliates, referred to as a ``family of organizations,'' are \n     committed to running ``tough and effective campaigns to \n     defeat anti-environment candidates, and support those leaders \n     who stand up for a clean, healthy future for America.'' The \n     very purpose of LCV is to campaign against anti-environmental \n     candidates, an action that a 501(c)(3) cannot engage in. LCV \n     does, however, make the claim that the LCV Education Fund is \n     a separate entity, committed ``to bring[ing] the environment \n     to the center of the public's attention as an issue critical \n     to good public policy and a healthy political system.''\n       In 2006, LCV had two 527 groups: the League of Conservation \n     Voters--SSF, and the\n\n[[Page S9451]]\n\n     League of Conservation Voters Inc. SSF--527 II. These 527 \n     groups were fined by the FEC for violating the following \n     three separate provisions: Failure to register with the FEC \n     as a PAC, failure to report contributions and expenditures to \n     the FEC, and knowingly accepting individual's donations in \n     excess of $5,000. (The FEC found that more than $6 million of \n     LCV's expenditures during 2004 violated the $5,000 individual \n     maximum amount restriction.)\n       The LCV was fined a total of $180,000 by the FEC. According \n     to an FEC press release, LCV received this fine for acting as \n     a clear political committee and violating federal election \n     law. The organization was required to disclose all current \n     and future contributions and expenditures and register as a \n     PAC should it engage in activities that qualified it as such. \n     The Wall Street Journal highlighted these violations in an \n     article published in December 2007. Following this incident, \n     the LCV restructured its organization into a 501(c)(4), which \n     allows the organization to run with fewer disclosure \n     restrictions.\n       Every election cycle, the LCV lists ``the Dirty Dozen,'' a \n     list of federal candidates for election or re-election whom \n     the LCV deems as environmentally unfriendly. The first list \n     was created in 1996, and contained four members of the \n     Senate, and eight members of the House. That year, LCV spent \n     $1.5 million ``sending two hundred and fifty-four pieces of \n     persuasion mail to targeted voters [and] running nine \n     thousand television and radio ads'' against the members of \n     the ``Dirty Dozen'' which included eleven Republicans and one \n     Democrat. The one Democrat listed on the ``Dirty Dozen'' \n     regained his seat in the House that year while seven of the \n     Republican candidates on the list were not re-elected.\n       In 1998, the ``Dirty Dozen'' list was comprised of eleven \n     Republicans and two Democrats. That year, the LCV spent a \n     total of $2.3 million on election campaigning, ``where our \n     efforts could provide the winning margin of difference.'' The \n     two Democrats on the list retained their seats and nine of \n     the eleven Republicans on the list were defeated.\n       In 2000, the LCV spent more than $4 million, ``the largest \n     expenditure in history,'' on the election. Their ``Dirty \n     Dozen'' list focused on eleven Republicans and one Democrat. \n     In that election cycle, seven of the Republicans on the list \n     were defeated; the one Democrat kept his seat.\n       Again, in 2002, the ``Dirty Dozen'' list was comprised of \n     eleven Republicans and one Democrat. LCV did not report how \n     much it spent on the year's election cycle. Five Republicans \n     on the list lost their seats while the one Democrat retained \n     his seat.\n       Two years later, in 2004, the ``Dirty Dozen'' list \n     contained twelve Republicans and one Democrat. LCV and its \n     affiliates spent a total of $16 million during that year's \n     elections targeting the 13 candidates. As in previous years, \n     the one Democrat on the list retained his seat while four of \n     the twelve Republicans were defeated. For the first time, in \n     2004, the LCV included a presidential administration on their \n     list. The LCV endorsed Senator John Kerry (D-MA) for \n     President.\n       In 2006, the LCV chose fifteen candidates for their ``Dirty \n     Dozen'' list. The list was comprised of thirteen Republicans \n     and two Democrats. While the two Democrats on the ``Dirty \n     Dozen'' list retained their seats, nine Republicans lost \n     their seats. During this election, the LCV asked viewers of \n     their web site to choose one candidate for the ``Dirty \n     Dozen'' list. The viewers chose Rep. Charles Taylor (R-NC) to \n     join the ``Dirty Dozen'' list. Taylor lost his seat in 2006 \n     to Heath Shuler (D-NC). The LCV and its affiliates used its \n     extensive budget of $27 million on campaign activities.\n       At the time of this report, the LCV had yet to release a \n     completed version of the 2008 ``Dirty Dozen'' list. However, \n     it has released the names of nine individuals who will fill \n     up the ranks of the completed list. Of those nine, there is \n     one Democrat joining the ``Dirty Dozen.''\n       While there is no means of calculating or anticipating what \n     LCV will spend this year, as their budget has grown every \n     election cycle, they will most likely have at least the $27 \n     million that they did in 2006.\n       For more than a decade, the LCV has produced its ``Dirty \n     Dozen'' list, targeting select Congressional figures. The \n     organization has operated under the guise of ``the \n     independent political voice for the environment,'' since even \n     before the publication of the ``Dirty Dozen''. To date, \n     eighty-three names have been placed on the LCV's ``Dirty \n     Dozen'', including seventy-four Republicans. By their \n     bipartisan claims, it would be expected that LCV's support \n     would be split evenly; however, almost 90 percent of LCV's \n     recommendations have been to remove Republican candidates. \n     The publishers of the ``Dirty Dozen'' have yet to name even a \n     dozen Democrats to their list in the past twelve years. It \n     has become increasingly apparent that the LCV has been \n     allowed to participate in partisan politics while conveying \n     the impression of objectivity. The organization, however \n     still continues to make the claim that they don't support one \n     political party over another.\n\n\n                                  NRDC\n\n       The Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. is registered \n     as a 501(c)(3) organization. Like the LCV ``family of \n     organizations,'' it is also affiliated with a 501(c)(4) \n     organization, the NRDC Action Fund, and a 527 organization, \n     the Environmental Accountability Fund. By having at least one \n     of each category of tax-exempt organizations, groups can \n     essentially transfer wealth throughout their family of \n     organizations and remain virtually undetected. In its 2006 \n     tax filing, Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. \n     transferred $98,801 to NRDC Action Fund, and NRDC Action Fund \n     transferred $124,500 to undisclosed ``other organizations'' \n     that same year.\n       Founded in 1970, NRDC purports to be the ``nation's most \n     effective environmental action group'' whose mission is to \n     ``[t]o safeguard the Earth: its people, its plants and \n     animals and the natural systems on which all life depends.'' \n     The NRDC uses grassroots efforts and the power of legal and \n     scientific expertise to achieve its goals, which they \n     describe frequently as ``independent.''\n       From 2001 through 2005, the NRDC reported on the Bush \n     Administration by creating the Bush Record. The Record \n     categorized Bush's presidency as an administration that \n     ``will cater to industries that put America's health and \n     natural heritage at risk.'' The NRDC predicted that Bush \n     would continue ``to undermine environmental enforcement and \n     weaken key programs will be made.'' The organization gave up \n     the effort and stopped tracking the Administration's moves \n     after President Bush defeated Sen. Kerry in the 2004 \n     election.\n       NRDC has also showed their party leanings in popular \n     culture. In an episode of the HBO long-running comedy, Curb \n     Your Enthusiasm, the NRDC was featured in connection with \n     Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA). The episode, which features \n     Boxer as the event opener for the NRDC event, initially aired \n     on September 16, 2007. Boxer currently serves as Chairman of \n     the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n       At the time of this report, the NRDC had made no formal \n     declaration of support for a presidential candidate.\n\n\n                              sierra club\n\n       The Sierra Club Foundation is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt \n     organization with an affiliated 501(c)(4) group, Sierra Club. \n     There is also a 527 organization called the Sierra Club Voter \n     Education Fund, which claims to be a ``separate segregated \n     fund of the Sierra Club.'' The Sierra Club Foundation does \n     not claim affiliation with this 527 organization, however the \n     Sierra Club Voters Education Fund ``does not have its own \n     Board of directors, officers or trustees.'' In 2006, the \n     Sierra Club 501(c) organizations brought in more than $110 \n     million and spent nearly $104 million; the Sierra Club Voter \n     Education Fund only brought in $60,000, but managed to spend \n     nearly $1 million.\n       The Sierra Club Voter Education Fund has a history of \n     receiving support from its ``unaffiliated and unpartisan \n     company'' of the same name and address. During 2002, the \n     Sierra Club Voter Education Fund reported total contributions \n     of slightly more than $3 million. During that calendar year, \n     the Voter Education Fund reported received $2.25 million, the \n     vast majority of their total revenue, in contributions from \n     the Sierra Club.\n       It's not hard to understand why the Sierra Club's web of \n     affiliations, or ``non-affiliations,'' becomes so \n     intertwined. A brief glimpse at the activities of Carl Pope, \n     Sierra Club's executive director, shows a tangle even more \n     convoluted than the organization that he spearheads. In the \n     past five years, Carl Pope has played a major role in the \n     following organizations: Sierra Club; California League of \n     Conservation Voters, executive director; Public Voice; \n     California Common Cause; Zero Population Growth, now \n     Population Connection, political director; America Coming \n     Together, founding member and treasurer; America Votes; \n     American Rights at Work; and America's Families United. In \n     addition to Pope's extensive organizational involvement, \n     he also co-authored a book, ``Strategic Ignorance: Why the \n     Bush Administration Is Recklessly Destroying a Century of \n     Environmental Progress.'' The Sierra Club continues to \n     maintain that it is an independent organization whose \n     mission is solely ``to receive, administer, and disburse \n     funds donated for tax-exempt, charitable, scientific, \n     literary, and educational purposes.''\n       The Sierra Club has a history of endorsing candidates for \n     political office. Currently, the Sierra Club has announced \n     that it will support Senator Obama's (D-IL) presidential bid. \n     While there is no reported activity yet from the \n     organization, Sierra Club has been historically known to run \n     television and radio advertisements both supporting their \n     candidate and criticizing the opposition. Additionally, at \n     the time of this report, Sierra Club announced its support of \n     thirteen candidates for seats in the United States Senate. Of \n     those thirteen candidates, none are Republicans. The \n     organization has also announced its endorsement of one \n     hundred and fifty-six candidates to the United State House of \n     Representatives. Of the candidates, four are Republicans. \n     Essentially, ninety-eight percent of Sierra Club's \n     endorsements favor Democrat candidates.\n\n\n                               Greenpeace\n\n       Greenpeace USA presents itself as ``an independent \n     campaigning organization that uses peaceful protest and \n     creative communication to expose global environmental \n     problems.'' With two hundred fifty thousand members in the \n     United States (and 2.5 million worldwide) Greenpeace is \n     represented by Greenpeace, Inc., a 501(c)(4) organization, \n     and Greenpeace Fund, Inc., a 501(c)(3) organization. Through \n     those organizations, Greenpeace reported that it had raised \n     $11.5 million in 2006; its 501(c)(3) and (c)(4) collectively \n     reported contributions of $26 million\n\n[[Page S9452]]\n\n     for their 2006 tax filings (which extend past the 2006 year).\n       Greenpeace, like other environmental activist organizations \n     has strong ties to other politically oriented groups. The \n     chairman of the Board of Directors, Donald Ross, is involved \n     in multiple organizations, including the LCV, where he is a \n     board member. Ross is also the founder of M+R, a campaign \n     strategy firm whose clients include, among others: \n     Environmental Defense Fund, LCV, and the Democratic \n     Congressional Campaign Committee. Greenpeace is also a client \n     of Earthjustice, the legal entity which represents the Sierra \n     Club, NRDC and Environmental Defense Fund. Additionally, \n     Greenpeace remains officially affiliated with the Partnership \n     Project, whose members also include Sierra Club, \n     Environmental Defense Fund, NRDC and LCV. While Greenpeace \n     may not make a Dirty Dozen list, or endorse hundreds of \n     Democratic candidates, it is affiliated and supports the \n     organizations that do. Furthermore, it represents those \n     affiliations to the rest of the world.\n\n\n                       Environmental Defense Fund\n\n       Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) describes itself as an \n     organization that ``is dedicated to protecting the \n     environmental rights of all people'' by using a scientific \n     approach that is ``nonpartisan, cost-effective and fair.'' \n     Environmental Defense Fund is represented by its family of \n     organizations, Environmental Defense, Inc., a 501(c)(3) \n     organization, and Environmental Defense Action Fund, Inc., a \n     501(c)(4) organization.\n       EDF is also intimately connected with other environmental \n     and political organizations. Frank E. Loy, Environmental \n     Defense Fund's chairman of the board, served as Clinton's \n     Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs. Until 2006, \n     Teresa Heinz, wife of Sen. John Kerry (D-MA), served on the \n     board of trustees for EDF. Heinz is also the current chairman \n     of Heinz Endowments, a part of the Heinz Family Foundation, \n     one of the nation's twenty-five largest charitable \n     foundations. This report will discuss the Heinz Foundation's \n     activities in more detail later. Current EDF trustee \n     George Woodwell also serves on the board of the NRDC.\n       Additionally, the trustees of EDF are connected with \n     partisan activities. Trustee Frank Loy currently serves as \n     one of Senator Obama's ``top environmental advisers'' for the \n     2008 Presidential Campaign. This past year, trustee Douglas \n     Shorenstein donated $272,100 to Democratic political \n     objectives, including the Hillary Clinton and Al Franken \n     campaigns. Trustee Joanne Woodward, wife of noted Hollywood \n     star Paul Newman, donated significantly to both the Clinton \n     and Obama campaigns.\n       EDF reported raising $71.8 million for the 2006 calendar \n     year, and reported receiving contributions totaling more than \n     $94 million during the 2006 IRS filing period (which extends \n     beyond the 2006 calendar year). Of that amount, the \n     organization spent $18.9 million to promote their stance on \n     climate change issues, and $19.5 collectively on land and \n     ocean environmental issues.\n\n\n                              FOUNDATIONS\n\n       All of the above groups receive a significant amount of \n     their funds from foundations that regularly give to groups \n     with allied interests. Note that each foundation and charity \n     mentioned is also organized as a 501(c)(3) and is not able to \n     engage in campaign activities. These foundations, however, do \n     not have to make meaningful disclosures about the purpose of \n     their donations and grants or what happens to the money after \n     it is donated. Therefore, tracking such funds is impossible. \n     Many times these foundations donate significant funds to \n     other foundations who in turn donate significantly to \n     environmental groups. The Tides Foundation has a history of \n     making donations and grants to every environmental group \n     mentioned in this report. While neither the Pew Charitable \n     Trust nor the Heinz family of foundations has given directly \n     to all five mentioned groups, they have donated millions to \n     Tides, creating an interlocking system of money-changing, \n     with no transparency.\n       The following are a few of the foundations that regularly \n     give to environmental activist, ``nonpartisan,'' groups such \n     as those mentioned above.\n     Pew Charitable Trusts\n       Made up of seven different charities, the Pew Charitable \n     Trusts claims that it is an ``independent nonprofit'' that \n     ``applies a rigorous, analytical approach to improve public \n     policy, inform the public and stimulate civic life.'' In \n     2004, Pew made the switch from a private foundation to a \n     public charity in order to provide the organization more \n     flexibility and range in their efforts. The switch to a \n     public charity gives Pew the ability to lobby on the federal \n     and state level, and combine certain resources required to be \n     separate when Pew was operating as a private foundation.\n       The switch to public charity also allows the organization \n     to spend the money generated on issues and in sectors not \n     originally intended by its founders. According to a 2004 Wall \n     Street Journal article, the foundation was set up ``to \n     disburse money to charities and research that the founders \n     believed reflected their values and priorities,'' not to \n     venture into the whims of the current directors.\n       The change in Pew's status allows the organization to \n     pursue more partisan activities than it had undertaken \n     previously. The Wall Street Journal article highlighted that \n     Pew, because of its status shift, would now be able to spend \n     five percent of its budget on lobbying efforts, funding ``a \n     lot of K Street lunches.'' With a $4 billion budget, that \n     means that Pew can spend $200 million in lobbying. This means \n     that ``Pew's shift promises to have a seismic impact on the \n     foundation and political worlds.''\n       Since the shift, Pew has given a substantial amount of \n     money to environmental activist groups directly, and through \n     other private funds that finance those groups. Pew \n     contributed $431,000 to EDF; $900,000 to NRDC; and $700,000 \n     to the Partnership Project, which is a joint venture of the \n     nation's leading environmental groups. The Partnership \n     Project's membership includes such names as LCV, EDF, NRDC, \n     Greenpeace, and Sierra Club. Additionally, Pew gave more than \n     $7 million to the Tides Foundation. During that time, the \n     Tides Foundation contributed a collective $1.8 million to the \n     following organizations: EDF, LCV, Greenpeace, NRDC, and \n     Sierra Club.\n     Heinz Foundations\n       Based in Pittsburgh, the Heinz family of foundations is \n     made up of several different foundations. Two of the major \n     organizations within this empire are the Heinz Endowments, \n     and the Heinz Family Philanthropies (hereinafter collectively \n     referred to as ``Heinz''). In 2006, the Heinz Endowments \n     combined the Howard Heinz Endowment and the Vira I. Heinz \n     Endowment, two of the Heinz foundations more major funds, \n     with a common purpose ``to develop solutions that are \n     national in scope.'' The Heinz Family Philanthropies are made \n     up of three funds: The Teresa and H. John Heinz III \n     Foundation, the H. John Heinz III Foundation, and the Heinz \n     Family Foundation. The Philanthropies focus on three key \n     issues: healthcare and the elderly, environment concerns, and \n     advancing female opportunities in the workplace.\n       At the center of the Heinz empire is Teresa Heinz. She is \n     the current chairman of both the Heinz Endowments and the \n     Heinz Family Philanthropies. As previously stated, Ms. Heinz, \n     wife of Sen. John Kerry (D-MA), is known for her \n     environmental and political activities. When her husband ran \n     for President in 2004, the LCV publicly endorsed him--the \n     earliest the organization had ever endorsed a Presidential \n     candidate. LCV had previously received more than $57,000 from \n     Heinz donations, but made the assertion that the money had no \n     effect on their endorsement. Ms. Heinz oversees more than \n     $1.5 billion of Heinz foundation resources.\n       Heinz, like Pew, has a history of giving both to \n     environmental organizations individually, as well as to other \n     funds and private foundations that also donate significant \n     sums to environmental activists. Last year alone, Heinz gave \n     $160,000 to NRDC directly. Since 2002, Heinz has given a \n     total of $740,000 to EDF, LCV, and NRDC specifically. Over \n     the past five years, Heinz has also given $3.8 million to \n     Tides. Tides, as previously stated, has donated significantly \n     to all five of the mentioned environmental organizations, and \n     receives a bulk of their funds from foundations such as \n     Heinz.\n     Turner Foundation\n       Founded in 1990 by Ted Turner, the Turner Foundation is a \n     self-proclaimed ``private, independent family foundation \n     committed to preventing damage to the natural--water, air, \n     and land--on which all life depends.'' Since 1991, the Turner \n     Foundation has reported giving out $297.6 million in grants \n     to organizations ``aimed at creating a better world.'' In its \n     2006 filing, the Turner Foundation raised more than $12 \n     million and contributed more than $8.6 million in grants.\n       The Turner Foundation focuses its philanthropic efforts \n     almost solely on environmental pursuits. In 2001, for \n     instance, Ted Turner co-founded the ``Nuclear Threat \n     Initiative,'' with former Democratic Senator Sam Nunn, to \n     combat the growing nuclear threat. In addition, the \n     Foundation has historically undertaken ``special projects'' \n     which include the League of Conservation Voters Education \n     Fund and the Partnership Project.\n       Since 2002, the Turner Foundation has contributed more than \n     $2.9 million to the Partnership Project. The Turner \n     Foundation also contributed significant sums to several of \n     the mentioned members individually. Since 2002, the Turner \n     Foundation has given more than $1 million to the NRDC; \n     $778,875 to EDF; and $6.7 million to the LCV Education Fund.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       This report by no means paints a complete picture of \n     environmental activism and its political and financial ties \n     to election politics. There are additional activities that \n     the environmental groups mentioned participated in, and \n     additional organizations that the foundations mentioned \n     funded. Each of the groups cited, including the foundations, \n     are represented by a 501(c)(3) organization. Under this \n     structure, these organizations collect funds from individual \n     donors by representing themselves as unbiased, objective, \n     and nonpartisan. They are able to amass wealth because \n     those funds are tax-deductible to their donors.\n       Each of these organizations has also, both individually and \n     collectively, given numerous examples of their partisanship \n     activities. The LCV is, by its very nature, a partisan \n     organization. Additionally, its history has shown it to \n     consistently favor Democratic candidates. It is closely \n     followed by the Sierra Club, which is currently only giving \n     two percent of its support to Republican candidates this \n     year. The NRDC has gone on television showing its support for \n     a Democratic\n\n[[Page S9453]]\n\n     Senator. EDF has a board comprised of publicly-disclosed \n     advisors and financial supporters to the Senator Barack Obama \n     Presidential Campaign. Greenpeace, aside from being \n     affiliated with all the above organizations, is chaired by a \n     man who is directly associated with the Democratic \n     Congressional Campaign Committee. Furthermore, all of these \n     organizations are associated with each other through the \n     Partnership Project, which has consistently supported the \n     Democratic environmental platform.\n       In conclusion, as we turn to another election year, these \n     environmental groups continue to campaign in much the same \n     manner. With a presidential campaign in full swing, these \n     organizations and foundations are likely to wield an even \n     bigger sword than in years previous. Yet for all of the \n     activities that take place, both those mentioned above and \n     others, these groups remain unchecked. They continue to do \n     business under the scope of charitable organizations. While \n     it is not likely that their partisan habits are going to \n     change, the public should see these nonprofits for what they \n     are, and what they stand for.\n       Because of the complicated web of 501(c), 527, and PAC \n     organizations, it is clear that individuals who donate to a \n     501(c)(3) organization intending to contribute to the cause \n     of the organization, have no clear mechanism for verifying \n     that their donation was used for the cause. Unsuspectingly, \n     these donors may be contributing to partisan activities when \n     they originally intended their donation to aide an \n     environmental cause. Additionally, there is not sufficient \n     oversight over these organizations to police their political \n     and campaign activities.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me state my understanding of how we \nare going to proceed now. I believe, in the spirit of going back and \nforth, the Senator from Colorado has indicated he would agree that I \ncan go ahead and speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business; \nthat he is going to be requesting 15 minutes to speak. At that time, if \nSenator Feingold is here, I know he wanted to speak, too, and Senator \nBond has been waiting and wants to speak.\n  I gather maybe I should do a unanimous consent at this point that I \nbe allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes and then Senator Allard be \nallowed to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak for 10 minutes after Senator Allard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9453-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9453-S9455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me take a few minutes to discuss \nwhat we have been able to do with regard to energy policy in this \nCongress and discuss where I believe we are headed in the next \nCongress.\n  We began this Congress having passed, in mid-2005, the first \ncomprehensive Energy Policy Act in 13 years.\n  Mr. President, could I be advised when 8 of my 10 minutes has been \nused?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. We passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005. That bill was \nabout 5 years in the making. It only became law because the chairman of \nthe Energy Committee at that time, Senator Domenici, took it upon \nhimself to work constructively across the aisle with Democrats, myself \nand others, to put forward a bill both sides could embrace. In the \nfirst session of this Congress, we followed up with a new comprehensive \nenergy bill, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. That \nbill was also the result of a strong bipartisan effort.\n  President Bush helped by putting forth some important policy \ninitiatives in his 2007 State of the Union speech, calling for more \nproduction of alternative transportation fuels and for higher fuel \neconomy standards.\n  In the Senate Energy Committee, we were able to report a strong \nenergy bill that formed the basis for Senate action with a large \nbipartisan majority. Other committees played a major role in different \nparts of that legislation as well.\n  After a long and difficult process with the House, we were able to \ncome to closure on a financial piece of bipartisan legislation that the \nPresident signed in December of last year.\n  The Energy Policy Act of 2005 was a good piece of legislation. The \nEnergy Independence and Security Act of 2007 was an even better piece \nof legislation. Throughout much of 2008, energy issues have been \nsurrounded, unfortunately, by more partisan rancor as energy emerged as \na key concern for voters as an issue on the campaign trial.\n  This is an important reason why, despite so much floor discussion of \nenergy and energy-related topics, we do not have as much to show as a \nresult of our efforts as I would like.\n  When energy issues become politicized along party lines, it is clear \nthe Senate loses its ability to act in an effective way. I am pleased \nthat in the past few weeks we have begun to find a bipartisan way \nforward on energy again. We have put together an energy tax incentive \npackage that has won very broad bipartisan support in the Senate. It \npassed with a margin of 93 to 2.\n  The efforts of leadership, Senator Reid in the Senate, Senator \nMcConnell, Senator Baucus, Senator Grassley, and many others helped to \nput this legislative package together. Also, we have made some \nsignificant bipartisan progress on energy policy in the continuing \nresolution, which I believe is coming up for consideration in the \nSenate very soon.\n  The moratorium on offshore oil and gas exploration has been lifted \nfor much of the Outer Continental Shelf. That is a development I \nsupport. We have also fully funded the direct loan program for \nretooling the auto industry, permitting up to $25 billion in loans to \nbe made to help move our transportation sector into a cleaner and more \nenergy-efficient future.\n  This is important to our future national economic security. I hope \nall these accomplishments make it across the finish line and actually \nbecome law in the next few days. If they do, they will help set the \nstage for what I believe to be a reemergence of bipartisanship on \nenergy after the election is behind us and as we reconvene this next \nyear as the 111th Congress.\n  I wish to make clear this morning my intention to push early and hard \nin the new Congress to renew our commitment to an effective, \nbipartisan, and comprehensive approach to energy policy. Despite the \nsuccesses we have had in this Congress, and in the past, there is a \ngreat deal of work that remains to be done in order to secure our \nenergy future, an energy future that is adequate and affordable and \nclean.\n  Let me talk about a few of the energy challenges we face in the next \nCongress and that I hope to work on with my colleagues both on the \nDemocratic and Republican side. We have a real need to work on the \ndeployment of new energy technologies of all kinds, particularly with \nthe growing concern about global warming.\n  We need to make sure we are developing and putting in place a new \ngeneration of clean, low-carbon energy technologies. These technologies \ninclude renewable energy, and carbon capture, transportation and \nstorage and other low-carbon technologies relevant to the nuclear power \nindustry.\n  There is a global clean-tech revolution we can either lead in or we \ncan miss out on. I believe we need to make the investments here in the \nUnited States to be leaders in this revolution.\n  Along with new clean energy technologies, we will need a modernized \nenergy infrastructure to make sure clean energy can be transported or \ntransmitted from wherever it is generated to wherever it is needed. \nWithout a major new focus on putting in place a 21st century energy \ninfrastructure, we will not be able to make the progress we need to \nmake to secure our energy security goals and our climate security \ngoals.\n  Along with new sources of energy, we need to make much more progress \non using energy wisely and efficiently. A major focus of our effort \nneeds to be made in the transportation sector. Many in the Senate have \ntalked about the need for another Manhattan Project or another Apollo \nProject.\n  While I recognize that a different committee, the Committee on \nCommerce and Science and Transportation, is largely responsible for \nregulatory standards on fuel economy, there is a great deal our \ncommittee, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, can do to make \nsure we have the right technology push for advanced vehicles. I see \nthat as a focus of our work in the next Congress as well.\n  We need to do more to improve energy usage in manufacturing, \nbuildings\n\n[[Page S9454]]\n\nand commercial equipment and appliances. Our investments in these areas \nhave been totally inadequate over the past decade. Our investments in \nnew energy technologies and innovation, new energy science and \nengineering, on training the next generation of energy researchers and \ntechnicians have been inadequate.\n  Finally, we need to include the functioning of our Federal agencies \nand programs related to energy across the board. We need to develop \nreal strengths in the Federal Government in terms of working with \nentrepreneurs and industry and markets in commercializing new energy \ntechnologies.\n  One other area we obviously need to put a focus on is the area of the \nrecent scandals in the Minerals Management Service. This indicates that \na thorough examination is needed as to how that agency currently \nfunctions, how its programs can be reformed so the taxpayers get the \nvalue they deserve from the Federal oil and gas resources.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator has used 8 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I appreciate that notification. My colleague from \nAlaska, the very valued senior member of our committee, Senator \nMurkowski, is here and wanted to make a few comments about our plans \nfor the upcoming Congress.\n  I very much welcome her strong support for a bipartisanship effort, \nand I yield the balance of my 10 minutes to her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here to follow up on \nthe comments from the chairman of the Energy Committee.\n  As one of the senior members on the committee, I have had an \nopportunity to work with him and Ranking Member Domenici on many of the \nissues he has talked about, as we have tried to advance energy policies \nfor the country. One of the things we recognize on the committee \nhistorically is there has been a very good, strong, bipartisan \nrelationship, working together to advance policy goals. The point has \nbeen made that perhaps politics has intervened as we have tried to \nadvance some policies of late. I would like to think that as we begin a \nnew Congress next year, with the initiative before us that this country \nneeds and deserves a good, comprehensive energy policy that works for \nthe Nation, that gets us to a point that allows for a level of energy \nsecurity for us, that we will do so in a way that is cooperative, \ncollaborative, and that allows us to move the technologies and advance \nthe infrastructure that is necessary, that allows us to have policies \nin place that not only provide for increased domestic production but \nrenewables and alternatives, with a focus on conservation--truly an \nenergy policy that works. I look forward to working with the chairman \nin advancing these goals.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent that after the remarks of \nSenator Allard and Senator Bond, I be recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I object. Senator Bond had already asked \nfor time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I said after Senator Allard and Senator Bond.\n  Mr. ALLARD. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nBingaman, for his leadership on energy, and also the Senator from \nAlaska, Ms. Murkowski, for her leadership, as well as Republican \nSenator Pete Domenici for his very strong leadership on energy over the \nlast number of years. This is an issue that is extremely important to \nthe country. I rise to talk about energy policy and some of the \nthoughts I have been talking about since coming to the Senate. It is \nimportant that we get the solution right.\n  I fully support what the Senator from New Mexico talked about, the \nthree goals he outlined for the next Congress. I will not be here. I am \nretiring voluntarily. But I do support those goals. I hope we continue \nto follow through with those goals; that is, an adequate supply of \nenergy, affordable, and that we have a clean source of energy to begin \nto address some of our environmental problems.\n  When I first came to the Senate from the House of Representatives, I \nhad been a member of the renewable energy caucus. I came over to the \nSenate and discovered that we did not have a renewable energy caucus to \nsupport the staff and Members of this body. I began the process of \nestablishing a renewable energy caucus because I had come to realize \nthat not only was a balanced energy policy good for the State of \nColorado but also for the Nation.\n  In the State of Colorado, we have the Renewable Energy Laboratory, \nwhich was focusing on new technology, whose main effort was to move \nthat technology--not only to discover it but also to move it to market. \nThat is an important step that happens so often in the research world. \nNobody looks at the practical aspect of moving scientific discoveries \ninto a market that will really serve the people.\n  This is a fabulous agency we have, a research agency in Colorado. It \nnaturally came on my shoulders to begin to organize the Senate \nrenewable energy caucus. We did this in a bipartisan manner. We were \nable to get leadership from the Democratic Party to join me. As \ncochairmen, we promoted the Senate renewable energy caucus. Over the \nyears, the membership built up. Our programs got stronger with the \nsupport of renewable energy labs as well as support from renewable \nenergy industries and businesses throughout the country.\n  As time went on, we had a change in administration from President \nClinton over to President Bush. At the time, he was very strongly in \nfavor of the oil and gas industry and perhaps did not appreciate what \nwas going to be brought to the table with renewable energy. I had to \nspend some time trying to convince this Republican administration that \nit needed to appreciate a little more what renewable energy technology \nwas going to bring to this country, now and in the future.\n  When first coming to the Senate, I always believed we needed to \neventually get to a renewable energy economy, but we needed to do it in \na way that wouldn't destroy the economy. In other words, initially we \nhad to support new energy development--whether it was in hydrocarbons \nor other sources of energy, whether it was nuclear, whether it was \ncoal, whatever--but we could not afford to take anything off the table \nbecause we had to establish a bridge between older technology built on \nhydrocarbons, an economy built on that, and build that into sort of the \nnew stage of energy independence. This is not something I was trying to \nthink about in the last year or two when we had the energy crisis, but \nsomething I have been working on since coming to the Senate, thinking \nthat we needed to have that balance, that it was important for us to \nmove forward.\n  Eventually, the Bush administration became very supportive of \nrenewable energy. I am delighted to have them understand the importance \nof renewable energy and what needs to be done as far as nuclear power.\n  On nuclear power, by the way, we have lost our infrastructure. A lot \nof technicians who know how to operate nuclear powerplants, we have \nlost, and we have exported our technology to France and England. I have \ngone to those facilities and visited with them. They have been \nsupporting nuclear power, which allowed them to sign on to treaties \nlike the Kyoto Treaty which we did not pass in this Congress by a very \nlarge margin because we understood that this country was not ready to \nmove forward yet. We understood at that time that we were exempting big \npolluters in the world such as China and India.\n  We need to get ready because we need to be prepared to compete in a \nworld where the source of energy is going to be changing.\n  I continued to press for oil and gas development, which is important \nto the economy of Colorado. It was important to the economy of this \ncountry when I first came here, and it remains so. It is with interest \nthat I looked at the public employees' retirement accounts in the State \nof Colorado. These are State employees. It is a retirement plan with \ngrowth built on the stock market. A large percentage of their \ninvestments today are in oil and gas. So if we walk away from oil and \ngas development in the State of Colorado, we would severely impact the \nretirement incomes of many of our State employees.\n  We need to keep in mind how important oil and gas still is to the \neconomy\n\n[[Page S9455]]\n\nand to retirement benefits. There are mandates in States such as \nColorado that say you have to invest those dollars in those areas where \nyou can get a good return. So by law in the State of Colorado, they \nhave to invest in oil and gas companies because they have a good, safe \nreturn. That is probably going to be there for some time.\n  Clean coal, obviously, in Colorado and in the country remains \nimportant. Clean coal in Colorado is used to dilute the softer coals so \nthat mainly communities on the eastern seaboard can meet their air \npollution requirements. We still have a need for that very inexpensive \nsource of energy, and we should not ignore it.\n  There are proposals to convert oil to liquids, which is extremely \nimportant from a national defense standpoint. I know the Defense \nDepartment is looking at this kind of technology so they can have a \nreserve available in times of war or if, for some reason or other, this \ncountry's reserve should be disrupted, pretty much like the naval oil \nreserve we used to have in Colorado, which is now referred to as the \nRoan Plateau, where much of our oil shale is today.\n  Natural gas remains important. Again, we are giving in to the lower \ncarbons which burn very cleanly. Colorado State University, which I \nattended, is doing some remarkable research where they are growing \nalgae now that will grow and develop a diesel fuel. It is a biofuel. We \nhave a company in Berthoud, CO, to the south of where I live that has \ntaken the grease from restaurants and converted it to a diesel fuel. \nThis not only helps us get rid of a very problematic sort of discharge \nthat we have from restaurants, but it converts it into fuel. The \nexciting thing about this company is they can operate without \nsubsidies. To me, that is really exciting. I hope we can continue to \nget more companies of this nature to begin to work without having to \nlean on the Government for the subsidies.\n\n  We are all familiar with ethanol and how that has developed over \ntime. There is a lot that can be done. We have talked about \nhydrocarbons.\n  There is a lot that can be done in renewables. I see that development \nhappening in the State of Colorado.\n  We have communities that are using geothermal energy. This is where \nthey run pipes down into the ground. It provides either cooling and/or \nheating into a building structure. It takes a certain type of geology \nfor that technology to work, but there are many areas in this country \nwhere that can work. The environmental community doesn't like to talk \nabout hydroelectric power, but it is a renewable energy, and it is \nsomething we should not forget. There are times when it is very \napplicable to use hydroelectric power.\n  We have a large wind area in the Midwest involving Texas and Colorado \nand Wyoming and Montana, parts of Nebraska, Utah, Nevada. These areas \nare being looked at for wind technology. We have been hearing about it \nthroughout these debates.\n  Solar and hydrogen are two things that work well.\n  Obviously, we have legislation dealing with conservation and battery \ntechnology. Senator Bingaman talked about the Energy bill of 2005. We \npromoted all this to happen in that Energy bill.\n  I was extremely disappointed when last year's appropriations bill had \na rider in it that prevented us from developing Outer Continental Shelf \noil resources as well as oil shale in the State of Colorado. Oil shale \nin Colorado is one of the largest potential reserves we have of \nhydrocarbon fuel in the world. It is larger than all the known reserves \nin Saudi Arabia. We should not mark that off. When we start \ndisregarding sources of energy, we run the potential of breaking down \nthat bridge that we need from traditional fuels to where we need to be \nin the future with renewable sources.\n  Each year, we send over $700 billion overseas for fuel. Much of this \nmoney goes to nations that are on less than friendly terms with the \nUnited States. For both economic and national security reasons, \nachieving energy independence should be one of our top priorities.\n  Yesterday, the House of Representatives took a step in the right \ndirection by approving legislation which would repeal the moratorium on \noffshore drilling and on issuing oil shale regulations. This is an \nimportant step that Republicans in the House and Senate have been \nchampioning. Lifting the moratorium on the Outer Continental Shelf will \nallow access to an estimated 18 billion barrels of oil and 76 trillion \ncubic feet of natural gas. Lifting the moratorium on oil shale \nregulations moves us one step closer to being able to access an \nestimated 800 billion barrels of potentially recoverable oil. That is \nmore than the proven reserves, as I mentioned earlier, of Saudi Arabia. \nIt is one of the largest reserves in the world.\n\n  Taking these steps to increase our energy supply could not come at a \nbetter time. Families across America are struggling with high fuel \nprices. The cooler temperatures of fall are also making folks worry \nabout how the cost of home heating fuel is going to affect their \nability to make it through the winter.\n  As the Senate takes up the continuing resolution that was worked on \nby the House yesterday, I am hopeful my colleagues will consider this. \nI am not saying drilling is the only answer to our energy needs. As a \nfounder and cochair of the Senate renewable energy caucus, I know the \nimportance of using renewable energy. I was pleased the Senate passed \nlegislation yesterday that extended many important renewable energy tax \nincentives.\n  I am a strong supporter of renewable energy, but we are not at a \npoint yet where renewable energy can meet all our energy needs. We \nstill need fossil fuels, which is why I support removing the Outer \nContinental Shelf and oil shale moratoriums. With millions of Americans \nstruggling with high fuel prices, it is imperative that the Senate pass \na continuing resolution that does not contain these misguided \nmoratoria.\n  So I ask my colleagues to join me in working for a balanced energy \npolicy for this country that will not only help mean a more secure \nAmerica from a military aspect but also a more secure America from an \neconomic aspect. I urge my colleagues to join me in that effort in the \nclosing days of this session.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, while he is on the floor, I commend and \nthank the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Allard, for the great work he has \ndone on housing. I commend him also for his great leadership on all \naspects of energy. I join with him in recognizing the great \ncontributions of Chairman Bingaman, Senator Murkowski, and, of course, \nSenator Domenici. We will miss his guidance and his leadership. But he \nhas made a great contribution, and we are most appreciative.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for his \ncomments and recognize his leadership, particularly on housing issues, \nand I think he has some great ideas he is bringing forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9455-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9455-S9456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FINANCIAL CRISIS\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, America is facing a financial crisis, and \nlast night the President made the case for immediate action. It is \ncritical we act now to protect jobs in Missouri and throughout the \nNation. It is critical we act now to keep families' checking and \ncollege savings accounts safe. It is critical we act now to preserve \nseniors' retirements. It is critical we act now and eliminate this very \nreal threat to our economy. If we do not solve this crisis, families \nwill not be able to get home or car loans, employers will not get the \nday-to-day operating funds they need to meet payroll, the possibility \nof new jobs will grind to a halt as spending and investment stops.\n  To fail to act is not an option. We must act now, but we must act \nresponsibly. Any rescue plan Congress approves to stabilize our \nfinancial system must also increase accountability so we do not reward \nthose who put us in this situation. Any rescue plan Congress approves \nmust increase oversight so taxpayer dollars are protected and mistakes \nare not repeated. And any rescue plan Congress approves must increase \ntransparency so Americans can know their money is safe.\n  I have heard from folks in my home State of Missouri, and they want \ntheir Government to act now to keep this crisis from spreading from \nWall Street to Main Street. But the folks in Missouri also want to know \nwhat their\n\n[[Page S9456]]\n\nGovernment is going to do to protect their tax dollars.\n  I have heard from hundreds of Missourians, probably thousands, now \ncalling my office in DC, and in St. Louis, Kansas City, Cape Girardeau, \nColumbia, Springfield, and Jefferson City. All of these people want \naccountability.\n  They want to know their tax dollars are not going to be used to bail \nout irresponsible executives who got us into this mess to begin with. \nThese Missourians know that when they lose a lot of money at their \njobs, they lose their jobs and they do not get bonuses for doing it, \nwhich is why from the start I have been calling on the administration \nto eliminate golden parachutes--no tax dollars for fat severance \npackages for failed executives. I was glad to hear last night the \nPresident state he now agrees. This is an important step in crafting a \nresponsible plan.\n  I have also stressed that there must be independent oversight of how \nthe Treasury handles the credit we extend. I will not agree to hand \nover a blank check. I was pleased that the President now agrees there \nmust be oversight. That is another important step in crafting a \nresponsible plan. We also need to get taxpayer equity in participating \nfirms. Taxpayers should get something for their money.\n  Accountability and oversight, protecting taxpayer dollars--these are \nMain Street values. These are values that were absent on Wall Street \nwhen excessive greed and abuse of regulatory loopholes led to this \ncrisis. These are also values that were absent when investors entered \ninto investments they did not understand and some private citizens took \non debt they could not afford.\n  We must restore the Main Street values in Government, on Wall Street, \nand in our private lives. We must also restore bipartisanship. I have \ncome to the floor a number of times to urge my colleagues to work \ntogether across the aisle to solve this crisis for our Nation. Now is \nnot the time for partisan finger-pointing or partisan games. I have \nbeen disappointed to hear many speeches on the floor, with political \ntalking points and in the press. Now is the time for quick and \nresponsible bipartisan action that will stabilize our economy, protect \ntaxpayers, restore accountability, and increase oversight to prevent \nanother emergency in the future.\n  While it is critical that we act now to address the financial crisis, \nwe also must look to long-term reforms to prevent another crisis in the \nfuture. I have long been an advocate for stronger oversight of Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac and a critic of those who were moving too slow to \nimpose reforms of Fannie and Freddie. I have said there must be more \neffective oversight of GSEs.\n  But there is also another problem we need to address. I mentioned \nthat along with other things in the remarks I made last week, saying \nwhat changes need to be made by legislation and by administrative \naction and regulatory action.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bond pertaining to the introduction of S. 3581 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, last week we celebrated the 221st \nanniversary of the day in 1787 when 39 members of the Constitutional \nConvention signed the Constitution in Philadelphia. It is a sad fact, \nas we consider that anniversary, that for the past 7\\1/2\\ years, and \nespecially since 9/11, the Bush administration has treated the \nConstitution and the rule of law with a disrespect never before seen in \nthe history of this country.\n  By now, the public can be excused for being almost numb to new \nrevelations of Government wrongdoing and overreaching. The catalog is \nreally breathtaking, even when immensely complicated and far-reaching \nprograms and events are reduced to simple catch phrases: torture, \nGuantanamo, ignoring the Geneva Conventions, warrantless wiretapping, \ndata mining, destruction of e-mails, U.S. attorney firings, \nstonewalling of congressional oversight, abuse of the state secrets \ndoctrine and executive privilege, secret abrogation of Executive \norders, signing statements.\n  This is a shameful legacy that will haunt our country for years to \ncome. That is why I believe so strongly that the next President of the \nUnited States--whoever that may be--must pledge his commitment to \nrestoring the rule of law in this country and then take the necessary \nsteps to demonstrate that commitment. That is why, also, I held a \nhearing last week in the Constitution Subcommittee of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee asking a range of legal and historical experts \nexactly what the new President and the new Congress must do to repair \nthe damage done by the current administration to the rule of law.\n  There can be no dispute that the rule of law is central to our \ndemocracy and our system of government. But what does ``the rule of \nlaw'' really mean? Well, as Thomas Paine said, in 1776:\n\n       In America, the law is king.\n\n  That, of course, was a truly revolutionary concept at a time when, in \nmany places, the kings were the law. But more then 200 years later, we \nstill must struggle to fulfill Paine's simply stated vision. It is not \nalways easy, nor is it something that, once done, need not be carefully \nmaintained.\n  Justice Frankfurter wrote that law:\n\n       . . . .is an enveloping and permeating habituation of \n     behavior, reflecting the counsels of reason on the part of \n     those entrusted with power in reconciling the pressures of \n     conflicting interests. Once we conceive ``the rule of law'' \n     as embracing the whole range of presuppositions on which \n     government is conducted . . . , the relevant question is not, \n     has it been achieved, but, is it conscientiously and \n     systematically pursued.\n\n  The post-September 11 period is not, of course, the first time that \nthe checks and balances of our system of government have been placed \nunder great strain. As Berkeley law professors Daniel Farber and Anne \nJoseph O'Connell wrote in testimony submitted for the hearing on this \ntopic:\n\n       The greatest constitutional crisis in our history came with \n     the Civil War, which tested the nature of the Union, the \n     scope of presidential power, and the extent of liberty that \n     can survive in war time.\n\n  But as legal scholar Louis Fisher of the Library of Congress \ndescribed in his testimony, President Lincoln pursued a much different \napproach than our current President when he believed he needed to act \nin an extra-constitutional manner to save the Union. He acted openly, \nand sought Congress's participation and ultimately approval of his \nactions.\n  According to Dr. Fisher, Lincoln took actions we are all familiar \nwith, including withdrawing funds from the Treasury without an \nappropriation, calling up the troops, placing a blockade on the South, \nand suspending the writ of habeas corpus. In ordering those actions, \nLincoln never claimed to be acting legally or constitutionally and \nnever argued that Article II somehow allowed him to do what he did. \nInstead, Lincoln admitted to exceeding the constitutional boundaries of \nhis office and therefore needed the sanction of Congress. . . . He \nrecognized that the superior lawmaking body was Congress, not the \nPresident.\n  Now, of course, each era brings its own challenges to the \nconscientious and systematic pursuit of the rule of law. How the \nleaders of our government respond to those challenges at the time they \noccur is, of course, critical. But recognizing that leaders do not \nalways perform perfectly, that not every President is an Abraham \nLincoln, the years that follow a crisis are perhaps even more \nimportant. As Yale Law School Dean Harold Koh testified at the hearing:\n\n       As difficult as the last 7 years have been, they loom far \n     less important in the grand scheme of things than the next 8, \n     which will determine whether the pendulum of U.S. policy \n     swings back from the extreme place to which it has been \n     pushed, or stays stuck in a `new normal' position under which \n     our policies toward national security, law, and human rights \n     remain wholly subsumed by the `War on Terror.'\n\n  I could not agree more.\n  So the obvious question is: Where do we go from here? One of the most \nimportant things that the next President must do, whoever he may be, is \ntake concrete steps to restore the rule of\n\n[[Page S9457]]\n\nlaw in this country. He must make sure that the excesses of this \nadministration don't become so ingrained in our system that they change \nthe very notion of what the law is. And he must recognize that we can \nprotect our national security--in fact, we can do it more effectively--\nwithout trampling on the rights of the American people or the rule of \nlaw.\n  That, of course, is much easier said than done. But there is one \nimmediate step that, while it may be viewed as symbolic, is critically \nimportant for the next President to take: stating clearly and \nunequivocally in the inaugural address that he renounces the current \nadministration's abuses of executive power and that his administration \nwill uphold the rule of law. To be sure, this isn't the only subject \nthe new president should address, but it is among the most urgent. \nWhere he stands on executive power goes beyond policy and politics and \nspeaks to his respect for the Constitution itself. And a willingness to \nraise this issue in the inaugural address will send a message, loud and \nclear, to the American public, to Congress and to every level of \ngovernment that the days of lawlessness and excess are over.\n  Thomas Jefferson said this in his first inaugural address:\n\n       The essential principles of our Government form the bright \n     constellation which has gone before us and guided our steps \n     through an age of revolution and reformation . . . [S]hould \n     we wander from them in moments of error or of alarm, let us \n     hasten to retrace our steps and to regain the road which \n     alone leads to peace, liberty and safety.\n\n  I hope our next President will echo that sentiment in his inaugural \naddress. Indeed, demonstrating that commitment on day one will go a \nlong way toward reinstating what Ohio State University Law Professor \nPeter Shane called a ``rule of law culture'' in government. As he \nexplained in his hearing testimony:\n\n       The written documents of law have to be buttressed by a set \n     of norms, conventional expectations, and routine behaviors \n     that lead officials to behave as if they are accountable to \n     the public interest and to legitimate sources of legal and \n     political authority at all times, even when the written rules \n     are ambiguous and even when they could probably get away with \n     merely self-serving behavior.\n\n  This cuts to the core of the problem that the next President will \nface: After 8 years of disregard for the rule of law at the highest \nlevel of government, how can we instill new norms and expectations \nthroughout the Federal Government? Stating that commitment in the \ninaugural address will go a long way in that direction.\n  But it is not only a matter of a new President saying: Ok, I won't do \nthat anymore. This President's transgressions are so deep and the \ndamage to our system of government so extensive that a concerted effort \nfrom the executive and legislative branches will be needed. And that \nmeans the new President will, in some respects, have to go against his \ninstitutional interests--a challenge that we cannot underestimate.\n  That is why I called the hearing last week on this topic--to hear \nfrom legal and historical experts on how the next President should go \nabout tackling the wreckage that this President will leave behind. I \nasked witnesses to be forward-looking--not to simply review what has \ngone wrong in the past 7 or 8 years, but to address very specifically \nwhat needs to be set right starting next year and how to go about doing \nit. In addition to the testimony of the witnesses at the hearing, I \nsolicited written testimony from advocates, law professors, historians \nand other experts. I was pleased that we received nearly 30 written \nsubmissions from a host of national groups and distinguished \nindividuals.\n  At the hearing, we heard testimony from one of the foremost legal \nscholars in the country about just how far outside mainstream legal \nthought the current administration went. We heard comparisons to the \nevents leading up to the Church Committee's investigation in the 1970s, \nfrom the man who served as chief counsel to that committee. We heard \nfrom a former Republican Member of Congress about Congress's failure to \nassert itself as a coequal branch of government. We heard from the \nformer head of the Justice Department's office of legal counsel about \nthe perversion of the law that was allowed to occur in that important \noffice. We heard from a former White House chief of staff about the \ndangers of the excessive executive secrecy that permeated the \ngovernment under this administration. We heard from a leading national \nsecurity lawyer about the harm that post-9/11 domestic surveillance \npolicies have done to our national security. And we heard from the head \nof one of the leading human rights organizations about the damage our \ninterrogation and detention policies have done to our reputation \nabroad.\n  But most importantly, we heard from every one of these individuals \ntheir specific prescriptions for moving beyond these mistakes--for \ntaking the steps that are necessary to restore our core American \nprinciples.\n  Indeed, between the hearing witnesses and the written testimony that \nwas submitted, the subcommittee received an enormous number of \nrecommendations, including many provocative and important ideas. They \nrange from the general to the very specific, and they cover a variety \nof subject matters, from government secrecy to detention and \ninterrogation policy to surveillance to separation of powers. I am very \npleased that so many experts took the time to offer these proposals.\n  Let me take a few minutes today to share some examples of the kinds \nof recommendations that the witnesses provided, both those who \ntestified at the hearing and those who submitted written testimony. \nSeveral suggestions reinforce my belief that the new administration \nmust set a clear tone of adherence to the rule of law from the start. \nMark Agrast of the Center for American Progress Action Fund suggests \nthat the President should convene a White House conference on the rule \nof law, and pledge to work with Congress to give priority to measures \nto restore public confidence in the rule of law. Former Solicitor \nGeneral Walter Dellinger argues that:\n\n       [T]he next President should . . . affirmatively adopt a \n     view of presidential power that recognizes the roles and \n     authorities of all three co-equal branches and that takes \n     account of settled judicial precedent.\n\n  Many of our witnesses are concerned about the impact of the last 8 \nyears on the separation of powers, and specifically about Congress's \nfailure to stand up to the president as he asserted more and more \nunconstrained power. Several strongly suggest oversight and \ninvestigative hearings to determine what exactly happened. Frederick \nSchwarz of the Brennan Center suggests an independent, bipartisan, \ninvestigatory commission to assess what has gone wrong and what has \ngone right with the Nation's policies concerning terrorism. Such a \ncommission would allow the public to get the full story of the abuses \nof the Bush administration, providing accountability and a mechanism \nfor developing protections against future abuse that can be implemented \nby the executive and legislative branches. The ACLU suggests more \nnarrowly focused oversight hearings in Congress to reveal illegal or \nimproper executive branch activity, and argues that Congress must deny \nfunding for programs it believes are abusive or illegal.\n  Former Congressman Mickey Edwards, a Republican from Oklahoma, also \nargues that Congress must use the power of the purse to assert its will \nin interbranch disagreements. He believes that Congress should \naggressively utilize its subpoena power to get the information it \nneeds. Being able to enforce congressional subpoenas, of course, is an \nimportant component of oversight, and several witnesses had suggestions \non that topic. Common Cause believes that the next president should \nissue an Executive order mandating Federal agencies' complete \ncooperation with congressional investigations. University of \nPennsylvania Law Professor Seth Kreimer argues that officials who \nignored legitimate congressional subpoenas should be prosecuted. The \nCenter for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington suggests that \nCongress enact legislation granting jurisdiction to the Federal courts \nover cases seeking enforcement of congressional subpoenas. And Bruce \nFein, a former Reagan administration official, believes a special \nthree-judge court should be created that could appoint an independent \ncounsel to enforce contempt findings against the executive branch since \nthe Department of Justice refused to enforce congressional subpoenas \nduring this administration.\n\n[[Page S9458]]\n\n  Many of the suggestions from our witnesses focus on the \ndecisionmaking of our national security agencies. Stephen Aftergood of \nthe Federation of American Scientists suggests enhancing oversight of \nintelligence agencies by using cleared auditors from the GAO. And Mark \nAgrast advocates establishing a national security law committee within \nthe National Security Council to make decisions on legal issues related \nto national security.\n  A crucial part of restoring the rule of law in the next \nadministration will be rebuilding the reputation of the office of legal \ncounsel. Walter Dellinger, joined by a prestigious group of former OLC \nattorneys, provided detailed testimony on how that can be done. The \nincoming attorney general should pay very close heed to this advice.\n  Another issue that almost every person or group mentioned in their \nsubmissions is the problem of excessive government secrecy. This \nproblem permeates all of the other rule of law issues discussed at the \nhearing. When the executive branch invokes the state secrets privilege \nto shut down lawsuits, hides its programs behind secret OLC opinions, \noverclassifies information to avoid public disclosure, and interprets \nthe Freedom of Information Act as an information withholding statute, \nit shuts down all of the means to detect and respond to its abuses of \nthe rule of law--whether those abuses involve torture, domestic spying, \nor the firing of U.S. attorneys for partisan gain.\n  With regard to this administration's overuse of the state secrets \nprivilege, University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey Stone and many \nothers recommend that Congress pass S. 2533, the State Secrets \nProtection Act, which was reported out of the Judiciary Committee in \nApril. The bill takes the simple and obvious step of requiring courts \nto review allegedly privileged documents to determine whether they \nreally are privileged.\n  To address the rampant problem of overclassification, several \nsubmissions, including that of John Podesta from the Center for \nAmerican Progress Action Fund, urge the next President to rewrite the \nexecutive order on classification to reverse some of the changes made \nby President Bush to that order. In particular, President Bush \neliminated provisions that established a presumption against \nclassification in cases of significant doubt, that permitted senior \nagency officials to declassify information in exceptional cases where \nthe public interest in disclosure outweighs the need to protect the \ninformation, and that prohibited reclassification of materials that \nhave been released to the public. Contributors argue that these \nprovisions be restored.\n  On the issue of secret OLC opinions and other manifestations of \nsecret law, there is general agreement that legislation is needed to \nrequire greater disclosure of the law under which the executive branch \noperates. A number of submissions recommend the passage of 2 bills I \nintroduced this year: the Executive Order Integrity Act, which requires \nthe president to publish notice in the Federal Register when revoking \nor modifying a published Executive order, and the OLC Reporting Act, \nwhich requires the Attorney General to report to Congress when the \nDepartment of Justice concludes that the executive branch is not bound \nby a statute.\n  Finally, the National Security Archive and others address the proper \nstandard for disclosure of information under the Freedom of Information \nAct. Attorney General Reno issued a memorandum in 1993 that contained a \n``presumption of disclosure'': even if a document was technically \nexempt from disclosure under FOIA, the Department of Justice would \ndefend the withholding only if disclosure would actually harm an \ninterest protected by the exemption. Attorney General Ashcroft reversed \nthat presumption in 2001. Contributors uniformly recommend that the new \nadministration immediately restore the presumption of disclosure.\n  The subcommittee also received numerous recommendations for reforming \nour detention and interrogation policy. Detailed plans for \naccomplishing the difficult task of closing the detention facility at \nGuantanamo Bay were presented by Elisa Massimino of Human Rights First, \nby the Center for Strategic and International Studies, by Harold Koh, \nand by a group of 20 leading scholars. There is near- universal \nagreement that Guantanamo should be closed. These thoughtful proposals \ndeserve careful consideration. A number of groups also recommend \ndismantling the current system of military commissions, and instead \ntrying terrorist suspects in U.S. courts or military courts-martial.\n  With respect to interrogation practices, Princeton's Deborah \nPearlstein and others argue that the U.S. Government should have a \nsingle, government-wide standard of humane detainee treatment. \nMassimino suggests that the President and the Congress should invest in \nefforts to pursue the most effective and humane means of intelligence \ngathering. And Harold Koh emphasizes the importance of fully complying \nwith obligations under the Geneva Conventions and the Convention \nAgainst Torture.\n\n  And finally, a number of recommendations were made on government \nsurveillance and privacy issues. National security lawyer Suzanne \nSpaulding argues that the next administration should undertake a \ncomprehensive review of domestic intelligence activities and \nauthorities, to assess their effectiveness and to ensure that they \nsupport, rather than undermine, the rule of law. She points to a number \nof key issues for review, many of which were also mentioned in other \nsubmissions as issues where changes need to be made.\n  These include the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the \nrelated amendments made this summer; national security letters and \nother Patriot Act authorities; the first amendment implications of \ndomestic spying activities; data mining and other data collection and \nanalysis activities; profiling in the name of counterterrorism; the \nappropriate role of the many Federal, State and local entities that are \nnow involved in domestic intelligence gathering; and the need to \nenhance transparency and oversight in all of these areas. This is a \nlong list, but Spaulding argues that too many of these powers were \ncreated piecemeal, without consideration of how they fit together and \nwithout adequate consideration for the need to respect civil liberties.\n  This is just a sampling of the careful and interesting proposals that \nthe subcommittee received. Taken together, these recommendations should \nserve as an excellent source for both branches of government. While I \nam not at this ge time going to propose a specific plan of action to \nthe next President or the next Congress, I am reviewing the legislative \nproposals that have been submitted, and I hope my colleagues will take \nadvantage of them as well. I thank each and every person who made the \neffort to submit these recommendations. They have done this country a \nreal service.\n  In January, I intend to present the full hearing record to the new \nPresident, and urge him to take specific actions to restore the rule of \nlaw. These recommendations should serve as a blueprint for the new \nPresident so that he can get started right away on this immense and \nextremely important job of restoring the rule of law.\n  It will not be easy. Even those steps that are almost universally \nagreed upon, such as the necessity of closing the facility at \nGuantanamo Bay, pose tricky legal and practical questions. And, of \ncourse, there may be institutional resistance within the executive \nbranch to actions that are viewed as ceding power to the other branches \nof government, no matter how unprecedented the executive power theories \nthat need to be undone. But as Suzanne Spaulding explained at the \nhearing:\n\n       We have to demonstrate that we still believe what our \n     founders understood; that this system of checks and balances \n     and respect for civil liberties is not a luxury of peace and \n     tranquility but was created in a time of great peril as the \n     best hope for keeping this nation strong and resilient.\n\n  This is an important point, because the polices pursued by this \nadministration have not kept this Nation ``strong and resilient.'' They \nhave undermined national unity, diminished our international standing \nand alliances, and hurt our efforts to counter the serious threat we \nface from al-Qaida and its affiliates. By putting policies in place \nthat accord with basic American principles, we can strengthen our \nnational security as well.\n  As I said at the outset, it is the years that follow a crisis that \nmay matter\n\n[[Page S9459]]\n\nmost, that are the true test of the strength of our democracy. So I \nhope that the next President will carefully review the many \nrecommendations that have been presented, because the future of our \ndemocracy depends on it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before the Senate is important legislation I \nintroduced months ago to extend for 5 years the authority of the U.S. \nSupreme Court Police to protect Supreme Court Justices when they leave \nthe Supreme Court grounds. Senator Specter cosponsored this measure \nwith me. We have extended the Court police's authority to protect \nJustices before, the last time in 2004. This authority expires at the \nend of this year.\n  This is exactly the type of bill that should pass by unanimous \nconsent without delay. I hotlined the bill and it was cleared on the \nDemocratic side of the Senate for passage months ago, but I was told \nthat there was a Republican objection. Although I would prefer to pass \nthis measure clean, Senator Kyl has insisted on adding an amendment. I \nwill consent to this amendment because this bill needs to pass to \nextend the Supreme Court police's authority. The time for passage is \nnow, without further delay.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 5057 and the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5057) to reauthorize the Debbie Smith DNA \n     Backlog Grant Program, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will pass the \nreauthorization of the Debbie Smith Act. I want to thank Senator Biden \nfor his leadership in the Senate in supporting this important program, \nand I was pleased to work with him and others, as I have before, to \nensure that the Debbie Smith grant program is given the authorization \nto continue its vital work.\n  I should take this opportunity to thank Debbie Smith for her courage \nand for the tireless efforts of her and her husband, Rob, on behalf of \nrape victims. In her own case, DNA testing led to the arrest and \nconviction of her attacker, but the backlog of rape kits waiting to be \ntested forced her to endure an excruciating wait before the culprit \ncould be found and justice could be done. The legislation that she \ninspired and worked so hard to pass aims to ensure that other victims \ndo not have to live in fear through a long and unnecessary delay.\n  In 2004, after years of work, Congress passed a significant package \nof criminal justice reforms known as the Justice for All Act, which \nsubstantially increased Federal resources available to State and local \ngovernments to combat crime with DNA technology. The Debbie Smith DNA \nBacklog Grant Program was a key component of that legislation. I worked \nhard for years to try to get the Debbie Smith Act passed, and I was \nthrilled in 2004 to finally be able to call Debbie to tell her that our \nhard work had paid off. I have pushed every year since for full funding \nof this crucial program.\n  As DNA testing moved to the front lines of the war on crime, forensic \nlaboratories nationwide experienced a significant increase in their \ncaseloads, both in number and complexity. Funding simply did not keep \npace with this increasing demand, and forensic labs nationwide became \nseriously bottlenecked.\n  Backlogs have seriously impeded the use of DNA testing in solving \ncases without suspects--and reexamining cases in which there are strong \nclaims of innocence--as labs are required to give priority status to \nthose cases in which a suspect is known. Solely for lack of funding, \ncritical evidence remains untested while rapists and killers remain at \nlarge.\n  The Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program has given States help they \ndesperately needed, and continue to need, to carry out DNA analyses of \nbacklogged evidence. It has provided a strong starting point in \naddressing this serious problem, but much work remains to be done \nbefore we conquer these inexcusable backlogs. That is why I so strongly \nsupport reauthorization of this vital program.\n  Some in both Chambers have expressed a desire to expand and improve \nthis program and other DNA testing programs. I share those goals and \nwill work with others to pursue them next year. It is very important, \nthough, that we reauthorize the Debbie Smith program now, when we can \nand should, and turn to more difficult tasks in the next Congress when \nwe will be able to give them the attention they require.\n  This reauthorization bill authorizes $755 million over the next 5 \nyears to reduce the current backlog of unanalyzed DNA samples in the \nNation's crime labs. I am glad that the Senate has passed it, and I \nhope the House promptly passes this version of the bill, and the \nPresident promptly signs it. I hope too that Congress fully funds this \nimportant program.\n  I want to make one point on the issue of rape kit testing, which this \nlegislation does so much to promote and which Debbie Smith has worked \nso hard to make available for all victims of horrendous attacks. No \nvictim should ever be required to pay the cost of a rape kit. \nCollecting and testing evidence from serious crimes is a responsibility \nour Government and our community bears, and it should never be seen as \na revenue source for cities and towns. It appalls me that any official \nin any community would condone such a practice, and I hope it will \nstop.\n  I congratulate Debbie and Rob Smith on this key step toward the \nreauthorization of this important program, and I look forward to \nworking with them to continue to find ways to protect women, assist \ncrime victims, and bring criminals to justice.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Biden \nsubstitute amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to, the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and passed; the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; and any \nstatements related to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Senate's \npassage of the Methamphetamine Production Prevention Act. This is \nlegislation I introduced with my colleague Senator Grassley to make it \neasier for law enforcement to keep track of purchases of the \ningredients needed to produce methamphetamine. I am pleased that the \nSenate has passed this important legislation by unanimous consent, and \nI urge the House of Representatives to act quickly to take up and pass \nthe bill.\n  For years, the manufacture and use of methamphetamine have plagued \nfamilies and communities across Illinois and throughout the Nation. \nCurrent Federal law limits the amount of meth precursor drug products \nthat a person can buy and requires pharmacies to keep a written or \nelectronic logbook recording each sale of a precursor product. The \npoint of these logbooks is to keep track of individuals' purchases so \nthey cannot buy amounts that exceed the limit. The only real reason to \npurchase over-the-limit quantities of these products is for meth \nproduction. So current law limits bulk purchases and requires \nrecordkeeping of transactions.\n  Unfortunately, meth makers have figured out how to avoid these limits \nby ``smurfing.'' This is the practice of buying meth precursor products \nin quantities above the limit by traveling to multiple pharmacies that \nkeep written logbooks and buying legal amounts at each one. It is \ndifficult and time-consuming for law enforcement investigators to find \nthese meth ``smurfs'' when the investigators have to go to each \npharmacy and flip through the paper logbooks to try to spot individual \nnames. According to Illinois law enforcement authorities, smurfing now \naccounts for at least 90 percent of the pseudoephedrine used to make \nmeth in Illinois.\n  The Methamphetamine Production Prevention Act will help wipe out \n``smurfing'' by making it easier for retailers to use electronic \nlogbook systems that can monitor sales of meth precursor products and \nidentify individuals who are illegally stockpiling those precursors. \nWhen retailers collect their logbook information electronically and \nmake that information accessible to law enforcement, that information \ncan be used to identify and prosecute ``smurfs'' and meth cooks.\n  The Methamphetamine Production Prevention Act corrects several \ntechnical hurdles in current Federal law that are prohibiting more \nwidespread use of electronic logbook systems. For example, the bill \ngives retailers who use electronic logbook systems the option of \ncollecting purchaser signatures on paper, as long as those signatures \ncan be clearly linked to the rest of the sale information that is \ncaptured electronically. This will provide tremendous cost savings for \nretailers without hurting law enforcement efforts. Also, the bill \npermits retailers to enter into their logbook system data about the \nproduct name and quantity sold through electronic data capture \ntechnology such as a bar code reader. This will help to speed up \ntransactions, and will help avoid transcription errors in the logbook \nrecords.\n  Further, this legislation permits a retailer, rather than a \npurchaser, to enter the purchaser's name and address and the date and \ntime of sale into the logbook system. It is difficult to design an \nelectronic logbook system where the purchaser is the one who ``enters'' \nhis or her name, address, and the date and time of sale, as is required \nunder current law. My bill permits the retailer to input that \ninformation, and then the purchaser must verify that the inputted \ninformation is correct, for example by orally confirming the \ninformation that the retail clerk reads back to the purchaser. The bill \nwould also permit this information to be captured through electronic \ncapture technology, such as a bar code reader or a software program \nthat records the date and time.\n  If we increase the use of electronic logbook systems, we will put a \nstop to ``smurfing'' and cut off the flow of precursor chemicals that \nsupply meth labs in Illinois and throughout the country. That is why \nlaw enforcement agencies such as the National Narcotics Officers' \nAssociations' Coalition, the National Criminal Justice Association, the \nNational Sheriffs' Association, and the National District Attorneys \nAssociation want this legislation to become law. My staff and I have \nalso worked with the retail pharmacy community and the drug \nmanufacturer community on this legislation, and I am pleased that my \nbill has received the endorsement of the National Association of Chain \nDrug Stores and the Consumer Healthcare Products Association. I also \nwant to commend and thank Illinois attorney general Lisa Madigan and\n\n[[Page S9463]]\n\nSteve Mange, the head of the Illinois Meth Project, for their \nassistance in crafting this legislation.\n  I thank my colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, for his leadership \non this issue and Senators Harkin, Bayh, Biden, Cantwell, Clinton, \nConrad, Feinstein, Johnson, Lincoln, McCaskill, Murkowski, Obama, and \nSchumer for their cosponsorship.\n  The production of methamphetamine has plagued our communities for far \ntoo long, and this legislation takes a critical step to stop it. I \nthank my colleagues in the Senate for the unanimous passage of this \nimportant bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9463-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, we are working this week, many of us \nworking very hard this week--none harder than my friend and senior \ncolleague from Rhode Island, Jack Reed--to address a paroxysm in the \nfinancial markets, one that has been a long time coming. During that \nlong time, people in Washington, over and over, missed opportunities to \nprevent it. Make no mistake, this whole episode we are going through \nnow was preventable. This is a human failure not some natural disaster, \nnot economic inevitability. A political sellout to financial interests, \na sellout given intellectual cover by a toxic ideology of deregulation \nappears to be at the heart of what happened. I was not here to see it, \nbut all the clues point to that.\n  This crisis is now past preventing. We have to fix it. It is a shame \non those responsible that it happened in the first place, but it is a \nshame on all of us if we do not learn its lesson because there is more \nto come.\n  In his famous ``Give Me Liberty Or Give Me Death'' speech, Patrick \nHenry also noted:\n\n       We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and \n     listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into \n     beasts.\n\n  We should heed these words from the earliest days of our democracy \nand not shut our eyes to the painful truth of what has happened and not \nshut our eyes to the painful truths that still lie before us. Folks \nhere have too often told Americans what they want to hear and too \nrarely told them what they need to know.\n  There is no painful truth that Americans cannot deal with; there is \nnothing Americans cannot solve--but not if we are not told what we need \nto know. So we are now borrowing $700 billion because people here \nrefused to face a painful truth about our financial markets, about the \nfolly of deregulation. But that is just one of many painful, in some \ncases inconvenient, truths that we confront today.\n  I remember sitting with the Presiding Officer, the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota, in the Environment and Public Works Committee \nhearing the president of the Association of Health Directors of all the \nStates and territories across the Nation deliver the unanimous \nstatement of that association on global warming. It was a strong \nstatement, a stern and sobering statement. But most important, it was \nunanimous. Yet in this Chamber some still ignore or deny the painful \ntruth of the changes befalling our planet.\n  Our capacity for denial, for artifice, and for self-delusion has \nbecome dangerous. Phony doubts about global warming may hide the facts \nof our planet's condition from our people, but the Earth doesn't care \nabout doubts. She will behave the way nature dictates, and the \nconsequences will be on all of us.\n  Phony theories of deregulation may have obscured the facts of the \nfinancial markets from us, but the markets don't care about our \ntheories. If we let them come to failure, they will fail. And now the \nconsequences are on all of us.\n  The painful experiences we are going through today are, for the Bush \nadministration, a rendezvous with reality. It is not the only one we \nhave coming, if we don't begin to govern in a reality-based \nenvironment.\n  The $7.7 trillion debt that George W. Bush has run up as President--\nthere will be a rendezvous with reality on that. The $34 trillion \nMedicare liability, which is just one symptom of our bloated and \nunstable health care system--there will be a rendezvous with reality on \nthat. The $740 billion annual trade deficit the United States of \nAmerica is running--there will be a rendezvous with reality on that. An \nenergy policy that hemorrhages $600 billion a year to oil-producing \ncountries and puts us on the losing end of the biggest wealth transfer \nin the history of humankind, all to keep big oil happy--there will be a \nrendezvous with reality on that. There will be a rendezvous with \nreality on the tons of carbon and greenhouse gases we are pumping into \nour thin and delicate atmosphere. These rendezvous with reality will \ncome.\n  The only question for us is on what terms will we meet them. We can \ndecide: Will we be prepared or be caught flat-footed? Will we tackle \nproblems while they are still manageable or wait until they overwhelm \nus? Will we address difficulty or face calamity? These are choices of \nours and they pose the question, Are we capable of reality-based \ngoverning.\n  I ask these questions because there is a common narrative through all \nthese problems, and it is a perilous one to our democracy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I would like, through the Chair, to ask my friend from \nRhode Island if I can ask a unanimous consent?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

I applaud the majority leader for the enormous, hard, \nsuccessful work he is doing in these hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Democracy as an institution will not do well if we \nare all satisfied to be told what we want to hear and not what we need \nto know. Democracy will not address problems well if our elected \nleaders traffic in ideology instead of respecting reality. Reality \nbites hard when she is ignored. Democracy will not flourish if leaders \ntout for special interests instead of fighting for the public interest.\n  Democracy will suffer a terrible blow when the days of reckoning \ncome, when the rendezvous with reality occurs and our people, \nparticularly our young people, turn to us and say: How could you? How \ncould you not have warned us? How could you not have been square with \nus? How could you have been so irresponsible?\n\n[[Page S9464]]\n\n  As elected officials, we have a trust and we had better begin to \nhonor it. So as we grapple with the proposal for the biggest bailout in \nhistory, a $700 billion patch on Wall Street and our credit market, \nwhat do we look for next? What is the next wave that will hit? Well, I \nfear the next internal wave we face could be credit card debt.\n  We have 115 million households in America. They have 1.2 billion \ncredit cards; 115 million households in America with 1.2 billion credit \ncards. The total credit card debt that Americans will carry by the end \nof this year will likely be $1 trillion.\n  To put that in context, our international gross domestic product is \nonly $14 trillion. With that many cards in use and that much debt piled \nup, we now have a pretty fixed pool of credit card borrowers out there. \nThis is not an expanding market. The Bush economy has stressed this \npool of borrowers and stressed them hard.\n  The average middle-class family under age 55 makes $2,000 less than \nwhen George W. Bush took office. Their average family expenses have \nincreased by $4,600 since George W. Bush took office. If you add the \ntwo together, the average middle-class family is $6,600 a year worse \noff after 8 years of Republican misrule.\n  So they are stressed. They are not whiners, as Senator Gramm, one of \nthe Presidential candidate's campaign advisers, said, and the economy \naround them is not fundamentally sound, as one of our Presidential \ncandidates has busily been telling Americans until it had become too \npreposterous to continue saying it.\n  So what happens to these stressed families? Well, the credit card \ncompanies see a family stressed, and they see them as a worse credit \nrisk, so they raise their interest rates and they impose steep \npenalties and fees. It is an industry where when you are down, they \nmake it even worse for you.\n  So now the family is more stressed. So they fall more behind, and a \nvicious cycle emerges. Another vicious cycle operates right alongside. \nOne credit card company finds a new dirty trick to gouge the consumer, \nso they make more money. Investors and competitors see them making more \nmoney, and in a market economy, capital goes to the highest rate of \nreturn.\n  So now all the other credit card companies have to copy them to \ncompete. So that credit card agreement gets more and more pages, longer \nand longer, more tricks to hit you with fees, penalties, and rate \nhikes. They get more devious and complex, and nobody can get off that \nmerry-go-round, because if they try, they will lose their competitive \nposition to the worst of the lot.\n  So you have two vicious cycles and they converge and together they \ncan drive credit card debt in only one direction. The tricks and traps \nand rate increases and penalties and fees get worse and worse, driven \nby the jungle force of competition among the credit card companies. \nStruggling families see credit costs rising ever higher, driving them \nfurther and further underwater, with no end in sight.\n  There is no present mechanism to interrupt these gathering forces. \nNow, in a reality-based mode of governing, prudent men and women would \ndo something. There should be consequences when abusive lenders take \nadvantage of families in difficult circumstances.\n  This summer our majority whip, Senator Dick Durbin from Illinois, and \nI introduced the Consumer Credit Fairness Act, legislation that would \nprovide a powerful incentive for loan companies to keep their rates and \nfees at reasonable levels and would give borrowers leverage to \nnegotiate better terms. It would interrupt the vicious cycle.\n  But more can be done. For generations, for generations in this \ncountry, the 50 States had the power to enforce their own what were \ncalled usury laws, laws that limited the amount of interest that could \nbe charged to fair and nonabusive levels, and they were able to enforce \ntheir usury laws against anyone. They were their citizens and they \ncould protect them.\n  Then, in 1978, in a fairly narrow decision, construing the National \nBanking Act, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Marquette v. First Bank of \nOmaha and decided that States could only set limits on the interest \nrates and fees charged by in-state credit card companies.\n  So what do you expect would happen? Predictably, credit card \ncompanies began moving to States with the weakest lending laws, with \nthe worst consumer protections, setting off what has become a race to \nthe bottom among credit card companies, all at the expense of \nconsumers.\n  I intend to propose that we restore to our sovereign States the \nrights they historically enjoyed for two centuries, to set limits on \nthe interest rates and fees charged to their own citizens. It does not \nseem like asking a lot. I will soon be introducing legislation to \naccomplish this. I encourage my colleagues to try to help me bring this \nto reality.\n  If we simply reempower the States to protect their own citizens from \nunscrupulous lending practices, we can end the confluence of these two \nvicious cycles before this situation, too, gets out of hand.\n  While the current economic crisis gives us this moment of clarity, \nthis moment of reality, this moment of reality-based governing, while \nthis $700 billion rendezvous with reality has our attention, before we \nrevert to claims that the No. 1 issue facing the United States is to \ndrill for more oil or whatever we get back to, while we have a moment \nof honest focus, this is our chance to get ahead of one of these \nproblems.\n  We will still have the $7.7 trillion Bush debt to deal with, we will \nstill have the $34 trillion Medicare debt to deal with, we will still \nhave the $734 trillion trade deficit to deal with, we will still have \nour energy hemorrhage to deal with, and we will still have global \nwarming to deal with, to name a few.\n  But let's get ahead of this one. Let's not mess up this one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, earlier today I spoke on the floor \nabout the impending financial difficulties we are facing and the issues \nbefore us. I come back not to repeat those remarks at all but, rather, \nin this time of turmoil and stress, to recognize that all of us as \nAmericans, and Georgians in my State, in times of difficulty turn to \nthose institutions of faith and family that give them strength.\n  In Georgia, in the fall, there is another institution that gives us \nstrength, the University of Georgia football, the Southeastern \nConference, and a man named Larry Munson. On Monday of this week, Larry \nMunson, at the age of 86, announced his retirement, after 43 years as \nthe voice of the Georgia Bulldogs.\n  He first started in Wyoming, moved to Tennessee, and in 1962, the \nAtlanta Braves brought him to Atlanta to be the first announcer when \nthe franchise moved from Milwaukee. In 1996, Joel Eaves, the athletic \ndirector, asked him to come to Athens. He became an institution not \njust in Athens, not just in the Southeastern Conference but of \nannouncers around the world.\n  He is in the company of Chris Schenkel, Frank Jackson, and those \nfamous voices all of us have known in sports. But more than anything \nelse, Larry Munson coined phrases that now are listed in dictionaries \nand history books for their uniqueness.\n  In 1981, when the University of Georgia upset Tennessee in Knoxville, \nTN, on the last play of the game, he talked about how his ``Bulldogs \nhad stepped on and crushed the Tennessee faces just like they had on a \nhobnailed boot.''\n  In 1982, when Georgia won the Southeastern Conference in Auburn, it \nwas Larry Munson who declared that ``sugar was falling from the skies'' \nas Georgia got an invitation to go to the Sugar Bowl.\n  Probably the most memorable, in 1980, when Herschel Walker, then a \nfreshman, scored his first touchdown of a storied career in college, \nLarry Munson replied, as he announced the run: My goodness, he is \nrunning over people. He ran right through people. And, oh, my goodness, \nhe is only a freshman.\n  These and so many more have endeared Larry Munson to the people of \nGeorgia, the Southeastern Conference, and collegiate gate football. So \non this day in the Senate, as all of us seek\n\n[[Page S9465]]\n\ncomfort in those things we appreciate, love, and admire, I wish to \nexpress my appreciation to Larry Munson and the contributions he has \nmade to athletics in our State and to the University of Georgia and \nwish him the very best in the years to come.\n  God bless you, Larry.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today with a heart that is not \ntotally joyful because I am going to be talking about four of my \ncolleagues who are leaving the Senate. Pretty soon, I will be talking \nabout my own leaving the Senate but not today. I will save that for \nanother day. The first one I want to talk about is John Warner of \nVirginia. I have gotten to know him and his wife Jeanne.\n  It is with great pride and honor that I pay tribute to my friend and \ndistinguished colleague from the Commonwealth of Virginia, Senator John \nWarner. He served in this body for 30 years; I have served for 36. So \nthe arithmetic is simple: I have been with him for all of his 30 years \nin the Senate. He dealt almost exclusively, and with perfection, on \nmilitary matters. I did the budget for the Senate for a long time, and \nI have been privileged to work for the last 5 years on energy matters. \nIn between, it was nothing but joy on my part to work on matters of the \nSenate. I believe the same was true for John Warner, who not only \nworked in military matters and worried about our troops, but he also \nfrom time to time got over into public works.\n  Early in his Senate career, Senator Warner and I served on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. More recently, our work \ntogether has centered on defense and national security and, as I \nindicated, of late homeland security.\n  He earned the respect of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nbecause of his unique ability to negotiate and foster positive working \nrelationships with fellow Senators. There was much being said about \nworking across the aisle and being bipartisan. Clearly, when things had \nto be partisan because it was the nature of things, John Warner was a \npartisan. But obviously, when it was a matter that pertained to \nsomething that could be worked out between Democrats and Republicans, \none could bet that he was quick to raise his hand and lift it across \nthe aisle and work with Senators from the other side.\n  He has been a leader on a broad range of issues. As I indicated, he \nis someone who makes me proud.\n  Prior to his five terms in the Senate, John served his country as a \nUnited States Marine, was later appointed Under Secretary of the Navy \nand was eventually appointed and confirmed as the 61st Secretary of the \nNavy. Early in our Senate career, Senator Warner and I served on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee together. Over the past several \nCongresses, our work together has centered on defense, national \nsecurity and homeland security matters.\n  During his Senate, tenure John has earned the respect and admiration \nof his colleagues on both sides of the aisle because of his unique \nability to negotiate, accommodate, compromise, and foster positive \nworking relationships with fellow Members. Through this approach, John \nWarner has been a leader on a broad range of issues such as \nstrengthening our defense and national security, fighting the global \nwar on terrorism and decreasing carbon and other emissions globally. \nWhile in the Senate, he dutifully served on the Armed Services \nCommittee, Intelligence Committee, Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  John has been a long time colleague of mine, and I will dearly miss \nhim. The Commonwealth of Virginia has been fortunate to have John on \ntheir side. He has been an asset not only to his state, but also to our \nNation. In the course of working together for so many years, I have \ndeveloped genuine respect for Senator John Warner. I thank him for \nyears of distinguished service and wish him the very best in all his \nfuture endeavors. My wife Nancy and I wish John and his wonderful \nfamily all the best during his retirement.\n\n\n                              Larry Craig\n\n  At this time I would like to take some time to talk about Senator \nLarry Craig and to thank him for his service here in the Senate and for \nhis service and dedication to his home State of Idaho.\n  I have been fortunate enough to work with Senator Craig on many of \nthe same issues over the years. More often than not we were on the same \nside of those issues. We worked for many hours together on energy \npolicy, and more specifically, nuclear energy policy. In addition, the \nStates we represent, New Mexico and Idaho, are similar in that they are \nboth in the west, are largely rural, have vast swaths of Federal land, \nand are home to Federal research laboratories. These similarities--\nbetween the States we represent--brought us together by way of common \ninterests on many of the same policy subjects.\n  Senator Craig and I served on the Appropriations Committee together \nfor many years. During that time, we worked together to make sure the \nDepartments of Energy and Interior were taken care of in terms of \nfunding. As many of us know, Senator Craig comes from a strong \nagriculture background. At times we had to try to fend off, as best we \ncould, efforts to change the Milk Income Loss Contract program. The \nchanges to the program would have compromised dairy producers from each \nof our home States. Dairy farmers in New Mexico and Idaho knew that \nSenator Craig was a formidable ally for their cause, and I thank him \nfor his help and support.\n  As chairman and ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, I have always admired Senator Craig's command of public \nlands policy. He has been a great leader on public lands issues \nthroughout his career and without the leadership of Senator Craig, we \nwould have never been able to pass the Healthy Forests bill in December \n2003. It was also through his leadership we passed the Secure Rural \nSchools and Community Self-determination Act which has been so \nimportant to both our states. He led the Republican side on public \nlands and forest issues as chairman or ranking member of the Public \nLands and Forest Subcommittee from 1995 until 2007.\n  Some of our most important work together took place in the nuclear \narena. Senator Craig has done a tremendous job of promoting nuclear \npower as a safe, reliable and clean source of energy. I appreciate his \noutstanding work on nuclear matters, and I appreciate his support and \nencouragement along the way for my efforts in this important area.\n  Many people know that because of where we live and what we do in our \nStates, Senator Craig and I naturally work on similar matters. That is \nas it turned out. I will talk about some matters that have been very \nbig for our country that are not natural to our States.\n  First, I served with him on the Committee on Appropriations for a \nnumber of years. We worked together on energy policy and, more \nspecifically, nuclear energy policy. The States we represent are home \nto national research laboratories.\n  As many of my colleagues know, Senator Craig comes from a strong \nagricultural background. At times, we had to try to fend off, as best \nwe could, efforts to change the Milk Income Loss Contract Program, \ncalled the MILC Program. That sounds like something we should all be \nfor. It turns out that dairy farmers in New Mexico and Idaho knew \nSenator Craig was a formidable ally when it came to subsidies that \nwould help some and hurt others. We were generally on the hurt end \nbecause we were smaller States that had that particular set of facts. \nWe worked hard\n\n[[Page S9466]]\n\non those issues. I learned to respect him greatly.\n  He led Republicans on public lands issues and forest issues as \nchairman and ranking member of the Public Lands and Forest Subcommittee \nfrom 1995 through 1997. This led to the enactment of the healthy forest \nbill in December of 2003--I was part of that with him--and the Senate \nRural Schools and Communities Self-Determination Act, which was his. I \nam sure most of the thinking to put it together was his. It was an \nabsolutely stellar bill that got assistance to schools across his State \nand other Western States that lost some or all of their revenues for \ntheir schools because of the curtailment of timber sales in the area. \nHe and the distinguished Senator from Washington worked together to get \nthis done.\n  Senator Craig and I have spent a great deal of time on matters \npertaining to nuclear power. Nuclear power is making a renaissance in \nAmerica. We will soon have many of them built in the United States. We \nhave more than any other country in the world, but we only get 20 \npercent of our electricity from nuclear power. Countries such as France \nhave gone way ahead of us and now have 75 to 80 percent. Other \ncountries of the world have as well, since America has made its bid, \nsaying: We are going to change our minds, for which I am very proud. I \ntook the lead in that, with Larry's help, and we have changed America. \nWith it has come a renaissance in nuclear power.\n  I wish him the greatest success in his retirement. I am sure we will \nhear from him. He is too young to be quiet. He will be doing something, \nand we will hear about it.\n\n\n                              Chuck Hagel\n\n  I also wish to take this time to pay tribute to Chuck Hagel, the \nsenior Senator from Nebraska, who is retiring after serving for two \nterms in the Senate.\n  Senator Hagel, a fourth generation Nebraskan, has served his State \nand his country in many ways. He served as an infantry squad leader \nwith the U.S. Army's 9th Infantry Division and is a decorated Vietnam \nveteran, having been awarded many honors including two Purple Hearts. \nAs a U.S. Senator, Chuck Hagel has served on four committees: Foreign \nRelations; Banking; Housing and Urban Affairs; Intelligence and Rules.\n  During his time in the Senate, coinciding with mine, it has been my \npleasure to work with the distinguished Senator on issues affecting our \nNation. I can recall a chance meeting between a member of my staff, one \nof my constituent groups from New Mexico and Senator Hagel, in which he \ntook time out of his busy schedule to speak with my New Mexico \nconstituents to offer his insights and share some very kind words. Such \na small genuine instance like this made all the difference in their \ntrip to our Nation's Capital.\n  As I said, when he came here, for some reason, I think I became one \nof his very first friends. He must have decided that I was a big \nchairman, and when I went on a trip with the Budget Committee to \nEurope, I asked him if he would go, and he jumped to it. So we got to \nknow each other during the first 2 or 3 months of his term on a trip to \nEurope where we learned about the new monetary system that was about to \ntake place in Europe. We did a number of other things together.\n  Obviously, he has been an exemplary Senator in all respects. He will \nreturn to his State and to America filled with ideas and ready to do \nother things for this great land. My wife Nancy and I wish Chuck and \nhis family all the best.\n\n\n                              Wayne Allard\n\n  Now I rise to speak about Senator Wayne Allard from Colorado who \nannounced in January 2007 he would not seek reelection in 2008, keeping \nhis promise of only serving two terms. I would like to thank Wayne for \nhis service here in the Senate and for his service to the State of \nColorado.\n  In the course of working together with Senator Allard for many years \non the Senate Budget Committee and more recently on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, I have developed genuine respect for Senator \nAllard. We have a lot in common, fighting for the interests of our \npredominantly rural, Western States. Although we did not always agree, \nwe worked well together, and I valued his commitment to his home State.\n  Senator Allard announced in January of 2007 that he would not seek \nreelection in 2008, keeping his promise to serve only two terms. Some \nof us were sorry that he did that. I was one. I would like to thank \nWayne for his service in the Senate, for his service to the State of \nColorado, my neighbor.\n  We worked together for many years on the Budget Committee. More \nrecently, we worked on appropriations. Colorado is my neighbor to the \nnorth, and we have much in common in fighting for the interests of much \nof our rural way of life that Western States have. At the same time, we \nhave growing metropolises with the problems of transportation and the \nlike, which he has spent much time on. He has supported many things I \nhave worked on. For that, I am grateful and thankful to him today.\n  He and his wife Joan will return to non-Senate life. I don't know if \nhe is going home. I haven't asked him personally. But wherever he goes, \nit is obvious he will make an impact.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9466-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9466-S9467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BANKING LESSON\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I want to give a little history lesson \non banking. It is strange that I only served on the Banking Committee 2 \nyears of my Senate life. That was when I filled in. I served and \nlearned a lot. But when this crisis came about, I decided that somebody \nwas going to teach me about what had happened since the Great \nDepression. So I am going to try to do that as quickly as I can.\n  First, it is not time for partisan ideological finger-pointing.\n  Second, there is no plan that can emerge from any set of honest \ndeliberations that will be painless. We are undergoing a massive \ndeleveraging in the finance markets.\n  Third, I was chairman of the Senate Budget Committee when the \nResolution Trust Corporation was formed in order to curb the savings \nand loan crisis of the early 1990s. That effort was also controversial. \nI hope the plan that emerges from Congress and the administration does \nthe same for financial markets now. I recognize the difference between \nthe two. The first was much easier because there were many physical \nassets we could look at and transfer title to, and people could feel \nassets. I would say that, as a model, that terrible situation ended \nwith the Federal Government making money instead of losing money.\n  From everything I know about the proposal, the principal proposal put \nforth by the executive branch through the two spokesmen who have been \nworking 24 hours a day nonstop, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, an \nabsolute expert in this field--it has been said over and over that he \nknows much about recessions and he knows much about depressions. He \nwrote his professorial doctorate thesis on the Great Depression. That \nis why he talks as if he knows what happens in depressions. He has been \ntelling us what will happen if we go into a depression. Then we have \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, whom we all have gotten to know. He \napologizes profusely for not being a great speaker, but he has \npresented a difficult plan and come a long way.\n  I, for one, hope we come to a resolution soon between Democrats and \nRepublicans and the White House, speaking through their spokesmen, and \nsend a signal to the American people that we know how to take care of \nthe financial markets--not Wall Street, the financial markets--of \nAmerica. The financial markets, not Wall Street, are plugged. They \ndon't work right now. They don't run. They are filled with toxic \nassets. We have to get the toxic assets out or else we will have no \nliquidity in the financing system.\n  Some say the basic problem goes back to 1933 and the so-called Glass-\nSteagall Act that separated investment banking from commercial banking. \nSome say that, to the contrary, if Glass-Steagall were still the law of \nthe land, we wouldn't have the problems we now confront. Both sides \ncite great scholars, economic theorists, and market gurus, but both \nDemocrats and Republicans voted for the original Glass-Steagall. In \n1999, under the leadership of President Clinton and Treasury Secretary \nRubin, Glass-Steagall was repealed. Now many say that repeal of Glass-\nSteagall has caused the problem.\n\n[[Page S9467]]\n\nI should note that Republicans controlled the Congress then and \nDemocrats controlled the executive branch. Both parties played a role.\n  Some contend that the problem goes back to 1977, when Congress passed \nthe Community Reinvestment Act requiring that financial institutions \nfinance home purchases to borrowers who were historically deemed \nunlikely to pay back the loans. The theorists say that when politicians \ntry to determine who is a good borrower, both the borrower and the \nlender will suffer. I think we will look back on this effort to save \nthe system and that conclusion will become a reality. Let me repeat. \nSome say that when we try to determine who is a good borrower and make \na determination rather than letting the market make the determination \nas to who is a good borrower, we both suffer. Those who lend the money \ndon't get paid, and those who buy don't get what they bought. That is \nsort of what has happened here. Many of those became the toxic assets \nthat we are now talking about. The Reinvestment Act, which both \nDemocrats and Republicans voted for, was an act that attempted to push \nloans that were questionable in terms of whether the people buying \ncould ever pay them off.\n  Some say we should have seen this coming. They note that the savings \nand loan crisis came not too long after the Garn-St. Germain Act of \n1982 that loosened regulation of savings and loans in America. The law \ndrew the support of both Democrats and Republicans and was signed into \nlaw by a Republican President. This argument says that when regulation \nof Government-insured money loosens, the odds that extremely risky \nbehavior will occur increases.\n  During the last 10 years, as regulation of markets decreased, \nglobalization of markets increased. More and more complicated and \nmodel-driven financial products were invented, and regulators clearly \nlost the ability to analyze risk and to step in when necessary. Many \nbelieve the Long-Term Capital Management debacle was an early warning \nthat financial mathematicians in the marketplace had gotten ahead of \nthe financial regulators. Warnings about the size and complexity of \nderivatives of all sorts proliferated. Many policymakers asked aboutthe \nsize and complexity of these derivatives of all sorts and could not get \nanswers and could not understand some of that which they were being \ntold. Many policymakers and regulators assumed that the financial \ncompanies themselves would realize that proper risk analysis was in \ntheir self-interest and self-regulation would naturally occur. That \nassumption has proved wrong. Many purchasers of these convoluted \nproducts were reassured because rating agencies continued to give so \nmany of them AAA ratings. Instead of going through the extremely \ndifficult process of analyzing each and every component of each and \nevery product, purchasers depended upon the ratings agencies. So some \nanalysts now say it was the rating agencies that failed.\n\n  Finally, we all recognize that turmoil plagues all markets worldwide. \nMany nations and institutions in many countries now own what are called \n``toxic assets.'' I have just tried to describe them a minute ago.\n  Literally trillions of dollars of various complex financial products \nare held by many banks, investment houses, pension funds, and insurance \ncompanies in almost every developed nation. China has had to step in by \nincreasing Government shares of some banks. Russia closed down its \nmarkets for 2 days and may spend as much as $120 billion to stabilize \nits markets. Germany and the United Kingdom have had to devote billions \nwithin the last 18 months to try to stem financial contagion. Serious \nerosion of confidence in financial institutions threatens to freeze \ncredit, with all the disastrous consequences that holds for a financial \nworld built on easy, safe, transparent credit. Now credit is hard, \ninsecure, and opaque.\n  So, I will not pretend to know if the plan proposed by the \nadministration and some in Congress will solve the problem. Since no \none seems to know what shape this plan will take in the end, any \npredictions seem foolish at this point. I do know that the size of the \npotential market injury, and the consequences that the working man and \nwoman in this and other nations will suffer, compel serious, strategic \nsovereign government action. Thus, I believe the warnings of a Federal \nReserve Chairman who probably knows as much about the financial \nconsequences of the Great Depression as anyone else in town, and the \nwarnings of a Treasury Secretary who used to head a Wall Street firm \nthat invented many of the instruments that now seem ``toxic.'' If they \ndon't know the severity of this problem, and if they cannot at least \ngive us a plan that will stabilize market behavior until a clearing \nprice for these assets emerges, then I suspect that no one can.\n  We will pass legislation that I guarantee you will be imperfect. All \nsorts of objections from various industries and groups have already \nfilled cyberspace, and newspaper space, and air time. Ideological and \ntheoretical objections already fill the atmosphere. It seems to me that \nthe time for such almost theological discussions is long past. As a \nSenator who has been here a long time, and seen many recessions and \nmarket crises come and go, I only know two things: we are all to blame \nin some form or other; and we need to act now, with a very large, \nGovernment-led program, and with all prudent speed.\n  Madam President, I believe my time is about to expire.\n  I certainly hope we will pass something like what has been asked of \nus by the executive branch, with five or six things that clearly are \nnecessary, that we find necessary as representatives of the people, but \nthat we get it done because we must save our own ability to lend \nmoney--that is, our system of borrowing and lending--and the rest of \nthe world kind of waits on us also.\n  So this is truly a big one. As I said to my hometown paper, after 36 \nyears in the Senate, on the last day or next to the last day of my time \nhere, I will vote on the most important issue I have ever voted on, the \nmost complex, and that costs the most--all in one shot. As I leave and \nwalk out, here will be behind me the most difficult issue we have faced \nas a Nation. It is very hard for our people to understand it, but it is \na terrible one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9467-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9467-S9468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  FERC\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I note that the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources is on the \nfloor. I wonder if I might address a question to my good friend from \nNew Mexico. Many are alleging that one of the root causes of our \ncurrent financial distress stems from insufficient regulatory oversight \nof financial markets. That is a criticism which some allege to be \napplicable to our Nation's energy markets--the theory apparently being \nthat lax oversight has allowed speculators and manipulators to \nartificially increase prices for oil and gas. Given that you were \nChairman of the Energy Committee at the time of passage of the Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005 I wonder if you might want to comment on the \nregulatory authorities that were addressed in that act. As I recall, \nEPACT significantly increased the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission's ability to not only oversee markets but to punish \nmanipulation within those markets.\n  Mr DOMENICI. The Senator is absolutely correct. We enhanced FERC's \nauthority to police and prevent market manipulation and we increased \nthe Commission's authority to levy fines to $1 million per day. It was \nour thinking that the potential for fines of this magnitude would serve \nas a meaningful deterrent to market manipulation. While I am a long \ntime supporter of markets, I agreed to the grant of enhanced penalty \nauthority to the FERC as a step to ensure that those markets were \nconducted fairly, openly, and without the exercise of market power by \nany of the participants.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of my \ncolleague, and I share his sentiment both toward the desirability of \nmarkets and the need to ensure that those markets operate fairly and \nefficiently. My specific inquiry relates to the standard of review \nwhich attaches to any enforcement proceedings under these enhanced \nauthorities. While I agree with the need for greater oversight in the \noperation of these markets, it seems to me that along with its enhanced \noversight authority the FERC has an obligation\n\n[[Page S9468]]\n\nto protect the due process rights for those against whom it might bring \ncauses of action. Did EPACT bring about any change in the standards of \nreview which would attach to enforcement proceedings under these new \nauthorities?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think the Senator's question is well informed, and I \ncan assure him that there was no intent to change the standard of \nreview which would attach to any enforcement proceeding. The \nlongstanding practice has been for the accused party to have rights to \na de novo review of the charges in Federal court. Such rights are \nnecessary to ensure that the agency does not act as both prosecutor and \njudge in any enforcement proceeding. That right is clear, not just in \nthe case law but in other statutes administered by the FERC, including \nthe Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act. There is no \nsuggestion and there can be no inference that we intended to change \nthat standard with our enhanced market oversight provisions in the \nNatural Gas Act.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank my good friend for that clarification and for the \nwisdom he has brought to Federal energy policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Madam President, let me say, first, following one of my \ndearest friends in the Senate, I cannot tell you how much I admire and \nrespect this great man and how much he will be missed in the Senate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Madam President, we all know high gas prices are the \nsource of tremendous frustration to individuals, families, and \nbusinesses alike. I am greatly discouraged that yet another week has \ngone by and no action on a comprehensive energy policy has taken root \nin the Senate. Our country deserves better than the lack of leadership \nin Washington that has been shown on this issue the past 2 years.\n  We need a comprehensive energy policy, but right now in North \nCarolina we just need more gasoline. My State faces a gas shortage of \ncrisis proportions. In western North Carolina, Asheville-Buncombe \nTechnical Community College and Southwestern Community College have \nboth canceled classes for the rest of this week because students and \nprofessors cannot get to class. My office has been assisting senior \ncitizens who need help getting to doctor appointments because public \ntransportation systems are struggling to meet increased demand. \nBusinesses are closing early, cars are being left on the side of the \nroad, and families are staying home just to conserve gasoline. The \nripple effects of this gas shortage are resonating throughout North \nCarolina and the Southeast.\n  I know folks in western North Carolina are being particularly hard \nhit, and I want them to know I have heard them and we are acting to \nbring relief. My office has been in daily contact with constituents, \nState and local officials, gasoline refiners and distributors, and our \nFederal agencies. In response to the shortage, today my colleague, \nSenator Richard Burr, and I have written to the Secretary of Energy \nrequesting him to tap the International Energy Agency's emergency \ngasoline and diesel fuel supply. An IEA release can help alleviate some \nof the supply constraints we are feeling in the United States. This is \na prudent and responsible step which is on the scale of our efforts \npost-Katrina and Rita, and there is no reason the Secretary of Energy \nshould not take this action.\n  Additionally, Senator Burr and I have introduced legislation today \nthat will help prevent in the future a situation such as the one we \nfind ourselves in today. The Motor Fuel Supply and Distribution \nImprovement Act of 2008 will reduce the proliferation of boutique fuels \nand streamline the process of getting more affordable and reliable \nproduct to western North Carolina, Charlotte, the Southeast, and across \nthe country. With this legislation, we will no longer have to rely on \nan EPA Administrator to issue a waiver in times of crisis or be held \nvictim to a policy that creates hurdles to getting gasoline to \nconsumers when they need it most.\n  We also know this particular shortage is a result of Hurricanes \nGustav and Ike, which devastated the gulf coast and its infrastructure. \nBeing from a State that has been hit by its fair share of hurricanes, \nmy heart goes out to the people of the gulf who have endured far too \nmuch disaster for one lifetime, and we will do everything possible to \nsupport them and help them rebuild.\n  Of strategic consequence, however, the refinery and pipeline closures \nin the gulf as a result of the storms highlight a glaring energy \nsecurity issue for our country. It makes little sense to have a quarter \nof our country's refining capacity located so densely in one area. We \nhave far too few oil refineries in America, and right now in North \nCarolina we are experiencing the harmful consequences of a policy that \nhas greatly inhibited the building of new refineries in America.\n  We need to get to work building new refineries right here at home. In \nfact, for years I have been calling for streamlining regulations so \nmore refineries can get built, only to have special interests stand in \nthe way. The Gas Petroleum Rifiner Improvement and Community \nEmpowerment Act, or Gas PRICE Act, which I have supported since 2005, \nwould streamline the process for the construction and operation of a \nrefinery so we can build additional refineries and create new jobs in \nNorth Carolina and throughout the Southeast. This is a sensible \napproach that would expand refinery capacity and lower gas prices.\n  Significantly, with this plan, our country would no longer be so \ndependent on one area to provide us with so much of our gasoline. As we \nsaw in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, we need to expand \nrefining capacity and production so that even in the face of crisis \nsituations our fuel supply system continues to function and support \nAmerican businesses and consumers.\n  Now Hurricanes Gustav and Ike have reinforced that same message. \nNorth Carolinians can no longer afford Congress's inaction on our \nenergy future. It is time to put the special interests aside and do \nwhat is right for our country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for approximately 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today we are facing a historic economic \ncrisis. We have been told by the Secretary of Treasury and the Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve that we stand on the edge of a financial cliff \nand that we are looking down on a potential disaster that this country \nhas not seen since the Great Depression. We have seen historic \nfinancial firms and banks with household names swept away in a matter \nof weeks. These massive changes have left the American people worried, \nconfused, and angry.\n  In the wake of this chaos on Wall Street, the administration has come \nto Congress with a plan they believe will calm the storm. They came to \nus with few details--only three pages. They told us we need to move \nimmediately, that delay was dangerous. We were told that oversight of \nthe bailout would be a burden and just slow everything down. We were \ntold to hand over the money and simply get out of the way.\n  The administration asked the American people for a $700 billion blank \ncheck. Wall Street and the administration are asking hard-working \nWisconsinites to bail them out, to buy assets that no one wants, to go \nfurther into debt to China so that banks and financial institutions can \navoid bankruptcy. My constituents, the people of Wisconsin, cannot \nunderstand how we got to this point and why they should be asked to \nfoot the bill. They are furious, and I do not blame them.\n  I share their anger. As a businessman, I am shocked and appalled that \nthe supposed best and brightest on Wall Street allowed their companies \nto purchase dangerous assets they did not understand, that these people \ngambled with the money of millions of Americans, and now they expect \nthose same Americans to come to their rescue.\n\n[[Page S9469]]\n\n  These supposed titans of Wall Street owe the American people an \nexplanation. We are being asked for the staggering sum of $700 billion, \nbut not one CEO has come to Capitol Hill to apologize for their part in \ncreating this awful mess. To add insult to injury, when Congress tried \nto limit CEO compensation for firms that would benefit from the plan, \nthe administration resisted. They had the nerve to ask my \nconstituents--who make about $48,000 per household--for money while \nthey keep their multimillion-dollar salaries.\n  I think these CEOs need to come before Congress and explain how we \ngot into this mess--and to explain their role. Now, I know they are not \nsolely to blame. Regulators were asleep at the switch, the \nadministration believed in letting markets run wild, Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac overextended themselves, and Congress failed to do adequate \noversight. But as a businessman who firmly believes in markets, I am \nstunned that Wall Street engaged in the behavior that led us to this \npoint.\n  I hope Congress will call some of these CEOs who are most involved in \nthis meltdown to testify. The American people want to hear from them. I \nthink they owe us all an apology. They should also explain what they \nplan to do in the future to make sure we never end up in this kind of \ncrisis again. They should tell us what kind of regulations they think \nare necessary to avoid another crisis. It is the least they can do in \nexchange for the risks the American people are being asked to absorb on \ntheir behalf.\n  We have yet to see the details of this final bailout package. I am \nreserving judgment. I understand the delicate situation we are in and \nthe risks we face, but I am wary of being rushed into a quick decision. \nI would prefer a solution that does not provide the $700 billion all at \nonce but provides part of it now and more later, if necessary. We can \nreconvene and raise the amount at any time with short notice, so I do \nnot see the necessity of providing everything upfront. Any bailout \nneeds rigorous oversight. We must limit CEO compensation, and it should \nalso give the taxpayers a chance to share in any profits that may \nresult.\n  This is not our money we are handing to Secretary Paulson. It is the \ntaxpayers'. I never forget who I am working for, and the people I serve \nare furious they are being asked to give $700 billion to the very \ninvestors who have made such bad decisions. No one wants to plunge the \neconomy into chaos, but we need to make sure we take our time and get \nthis right because if we do not, we will be back here again, and the \nstakes will be even higher.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9469-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 3325\n\n  Mr. KOHL.

Madam President, I wish to expand a minute on the \npurposes of this.\n  The American people should know we have a law called the improper \npayments law where every agency is supposed to report to Congress every \nyear the amount of improper payments, both over and under, and how that \naffects their budgets and their goals. Less than 50 percent of the \nagencies file that report with Congress. The reason they don't is \nbecause we don't make them. We don't say: Your funding is contingent \nupon you following the law. So, regrettably, I objected to what Senator \nKohl--I actually agree with the things we are doing in the bill, but we \nwon't accomplish what we want to accomplish if we don't make the \nJustice Department report to us and have metrics to see that the money \nwe are going to spend--not ours; actually, it is going to be the money \nof the next generation--is spent wisely and is effective in doing what \nwe want to get done.\n  It is my hope before we leave here that we can work out a compromise. \nI have spoken with Senator Specter. I have not had a chance to visit \nwith Senator Leahy. I intend to do that today. We have given in a lot \nof areas on this bill, especially the spending amounts.\n  I also note the Justice Department ended last year with $1.72 billion \nin unobligated balances. They are the only agency that gets to keep \ntheir money, and they get to decide--not us--what they are going to do \nwith that $1.72 billion. So there is plenty of money in the Justice \nDepartment right now to do this program.\n  We have to decide whether we are going to put teeth in what we tell \nagencies to do. My hope is we will start doing that.\n  I was going to spend some time now talking about the continuing \nresolution. I am going to reserve that and try to come back at a \ndifferent time and try to reach Senator Specter and Senator Leahy on \nthis IP bill in the hopes we can get something worked out.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note that we would obviously be in \nrecess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9469-4", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know that throughout the Capitol, even \nat this relatively late hour, there are many meetings going on as \nSenators and members of the administration and House Members and \nleadership and rank-and-file struggle with how to address some of the \nmajor challenges before our Nation, both domestically and \ninternationally.\n  Of course, Mr. President, you are aware that while all of these \nissues are going on, for those of us in the South, we have a special \nmission, if you will, and our attention has been drawn in the last few \nweeks to the terrible devastation that has occurred not just in \nLouisiana, not just in parts of Mississippi, not just in Arkansas, but, \nof course, in Texas as well, where not one storm, not really two, but, \nMr. President, as you are aware, three pretty\n\n[[Page S9470]]\n\nmajor hurricanes, starting with Fay, came through Florida with \ndrenching rain, rain, rain, and not just in the State of Florida \nbecause as that storm moved its way up through the central part of our \nState, it flooded vast areas of the central part of our country.\n  Then, as people were drying out and cleaning up from the wreckage of \nthese storms, with levees overflowing, creeks rising, farmers \nstruggling, and communities trying to keep dry, lo and behold, here \ncomes Gustav into the gulf, skipping Florida this time, no direct hit--\nalthough you have been hit so many times in the last few years--but \nslamming right into the coast of Louisiana, as ironic as it would seem, \nliterally almost to the day of the third anniversary of Katrina, which \nwas the worst catastrophe. And we say natural disaster, but actually it \nwas a manmade catastrophe because had the levees that we made held, the \ncity would not have gone underwater, or the region. So it was both a \nnatural and manmade disaster. On the third anniversary, Gustav comes \nthrough, with its great tidal surge in south Louisiana. It caught part \nof Mississippi, as well as a little bit of Texas, but it swept through \nall 64 parishes in Louisiana with hurricane-force winds.\n  Now, this is not usual for us. We usually have terrible storms, such \nas Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, without the levee breaks, where the \ndamage is localized to the southern part of our State. But not Gustav. \nGustav came through as a category III and then II, and then the winds \nmoved through our entire State. Louisiana was in that path.\n  Just as we were catching our breath and the lights were starting to \ncome back on after weeks, Ike comes roaring in--yes, directly into \nGalveston and into that path of Houston, but, as you know, the eastern \nbands are the worst, and to the east of Galveston and to the east of \nBeaumont, lo and behold, lies southwest Louisiana and coastal Louisiana \nyet again.\n  I tell my family that I feel as if--not just for me but the people I \nrepresent--we are living literally the chapters of Job, I mean for the \nlast several years, just suffering after suffering after suffering.\n  This Congress has been very good, particularly the leadership now, to \nstep up. Even at times when, in my view, the administration turned a \ncold shoulder for whatever reason, this Congress stepped up and did \nyeoman's work, basically pushing forward on 100 percent reimbursement \nwhen we needed it and, when there was some reluctance to do so at the \nadministration level, giving us more community development block \ngrants, and I could go on and on. We are very grateful.\n  But I had to come to the floor today, Mr. President, to speak again \non behalf of the 64 parishes in Louisiana and the southern part of our \nState. Senators, of course, will speak for their own States, but I am \nwell aware, having been in conversations with Senator Hutchison of \nTexas earlier today and Senator Blanche Lincoln from Arkansas and other \nSenators, that the southern part of our State, particularly when it \ncomes to our rural areas and to agriculture, is currently being \noverlooked, and I am here today to call attention to this fact and to \ntry to lay out some data for the record in hopes that sometime before \nwe leave here we might make a few corrections to this situation because \nit would be tragic and devastating to not just hundreds but thousands \nof families in these rural areas.\n  Right now, as I speak, people in these areas are looking out at their \nfields and seeing complete and total destruction. These storms hit not \nat planting time, not in the middle of the season, but at harvest time, \nand because the Fay rains delayed the harvest--and, of course, you know \nhow our crops are harvested, Mr. President. You can't harvest crops in \nthe middle of torrential downpours, so the farmers who were ready \nwaited. We had beautiful crops in the field. We had soybean that looked \nbeautiful. We had cotton. Our sweet potato crop looked promising. We \nare growing a lot more corn. In Louisiana, we grow it all. We are not a \nState that grows just one crop. We have vegetables, but primarily it is \ncotton, soybean, rice, and now our sweet potatoes are growing in many \nmore places, not just south Louisiana. So our farmers were literally \ngiddy with excitement. Only 4 months ago, we were thinking we were \ngoing to have a Record, a banner agricultural year.\n  I am sure people were making plans for expansion and new investments \nand perhaps even acquiring new land or expanding their lease \narrangements. Literally within a matter of 90 days, the world turned \nupside down. The world seems to be turning upside down right now in \nanother sector, in the financial markets. As that world is turning \nupside down, this Congress is turning with it and all attention right \nnow is focused on Wall Street and financiers and the lack of credit in \nNew York, on the east coast to the west coast. But I am here to tell \nyou there is a credit crunch, a credit crisis right now in the \nheartland and nobody is talking much about this.\n  We have a $700 billion bailout bill under consideration. I have not \nheard in the last 2 weeks from anyone--from the Fed to the White House \nto many of the leadership here in Congress--about any kind of credit \ncrunch happening in small towns, on Main Streets, the heartland, the \nbackbone of this country when it comes to agriculture. I can tell you \nthere is a lot of anxiety and a lot of fear where I come from.\n  I visited some of my farms last week. I went up to northeast \nLouisiana to see for myself. I have been getting calls, hearing some \ndire reports, so I thought I better go look and see myself because I am \nsure--I don't know, but I would venture to say there hasn't been \nanybody from the U.S. Department of Agriculture up there lately. I \nthought, since I am a Senator from Louisiana, I would go up and look \nmyself.\n  I am going to put up some pictures here because I was so taken by \nwhat I saw that I had my staff blow up some photographs. This is the \nrice crop in Cheneyville, LA. Of course it is completely ruined. The \nrice is sprouting in the fields, unable to be harvested. These fields \nare not able to be drained. That is the rice crop.\n  I want to show a picture of our cotton crop in north Louisiana. And I \nhave a few other photos to share about sugarcane, sweet potatoes, et \ncetera. This is our cotton crop right here. Again, literally 8 weeks \nago this was the most beautiful cotton you could see, for miles and \nmiles. Louisiana, even though we talk a lot about tourism and we talk a \nlot about the port and oil and gas, we are by nature a very strong \nagricultural State. Not every State in the Union is such, but we are. \nWe have thousands of acres under cultivation. This is what our cotton \nlooks like. It cannot be harvested. The farmers who were desperate to \ntry to get in there and harvest what they could have been turned away \nat the gin because the gin is unable to process this cotton. So we are \ngoing to have 100 percent losses on some farms, 50 percent losses, 45 \npercent losses, at a time when the farmers have put every penny they \nhad into their crop, waiting to pull it out. At that moment the rains \ncame.\n  When you talk about a credit crunch, I know it may be tight on the \neast coast and the west coast, but it could hardly get tighter than in \nsmall places that I know of in Louisiana. I am sure this is true of \nTexas and Arkansas.\n  We are not asking for $700 billion. We are not even asking for $50 \nbillion. We are not even necessarily at this moment asking for $10 \nbillion. But we have to have something before we leave. We have to have \nsomething before we leave.\n  When I saw this, I thought surely the Department of Agriculture is on \ntop of this--because I have one staff person who does agriculture--one. \nThe Department of Agriculture--I don't know, but I am going to put in \nthe Record how many employees they might have. I am sure it is \nthousands. I am going to put into the Record the exact number. So I say \nto myself: Don't worry, Senator, there is a whole Department of \nAgriculture out there. Surely the people whose job it is to record this \nwould have been down to either Louisiana or Texas or Mississippi or \nArkansas to take pictures and maybe help declare a disaster.\n  On Wednesday I had a hearing and asked the Secretary to come before \nour committee, to ask him if he has the intention of declaring a \ndisaster in Louisiana. He said he was not sure. When I pressed him for \nwhen he might declare a disaster, he did not know. They said they are \ngetting the figures in as we speak.\n\n[[Page S9471]]\n\n  I have the figures from our Commissioner of Agriculture. I am going \nto submit them for the record. But the preliminary figures that we have \nbeen scrambling to get in the last few weeks, from L.S.U., and from our \nresearch centers and extension service centers, say it is a minimum of \na $700 million loss just in Louisiana.\n  I know Texas is still struggling. The people just got back to \nGalveston yesterday. We still cannot get into Cameron Parish, which is \nthe parish closest to Texas, along our border, because it is that \ndevastated and flooded. We only have 10,000 people who live there, but \nit is a great farming and ranching community. Yes, I admit our numbers \nare not completely in from Cameron. But it doesn't take a month to get \nnumbers from Richland Parish. It doesn't take a month to get numbers \nfrom Madison Parish. I suggest somebody who works for the Department of \nAgriculture might want to spend a little time looking at central and \nnorth Louisiana so we can get our numbers in.\n  I thought not only would they do that, they would have declared a \ndisaster and we would have a program to help. You know what I found out \nwhen I came back? We had created a program in the last farm bill--that \nis the good news. The bad news is the regulations have not yet started \nto be written.\n  Let me be clear. We passed a bill. There is a new program. They have \nstarted very briefly to write these regulations but, according to the \ntestimony I received--I am going to submit the full testimony for the \nRecord--the regulations are ``not imminent.''\n  I will wrap up. I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Under Secretary said--when I said, Could these \nregulations be written in 3 months? Could they be written in 6 months? \nCould they be written within the year?--Let me just say, Senator, \n``they are not imminent.''\n  I said, What exactly does that mean? So our farmers have nowhere to \nask for help?\n  Well, that is about it.\n  That answer is not acceptable to this Senator. If we are dealing with \na credit crisis and can, in 5 days or 7 days, put together a $700 \nbillion bailout for the financiers who bet on the price of cotton and \nsoybean and wheat and sweet potatoes and sugarcane, we most certainly \ncan spend a few days and a few billion dollars supporting the men and \nwomen who actually grow it.\n  That is why I am going to spend some time today, tonight, tomorrow \nand the next day, until I hear from the leadership--the Republican \nleadership, the Democratic leadership, or from the leadership at the \nWhite House--about what we can possibly do to get some help to farmers \nin the middle of the country who need our attention.\n  The program that will help them, the regulations have not been \nwritten. They can't even apply until next year. They have to go to the \nbank next week. When they go to the bank, if we don't do something \nhere, the bank is going to say I can't lend you money because I can't \nget it from the elevator, the elevator can't get it from the importer \nor exporter, and it is a chain event that will result for the people \nwhom we all represent--who have not borrowed one penny inappropriately, \nwho were not engaged in subprime mortgages. All they do is work hard \nbefore the Sun comes up and as it goes down they are still working; who \npay their bills and pay their mortgages. In their time of need this \nCongress is going to walk out without leaving a few pennies on the \ntable for them? I don't think so.\n  I have brought this to the attention of the Appropriations Committee \nin a letter I wrote several weeks ago. I guess the letter was not \nwritten strongly enough to get the attention we needed, so I am going \nto continue to speak and make phone calls and hold meetings and \norganize as best I can a group of Senators and House Members who \nrepresent the southern part of this country and the breadbasket of \nAmerica, the central interior part, to say while we are bailing out the \nfinancial coasts, we have our energy coast, which is a whole other \nspeech that I could give, underwater, our rigs are toppled, now our \ncrops are down in the field down in the south, in the gulf coast, and \nwe cannot even get a quorum in a meeting to take care of this.\n  Let me say generally, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Tom \nHarkin, has been very sensitive. I brought this matter to him and he \nconducted a joint hearing with me, so I thank publicly Senator Harkin. \nI thank Kay Bailey Hutchison for phone calls and meetings. I thank \nBlanche Lincoln. I am sure there will be other Senators who can \nrecognize the damage done, not just to Louisiana but to their States as \nwell, and recognize that the program we have, the regulations have not \nbeen written and it is not going to help.\n  Let me also mention Senator Kent Conrad who helped design that \nprogram. He has said to me, and will probably speak on this, that he \nrecognizes the program that has been designed is not sufficient and we \ndo need special help.\n  I am going to conclude by saying I will be back on the floor in the \nmorning and many times throughout this weekend as we work through these \nmajor bills on defense, homeland security, the Wall Street bailout. But \nI am going to continue to press for some appropriate immediate relief, \ntargeted and specific to the counties and to the parishes and farmers \nand farm communities that need the most help. Certainly these Americans \nwho have done nothing wrong but work hard and just got caught in a \nconfluence of terrible rains and bad storms can get the help they need.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders).

Mr. President, we have just passed the NASA \nreauthorization bill. It is noteworthy that next week, October 1, is \nthe 50th anniversary of the start of the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration, and if my colleagues will recall, that was 1958. My \ncolleagues may remember what was happening. The Soviet Union had \nsurprised us by putting into orbit the first satellite, Sputnik, and \nAmerica, in the midst of the Cold War among two superpowers, was \nabsolutely shocked that we were behind in our technology; that we could \nnot be premier. Then, lo and behold, 3 years later, they shocked us \nagain by putting the first human in orbit, Yuri Gagarin, for one orbit \nwhen, in fact, we only had a rocket, the Redstone, that could get a \nhuman into suborbit. Then, we put Alan Shepard and subsequently Gus \nGrissom in suborbit, and then, in the meantime, the Soviet Union put \nTitov into several orbits. Of course, the\n\n[[Page S9472]]\n\neyes of the world then focused in on Cape Canaveral, when a young \nmarine, one of the original seven American astronauts, named John \nGlenn, climbed into that capsule knowing that the Atlas rocket had a \n20-percent chance of failure. He rode it into the heavens for only \nthree orbits. There was an indication on the instrument panel that his \nheat shield was loose, and as he started the deorbit burn, John Glenn \nknew that if that was an accurate reading, on reentry into the Earth's \nfiery atmosphere, heating up in excess of 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, he \nwould burn up. It is that memorable time when we heard his last words \nbefore he went into the blackout period on radio transmissions: John \nGlenn humming ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic.'' It is hard to tell \nthat story without getting a lump in my throat.\n  Of course, what then happened, months before we flew John Glenn, we \nhad a young President who said: We are going to the Moon and back \nwithin 9 years. This Nation came together. It focused the political \nwill, it provided the resources, and it did what people did not think \ncould be done.\n  A generation of young people so inspired by this Nation's space \nprogram started pouring into the universities, into math and science \nand technology and engineering. That generation that was educated in \nhigh technology has been the generation that has led us to be the \nleader in a global marketplace by producing the technology, the \ninnovations, the intellectual capital that has allowed us to continue \nto be that leader.\n  So it is with that background that this Senator, who has the \nprivilege of chairing the Space and Science Subcommittee within the \nCommerce Committee, wants to say: Happy birthday, NASA. We are sending \nto the House of Representatives tonight this NASA reauthorization bill, \nwhich will give the flexibility to the next President, and his designee \nas the next leader of NASA, the flexibility in a very troubled program \nthat has not had the resources to do all the things that are demanded \nof it to try to continue to keep America preeminent in space; also to \ncontinue to have access to our own International Space Station that we \nbuilt and paid for; and then to chart out a course for the future \nexploration of the heavens that will keep us fulfilling our destiny of \nour character as an American people, which is that by nature we are \nexplorers and adventurers.\n  We never want to give that up. If we ever do, we will be a second-\nrate nation. But we would not because we have always had a frontier, a \nnew frontier. In the development of this country, it used to be \nwestward. Now it is upward and it is inward and that is the frontier we \nwant to continue to explore.\n  So happy birthday, NASA. It is my hope that we will have the House of \nRepresentatives take this up on their suspension calendar tomorrow.\n  I wish to give great credit to the staff who are in the room for the \nmajority and the minority. They all have worked at enormous overload--\nChan Lieu and Jeff Bingham. Jeff, despite the fact of having suffered a \nheart attack earlier this year, and we didn't even let him out of his \nrecuperative bed but that I was on the phone with him getting him to \nstart corralling all these other Senators and House Members so we could \nget a consensus, so we could come together in an agreement.\n  The result tonight is the fact that this has been cleared in a 100-\nmember Senate, when Senators are on edge and they are always looking \nfor something to object to, and there is no objection here, as ruled by \nthe Presiding Officer.\n  My congratulations to all the people, to the staff of the Commerce \nCommittee, and to the staff of the Science and Technology Committee in \nthe House of Representatives, chaired by Congressman Bart Gordon of \nTennessee. I am very grateful for everybody coming together and making \nthis happen.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my subcommittee \nchairman, Senator Bill Nelson, in bringing this legislation to the \nfloor for consideration and passage. I share his belief that this \nlegislation is an important statement of overwhelming congressional \nintent regarding the future of our Nation's civil space programs.\n  This statement, in the form of legislation we expect to have the \nnear-unanimous support of the Congress, comes at a crucial time for \nNASA and its important programs. Not only do we, as authorizing \ncommittee members, believe it is our responsibility to regularly and \nconsistently offer legislation to authorize appropriations levels, but \nalso to provide a policy framework and guidance for the effective and \nefficient use of those appropriations. The passage of this bill will \nrepresent the first time in over 20 years that NASA authorization bills \nwill have been adopted back-to-back by the Congress.\n  This week we celebrated NASA's 50th anniversary of the legislation \nthat brought NASA into existence on October 1, 1958, and began this \nNation's concerted effort to explore the heavens above us, and the \nuniverse beyond.\n  NASA also finds itself at a unique moment in its history, where it is \nundertaking a major shift in its contribution to the human exploration \nand utilization of space. In just two more years, we will see the \ncompletion of the International Space Station, which NASA has been \ndeveloping, in cooperation with its 16 international partners, to serve \nas a unique laboratory in space--one that will finally be equipped with \nits full complement of research facilities, and inhabited by a full \ncrew of six astronauts and researchers.\n  Three years ago, the Congress enacted legislation which, among many \nother things, designated the U.S. portion of the space station--and the \nroughly fifty percent of our partner-built laboratories that we are \nallocated in exchange for launching and operating the station and its \nmodules--as a National Laboratory. Already we are seeing the interest \nin using those unique orbiting facilities increase, as Memoranda of \nUnderstanding have been signed between NASA and the National Institutes \nof Health and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to pave the way for \ntheir use of those facilities for research that will benefit life on \nEarth. Other agreements have been signed and more are under \ndevelopment. The research future of the space station is beginning to \nshine brighter than it has in recent years.\n  NASA is preparing itself to turn its own focus outward from the \nEarth, once it has completed paving the way for others to carry forward \nthe utilization of the space station and low-earth orbit. This \nlegislation, like its predecessor in 2005, underscores the \ncongressional commitment to see that new mission move forward--and even \nmore quickly than currently planned, in terms of developing the \npostshuttle vehicles that will enable that new Vision for Exploration.\n  I am especially pleased that this legislation includes the clear \nrecognition of a unique and important facility in my own State--the \nMichoud Assembly Facility--the important role it will play in the \ndevelopment and production of the space shuttle replacement vehicles, \nas it has done for over a quarter of a century in the space shuttle \nprogram. It includes language that will help to clarify the details of \nthat role, for Michoud and for the other NASA facilities and Centers \nthat most directly support human space launch development and \noperations, such as the nearby Stennis Research Center, the Marshall \nSpace flight Center, Johnson Space Center, and, of course the Kennedy \nSpace Center.\n  All of these facilities--and their extremely talented and capable \nemployees--are facing what could be a difficult transition, as one \nsystem winds down and another grows up to take its place. This \nlegislation demonstrates that the Congress is aware of the fear and \nuncertainty that can accompany such a transition, and includes initial \nsteps we have taken to mitigate these concerns and address the impacts \nof such redirection of work and skills. We must act quickly and \neffectively to minimize the disruption of jobs--and people's lives and \nlivelihood. Some of those impacts are already being felt, in Michoud \nand other facilities, as certain of the activities to support the space \nshuttle program are already winding down. The legislation includes \nlanguage to help us know, well in advance, when more of those kinds of \nchanges will occur, so that we can monitor them and ensure the tools \nand resources are in place to deal with them.\n  We have also been able to address the situation that has arisen \nrecently as\n\n[[Page S9473]]\n\nthe result of concerns about availability of Soyuz vehicles to ensure \nwe can have crew access to the space station--and a crew escape \ncapability should it ever become necessary for the crew to quickly \nreturn to Earth. While specific steps are being taken in other \nlegislation to address this issue, which is outside the jurisdiction of \nthe Commerce Committee, our bill will ensure we will retain the option, \nat least, to continue space shuttle flights for some period of time, \nshould that prove to be necessary to ensure effective use of the space \nstation. The bill ensures that such an option is preserved, at least \nuntil the end of April, next year, so that the new administration and \nthe Congress will have time to consider the need or desirability of \ntaking that step. And the bill includes a provision that will ensure \nthe Congress will have the results of a study already under way within \nNASA, which would identify and quantify a range of options for \ncontinued shuttle operations over a range of time periods.\n  An important message this legislation is intended to send is that \nNASA should have the resources it needs to carry out the unique and \nvaluable programs that it is asked to conduct for the American people. \nThose programs include a wide range of activity beyond human \nspaceflight. Space Science, such as carried out by the Hubble Space \nTelescope and the other Great Observatories, and the incredible success \nof Martian rovers and interplanetary probes, are not only exciting and \nthrilling to watch, but, like their human spaceflight counterparts, \nhelp inspire entire generations to pursue science, technology, \nengineering and mathematics in school--and help guarantee the Nation's \nstrong leadership role in the global community of nations. NASA's Earth \nscience programs provide answers about our own spaceship Earth that are \nessential to help us understand and use the resources our earthy home \nwisely and understand the true nature of our impact on the environment, \nand ways we can help mitigate those impacts responsibly.\n\n  Research in advanced concepts in aeronautics carried out by NASA \nplays a key role in ensuring the safe and efficient operations of our \naviation industry, and in identifying the new technologies and systems \nthat will drive the future developments of aeronautics systems and \nvehicles that we cannot even imagine today.\n  In short, the legislation provides a balanced level of funding and \nemphasis on all of NASA's key missions. To do all of these things, we \nhave increased the authorized funding levels for NASA more than $2 \nbillion above the amount requested for fiscal year 2009. We do not do \nso with the expectation that such an increased level of funding will be \nable to be appropriated. We understand the fiscal challenges we all \nface and I am among those who has and will always stand for reducing \nthe size of government and ensuring that the government moves more in \nthe direction of doing only those things that cannot be done by the \nprivate sector.\n  I believe that what NASA does, when it works at the leading edge of \nscience and exploration, is doing things that no other entity, public \nor private, can do. We must be sure to always be alert, however, for \nopportunities for NASA to help private and commercial entities use the \nnew technologies and techniques developed in research to place \nthemselves in a position to move into areas once seen as the purview of \nNASA--such as the commercial orbital space transportation system, \nintended to enable private entities to provide launch and cargo--and \none day crew--delivery to and from the International Space Station. \nThis legislation includes provisions to help ensure the expanded \ndevelopment of a commercial space industry that can effectively--and \neconomically--operate in both low-earth orbit and eventually \nparticipate in the exploration of the Moon--and beyond.\n  I believe we need to view the funds authorized to accomplish NASA's \nobjectives more as investments than simply expenditures. We have had 50 \nyears of experience which demonstrates that money invested in NASA \nprograms yields technology gains and scientific excellence that has \nprovided massive returns on that investment. One doesn't have to look \nvery far to see the benefits to mankind from those programs. To list \nthem all--even the obvious ones--would take volumes.\n  In years past, there have been efforts by private economic experts to \nquantify the value returned to the economy of this Nation from the \nproduct of NASA research and exploration. Those estimates have ranged \nfrom $7 to $9 returned to the economy for every dollar spent by NASA. \nSuch estimates are hard to prove beyond a shadow of doubt and are based \non assumptions that mayor may not be valid. But even if they are wildly \nexaggerated, and the return on investment is only something like $1 \nback to the economy for every dollar spent. How many government \nprograms could one say that about?\n  I have described some of what I believe to be the very important and \npositive aspects of the legislation and the agency programs and \ninitiatives it supports. We also have important and difficult issues \nthat will need to be addressed which we have not been able to fully \ndeal with in this bill. Many people are deeply concerned about the fact \nthat, between the retirement of the space shuttle, planned for 2010, \nand the availability of the Ares 1 Rocket and the Orion Crew \nExploration vehicle, there could be a 3- to 6-year gap, during which \nthis nation would not have the capability to independently launch \nhumans into space. That this period of time--however long it proves to \nbe--would begin, under the present plan, precisely at the time we have \nfinally completed the space station and it is available for research \nand scientific uses, makes that gap even less acceptable. It makes \nlittle sense for us not to be able to get U.S. scientists and \nastronauts there to conduct the long-awaited research that can only be \ndone in that unique microgravity environment.\n  As I mentioned we have attempted to address part of that problem in \nlanguage and authorized funding that would accelerate the development \nof shuttle replacement vehicles. That addresses the ``back end'' of the \ngap. But I would like to have seen more flexibility in the bill to \nenable the assessment of other options, besides extension of the \nshuttle program, or even in combination with that, to develop \nalternative capabilities in the short-term. We were unable to preserve \nthe flexibility we had started with in our reported bill during the \npreconferencing and negotiations with the House leading to the \nagreement on the language we are presenting today. But I hope we will \nbe able to more thoughtfully and fully address that issue as we begin \nnext year to develop the next NASA Reauthorization Act.\n  I believe this legislation represents a strong and important message \nof support for ensuring the United States maintains its leadership \nposition in space exploration. I remind my colleagues that the \nsubstitute amendment we are offering has been fully agreed to in \nadvance by the House Science Committee, and the amended House bill can \nbe swiftly accepted by the House when we return it to them, and sent to \nthe President before this Congress adjourns for the year. I urge my \ncolleagues to support passage of our substitute amendment to the House \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9473-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9473-S9474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             GREAT LAKES LEGACY REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, today I wish Senator Allard well as he \nleaves the Senate, after 12 years here and 6 years in the other body. \nThat is a long record of honorable service to the wonderful State of \nColorado. During our time together in the Senate, I was very pleased to \nwork with Senator Allard on a critical issue facing both our States: \nchronic wasting disease. I appreciated his commitment to fighting the \nspread of CWD, which was characteristic of his commitment to the people \nof Colorado throughout his time here. I wish him all the best as he \nleaves the Senate, and I thank him for his years of dedicated service \nto our country.\n\n\n                              Larry Craig\n\n  Mr. President, as Senator Craig retires from the Senate, I want to \ntake a few moments to recognize him and thank him for his work on \nbehalf of the people of Idaho. He devoted 18 years to serving the \npeople of Idaho in the Senate, following 10 years of service in the \nHouse of Representatives. Senator Craig and I worked together in two \nvery different, very important areas: protecting civil liberties and \nsupporting America's dairy farmers. In both cases, he was dedicated to \nthe best interests of the people of Idaho, and I am grateful for his \nefforts.\n  Senator Craig was a key member of the group of six Senators--three \nRepublicans and three Democrats, including myself--who worked together \nto try to strengthen the protections for Americans' privacy rights in \nthe Patriot Act reauthorization that we considered in the Senate during \nthe 109th Congress. His willingness to work across party lines on that \nissue was commendable, and it was a critical boost to our efforts. \nSenator Craig understands the importance of protecting Americans' \nfreedoms, and I applaud his commitment to these issues.\n  I also thank him for his consistent support of dairy farmers, another \narea where we frequently worked together. Senator Craig and I shared \nconcerns about the impact of the Australia free trade agreement on \ndairy farmers, on the threat of unsafe importation of milk protein \nconcentrates, and on nonfat milk price reporting errors.\n  Once again on these issues, Senator Craig put the needs of the people \nof Idaho first, and reached across the aisle to protect hardworking \ndairy farmers. After 28 years of service in Congress, Senator Craig is \nretiring from the Senate, and I wish him all the best. His hard work \nand dedication have made a valuable contribution to the Senate and to \nthe American people.\n\n\n                             Pete Domenici\n\n  Mr. President, today I thank Senator Domenici for his 36 years of \nservice here in the Senate, longer than any New Mexican in the State's \nhistory. I have had the pleasure of serving with Senator Domenici on \nthe Budget Committee, where his leadership has been a cornerstone of \nthe committee's work for decades. I have always appreciated his \nwillingness to listen to and accommodate different points of view \nthrough the years. I also thank him for his work on biennial budgeting, \nsomething I also strongly support and was proud to work on with him.\n  Senator Domenici's commitment to mental health parity is well known \nand deserves special recognition. It is fitting that, on the eve of \nSenator Domenici's retirement, the Mental Health Parity Act of 2008, \nwhich he worked on with Senators Dodd, Kennedy and Enzi, should pass \nthe Senate. I was pleased to cosponsor this bill and look forward to it \nbeing enacted.\n  Finally, I thank Senator Domenici for his vote in support of the \nMcCain-Feingold legislation when it passed the Senate in 2002. It was \nhis support, along with 59 other Senators, that gave us that victory \nafter a long fight to ban soft money. I will always remember and \nappreciate his support, and I wish him all the best as he retires from \nthe Senate.\n\n\n                              Chuck Hagel\n\n  Mr. President, today I recognize the work of an outstanding \ncolleague, Senator Chuck Hagel. As he leaves the Senate, there are many \nthings he will be remembered for, and I will add a few to that long \nlist. I have had the pleasure of serving with Senator Hagel on both the \nForeign Relations and Intelligence committees, where I have seen what a \nthoughtful and dedicated public servant he truly is. He has been an \noutspoken and independent voice on foreign policy, and against the \ncurrent Administration's reckless foreign policies, including the \ndisastrous war in Iraq.\n  In our time serving together in the Senate, we have worked on a \nnumber of bills relevant to our work on the Foreign Relations and \nIntelligence committees. Senator Hagel and I authored a bill to address \nthe serious threat posed to our national security by gaps in our \nintelligence gathering. Building\n\n[[Page S9475]]\n\non the work of the 9/11 Commission, our legislation would establish an \nindependent commission to improve how the U.S. Government collects and \nanalyzes information, so that we can head off emerging threats. Senator \nHagel has brought critical attention to this issue, and I have no doubt \nhe will continue to do so in the years ahead. I also appreciate Senator \nHagel's commitment to strengthening our citizen diplomacy, which is so \nimportant to improving the image of the U.S. abroad. His support for my \nGlobal Services Fellowship Program Act, and past efforts on this issue, \nhas been just one more example of Senator Hagel's willingness to reach \nacross the aisle to work on issues important to our country.\n  As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on African \nAffairs, I particularly appreciate Senator Hagel's support for a more \npeaceful, secure, and prosperous Africa. He has supported efforts to \nhelp protect civilians and provide them with access to basic services. \nHis voice has been one for political solutions to conflict, and for \ninitiatives that would bring long-term stability to the continent.\n  Senator Hagel has served the people of Nebraska, and America, with \ngreat dedication and skill. I will miss having him as a colleague, but \nI value his service and his friendship, and I wish him all the best as \nhe leaves the Senate.\n\n\n                              John Warner\n\n  Mr. President, today I thank Senator John Warner for his service to \nour country. Through his five terms in the Senate, and before that as \nSecretary of the Navy, Senator Warner has been an outstanding public \nservant. In the Senate he has worked hard for our country, and for the \npeople of Virginia. As chairman and now ranking member of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, Senator Warner has been a leader on a wide \nrange of issues affecting our national security, and he has always \napproached those issues with the utmost determination to do what is \nbest for the Nation and the American people.\n  Finally, I thank Senator Warner for his vote in support of the \nMcCain-Feingold legislation when it passed the Senate in 2002. It was \nhis support, along with 59 other Senators, that gave us that victory \nafter a long fight to ban soft money. I appreciate his effort on this \nand so many issues, and I thank him for his dedicated public service \nover so many years.\n\n\n                              WAYNE ALLARD\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great \nU.S. Senator and friend, Senator Wayne Allard. His strong political \nleadership will be greatly missed by the people of Colorado and the \nUnited States.\n  I got to serve with Wayne on the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs Committee and the Senate Budget Committee. As fellow fiscal \nconservatives, we share many of the same values and concerns. One of \nhis core beliefs, and mine, is that we must reduce wasteful government \nspending and work to balance the Federal budget. This is a philosophy \nthat Wayne applied to every piece of legislation that came in front of \nhim. It was important for him to do everything he could do as a public \nservant to save the taxpayers' money. I know that I could always count \non Wayne to follow these principals and stay true to his conservative \nroots.\n  As many of you know, Wayne had a successful career as a veterinarian \nbefore he came to Congress. With the help of his wife Joan, they built \na successful veterinary practice in Loveland, CO, where they raised \ntheir two daughters, Christi and Cheryl. As a veterinarian and as a \nU.S. Senator, Wayne contributed more than most to the people of this \ncountry. He will be greatly missed by me here in the Senate, but I know \nhe is looking forward to spending more time with his family back in \nColorado. I wish Wayne the best of luck as he begins the next chapter \nof his life.\n\n\n                              LARRY CRAIG\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to join my fellow Senators to honor a colleague \nand a friend, Senator Larry Craig, who is departing the U.S. Senate at \nthe close of this Congress. I have enjoyed working with Senator Craig \nover the last 20 years--first in the U.S. House of Representatives and \nlater in the U.S. Senate.\n  While in the Senate, I have had the great fortune of serving with \nLarry on the Senate Energy Committee. He is a revered advocate of \nenergy, public lands, and rural community issues. The two of us have \nstood together on numerous issues--most notably energy--and I have \nalways believed that we could achieve any task because I had his voice \nof reason and intellect by my side.\n  Senator Craig has shown the ability to keep a close eye on issues \nthat matter most to citizens back in Idaho, while also looking out for \nall Americans. Whether the issue of the day was rural schools, western \nranchers, public water, innovative forms of energy, and yes, even \nwolves, Senator Craig has proven that he is up for any challenge.\n  I would be mistaken to not mention the extraordinary work Senator \nCraig has done as a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. \nHis work has been instrumental to ensure that all citizens who are part \nof our armed services--including servicemembers, family members and \nsurvivors of veterans--are provided the world-class care and benefits \nthey have earned. I thank him for his relentless efforts to improve the \nlives of those who have worn the uniform.\n  I thank the senior Senator from Idaho for his leadership and \ncontributions to public service for the people of Idaho and all \nAmericans. I honor Senator Larry Craig not only for his length of \nservice but more importantly his quality of service. I wish him and his \nloved ones all the best of health for many years to come.\n\n\n                             PETE DOMENICI\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great U.S. Senator \nand friend, Senator Pete Domenici. His tireless work as New Mexico's \nlongest serving Senator in history has greatly benefitted the people of \nhis State and the United States of America. I am proud to have served \nwith such a great statesman.\n  During his time in the Senate, Pete has been instrumental in passing \nthousands of pieces of legislation on many different issues. However, I \ngot the distinct honor of serving with him on the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, where he serves as the ranking member and \nformer chairman. Over the years, he has been instrumental in passing \ncomprehensive energy legislation to help our Nation adapt to changing \nenergy needs and demands. By working side by side with Pete on the \ncommittee, I have gotten to witness firsthand the hard work he puts \ninto every piece of legislation that comes before him. He also has the \nability to reach across the aisle to other Senators who routinely join \nhim in passing bipartisan bills to benefit our country. I know that I \ncan speak for all of my colleagues, when I say that Pete's absence will \nbe felt by all of us.\n  While I will greatly miss my friend's leadership on the Senate floor \nand in the Energy Committee, I know that he is looking forward to \nretirement and being able to spend some much-deserved time off with his \nwife Nancy and their family. I want to thank Pete for his contributions \nhere in the Senate and wish him and his family well as they enter into \na new chapter in their lives.\n\n\n                              JOHN WARNER\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to honor my friend from Virginia, Senator \nJohn Warner. John and I have been friends since I was elected to the \nSenate in 1998.\n  As a true Virginian, John has dedicated his life to serving his \ncountry. At the age of 17 he enlisted in the U.S. Navy beginning his \nlong career of public service. After serving on active military duty in \nboth World War II and the Korean war, John went on to serve in the \nDepartment of the Navy, and led the Department as Secretary from 1972-\n1974.\n  Elected in 1978, John is the second longest serving Senator from the \nCommonwealth of Virginia in the history of the Senate. John has served \nthe people of Virginia well for 30 years and I know his family and the \npeople of Virginia are proud to call him one of their own.\n  John has a long list of accomplishments to show for the people of \nVirginia and the Nation. His leadership in the Senate will be missed \nand it has truly been an honor serving with him.\n  I would like to thank John for his contributions to the Senate and \nwish him well as he opens a new chapter to his life.\n\n[[Page S9476]]\n\n                              CHUCK HAGEL\n\n  Mr. President, today I pay tribute to my distinguished colleague from \nNebraska, Senator Chuck Hagel, who will be retiring from the Senate at \nthe conclusion of the 110th Congress.\n  I have worked with Chuck since coming over to the Senate in 1998. I \nhave also had the privilege of serving on the Senate Banking Committee \nwith Chuck. He is a man of integrity and patriotism. Chuck has served \nhis country proudly throughout the years, whether it be working as a \nstaffer for Congressman John McCollister of Nebraska, as Deputy \nAdministrator of the Veterans Administration, as U.S. Senator, or \nearning the Purple Heart while defending the freedoms we enjoy today. \nHe has a servant's heart and the people of Nebraska should be proud to \nhave been represented by a man of his character.\n  I am honored to know him and to have worked with him. I would like to \nthank Chuck for his contributions to the Senate and to the country we \nboth love. I wish him and his family the best in all of their future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9476-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9476-S9477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DC GUN LAWS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong \nopposition to H.R. 6842, which would repeal the commonsense gun laws of \nthe District of Columbia.\n  I believe this bill is reckless and irresponsible, and will lead to \nmore weapons and violence on the streets of our Nation's Capital. It \nwill endanger the citizens of the District of Columbia, the government \nemployees who work there, our elected officials, and anyone who visits \nWashington, DC.\n  The House bill repeals laws promoting public safety, including DC \nlaws that the U.S. Supreme Court indicated were permissible under the \n2nd amendment in the Heller decision.\n  I strongly disagree with the Supreme Court's decision in Heller that \nthe 2nd amendment gives individuals a right to possess guns for private \npurposes not related to state militias, and that the Constitution does \nnot permit a general ban on handguns in the home.\n  However, it is important to note that Heller also stands for the \nproposition that reasonable, commonsense gun regulations are entirely \npermissible.\n  Justice Scalia, who wrote the majority opinion in Heller, noted that \na wide variety of gun laws are ``presumptively lawful,'' including laws \n``forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places'' and \nregulations governing the ``conditions and qualifications on the \ncommercial sale of arms.'' Even bans on ``dangerous and unusual \nweapons'' are completely appropriate under the Heller decision.\n  The House bill completely ignores this language and takes the \napproach that all guns, for all people, at all times is the only way to \ngo after Heller.\n  It is worth noting just how far the House bill goes in repealing DC \nlaw and just how unsafe it will make the streets of DC.\n  The bill would do the following: It would repeal DC's ban on semi-\nautomatic weapons, including assault weapons.\n  If this bill becomes law, military-style assault weapons with high \ncapacity ammunition magazines will be allowed to be stockpiled in homes \nand businesses in the District, even near Federal buildings like the \nWhite House.\n  Even the .50 caliber sniper rifle, with a range of over 1 mile, will \nbe allowed in DC under the House bill. This is a weapon capable of \nfiring rounds that can penetrate concrete and armor plating. And at \nleast one model of the .50 caliber sniper rifle is easily concealed and \ntransported. One gun manufacturer describes it as a ``lightweight and \ntactical'' and capable of being collapsed and carried in ``a very small \ninconspicuous package.''\n  There is simply no good reason why anyone needs semi-automatic \nassault weapons in an urban city. It is unfathomable to me that the \nsame high-powered sniper-rifle used by our Armed Forces in Iraq and \nAfghanistan will be permitted in our Nation's Capital. Yet this is \nexactly what the House bill would allow if passed by the Senate.\n  The House bill would repeal existing Federal anti-gun trafficking \nlaws. For years, Federal law has banned gun dealers from selling \nhandguns directly to out-of-State buyers who are not licensed firearm \ndealers. This has greatly helped in the fight against illegal \ninterstate gun trafficking, and has prevented criminals from traveling \nto other States to buy guns.\n  The House bill repeals this longstanding Federal law and allows DC \nresidents to cross State lines to buy handguns in neighboring States. \nIllegal gun traffickers will be able to easily obtain large quantities \nof firearms outside of DC and then distribute those guns to criminals \nin DC and surrounding States.\n  The House bill repeals DC law restricting the ability of dangerous \nand unqualified people to obtain guns.\n  The bill also repeals many of the gun regulations that the Supreme \nCourt said were completely appropriate after Heller. It repeals the DC \nprohibition on persons under the age of 21 from possessing firearms, \nand it repeals all age limits for the possession of long guns, \nincluding assault weapons. The House bill even repeals the DC law \nprohibiting gun possession by people who have poor vision. \nUnbelievably, under the House bill, DC would be barred from having any \nvision requirement for gun use, even if someone is blind.\n  The House bill repeals all firearm registration requirements in \nWashington, DC. The bill repeals all registration requirements for \nfirearms, making it even more difficult for law enforcement to trace \nguns used in crimes and tracing them to their registered owner.\n  The House bill repeals all existing safe storage laws and prohibits \nDC from enacting any more safe storage laws. After the Heller decision, \nDC passed emergency legislation allowing guns to be unlocked for self-\ndefense, but requiring that they otherwise be locked to keep guns from \nchildren and criminals. The House bill prevents the DC City Council \nfrom enacting new legislation to replace the emergency law, as well as \nfrom enacting any laws that ``discourage'' gun ownership or require \nsafe storage of firearms.\n  Every major gun manufacturer recommends that guns be kept unloaded, \nlocked, and kept in a safe place. Under the House bill, DC could not \nenact any legislation requiring that guns be stored in a safe place, \neven in homes with children.\n  How can anyone believe that enacting these provisions in the House \nbill and eliminating DC's commonsense gun laws is the right thing to \ndo?\n  The American people clearly do not agree with the House bill. A \nrecent national poll found that 69 percent of Americans oppose Congress \npassing a law to eliminate Washington, DC's, gun laws. Additionally, 60 \npercent of Americans believe that Washington, DC, will become less safe \nif Congress takes that step.\n  As a former mayor who saw firsthand what happens when guns fall into \nthe hands of criminals, juveniles, and the mentally ill, I believe that \nthe House bill places the families of the District of Columbia in great \njeopardy.\n  The bill puts innocent lives at stake. It is an affront to the public \nsafety of the District of Columbia, as well as the right to home rule \nby its citizens.\n  This isn't just a bad law, it is a dangerous one. If this bill comes \nto the floor of the U.S. Senate, I will do everything in my power to \nstop it.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on June 26, 2008, in the landmark District \nof Columbia v. Heller decision, the United States Supreme Court \ndecisively confirmed what Oklahomans have known for a long time: we as \nAmericans have an individual right to legally possess and use a \nfirearm.\n  Prior to the Heller decision, DC, had the most restrictive gun \ncontrol laws in the country. The District effectively banned handguns \nin homes and required all licensed firearms to be unloaded and \ndissembled or bound by a trigger lock or similar device.\n  Not only did the Supreme Court deem the DC gun ban unconstitutional, \nit also positively affirmed that ``(t)he Second Amendment protects an \nindividual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a \nmilitia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as \nself-defense within the home.''\n  I was very satisfied with the Supreme Court's decision in District of \nColumbia v. Heller. Before the Supreme Court heard this case, the \nentire Oklahoma delegation signed onto an amicus brief to the Supreme \nCourt, urging the\n\n[[Page S9477]]\n\nCourt to affirm that the second amendment protects an individual right \nto possess firearms. With the signatures of Vice President Cheney, 55 \nSenators, and 250 Members of the House of Representatives, this amicus \nbrief had the support of more Members of Congress than any other amicus \nbrief in known history.\n  Unfortunately, it did not come as a great surprise that soon after \nthe Supreme Court decided the Heller case, the DC City Council began \nexploring new ways to restrict firearm possession in the District.\n  In response, on September 17, the House of Representatives passed the \nNational Capital Security and Safety Act, H.R. 6842, by an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote of 266-152. This bill prohibits the DC government from \npassing any law to restrict firearms in a person's home, business, or \nland. Additionally, the legislation rolls back the restrictions that \nthe DC government has implemented that prohibit the registration of \ncertain types of firearms. The bill also allows residents of the \nDistrict of Columbia to purchase firearms from licensed dealers in the \nneighboring states of Virginia and Maryland.\n  After the House of Representatives passed this important bill, I \njoined 47 of my colleagues in the Senate in sending a letter to \nMajority Leader Reid asking him to bring up H.R. 6842 for consideration \nin the Senate. I sincerely hope that the Senate has the opportunity to \ndebate and vote on this bill and send it to President Bush this year.\n  I have tenaciously fought to preserve the right of individual \ncitizens to keep and bear arms since my first days in Congress. I will \ncontinue in this next stage of the battle over the interpretation of \nthe second amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9477-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9477-S9478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CITIZENSHIP APPLICATION BACKLOGS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, following Republican opposition to the \nSenate's effort to pass a comprehensive immigration bill last summer, \nPresident Bush and other Republicans moved on and away from this \nadmirable goal. They chose, instead, to accommodate the most extreme \nviews in their party with respect to immigration. Secretary Chertoff \nturned to mass immigration raids and building border walls that have \nconsumed millions of taxpayer dollars, tread on the rights of property \nowners along the southern border, scarred the environment and tarnished \nthe reputation of the United States around the world.\n  One aspect of the immigration debate on which I have continued to \npress this year is the backlog in citizenship applications. Last year, \nthe administration insisted on a fee increase for citizenship \napplications and assured us it would cut processing time if authorized. \nThat increase, along with the increased enforcement activities, and an \nimpending presidential election, combined to result in a surge in \ncitizenship applications. In just three months, May, June, and July of \n2007, the immigration agency received over 700,000 citizenship \napplications. By last October, the agency had over 1 million \ncitizenship applications pending, and a significant backlog had \ndeveloped. Yet the administration did little. Its response reminded me \nof its preparations for Hurricane Katrina or the current financial \nmeltdown. The anticipated surge in applications was not adequately \nplanned for but resulted in a crisis before the administration would \nbegin to notice.\n  In early 2008, Senator Kennedy and I pressed Secretary Chertoff. We \njoined, along with Senator Schumer, in writing to the Homeland Security \nSecretary about this problem in advance of our April 2008 oversight \nhearing.\n  At the April hearing, I asked Secretary Chertoff for a firm \ncommitment that persons who had applied for U.S. citizenship by March \n31, 2008, would have their applications processed in time to register \nand vote in the upcoming Presidential election. Seven months should \nhave been adequate to consider these applications, especially when the \nagency had sold the increase in fees to us by saying it would cut \nprocessing time to less than seven months.\n  When Secretary Chertoff sought to excuse his delays by blaming the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, for being slow to clear name \nchecks, we made sure to provide the FBI with additional resources.\n  At our most recent FBI oversight hearing with Director Mueller last \nweek, I continued to raise the issue. At one point, the backlog in \ncitizenship applications was 1 million. By this spring, it was still \nnearly half a million. After the most recent oversight hearing, we were \ntold that it has been significantly reduced and now numbers in the tens \nof thousands. I thank the agents at the FBI and U.S. Customs and \nImmigration Services, USCIS, for their hard work.\n  The monthly updates we demanded have been helpful not only to us, but \napparently also to encourage progress within the agency. That is, of \ncourse, still too many. No one who has been here, working hard, \nfollowing the law, who has applied for citizenship more than 6 months \nago, ought to be denied participation in the upcoming Presidential \nelection because the Homeland Security bureaucracy has been too slow to \nprocess his or her application.\n  Now is the time for the agency to make a final push to process the \nremaining backlog of applications by the end of this month so that \nlawful immigrants will have time to register and will be able to vote. \nIt is unacceptable that tens of thousands of people, some of whom have \nbeen waiting for 2 years to have their applications processed, will be \nleft in limbo and unable to participate as citizens during the \nelections in November. So there is still significant work to do.\n  The Senate took an important step Wednesday night when it passed S. \n2840, the Military Personnel Citizenship Processing Act. I am pleased \nthe Senate has given its unanimous support to this legislation.\n  This bill is intended to help the Department of Homeland Security and \nUSCIS expedite citizenship applications for members of the Armed Forces \nby creating a liaison with the FBI and by setting processing deadlines \nfor these applications. Those who serve in our military and who wish to \nbecome citizens do not deserve to experience unnecessary bureaucratic \ndelays. Their dedication to the United States, and their desire to \nbecome full participants in the democracy they help defend, ought to be \nmet with a process that is as fair and efficient as possible.\n  The legislation the Senate passed last night will help to streamline \nthe citizenship process for the legal permanent residents who have \nserved the country they wish to call their own. I hope that this \nlegislation will help move Congress toward seeking additional \nimprovements in the citizenship process for everyone. The granting of \ncitizenship is one of the most sacred privileges our Nation conveys, \nand only comes to those who have worked hard to achieve it. Ensuring \nthat it is carried out with care and efficiency is a goal all members \nof congress should support.\n  I thank Senators Schumer and Hagel for successfully moving this \nlegislation through the Senate, and thank all Senators for supporting \nthis measure.\n  I commend Senator Kennedy, Senator Schumer and the other members of \nthe Judiciary Committee who have worked with me all year in our \noversight effort to ensure that the citizenship application backlog of \n1 million would be eradicated. Senator Kennedy, in particular, is \nsomeone who has been unrelenting in his focus on this issue and \ncharacteristically fought for fairness, dignity and the rights of those \nleast powerful among us. Senator Kennedy is our longtime chairman of \nthe Immigration subcommittee, and has led the Senate on immigration \nmatters for years. He asked me to express his appreciation to USCIS for \nits progress in clearing up the backlog in naturalization applications \nthat otherwise would have deprived over a million eligible citizens the \nopportunity to participate in our democracy during this fall's \nelection. He asked me to say that the right to vote is the most \nprecious right that American citizens have. He welcomes these new \nAmericans, and he urges them to go to the polls this November.\n  I hope that as a new administration takes office and begins to help \nthis Nation rise above the divisiveness, corruption, and failures of \nthe last 8 years, we can renew our commitment to immigration reform. \nThe answer does not lie in policies based on fear or isolationism, but \nin a restoration of America's rightful role in the world. It does\n\n[[Page S9478]]\n\nnot lie in denying children the opportunity for an education. It does \nnot lie in denying American farmers and small business owners willing \nworkers, nor does it lie in exploiting foreign labor to disadvantage \nAmerican workers. And the answer does not lie in raiding workplace \nafter workplace, tearing apart families, or building walls along our \nborders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9478-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the need for hate \ncrimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate \ncrimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes \nlaw, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our \nsociety. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor on many \noccasions to highlight a separate violent, hate-motivated crime that \nhas occurred in our country.\n  On the evening of August 9, 2008, 24-year-old Michael Roike was \nleaving the Playbill Cafe a Washington, DC, area bar with three of his \nfriends when they noticed an SUV parked next door nearby. The SUV \ncarried several men who reportedly spoke with Roike and his friends. \nThe conversation allegedly began casually but escalated when the men \nfrom the SUV repeatedly used the word ``faggot.'' One of Roike's \nfriends, Stevon-Christophe Burrell, 29, allegedly became upset and \nasked the men to leave them alone. In response, a male from the SUV \nreportedly approached Burrell aggressively. Roike said he stepped \nbetween them and tried to diffuse the situation, but Roike recounts \nthat he suddenly felt pain in the left side of his head and hit the \nground. Burrell was also struck before the attackers fled back to the \nvehicle and drove away. While no suspects have been apprehended, the \nMetropolitan Police Department report lists the attack as a ''simple \nassault,'' filing it as a hate crime based on sexual orientation.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9478-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATO MEMBERSHIP FOR ALBANIA AND CROATIA\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the NATO Alliance is now considering its \nthird round of post-Cold War enlargement. This will be the smallest of \nthe rounds, with only two countries to consider compared to three in \n1999 and seven in 2004. It should also be easiest, since the \ndevelopment of Membership Actions Plans allow NATO significantly more \npreinvitation interaction with aspirants today than took place in \nearlier rounds. Albania and Croatia were formally invited at the April \nNATO Summit in Bucharest, Romania. Macedonia did not receive an \ninvitation because of its lingering name dispute with Greece, and \nseveral European allies were unwilling to go forward with Membership \nAction Plans for Georgia and Ukraine.\n  In March of this year, the Helsinki Commission, which I cochair, held \na hearing on the prospects for NATO enlargement which included \ntestimony from expert analysts and contributions from the embassies of \nthese five countries. We have also had hearings on the matter in the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee which included administration views. \nIt is important for the Senate to act on these protocols quickly so \nthat ratification by all NATO countries can be completed in a timely \nmatter.\n  Turning to the records of the two aspirants, Albania has made \ntremendous strides since 1991, and the country is solidly committed to \nEuro-Atlantic integration. This is demonstrated by its contribution to \nnumerous peace operations around the world. There are concerns about \norganized crime and official corruption in Albania, but I believe the \ncountry is well aware of these concerns and is continuing to undertake \nefforts to address them. The country is also aware of the need for \nfurther electoral reform before parliamentary elections next June.\n  Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Dan Fried credibly \nasserted before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that ``countries \ncontinue reforms rather than abandon them, when they join the \nalliance,'' and this particularly applies to Albania given its ongoing \nEU aspirations. In that spirit, I want to express my support for \nAlbania's NATO membership, which will strengthen the alliance as well \nas the prospects for further reform in Albania.\n  Croatia is clearly ready for NATO membership. Its democratic \ncredentials are very strong. Recovering from the violent breakup of \nYugoslavia, the country essentially shed its extreme nationalist \nleanings in 2000 and has been in rapid transition ever since. Croatia \nis also preparing for EU membership, boosting reform efforts, and it \nhas become an increasingly active and helpful player in world affairs. \nI therefore want to express my strong support for Croatia's NATO \nmembership as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9478-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9478-S9479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CMS CERTIFICATIONS OF HRSA RURAL HEALTH CLINIC DESIGNATIONS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, yesterday we passed the Health Care Safety \nNet Act, which reauthorizes multiple programs within the jurisdiction \nof the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, HELP. This \nbill does include one section that changes the timeframe for the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, to certify rural \nhealth clinic, RHC, shortage area designations from 3 years to 4 years. \nWe have worked closely with the chairman and ranking member of the HELP \nCommittee to have language included in H.R. 3343 to align the timeframe \nfor CMS certifications of rural health clinic designations with the \ntimeframe for HRSA designations. This provision is crucial to \nmaintaining access to primary care and other necessary medical services \nin rural areas. I know that several rural health clinics in Montana \nwould be forced to close their doors if the CMS rule were permitted to \ngo forth. I am proud to stand with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to ensure that these important parts of our health care delivery \nsystem are protected.\n  We are most appreciative of the efforts of the HELP Committee to \ninclude this language at our request. As chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, I am obligated to point out for the record that Medicare is \nexclusively governed by title XVIII of the Social Security Act, which \nis under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. Inclusion \nof these Medicare provisions in H.R. 3343 does not represent any waiver \nof the Finance Committee's jurisdiction on this subject. In the absence \nof the Chairman of the HELP Committee, Senator Kennedy, I would ask the \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Enzi, to acknowledge that \nMedicare is governed by title XVIII of the Social Security Act and is \nunder the exclusive jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. Again, I \nwould like to extend our thanks to the chairman and ranking member of \nthe HELP Committee for graciously agreeing to our request to include \nthis language in H.R. 3343.\n  Mr. ENZI. It is a great pleasure to work with my distinguished \ncolleagues on H.R. 3343, the Health Care Safety Net Act. The Committee \non Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has a long and distinguished \nhistory of championing legislation improving our health care system. \nReauthorization of the health center program, the National Health \nService Corps, rural health care programs, and dental workforce \nprograms are a handful of examples of the successful programs the HELP \nCommittee governs. I have had the pleasure of working with Senators \nKennedy and Hatch on this bill, and I very much appreciate the work of \nSenators Smith, Barrasso, Roberts, and the other sponsors of S. 3367, \nwhich was the genesis of the rural health clinic provision included in \nthis bill. I also sincerely appreciate the contributions of Senators \nBaucus and Grassley, as the rural health provision is under the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee. I look forward to strengthening \nour relationship next year as our two great committees work together on \nhealth care reform, and I am pleased the passage of this bill puts us \none step closer to a higher quality health care system.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree with my colleague, Chairman Baucus, and would\n\n[[Page S9479]]\n\nalso like to extend my thanks to the chairman and ranking member of the \nHELP Committee, Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi, for working with us \non this issue. In my 7 years as chairman and ranking member of the \nFinance Committee, I have worked to preserve the committee's \njurisdiction over legislation amending the Social Security Act, as \nSenator Baucus is doing now. In this case, the CMS certification \nrequirement for rural health clinic designations is governed by title \nXVIII of the Social Security Act, which, as the Chairman has noted, is \nwithin the exclusive jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. The \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 required that rural health clinics be \nlocated in an underserved or shortage area that were designated or \nupdated within the previous 3 years but the 3-year requirement has only \nbeen applied to new facilities seeking to be designated as rural health \nclinics. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, recently \nissued a rule proposing changes in the requirements for rural health \nclinics. One of the proposed changes would apply the 3-year designation \nrequirement to all rural health clinics and decertify RHCs located in \ncommunities where the shortage area designation is more than 3 years \nold.\n  The Health Resources and Services Administration, HRSA, and most \nStates update their shortage area designations every 4 years. We need \nto align the timeframes for HRSA and CMS shortage area designations so \nthat CMS certifications of rural health clinic designations would be \nvalid for a 4-year period, consistent with the 4-year period used for \nHRSA designations. Otherwise, many rural health clinics in Iowa and \nother States throughout the country could lose their RHC designation \nsimply because their State is not able to comply with the new CMS 3-\nyear timeframe for certification.\n  Under the CMS proposal, if an RHC loses its designation or the State \nhas not renewed its shortage area designation within 3 years, the RHC \nmust request an exception within 90 days or it will be decertified 180 \ndays after the 3-year period ends. Unless the statutory 3-year CMS \ncertification period is changed to 4 years, many RHCs could be subject \nto being decertified in the near future unless they are deemed \n``essential.'' Rural health clinics should not be jeopardized with \nclosure because a shortage area designation has not been updated in a \ntimely fashion by the State or Federal Government.\n  CMS has estimated that approximately 500 of the 3,700 rural health \nclinics operating today no longer meet the existing location \nrequirements for RHCs, either because they are not in an area \ndesignated by the U.S. Census Bureau as ``nonurban'' or they are not \ndesignated by HRSA as being located in an eligible shortage area. \nOthers believe that this estimate is too low. The National Rural Health \nAssociation has estimated that the proposed changes to the location \nrequirements could result in up to 45 percent of RHCs being ineligible \nto continue in the program unless they are granted an exception. If \nthis estimate holds true for RHCs throughout the country, over 1,600 \nRHCs could be decertified. This would severely impact access to health \ncare for those in rural and medically underserved areas where rural \nhealth clinics provide the only access to critical medical services.\n  We are most appreciative of the efforts of our colleagues, Senator \nKennedy and Senator Enzi, to amend H.R. 3343 to change the CMS \ncertification period for shortage area designations from 3 to 4 years \nin order to align the CMS certification period for shortage area \ndesignations with HRSA's designation review period.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9479-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9479-S9480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HEALTH INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about health \ninsurance. A year ago, in the spirit of bipartisanship, I joined \nSenator Wyden and Senator Bennett in cosponsoring the Healthy Americans \nAct. The Wyden-Bennett bipartisan legislation offers elements that are \nconsistent with a ``patient-driven'' approach to improving our health \ncare system. A ``patient-driven'' approach means people can shop for \ntheir own health insurance in a competitive marketplace, which will \nallow them to choose the type of health care coverage that meets their \nneeds. Many in the Democratic Party, including the Democratic \nPresidential candidate, want a Government-controlled system that is not \n``patient-driven.'' This is a non-starter and is bad policy. And the \nmajority of Americans do not want the Government making their health \ncare decisions for them.\n  I continue to be interested in exploring ways to reform the health \ncare system through the Tax Code. I am interested in examining whether \nCongress should offer Americans a choice between a tax credit and a \ndeduction for health insurance. The Wyden-Bennett bill raises some \ntough questions that we need to explore as we look at health care \nreform. We need to determine the future role of Medicaid and SCHIP in \nour system over the long haul. We need to explore better ways to make \nthe market work to hold down the rising costs of health care. And we \nneed to find better ways to make health coverage more affordable and \nsecure. This ``patient-driven'' approach--with insurance reforms and \nchanges in the tax treatment of health insurance--should make health \ninsurance more affordable for everyone. The goal should also be, if \npeople are happy with their current health care coverage, they can keep \nit.\n  During my tenure in the Senate, I have sought to build bridges \nbetween Republicans and Democrats. I believe that there are times where \nRepublicans and Democrats need to come together to produce results. \nHealth care reform cannot be successful if it is not bipartisan. I \ncommend Senators Wyden and Bennett for forging the only bipartisan \neffort in Congress to date.\n  As I did last year, I want to make clear that my cosponsorship of the \nWyden-Bennett bill is not an endorsement of all that the bill proposes. \nInstead, I am cosponsoring this bill to add my voice to those who are \ncalling for people to work across party lines to find innovative \nsolutions that can work. While I support the ``patient-driven'' \napproaches in the bill, I have serious concerns about a number of the \nprovisions of the Healthy Americans Act. For example, this bill would \nrequire all individuals to buy health insurance. I support \naccessibility to private insurance and differ with my colleagues on \nthis point. Also, Senator Wyden's approach envisions a bigger role for \nGovernment than I would prefer. In addition, I certainly am not \nendorsing the repeal of the non-interference clause in Medicare Part D. \nThat is not going to be on the table for me.\n  I also need to address a concern about the Wyden-Bennett bill I have \nseen pop up lately. These accusations are particularly troubling \nbecause I don't think they are accurate. It is true that the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation has estimated the gross cost of the bill to be \nabout $1.4 trillion annually by the year 2014. It is also true that the \nJoint Committee on Taxation estimated that the bill is fully paid for \nso the net cost to the Federal Government is zero. I have also read a \nconcern that the Wyden-Bennett bill does not do enough regarding \nmandated benefits. The Wyden-Bennett bill reduces the impact of the \nmyriad State mandates so that there will only be a much more limited \nset of requirements of a health plan much more consistent with what is \nalready provided to Federal employees today.\n  Finally, I want to refute one particular charge regarding coverage of \nabortion services. The Wyden bill does not mandate that every American \nbuy a health insurance plan that covers abortion services. This Senator \nsupports legislation that protects life, and one only needs to point to \nmy record in this area for evidence of that fact. I would not support a \nbill that requires individuals to purchase health insurance that covers \nabortion, or legislation that encourages women to seek abortion. And, \nwhile I agree that Americans deserve similar health care options that \nMembers of Congress enjoy, I don't agree that Washington should mandate \ncoverage of procedures that purposely end human life. Should this bill \nmove forward, I will work with my colleagues to make sure abortion \ncoverage is not made mandatory.\n  So my cosponsorship is not an endorsement of all provisions of the \nbill. Instead, I have cosponsored the Healthy Americans Act to add my\n\n[[Page S9480]]\n\nvoice to the bipartisan call for significant changes in our health care \nsystem. This is only one step in the process of the public discussion \nof ideas for improving our health care system.

Mr. President, I rise today to highlight a bill my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Cardin of Maryland and I introduced \nlast week. S. 3509 addresses the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Iraq \nand potential security breakdown resulting from the mass displacement \nof Iraqis inside Iraq and as refugees into neighboring countries.\n  If passed, this bill will help the United States address the needs of \nmillions of Iraqis who have been forced to flee from their homes. The \nheart of the bill requires the Secretary of State to develop a \ncomprehensive regional strategy to address this humanitarian crisis. \nSenator Cardin and I are joined in this effort by our colleagues, \nSenators Bingaman and Voinovich, who have cosponsored the bill.\n  Unfortunately, we were not able to reach agreement to have this \nlegislation placed on the Foreign Relations Committee business agenda \nthis week. We may not have enough time left this year to bring this \nbill to the floor. I hope that is not the case--and if so, it is my \nhope that the State Department recognizes the need to formulate a \nstrategy and take prompt action itself.\n  It has been 5 years since the fall of Baghdad, and although this \nadministration refuses to acknowledge it, Iraq and her neighbors are in \nthe midst of a humanitarian crisis that threatens to undermine the \nstability of the Middle East. Wherever one stands on the future of the \nU.S. combat presence in Iraq, we have a moral responsibility to those \ninnocent Iraqis who have been driven from their homes and fear for \ntheir lives and their children's lives every day.\n  As I noted during my floor statement marking World Refugee Day this \npast June, Iraqis are now one of the largest displaced populations in \nthe world. According to host countries hosting Iraqi refugees, up to 2 \nmillion Iraqis have fled their homes for neighboring country in order \nto avoid sectarian and other violence. According to the U.N. High \nCommissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, there are over 2.7 million internally \ndisplaced persons in Iraq.\n  Iraqi refugees are overwhelming the basic infrastructure of Iraq's \nneighbors, especially in Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. This raises \ntroubling concerns about the region's stability and shifting sectarian \nbalances. No one in the region, and I must stress this, no one \nincluding host countries and refugees themselves expect Iraqi refugees \nto return anytime soon. This means we will be dealing with the exodus \nof displaced Iraqis for some time to come. Despite this \nadministration's position that security conditions are improving in \nIraq and life is normalizing, there are no signs of imminent return.\n  I saw firsthand the humanitarian and security implications of this \ncrisis during my trip to the region last year. Beyond the obvious \nhumanitarian and moral dimensions, this crisis has grave implications \nfor our national security interests in the Middle East.\n  We often talk about our military surge in Iraq. What has been missing \nfor far too long now has been our humanitarian surge to address basic \nneeds--access to food, health care, shelter, drinking water, and \neducation. This needs to be at the heart of any campaign to win \n``hearts and minds.'' Strong U.S. leadership is critical in bringing \nthe Iraqi Government, regional neighbors, and the international \ncommunity to the table to discuss and implement concrete measures.\n  To date, Congress has not passed any comprehensive legislation \naddressing this humanitarian crisis. My bill, S. 3509, would prompt the \nnext administration to act quickly and make the displacement of \nmillions of Iraqis an urgent foreign policy priority. The heart of the \nbill requires the Secretary of State to develop a comprehensive \nregional strategy that addresses the mass displacement of Iraqis. The \nstrategy would: address the serious challenges facing Iraqi refugees; \naddress the responsibility of the Iraqi Government to help meet the \nurgent needs of its citizens in the region; include an assessment of \nhow much assistance is needed to help meet these needs; include an \nassessment of what conditions are necessary for the voluntary, safe, \nsustainable return of displaced Iraqis; include a description of the \nsteps the U.S. Government has taken and will take to engage the \ninternational community to implement the strategy; and include plans to \nassess the impact of the strategy.\n  S. 3509 also includes reporting requirements from the State \nDepartment and the Government Accountability Office so that Congress is \ninformed on how the administration is moving forward on the Iraqi \nhumanitarian crisis.\n  Mr. President, I believe this bill will help define a roadmap for the \nUnited States and the international community on how we are meeting our \nbasic obligations towards helping vulnerable Iraqis displaced as a \nresult of the 2003 war. It will once again promote responsible American \nleadership abroad.\n  I want to thank the following groups who have supported S. 3509 thus \nfar:\n  America's Development Foundation; Campaign for Innocent Victims in \nconflict, CIVIC; CARE; Catholic Relief Services; CHF International; \nChurch World Service, Immigration and Refugee Program; EPIC: Promoting \na Free & Secure Iraq; Friends Committee on National Legislation; \nInternational Medical Corps; International Relief and Development; \nInternational Rescue Committee; Leadership Conference of Women \nReligious; Maryknoll Office for Global Concerns; Mercy Corps; NETWORK; \nPresbyterian Church, USA, Washington Office; Refugees International; \nSave the Children; U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants; and U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9480-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9480-S9482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,000, are \nheartbreaking and touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting \nevery e-mail sent to me through an address set up specifically for this \npurpose to the Congressional Record. This is not an issue that will be \neasily resolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious \nattention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only \ndetail their struggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have \nsuggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can do now to \ntackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond today. I ask \nunanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       In response to your request for stories reflecting rising \n     energy prices, I would offer the following: It is not unique \n     to my family, but it affects everyone, everywhere, and as an \n     elected official, I would advise you to keep it foremost in \n     your mind when debating the need for renewable energy \n     resources.\n       Our dependence on foreign oil has the effect of spilling \n     our blood on foreign sands in wars that we sure should not be \n     sticking our noses into. It is causing the rest of the world \n     to see us as imperialists, rather than as the beacon of \n     freedom, and it is edging our nation toward facism, as the \n     wealthy have no qualms about sacrificing the poor to make \n     sure the oil keeps flowing from these sources.\n       And, in the end, we the people lose. How can we call \n     ourselves an independent nation if we are to rely on foreign \n     energy? And how can we call ourselves a free people if we \n     cannot afford basic necessities? We the people are seeing \n     prices skyrocket, and our wages decline, despite what the \n     annual reports say, as they do not account for the \n     devaluation of the dollar.\n                                                          William.\n       P.S. Thank you for actually doing something about this \n     mess.\n                                  ____\n\n       Per your request, I am sending an e-mail in regard to my \n     concern for the rising costs of fuel and the impact it is \n     having upon me and my family.\n       As you know, Idaho is, to a great extent, a rural state. \n     Most of our employment involves traveling to or from our job \n     sites in automobiles. Since we aren't privileged enough to \n     have a rapid transit system or bus\n\n[[Page S9481]]\n\n     service, as in many urban city areas, we are forced to get to \n     our employment by our own methods. I work at the Idaho \n     National Laboratory. It is approximately 54 miles one way \n     from my home. The nature of my job (foreman over maintenance \n     craft personnel), requires that most of the time I use a \n     personal auto to commute between my home and my job site. My \n     auto gets approximately 30 miles per gallon, and it has a 17-\n     gallon fuel tank. Each day's travel is approximately 108 \n     miles divided by 30 mpg, giving an average of 3.6 gallons of \n     fuel per day. At $4 per gallon, it costs $14.40 each day to \n     drive to work. If we multiply this number by 9 (the number of \n     work days in a two-week period), it costs me approximately \n     $130 every two weeks for fuel, just to get to work! Multiply \n     that by 26 and my yearly cost (just to go to work) is \n     approximately $3,360. This does not count the fuel necessary \n     for my wife to get to her place of employment, or the costs \n     associated with the need to travel to buy groceries and other \n     necessities. The average cost of our fuel has risen about \n     $1.30 per gallon since last year at this time. My wages have \n     not compensated for the increase in fuel costs, nor has it \n     compensated for the additional costs associated with the \n     purchase of groceries and other commodities, just to survive.\n       Of course, we have to cut way back just to make ends meet. \n     This also means that our choices for recreation (or even a \n     date with my wife) are getting very limited because we must \n     use more and more money to pay for fuel, groceries, and \n     commodities necessary for our very existence. Why is it that \n     we can send billions of dollars, each year, to countries who \n     hate us and do not even use the money for what it is \n     intended, yet let our own people suffer? Where's the justice? \n     Why cannot we do something to help our own people for a \n     change, fight terrorism in this country (gangs), and open up \n     more of the reserves in our own country so that we do not \n     have to be dependent upon foreign terrorists who control \n     (actually are destroying) our economy and indeed the \n     worldwide economical situation?\n       I have two brothers who work in the oil business in \n     Wyoming. Their story of how much reserves we have differs \n     greatly from what our politicians are telling us. Who are we \n     to believe? Are we being misled? Are we being manipulated by \n     selfish interests who would rather pass a ``carbon tax'' bill \n     (when science has proven that there is, indeed, no global \n     warming crisis) creating more taxpayer dollars to line their \n     own pockets? I am a bit frustrated, but I really think that \n     there is no real justification for how fast the cost of fuel \n     has increased this year.\n       One more thing I would like to know, and that is why are we \n     at the mercy of minority organizations with a lot of money, \n     organizations like the ``green'' people, the \n     environmentalists, or other groups who are at least partially \n     to blame for our energy crisis? We need to be using more of \n     our domestic resources and get away from foreign dependence. \n     We need to put a few curbs on the organizations that are \n     responsible for chasing all of our industry out of our \n     country. Those people have ensured that there are so many \n     outrageous controls on manufacturers, that they cannot \n     reasonably make and market most of the things we use in this \n     country, at a fair and competitive price because the costs of \n     all of the regulations force these manufacturers to leave the \n     country and build their products where the regulations are \n     not prohibitive. Our country, unfortunately, can only rely \n     upon the amount of paperwork done in a day to be able to \n     claim to have done something useful. Even our complicated \n     sensitive technologies are coming from overseas.\n       The best example I can use for how far downhill we have \n     gone is to compare what we used to be able to do on the INL \n     to what we can do today. We used to be able to get work done. \n     A lot of work. We were productive. We built reactors, we \n     maintained them and the various other systems necessary to \n     make the rest of our facilities function well. We were not \n     overwhelmed by piles of paperwork. Yes, there was paperwork, \n     but it was nothing like we do today. Today, in our ``world \n     class'' society, we have DOE regulating us out of work. We \n     have a new company that has piled paperwork upon us to the \n     point that not just the administrators are doing piles of it, \n     but every man and woman from administrators to laborers, must \n     process piles of paper each day, to do `work.' Of course, \n     since the advent of the new contract between DOE and BEA, we \n     have consolidated the site and now we do about \\2/3\\ less \n     that ever before. More mountainous is the paperwork. More \n     signatures are required before work can begin. More \n     signatures are required to 'complete' work. Plus, now we have \n     found that the former Argonne personnel were not up to par \n     with the rest of the site (we were running Argonne for 50 \n     years without knowing what we were doing, nor how to do \n     business, and we never killed anyone). Our ignorance has \n     resulted in additional training for each and every person \n     working at the facility. In fact, there is so much training, \n     computer based and otherwise, little time to do work. \n     Besides, we aren't focused upon how much work we can do \n     `safely,' instead, we are focused upon how safe we can be, \n     doing little work in the name of `safety.'\n       Yes, I am frustrated. I guess I am lucky that I am not in \n     the Senate or Congress, because knowing what I know about how \n     things are done here, and how much is wasted, I would \n     seriously be working to close this site down. Tax payer money \n     is being spent (actually wasted), and the tax payer only \n     knows what the media tells them is being done with their \n     money. This is not a responsible national lab any more.\n       Anyway, I have unloaded upon you again. Sorry for the \n     apparent frustration, but I can see the mess because I am \n     behind the curtain that hides it from the rest of the \n     country. Thanks for listening.\n     Brent, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       We heat our home with propane; it is a 2,000 gallon tank. \n     With the cost of propane, it would run us around $3,000 to \n     fill it. We did not do that we did it at $250 at a time. We \n     even ran out one time. Wood is costing a lot as well, at our \n     age and work we have to buy it cut and delivered and that as \n     well is expensive, yet without the wood stove our home would \n     have cost to heat this year around $8,000. Personally I \n     believe in wind power and solar technology. Canada is \n     experimenting with a trailer right now that is brought in \n     that has wind power and wind solar on it. It is running farms \n     capable of running the whole house and everything as well. \n     So, if they are doing it right now, why are we not doing it? \n     They run about $40,000 right now. They are in the test run \n     just to see how long and evident it is. I want one. If they \n     are ready for the market place next year, I plan on getting \n     one. I feel in the deepest part of my soul that the greed of \n     man just might be too powerful. I am so pleased that you are \n     doing your best to protect Mother Earth and the souls that \n     live on her. Those whom are in denial and only live in the \n     power of money will indeed pay at some point in there souls. \n     So I hope this supports what needs to happen. I do, however, \n     only believe in wind and sun, I feel that we cannot ask other \n     countries to not use certain toxic and dangerous chemicals to \n     destroy this planet and not walk the talk. Thank You for all \n     your hard work.\n     Jeanine.\n                                  ____\n\n       I agree with the outrageous energy costs. Gasoline and fuel \n     prices are totally unheard of. The constant rise in fuel \n     costs has not only hindered the life style, we here in Idaho \n     enjoy, outdoor activities, fishing and camping, but the \n     farmers are also getting hammered. What in tarnation is \n     happening? The rich just keep getting richer. My hat is off \n     to the successful, prominent business people, but where do \n     the working class fit in? Seems like the taxes keep going up \n     right along with the cost of living, health care and so on.\n       I truly find it hard to believe that with all of the oil \n     wells and refineries we have in the United States that we \n     should not be in better shape. Where are these reserves being \n     sent to? I see where the Republican Committee is asking for \n     more drilling to take place in Alaska's wildlife areas. \n     What's up with that? What happened to the presently existing \n     Alaskan Pipeline? Did Wyoming, Texas and the sort all dry up?\n       Are we truly a ``free nation'' or are we relying on the \n     foreign imports and markets to help us attain this freedom? \n     If there is any.\n       I think the addressing of the country's issues have been a \n     long time in coming, but is it too late? What do our children \n     have to look forward to?\n     Nate.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a stay-at-home mom with four girls. My husband is \n     college-educated and makes a good living for our family. But, \n     with rising energy and gas prices, we are definitely feeling \n     the pinch in our monthly budget (not to mention rising food \n     prices as well). Ron works twelve miles from home. We do not \n     have additional drivers in our household yet. The driving I \n     do consists of basketball games, dance lessons, and church \n     activities and household errands. We spend over $280/month on \n     gas. To conserve, Ron has begun carpooling at least once a \n     week to work. That is not always easy, but the three drivers \n     are trying to save some money. It is definitely something I \n     think about everyday as I drive to and from town. I try to do \n     all the errands I can at once. We have canceled a planned \n     vacation to California this year to save the money. We hope \n     to be able to do it next year.\n       I feel we live in a great country. There is more technology \n     than ever before. I hope my country can help to make \n     alternative fuel sources a reality. I know solar cars exist. \n     I have seen one discussed on KTVB news recently. We need this \n     type of research to fuel America's economy. The technology is \n     out there. As an average Idahoan, I hope congress will help \n     drive this process.

Maybe they should learn to \n     live the way the rest of the country does. Paying $4+ for a \n     gallon of gas, $4 for a gallon of milk, $4 for a loaf of \n     bread and just about the same for a dozen eggs.

Come on, let us wake up and smell the coffee . . . \n     oh, that is up to (cheap coffee) $8 a pound. We need to start \n     using our own resources and stop sending billions to our \n     enemies.

If we have to buy \n     more than one tank of gas a month, it is almost impossible to \n     pay our\n\n[[Page S9482]]\n\n     bills. We have an all electric home and electricity has also \n     went way up in price. We watch propane and natural gas to see \n     if it would be better for us to change, but they have also \n     skyrocketed and just the cost of changing is unaffordable. We \n     also live in fear of losing our Social Security and Medicare \n     because they want to privatize it.\n       I think what you say you are trying to do now is the right \n     thing but why did not you do this sooner before the tax cut \n     for the rich oil companies was put in force and why do not \n     you speak up and stop these tax cuts from becoming permanent. \n     This is part of what is putting the squeeze on the American \n     people.

Mr. President, late this fall, my longest-serving staff \nmember, Linda Norris, will be retiring from my staff. Linda has \nprovided 18 years of professional, tireless and dedicated service to \nthe people of Idaho, first as a member of my first House campaign staff \nin the early 1990s, then as my regional director in Twin Falls, ID, and \nmy State director of constituent services on my Senate staff while \nretaining her position as Twin Falls regional director. She spent the \nlast few years here in my Washington, DC, office, finishing her time on \nmy staff in her function as State director of constituent services. \nLinda has consistently worked long hours over the years, and helped me \nimmeasurably by her excellence in the field of constituent and \ncommunity services and military and veteran relations.\n  When I met Linda in 1991, I was beginning my bid for a seat in the \nU.S. House of Representatives, representing the Second Congressional \nDistrict of Idaho. She asked me very direct questions about my stand on \nissues, my goals were I to be elected, and my priorities. She vetted \nme. Once she was satisfied that I met her standards, she offered to \ntake over regional operations for my campaign in south central Idaho in \nthe Magic Valley and Sun Valley area. That began what was to be a \nhighly successful working relationship of close to two decades, and a \nclose personal friendship of a lifetime for me, my wife and family.\n  Linda has worked diligently on every task that she took on, either \ngiven to her or ideas she pursued independently. She has been involved \nin land issues, helping as we negotiated sensitive access and \nconservation policies with the tribes, the Air Force, the Idaho \nDepartment of Lands, private entities and the counties in the 1990s. \nShe was my office liaison for the Harriman hiking trail in Sun Valley \nthat finally was completed just a few years ago. A nurse by training, \nLinda is the reason why I became so closely involved in domestic \nviolence issues. She was the first to crystallize the issue by \narranging for me to visit a safe house where I met two children \nphysically and emotionally devastated by brutality in their home. At \nthat moment, I pledged to do all I could to work toward eliminating \nthis terrible violence that occurs in too many homes across the United \nStates and beyond.\n  Linda has a special place in her heart for the military and for \nveterans. As an Army spouse, she brought a special sense of empathy to \nher work, together with an extraordinarily perceptive understanding of \nprotocol that goes a long way in ensuring that a Member of Congress's \noffice maintains a positive relationship with Department of Defense \nofficials. The importance of this cannot be understated when it comes \nto helping Idaho military members and veterans when they have questions \nor concerns about military and veterans' affairs issues. Linda leaves \nmy office held in very high esteem by both Idaho and national military \nand veterans affairs officials. Linda also has been solely responsible \nfor the past 15 years for the military academy nomination process in my \noffice. The other members of the Idaho delegation have even advised new \nstaff members to talk to her about the proper procedures and protocol \nfor this complicated and very important process. And, close to 10 years \nago, Linda suggested that I create the Spirit of Idaho and Spirit of \nFreedom awards. The Spirit of Idaho award recognizes extraordinary \nefforts of Idahoans for community service performed outside of their \nwork life. The Spirit of Freedom Award is one that I present annually \nto veterans and volunteers for their service to our country and to \nveterans.\n  Linda has worked behind the scenes, helping countless constituents \nwhen they encounter difficulties with federal agency processes and \nprocedures. She has done everything from facilitate a faster passport \napplication, to helping a number of Idahoans receive Purple Hearts and \nother military awards, and even helped family members obtain them for \nrelatives long deceased. Linda has celebrated with people who have had \nlong-term problems resolved and cried with mothers who have gotten \nfrightening, desperate calls from a son or daughter deployed overseas \nand going through bouts of depression or worse. Through it all, she has \nmaintained her composure, professionalism and judicious compassion. \nLinda also has a reputation for being a patient teacher and mentor. She \nhas provided new staff members with effective training and advice\n  In all the years Linda has worked for me, she has put Idahoans first \nand strictly adhered to the ethical and moral requirements of \ncongressional staff work. I could ask for no better service nor could \nIdahoans. Linda Norris will be missed by staff and constituents alike, \nand I will miss her professional counsel and hard work. Fortunately, my \nwife and I have years of her friendship to look forward to, and she \nknows that Susan and I wish her the best as she begins a new and \ndifferent journey in her life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9482-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9482-S9483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADOPTION AND CHILD WELFARE POLICY\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I would like to talk about the \nhistory of adoption and child welfare policy and the importance of the \nFostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 \nwhich passed in wrap-up on Monday, September 22, 2008.\n  First, I want to commend Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley and \ntheir professional staffs who have done incredible work to forge a \nconsensus and develop this bold package. Subcommittee Chairman \nMcDermott and Congressman Weller and their staffs showed the same \nleadership and commitment in the House. It was a privilege to be part \nof the process. This is a strong package with extraordinary broad-based \nsupport from the adoption community, child advocates, and even State \ngroups. That consensus was essential to move the legislation and act on \nbehalf of vulnerable children in foster care.\n  This strong bipartisan, bicameral package will help promote adoption, \nsupport guardianship, and improve the outcomes in foster care. The \npackage and the process build on the legacy of the 1997 Adoption and \nSafe Families Act. In 1997, a bipartisan group came together and \ndeveloped legislation that started the adoption incentive program, an \ninitiative that spurred genuine change in the child welfare system\n\n[[Page S9483]]\n\nincluding doubling the number of adoptions from foster care over the \ndecade. This means that 443,000 children from foster care have a \npermanent home and a family, and 3,600 are West Virginia children. A \nfamily and a permanent home makes all the difference for a child. The \n1997 act also changed the reasonable efforts provisions to restore \nbalance and help focus on the best interest of a child, and providing a \nsafe, stable and permanent home.\n  The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of \n2008 is a historic initiative to further promote adoption and \npermanency for children. It will eliminate, over time, the outdated \nconnection between adoption assistance eligibility with the broken Aid \nTo Families with Dependent Children, AFDC, a program that was \nterminated in 1996. The new Adoption Assistance Program is phased in \nover 10 years, starting with the oldest children or children who have \nbeen in care for over 5 years. The package also updates the adoption \nincentive program.\n  The bill gives States the option to invest in relative guardianship, \na program that was tested and found very successful during the child \nwelfare waivers. Children in relative placement tend to move less and \nget better reports from the teachers. The package also makes a special \ninvestment to promote the promising kinship navigator program to \nprovide support and referrals to the millions of grandparents and \nrelatives raising their kin. It provides new tools and direction to \nlocate relatives as possible care providers. This is an important \noption that will lead to more permanency for children.\n  The bill also requires States to do more on educational stability and \ndirects that each child has a coordinated health plan that includes \ndental and mental health care. This is fundamental for each child. To \nhelp staff do a better job serving children, the bill also invests in \ntraining programs.\n  The legislation will also invest in the more than 20,000 young people \nwho age out of foster care, each year. First, it requires that the \nyouth have full support in developing a transition plan 90 days before \nleaving care. It is not right or appropriate for a foster teen to leave \ncare and move into a homeless shelter. The legislation also encourages \nStates to extend foster care beyond the age of 18 if the young person \nis engaged in education, job training, employment, or has a disability \nthat prevents such engagement. Young people need and deserve support, \nand we know that it makes a positive difference.\n  Finally, for the first time, thanks to Chairman Baucus' leadership, \nthe Tribes and Tribal organization will have the option of direct \naccess to Federal foster care to serve Native American children \ndirectly.\n  Many of the provisions in this package, particularly improvements in \nadoption assistance, have been among my priorities for years. It is \nexciting to work with colleagues on a success, and it will be even more \nrewarding to work on its implementation for children and families in \nWest Virginia and nationwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9483-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MEDIA CONSOLIDATION\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to honor my \nformer budget analyst for agriculture, Jim Miller, for his exemplary \nservice. For the last 4 years, Jim has served me as my lead agriculture \nadviser. His efforts have helped produce great legislative successes \nfor our Nation's farmers and ranchers.\n  Jim's knowledge of agriculture is extraordinary. His encyclopedic \nfamiliarity with Federal agriculture policy allowed him to know the \nanswer to any question I would ask about agriculture. Throughout his \nservice, he garnered the respect and admiration of his colleagues as \nwell as other Senators for his intelligence and his good nature. His \nwise counsel will be missed.\n  Jim came to my office in August 2004 after working for the National \nFarmers Union. Even though Jim had 20 years of agriculture policy \nexpertise and had farmed in his native Washington State for over 20 \nyears before coming to Washington, he had never worked on Capitol Hill.\n  But he hit the ground running. Shortly after Jim joined my staff, he \nhelped me pass an agriculture disaster assistance package for North \nDakota farmers and ranchers in 2004. He also worked for 3 long years to \nsecure additional disaster assistance for North Dakota farmers stricken \nwith flooding in 2005 and severe drought in 2006.\n  I will always remember Jim for his work during the 2008 farm bill. \nJim was my lead negotiator and captain of my farm bill team. Without \nhis leadership and dedication, this most recent farm bill would not be \nas strong as it is. He gave this effort thousands upon thousands of \nhours of his time, working with people on both sides of the aisle and \nin both Houses of Congress to get a fantastic end result. He was \nresponsible for helping me deliver the top priorities for North Dakota \nproducers: increased farm program support levels and a standing \ndisaster program.\n  I thank him for helping this Congress produce what I think is the \nbest farm bill we have ever had. And it isn't just me that thinks \nthis--it is reflected in the recordbreaking votes we had in the Senate \nand the large margin of victory we had on overriding the President's \ntwo vetoes.\n  Since Jim left my office, he has rejoined the National Farmers Union. \nI will forever be grateful for his tireless efforts, his creative \nthinking, his coalition building, and friendship. I wish him all the \nbest in his new endeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9483-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9483-S9484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    RECOGNIZING ROY SILVERSTEIN, M.D\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments \nto recognize the achievements of Dr. Roy Silverstein, an Ohioan who has \ndedicated his professional life to biomedical research and medicine.\n  Dr. Silverstein is currently chairman of the Department of Cell \nBiology and vice chair for translational research at the Lerner \nResearch Institute, as well as professor of molecular medicine at the \nCleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine at Case Western Reserve \nUniversity.\n  Having chaired multiple grant review panels and published over 100 \narticles in various publications and scientific journals, Dr. \nSilverstein has accomplished an extraordinary number of professional \nmilestones and achievements.\n  As committee chair for the American Society of Hematology, ASH, for \nthe past 4 years, Dr. Silverstein has led the society's efforts to \neducate Members of Congress about hematology and the importance of \nFederal research funding. In this capacity, Dr. Silverstein has visited \nwith me and my staff to educate us about the critical issues facing \nhematologists.\n  The skilled advocacy and research of Dr. Silverstein remind many of \nus in Congress of how crucial it is to keep NIH funding strong. His \nwork demonstrates that NIH funding truly is a vehicle for enhancing the \nhealth and wellbeing of Americans. In addition to continuing his own \nresearch in blood clotting and bleeding disorders, Dr. Silverstein has \nalso shown great commitment to educating our next generation of \nphysicians and researchers. Dr. Silverstein is a superb advocate for \nhis\n\n[[Page S9484]]\n\nprofession, and I am grateful for his lifetime contribution to treating \nblood diseases and advocating for biomedical research.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9484-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING HUSSON UNIVERSITY\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I recognize a landmark event at \none of our Nation's great success stories in higher education. On \nOctober 11, 2008, Husson College in my home State of Maine will become \nHusson University.\n  This designation is but the latest chapter in a history that is truly \ninspiring. It began more than a century ago, in 1898, when Chesley \nHusson founded the Shaw School of Business on the second floor of a \nbuilding in downtown Bangor, offering instruction in such cutting-edge \ntechnologies of the day as typing and telegraphy. From the very start, \nHusson has remained a private school with an entrepreneurial approach \nand a commitment to educating young people of limited means.\n  Since then, Husson has grown tremendously, both in the size of its \nbeautiful campus and in the range of the courses and degrees offered. \nIt has grown because, through all those years, Husson has remained true \nto its founding principles of responding to needs, recognizing \nopportunities, and delivering real value.\n  Today, Husson offers a university-caliber range of both undergraduate \nand graduate degrees, including graduate professional degrees in \nbusiness, health and education. It is home to the New England School of \nCommunications, which offers audio, video, Web and computer programs, \nmarketing, theater, and both print and broadcast journalism, and to the \nBangor Theological Seminary, the only accredited graduate school of \nreligion in Northern New England. In addition to its main campus in \nBangor, Husson has developed a statewide reach with education centers \nin South Portland and Presque Isle, the Boat School in Eastport, and \nUnobskey College in Calais.\n  The Husson story is, however, about more than growth in enrollment, \ndegree offerings, and campus locations. It also is a story of fostering \npersonal growth, of preparing graduates for successful professional \ncareers, and of promoting in each student the development of individual \nself-worth.\n  Before coming to the Senate, I had the honor of serving as the \nfounding director of the Dyke Center for Family Business. I have never \nknown a school, a faculty, or a student body more focused on preparing \nfor a professional career than at Husson. Husson truly is remarkable in \nits dedication to this aspiration and its clear sense of purpose.\n  I saw in Husson students an emerging sense of personal pride, a sense \nof self-worth grounded in knowledge and confidence. This wonderful \ncombination of hands-on learning, personal attention from the faculty, \nfriendships that develop with other students, and self-discovery is the \nHusson spirit. As I travel throughout Maine and across the Nation I \nfind Husson alumni from every walk of life who possess that invaluable \nsense of self-worth.\n  Husson is more than a pretty campus in a small city that shines, as \nThoreau put it, ``like a star on the edge of night.'' Husson is a \nnetwork. It is a network that includes teachers, architects, bankers, \nnurses and therapists, counselors, criminal justice administrators, \nhospital CEOs and doctors, corporate executives and entrepreneurs, \nheads of architectural firms, senior law partners and entrepreneurs. It \nis a network that reaches across the State of Maine and around the \nworld.\n  If there is one thing today's college students do not need to be \ntold, it is that the world is changing every day. A big part of the \nHusson spirit is anticipating change. Among Husson alumni there are \nbusiness graduates who have become architects and attorneys, nurses who \nare hospital CEOs, and teachers who have become ministers. A Husson \ndegree is more than proof that a student can do one thing well. By \ndeveloping the skills to perfect one profession, Husson graduates learn \nthe discipline, leadership skills, and problem-solving capabilities to \nchange with the times. The Husson spirit is not just about being part \nof change, but of leading it.\n  The change I recognize today is evidence of that spirit. I \ncongratulate Husson College as it becomes Husson University. The Husson \nstory is remarkable, but I know that the most remarkable chapters have \nyet to be written.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9484-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CHARLES CITY COMMUNITY EDUCATION\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

In many cases, this Federal \nfunding is used to leverage public and/or private local funding, so it \noften has a tremendous multiplier effect in a local school district.\n  The Charles City Community School District received several fire \nsafety grants totaling $377,303. The 2001, 2003 and 2005 grants were \nused to upgrade fire safety systems at the high school, the middle \nschool and Washington Elementary. The 2002 grant was used to upgrade \nthe electrical system at the high school. The Federal grants have made \nit possible for the district to provide quality and safe schools for \ntheir students.\n  Excellent schools do not just pop up like mushrooms after a rain. \nThey are the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a \ntremendous amount of collaboration among local officials and concerned \ncitizens.

Mr. President, in Iowa and across the United \nStates, a new school year has begun. As you know, Iowa public schools \nhave an excellent reputation nationwide, and Iowa students' test scores \nare among the highest in the Nation.\n  I would like to take just a few minutes today to salute the dedicated \nteachers, administrators, and school board members in the Ottumwa \nCommunity School District, and to report on their participation in a \nunique Federal partnership to repair and modernize school facilities.\n  This fall marks the 10th year of the Iowa Demonstration Construction \nGrant Program. That is its formal name, but it is better known among \neducators in Iowa as the program of Harkin grants for Iowa public \nschools. Since 1998, I have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 \nmillion for the State government in Iowa, which selects worthy school \ndistricts to receive these grants for a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools or renovating existing facilities. In many cases, this Federal \nfunding is used to leverage public and/or private local funding, so it \noften has a tremendous multiplier effect in a local school district.\n  The Ottumwa Community School District received several Harkin grants \ntotaling $3,129,313 which it used to help modernize and make safety \nimprovements throughout the district. Harkin\n\n[[Page S9486]]\n\nconstruction grants totaling $2 million have helped with renovations at \nseveral schools in the district including Ottumwa High School, Evans \nMiddle School and Douma and James Elementary Schools. These projects \nhave included new classrooms, new roofs, and new HVAC systems. These \nschools are the modern, state-of-the-art facilities that befit the \neducational ambitions and excellence of this school district. Indeed, \nthey are the kind of schools that every child in America deserves.\n  The district also received eight fire safety grants totaling \n$1,129,313 to make improvements at buildings throughout the district \nincluding Ottumwa High School, the alternative high school, Evans \nMiddle School, Wildwood, Wilson, Agassiz, Horace Mann, James and \nPickwick Elementary Schools. The improvements included emergency and \nexit lighting, new sprinkler systems, upgraded fire alarm systems, \nelectrical work and other safety repairs. The Federal grants have made \nit possible for the district to provide quality and safe schools for \ntheir students.\n  Excellent schools do not just pop up like mushrooms after a rain. \nThey are the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a \ntremendous amount of collaboration among local officials and concerned \ncitizens. I salute the entire staff, administration, and governance in \nthe Ottumwa Community School District. In particular, I would like to \nrecognize the leadership of the board of education--Pat Curran, Cindy \nKurtz-Hopkins, Carol Mitchell, Payson Moreland, Ron Oswalt, Doug \nMathias and Jeff Strunk and former board members Cathy Angle, Ken \nCrosser, Bob Ketcham, Don Krieger, Andrea McDowell, Michael Neary, \nSteve Menke, Jerri Stroda, Bob Warren and Mark Zeller. I would also \nlike to recognize superintendent Jon Sheldahl; former superintendents \nJoe Scalzo and Tom Rubel; business managers Dick Springsteen and John \nDonner; directors of operations Lowell Smith, Steve Propp, Darrell \nReams and Danny Renfrew; and community programs director Kim Hellige.\n  As we mark the 10th anniversary of the Harkin school grant program in \nIowa, I am obliged to point out that many thousands of school buildings \nand facilities across the United States are in dire need of renovation \nor replacement. In my State of Iowa alone, according to a recent study, \nsome 79 percent of public schools need to be upgraded or repaired. The \nharsh reality is that the average age of school buildings in the United \nStates is nearly 50 years.\n  Too often, our children visit ultramodern shopping malls and gleaming \nsports arenas on weekends, but during the week go to school in rundown \nor antiquated facilities. This sends exactly the wrong message to our \nyoung people about our priorities.

Mr. President, on October 23, 2008, the YWCA of \nNorthwest Georgia will hold a vigil on Marietta Square in my hometown \nto commemorate Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I wish to express my \ngratitude for the work of the YWCA of Northwest Georgia and its \nexecutive director Holly Comer as they bring awareness to this \nimportant issue and its impact on our community.\n  The YWCA of Northwest Georgia opened the doors to the first domestic \nviolence shelter in Cobb County in 1978 in an effort to end domestic \nviolence in our State, our communities, and our homes. A home should be \na place of stability, comfort, and love. Domestic violence shatters \nthis important foundation. The terrible tragedies that result from \ndomestic violence destroy lives and insult the dignity of women, men, \nand children. I believe I represent all Georgians when I say thank you \nto the YWCA of Northwest Georgia for its hard work to combat domestic \nviolence and help those who have been victimized.\n  I am grateful for the social service providers, advocates, \ncounselors, and many others who provide care for the victims. I am also \ngrateful to the law\n\n[[Page S9487]]\n\nenforcement personnel and others who work to bring offenders to \njustice. As we recognize Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we are \nreminded of the important service these individuals provide.\n  Domestic violence has no place in our society, and I am strongly \ncommitted to addressing domestic violence and helping those who have \nbeen victimized. By working together with the YWCA of Northwest Georgia \nand its dedicated staff, we can build a Georgia where every home honors \nthe value and dignity of its loved ones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9487-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             100TH ANNIVERSARY OF GEORGIAN COURT UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I congratulate Georgian \nCourt University, GCU, on its 100th anniversary. For the past century, \nGCU has been a leader in higher education, encouraging intellectual \ninquiry, ethical professionalism, and community involvement. I am proud \nto have this institution in New Jersey, and it is an honor to pay \ntribute to its achievements.\n  Georgian Court University was founded by the Sisters of Mercy in 1908 \nas a women's college, and it remains dedicated to the success of women \ntoday. The Women's College at GCU provides an environment conducive to \nacademic achievement and offers a liberal arts education tailored to \nwomen's learning styles. In particular, GCU's Women in Leadership \nDevelopment Program is one of the most powerful programs for young \nwomen today. By participating on university committees, making \npresentations, lobbying legislators, and networking with mentors, \nstudents develop the skills and tools needed by today's successful \nwomen leaders.\n  In the 1970s, Georgian Court University expanded its programs and \nopened its doors to men. Over the decades, GCU has added buildings and \nfaculty to meet the growing student population, which stands at more \nthan 3,000 today. In addition to the original GCU estate, which has \nbeen preserved and is on the National Register of Historic Places, the \nGCU landscape includes a new wellness center, residence hall, chapel, \nand science wing that were all added in the last several years.\n  With 29 undergraduate and eight graduate degree offerings, GCU \ncontinues to develop new academic programs. Their new nursing program, \nestablished just this year, will help stem nursing shortages in New \nJersey. Their accelerated and executive MBA program allows executives \nto gain the information they need to advance their careers, and as one \nof only 50 NASA Educational Resource Centers, GCU ensures that teachers \nhave the most up-to-date scientific information for their classrooms.\n  Finally, I would like to pay tribute to the service of Georgian Court \nUniversity's faculty and students. Whether sending teams of students \nand staff to install water systems in poverty-stricken areas of \nHonduras or helping local homeless populations in New Jersey, GCU is \ncommitted to making the world a better place.\n  Mr. President, the students, alumni, and staff of Georgian Court \nUniversity have much to be proud of as they celebrate 100 years of \nacademia. I applaud GCU for its many years of service, and I wish the \nuniversity continued success in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9487-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO MARY MARK\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, former Oregon Governor Tom McCall \nonce said, ``Heroes are not statues framed against a red sky. They are \npeople who say, `This is my community and it is my responsibility to \nmake it better'.''\n  Today I pay tribute to a remarkable lady who truly earned the title \nof ``hero,'' because few individuals have done more in the past several \ndecades to make the community of Portland, OR, a better place than Mary \nMark. Mary passed away recently, and last week I joined with over 600 \nother Oregonians in attending a tribute service that honored Mary's \nlife and legacy.\n  I first met Mary some 13 years ago when I was just beginning my \ncampaign for the Senate. I had heard from many friends of the sterling \nreputation of Mary and her husband Pete and their status as two of \nOregon's most generous philanthropists, but since I was from east of \nthe mountains, I had not had the opportunity to meet them. And, \nunfortunately, the purpose of our meeting was for me to do something I \nhate to do, but which is a necessary evil for running for office--and \nthat's to ask people for money.\n  It didn't take me but a few minutes into the meeting to reach a few \nconclusions--conclusions that have been reinforced time and time again \nover the years. First, Mary and Pete were two of the warmest and most \ngracious people I had ever met. There is a tradition here on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate where members refer to each other as ``gentleman'' \nor ``gentlelady.'' We yield to the ``gentleman from Iowa,'' or we agree \nwith the remarks of the ``gentlelady from Maine.'' There are some who \nbelieve the terms are quaint and old-fashioned. I do not. I don't think \nthat manners and kindness and courtesy ever go out of fashion. And I \ncan't think of better words to describe Pete and Mary as a \n``gentleman'' and a ``gentlelady.''\n  The second conclusion I reached is that Mary and Pete were two of the \nkeenest observers of the political scene that I had ever met. I always \nlooked forward to our meetings, because I knew that Mary was going to \nask me some tough questions, and I knew she would share with me her \nvery perceptive opinions. To be frank, in our business it is easy to \nfind individuals who will tell me what they think I want to hear. Mary \nMark always told me what I needed to hear.\n  It was also easy to see that as much as Mary loved her country and \nher community, the true great love of her life was her husband, and \ntheir wonderful children and grandchildren. Mary understood \ninstinctively that our success as a society depends not on what happens \nin the conference tables of Washington, DC, but on what happens at \nkitchen tables in every community in Oregon. And when Sharon and I \nexperienced a tragedy in our family, Mary and Pete reached out to us \nwith kindness and compassion.\n  Mr. President, the Greek poet Sophocles once wrote, ``One must wait \nuntil the evening to see how splendid the day has been.'' For her \nfamily, for the community of Portland, and for Mary's countless friends \nand admirers, the evening of Mary's life came much too soon. It is my \nhope, however, that we can find solace in the fact that in the evening \nof her time on earth, Mary Mark could look back at a life filled with \nfamily, a life filled with generosity, a life filled with service to \nothers, a life filled with making a positive difference, and say that \nthe day had indeed been splendid.\n  May God bless Mary Mark, and may we all carry on her legacy by loving \nour community and by loving our family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9487-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9487-S9488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 1760.

A bill to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to prevent \nexcessive price speculation with respect to energy and agricultural \ncommodities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, energy prices are on a roller coaster, \ntaking American consumers and the American economy on an unpredictable, \nexpensive, and damaging ride. Just over a year ago, a barrel of crude \noil sold for $70 a barrel. In less than a year, the price doubled to \nnearly $147. Last week, that same barrel of oil cost $91, a price drop \nof $56 over a few months. Just in the past week crude oil prices have \njumped from about $96 per barrel to $130 per barrel and then back to \n$106 per barrel. No one knows whether, by the end of the year, the \nprice of oil will stay around $100, drop lower, or climb back up. The \nhuge price spikes we experienced can't be explained by changes in \nsupply and demand; about half the trading in oil futures results from \nspeculation as to whether oil prices will rise or fall by traders \nwithout any interest in actually using the oil they are buying and \nselling.\n  The natural gas, gasoline, and heating oil markets have also seen \nhuge price swings. The prices are up, they are down, they are \nunpredictable--making it impossible for many businesses and consumers \nto afford even basic goods and services.\n  The sky-high oil and gasoline prices in effect for the last year are \ntaking a tremendous toll on millions of American consumers and \nbusinesses. Speculation--not supply and demand--is keeping prices high, \nand our economy is forced to respond to erratic price changes. Unless \nwe act to protect our energy markets from excessive speculation and \nprice manipulation, the American economy will continue to be vulnerable \nto wild price swings affecting the prices of transportation, food, \nmanufacturing and everything in between, endangering the economic \nsecurity of our people, our businesses, and our Nation.\n  Congress should act now to help tame rampant speculation and \nreinvigorate supply and demand as market forces.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation, along with Senators Bingaman and \nHarkin, that represents our collective effort to enact the strongest \nand most workable measures to prevent excessive speculation and price \nmanipulation in U.S. energy markets. It will close the loopholes in \nour commodities laws that now impede the policing of U.S. energy trades \non foreign exchanges and in the unregulated over-the-counter market. It \nwill ensure that large commodity traders cannot use these markets to \nhide from CFTC oversight or avoid limits on speculation. The bill will \nstrengthen disclosure, oversight, and enforcement in U.S. energy \nmarkets, restoring the financial oversight that is crucial to protect \nAmerican consumers, American businesses, and the U.S. economy from \nfurther energy shocks.\n\n  More specifically, this legislation would make four sets of changes.\n  It will require the CFTC to set limits on the holdings of traders in \nall of the energy futures contracts traded on regulated exchanges to \nprevent traders from engaging in excessive speculation or price \nmanipulation. Since we closed the Enron loophole this year all futures \ncontracts must be traded in regulated markets.\n  It would close the ``London loophole'' by giving the CFTC the same \nauthority to police traders in the United States who trade U.S. futures \ncontracts on a foreign exchange and by requiring foreign exchanges that \nwant to install trading terminals in the U.S. to impose comparable \nlimits on speculative trading as the CFTC imposes on domestic exchanges \nto prevent excessive speculation and price manipulation.\n\n[[Page S9495]]\n\n  It will close the ``swaps loophole'' by requiring traders in the \nover-the-counter energy markets to report large trades to the CFTC, and \nit would authorize the CFTC to set limits on trading in the presently \nunregulated over-the-counter markets to prevent excessive speculation \nand price manipulation.\n  It will require the CFTC to revise the standards that allow traders \nwho use futures markets to hedge their holdings to exceed the \nspeculation limits that apply to everyone else.\n  My Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations' investigations have \nshown that one key factor in price spikes of energy is increased \nspeculation in the energy markets. Traders are trading contracts for \nfuture delivery of oil in record amounts, creating a demand for paper \ncontracts that gets translated into increases in prices and increasing \nprice volatility.\n  Much of this increase in trading of futures has been due to \nspeculation. Speculators in the oil market do not intend to use oil; \ninstead they buy and sell contracts for crude oil in the hope of making \na profit from changing prices. According to the CFTC's data, the number \nof futures and options contracts held by speculators has gone from \naround 100,000 contracts in 2001, which was 20 percent of the total \nnumber of outstanding contracts, to almost 1.2 million contracts, which \nrepresents almost 40 percent of the outstanding futures and options \ncontracts in oil on NYMEX Even this understates the increase in \nspeculation, since the CFTC data classifies futures trading involving \nindex funds as commercial trading rather than speculation, and the CFTC \nclassifies all traders in commercial firms as commercial traders, \nregardless of whether any particular trader in that firm may in fact be \nspeculating.\n  There is now, as a result, 12 times as many speculative holdings as \nthere was in 2001, while holdings of nonspeculative or commercial \nfutures and options is up but three times. The greater the demand there \nis to buy futures contracts for the delivery of a commodity, the higher \nthe price will be for those futures contracts.\n  Not surprisingly, therefore, this massive speculation that the price \nof oil will increase, together with the increase in the amount of \npurchases of futures contracts, in fact, helped increase the price of \noil to a level far above the price that is justified by the traditional \nforces of supply and demand.\n  In June 2006, I released a subcommittee report, ``The Role of Market \nSpeculation in Rising Oil and Gas Prices: A Need to Put a Cop on the \nBeat.'' This report found that the traditional forces of supply and \ndemand didn't account for sustained price increases and price \nvolatility in the oil and gasoline markets. The report concluded that, \nin 2006, a growing number of trades of contracts for future delivery of \noil occurred without regulatory oversight and that market speculation \nhad contributed to rising oil and gasoline prices, perhaps accounting \nfor $20 out of a then-priced $70 barrel of oil.\n  Oil industry executives and experts have arrived at a similar \nconclusion. Late last year, the President and CEO of Marathon Oil said, \n``$100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the market. It has \nto be speculation on the futures market that is fueling this.'' Mr. \nFadel Gheit, oil analyst for Oppenheimer and Company describes the oil \nmarket as ``a farce.'' ``The speculators have seized control and it's \nbasically a free-for-all, a global gambling hall, and it won't shut \ndown unless and until responsible governments step in.'' In January of \nthis year, when oil first hit $100 per barrel, Mr. Tim Evans, oil \nanalyst for Citigroup, wrote ``the larger supply and demand \nfundamentals do not support a further rise and are, in fact, more \nconsistent with lower price levels.'' At the joint hearing on the \neffects of speculation we held last December, Dr. Edward Krapels, a \nfinancial market analyst, testified, ``Of course financial trading, \nspeculation affects the price of oil because it affects the price of \neverything we trade. . . . It would be amazing if oil somehow escaped \nthis effect.'' Dr. Krapels added that as a result of this speculation \n``there is a bubble in oil prices.''\n  The need to control speculation is urgent. The presidents and CEOs of \nmajor U.S. airlines recently warned about the disastrous effects of \nrampant speculation on the airline industry. The CEOs stated ``normal \nmarket forces are being dangerously amplified by poorly regulated \nmarket speculation.'' The CEOs wrote, ``For airlines, ultra-expensive \nfuel means thousands of lost jobs and severe reductions in air service \nto both large and small communities.''\n  As to reining in speculation, the first step to take is to put a cop \nback on the beat in all our energy markets to prevent excessive \nspeculation, price manipulation, and trading abuses.\n  With respect to the futures markets, the legislation we are \nintroducing today requires the CFTC to establish limits on the amount \nof futures contracts any trader can hold. Currently, the CFTC allows \nthe futures exchanges themselves to set these limits. This bill would \nrequire the CFTC to set these limits to prevent excessive speculation \nand price manipulation. It would preserve, however, the exchanges' \nobligation and ability to police their traders to ensure they remain \nbelow these limits.\n  This legislation would also require the CFTC to conduct a rulemaking \nto review and revise the criteria for allowing traders who are using \nthe futures market to hedge their risks in a commodity to acquire \nholdings in excess of the limits on holdings for speculators.\n  Another step is to give the CFTC authority to prevent excessive \nspeculation in the over-the-counter markets. In 2007, my Subcommittee \nissued a report on the effects of speculation in the energy markets, \nentitled ``Excessive Speculation in the Natural Gas Market.'' This \ninvestigation showed that speculation by a hedge fund named Amaranth \ndistorted natural gas prices during the summer of 2006 and drove up \nprices for average consumers. The report demonstrated how Amaranth had \nshifted its speculative activity to unregulated markets, under the \n``Enron loophole,'' to avoid the restrictions and oversight in the \nregulated markets, and how Amaranth's trading in the unregulated \nmarkets contributed to price increases.\n  Following this investigation, I introduced a bill, S. 2058, to close \nthe Enron loophole and regulate the unregulated electronic energy \nmarkets. Working with Senators Feinstein and Snowe, and with the \nmembers of the Agriculture Committee in a bipartisan effort, we \nincluded an amendment to close the Enron loophole in the farm bill, \nwhich Congress passed this past spring, overriding a veto by President \nBush.\n  The legislation to close the Enron loophole placed over-the-counter--\nOTC--electronic exchanges under CFTC regulation. However, this \nlegislation did not address the separate issue of trading in the rest \nof the OTC market, which includes bilateral trades through voice \nbrokers, swap dealers, and direct party-to-party negotiations. In order \nto ensure there is a cop on the beat in all of the energy commodity \nmarkets, we need to address the rest of the OTC market as well.\n  Previously, I introduced legislation, S. 3255, along with Senator \nFeinstein, the Over-the-Counter Speculation Act, to address the rest of \nthe OTC market not covered by the farm bill. A large portion of this \nOTC market consists of the trading of swaps relating to the price of a \ncommodity. Generally, commodity swaps are contracts between two parties \nwhere one party pays a fixed price to another party in return for some \ntype of payment at a future time depending on the price of a commodity. \nBecause some of these swap instruments look very much like futures \ncontracts--except that they do not call for the actual delivery of the \ncommodity--there is concern that the price of these swaps that are \ntraded in the unregulated OTC market could affect the price of the very \nsimilar futures contracts that are traded on the regulated futures \nmarkets. We don't yet know for sure that this is the case, or that it \nis not, because we don't have any access to comprehensive data or \nreporting on the trading of these swaps in the OTC market.\n  The legislation introduced today includes these same provisions to \ngive the CFTC oversight authority to stop excessive speculation in the \nover-the-counter market. These provisions represent a practical, \nworkable approach that will enable the CFTC to obtain key information \nabout the OTC market to enable it to prevent excessive speculation and \nprice manipulation. These\n\n[[Page S9496]]\n\nprovisions are also included in the legislation introduced by the \nmajority leader and others, S. 3268, to stop excessive speculation.\n  Under these provisions, the CFTC will have the authority to ensure \nthat traders cannot avoid the CFTC reporting requirements by trading \nswaps in the unregulated OTC market instead of regulated exchanges. It \nwill enable the CFTC to act, such as by requiring reductions in \nholdings of futures contracts or swaps, against traders with large \npositions in order to prevent excessive speculation or price \nmanipulation regardless of whether the trader's position is on an \nexchange or in the OTC market.\n  The bill we are introducing today, unlike S. 3255, gives the CFTC the \nauthority to establish position limits in the over-the-counter market \nfor energy and agricultural commodities in order to prevent excessive \nspeculation and price manipulation. The CFTC needs this authority to \nensure that large traders are not using the over-the-counter markets to \nevade the position limits in the futures markets.\n  Earlier this year I introduced legislation with Senators Feinstein, \nDurbin, Dorgan and Bingaman, S.3129, to close the London loophole. This \nloophole has allowed crude oil traders in the U.S. to avoid the \nposition limits that apply to trading on U.S. futures exchanges by \ndirecting their trades onto the ICE Futures Exchange in London. The \nlegislation we introduced also was incorporated into the legislation to \nstop prevent excessive speculation introduced by the majority leader, \nS. 3268. These provisions are now included in the legislation we are \nintroducing today.\n  After this legislation was first introduced, the CFTC imposed more \nstringent requirements upon the ICE Futures Exchange's operations in \nthe United States--for the first time requiring the London exchange to \nimpose and enforce comparable position limits in order to be allowed to \nkeep its trading terminals in the United States. This is the very \naction our legislation called for. However, the current CFTC position \nlimits apply only to the nearest futures contract. Our legislation will \nensure that foreign exchanges with trading terminals in the U.S. will \napply position limits to other futures contracts once the CFTC \nestablishes those limits for U.S. exchanges.\n  Although the CFTC has taken these important steps that will go a long \nway towards closing the London loophole, Congress should still pass \nthis legislation to make sure the London loophole stays closed. The \nlegislation would put the conditions the CFTC has imposed upon the \nLondon exchange into statute, and ensure that the CFTC has clear \nauthority to take action against any U.S. trader who is manipulating \nthe price of a commodity or excessively speculating through the London \nexchange, including requiring that trader to reduce positions.\n  The legislation we are introducing today also includes a number of \nprovisions in the majority leader's bill, S. 3248, that require a \nvariety of studies, investigations, and reports designed to improve the \ntransparency and regulation of the energy markets. It also provides \nauthorization for the CFTC to hire an additional 100 employees to \noversee the commodity markets it regulates.\n  On September 11, the CFTC issued a ``Staff Report on Commodity Swap \nDealers and Index Traders with Commission Recommendations.'' The \nlegislation we have introduced embodies several of the CFTC's \nrecommendations to improve the transparency and regulation of swap \ndealers and commodity index traders. These recommendations include: \ndevelop and regularly publish reports on the activity of swap dealers \nand commodity index traders; more accurately assess the type of trading \nactivity in the CFTC's weekly reports on commercial and noncommercial \ntrading; review whether to eliminate the bona fide hedge exemption for \nswap dealers and create new limited risk management exemption; provide \nadditional staff and resources for the CFTC.\n  Our legislation also is consistent with CFTC Commissioner Chilton's \ndissenting views on the CFTC's recommendations. In his dissent, \nCommissioner Chilton requested that Congress provide: ``specific \nstatutory authorities to allow the Commission to obtain data regarding \nover-the-counter transactions that may impact exchange-traded markets; \n``specific statutory authorities to allow the Commission to address \nmarket disturbances or violations of the Commodity Exchange Act, based \non the data received regarding over-the-counter transactions;'' and \nauthorization and appropriation for 100 additional employees.\n  Our bill provides the CFTC with the statutory authorities requested \nby Commissioner Chilton and authorizes the requested employees.\n  In summary, the legislation we are introducing today will give the \nCFTC ability to police all of our energy commodity markets to prevent \nexcessive speculation and price manipulation. This legislation is \nnecessary to close all of the loopholes in current law that permit \nspeculators to avoid trading limits designed to prevent the type of \nexcessive speculation that has been contributing to high energy prices. \nWe hope our colleagues will support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a bill summary be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   The Levin-Bingaman-Harkin Prevent Excessive Speculation Act Bill \n                        Summary, Sept. 24, 2008\n\n       The Levin-Bingaman-Harkin Prevent Excessive Speculation Act \n     would:\n       Authorize Speculation Limits for all Energy and \n     Agricultural Commodities.\n       Direct CFTC to impose position limits on energy and \n     agricultural futures contracts to prevent excessive \n     speculation and manipulation and to ensure sufficient market \n     liquidity.

Similar to Sec. 4 in S. 3268.\n       Require CFTC to invite non-U.S. regulators to form an \n     international working group to develop uniform regulatory and \n     reporting requirements to protect futures markets from \n     excessive speculation and manipulation.

A bill to establish a commission to assess the nuclear \nactivities of the Islamic Republic of Iran; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue of \ncritical importance to the security of our Nation and the world. I want \nto talk about the future of Iran's nuclear capabilities and what it \nmeans for the United States.\n  Too often here in Washington, we get caught up in the debate of the \nmoment and fail to appreciate the larger picture. Too many are more \nconcerned with petty blame games and not enough are concerned with the \ngreater challenge of protecting Americans.\n\n[[Page S9497]]\n\n  General Michael Hayden, the Director of Central Intelligence, has \nsaid that he believes Iran is seeking nuclear weapons. Others, \nincluding the President of the United States and the leaders of France \nand Great Britain agree.\n  I ask myself what would happen if the Ahmadinejad regime in Iran \nsucceeded in acquiring a nuclear weapon. Among the possibilities, he \ncould use that weapon. Iran could share it with terrorists or other \nrogue states. At a minimum, an Iranian nuke would prompt its neighbors \nin the Gulf, in Turkey, in Egypt and elsewhere to seek a similar \nability in order to defend themselves against Iran's efforts to gain \nregional dominance.\n  The stakes could not be higher, and I am concerned that we are not \nmeeting the challenge. To the contrary, I believe we are being tested, \nand we are failing.\n  Iran is the most active state sponsor of terrorism around the world. \nIn addition to its long time support for groups like Hezbollah and \nHamas, Iran is now active in directing aggression against our troops in \nIraq, sponsoring not only Shiite extremists but even Sunni terror \ngroups. According to General Petraeus, ``...Iran has played [a \nfundamental role] in funding, training, arming, and directing the so-\ncalled Special Groups and generated renewed concern about Iran in the \nminds of many Iraqi leaders. Unchecked, the Special Groups pose the \ngreatest long-term threat to the viability of a democratic Iraq.''\n  In addition to its destabilizing sponsorship of violence across the \nMiddle East, we also know that Iran is working on delivery vehicles for \ndeadly weapons. The regime has continuously upgraded its missile \ncapabilities, and now has delivery vehicles that can strike targets all \nover the Middle East and into Europe. Couple that knowledge with the \nevidence available that Iran has worked on fitting nuclear warheads \nonto these missiles, and we have even more practical reasons for \nconcern.\n  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has stated emphatically that \nhis Nation ``will not give up one iota of its nuclear rights.''\n  Where does this leave the United States, and the American people, in \nconfronting this growing and multidimensional threat? Unfortunately, \nthe answer appear, to be: confused.\n  The clearest evidence that we have yet to focus on the exact nature \nof the Iranian threat--an understanding that is imperative if we are \ngoing to succeed in countering it--is last year's National Intelligence \nEstimate on Iran.\n  Although leaders and intelligence agencies around the world believe \nthat Iran is indeed pursuing nuclear weapons, the NIE drew confusing, \nmisleading, and contradicting conclusions. In dramatic phrasing clearly \ndesigned to mislead, the NIE states that ``We judge with high \nconfidence that in fall 2003, Tehran halted its nuclear weapons \nprogram.'' In a footnote that got short shrift from both the press and \nthe jubilant Iranian regime, the analysts explain that what they say `` \n`nuclear weapons program' we mean Iran's nuclear weapon design and \nweaponization work and covert uranium conversion-related and uranium \nenrichment-related work; we do not mean Iran's declared civil work \nrelated to uranium conversion and enrichment.'' In other words, the \nwork referred to that had ``halted'' was in fact work that this \nCongress had heretofore not been able to confirm, and that we were \nuncertain existed. What continued, according to the NIE, was Iran's \nattempts to use its licit nuclear program to develop nuclear weapons \ncapability. Which is exactly what we have been worrying about all \nalong.\n  Since the NIE, the intelligence community has backed away from its \noriginal assessment. The Director of National Intelligence, Vice \nAdmiral Mike McConnell said that Iran could ``probably'' produce the \nfissile material needed for a nuclear weapon by as early as 2010. He \nhas also testified that he would ``change the way we described the \nnuclear program'' in the NIE.\n  Both Hayden and McConnell have also admitted that the NIE was so \nquickly declassified and poorly focused that it confused people. \nUnfortunately, the damage is done. The notion that Iran has suspended \nits nuclear program--however false that may be--has derailed our \ndiplomatic push to a great extent and caused more confusion. Whatever \nthe intentions behind this misleading assessment, we now know that \nIran, with some of its international supporters, used the opportunity \nto derail the diplomatic process and move ahead with its uranium \nenrichment. Iran is now on the verge of producing enough highly \nenriched uranium for one to three nuclear weapons a year.\n  This is not good news. Diplomacy, and more serious sanctions, keep \nmilitary action at bay. A lack of options is what forces nations to \nmake military choices.\n  I raise these points not to criticize the administration, advocate \nfor one action course of action over another, or argue about the \nresults of the recent NIE. I raise these points because our Nation \ncannot afford confusion about the threat at hand. We have \nunderestimated our adversaries in the past, and missed important \ndevelopments even in friendly nations. Saddam Hussein developed nuclear \nweapons while receiving U.S. aid. India detonated a nuclear device \nbefore the U.S. had any advance warning. More recently, Syria procured \na nuclear reactor as the United States negotiated in good faith with \nits suppliers in North Korea.\n  We need to get this right. A mistake, a botched timeline, a missed \nevent, a faulty analysis--all or any of the above could result in the \nworst of all possible outcomes. It is for that reason, that I rise \ntoday to introduce the legislation to help us better assess the nuclear \nthreat from Iran. This legislation will create an independent \ncommission comprised of 12 private U.S. citizens with expertise in \nnuclear proliferation and experience on the question of Iran. They will \nbe appointed by the Speaker of the House, the House Minority Leader, \nand the Senate Minority Leader. Together, they will lend their \nexpertise on this critical issue.\n  There is a venerable history to such bipartisan commissions, \nincluding the 9/11 Commission, the Commission to Assess the Ballistic \nMissile Threat to the United States, and the Commission on the \nIntelligence Capabilities of the United States. A commission can \nprovide a set of fresh eyes to look without bias at the information at \nhand and make assessments upon which the American people and American \npolicymakers can rely.\n  Perhaps there are some among my colleagues or in the bureaucracy of \nthe executive branch who believe that they need no help, and that such \na commission is not necessary. To them, I suggest a brief review of \nhistory. Let us rely on the best our Nation has to offer, and bring \nbipartisan, fresh expertise to the question of the Iranian threat.\n  I urge my colleagues to support me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 3581. A bill to establish a Federal Mortgage Origination \nCommission, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that goes to \nthe heart of one of the major problems in our loan operations. We have \nhad a system develop where no longer are loans just made available by \nthe State-regulated banks and thrifts. Too many loan offers come over \nthe Internet or by fax. I have not been able to develop a good enough \nscreening program on my computer to keep them out. I know what kinds of \nsolicitations are being made. They are being made by unregulated \nentities, people not subject to any regulation. As we say back home: We \nregulate the bricks but not the clicks. We regulate the banks and the \nsavings and loans but not the people who offer you loans too good to be \ntrue by fax or Internet.\n  Congress has already taken some steps to address the mortgage \norigination problem by developing a mortgage licensing and registry \nsystem through the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing \nAct of 2008 and protecting consumers by requiring greater mortgage loan \ndisclosure requirements. In addition, I have worked with Senator Dodd, \nlast year and this year, to include more housing counseling funding to \nassist homeowners. I strongly believe the Mortgage Origination \nCommission, proposed by the Secretary of the Treasury, is an important \nelement to complement these efforts.\n  As many of us know, the root cause of the current financial crisis is \ntraced\n\n[[Page S9498]]\n\nto the breakdowns in the mortgage market, led by the high level of \nfailures in subprime mortgages. These failures occurred due to many \nreasons, but one major reason was the loophole in the Government's \noversight and regulatory system for mortgage origination. Specifically, \nmany mortgage brokers with no or uneven regulatory oversight originated \na substantial number of all housing mortgages and over half of all \nsubprime mortgages.\n  To help close regulatory loopholes in mortgage origination, my bill \ncontains the key components recommended by the Treasury.\n  First, this legislation creates a new Federal oversight entity called \nthe Mortgage Origination Commission. The Commission would be led by a \nPresidentially appointed Director for a 5-year term who would chair a \nseven-member board comprised of the Federal Government's key financial \nregulators: the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the \nCurrency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, and \nthe Conference of State Bank Supervisors.\n  Second, the Commission would be empowered to develop uniform minimum \nlicensing qualification standards for State mortgage market \nparticipants. As laid out in the bill, these standards would include \npersonal conduct and disciplinary history, minimum educational \nrequirements, testing criteria and procedures, and appropriate license \nrevocation standards. The Commission would also evaluate, rate, and \nreport on the adequacy of each State's system for licensing and \nregulation.\n  The bill retains State-level regulation of the mortgage origination \nprocess, but the new Federal Mortgage Origination Commission would \nensure that the States have adequate protections in place and improve \ntransparency in the mortgage origination process by providing \ninformation on the strength of each State's standards. The Commission \nwill also provide transparency in the securities market by providing \nevaluations and ratings on mortgages.\n  Finally, the bill clarifies the Federal Government's enforcement and \nexamination responsibilities over mortgage origination companies. \nSpecifically, the Federal Reserve and the Office of Thrift Supervision \nwould have clear authority over mortgage originators that are \naffiliates of depository institutions with a federally regulated \nholding company. States would have clear authority to enforce Federal \nmortgage laws governing mortgage transactions involving mortgage \noriginators.\n  In formulating this legislation, my goal was to develop a proposal to \nprovide more effective regulation, transparency, and oversight in a \nstreamlined manner. This bill enhances the current structure without \ncreating a major new Federal entity. If enacted, the Commission could \nbe up and running in a relatively short time.\n  As I said, the legislation mirrors the Secretary of Treasury's \nproposal, and it is intended to be part of the overall response. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to achieve this. I know time is \nrunning short. I hope they will carefully consider this proposal and \nperhaps include it in the bill coming to us or in separate legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 3584. A bill to comprehensively prevent, treat, and decrease \noverweight and obesity in our Nation's populations; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Obesity \nPrevention, Treatment and Research Act of 2008. This legislation \ncreates unprecedented collaborations and collective across agencies, \nand among private and public entities, individuals, and communities.\n  The very high prevalence of individuals who are obese or overweight \nhas resulted in an epidemic in the United States, affecting over 66 \npercent of adults and 32 percent of children according to the CDC's \nNational Center for Health Statistics. Over the last 30 years, the \nobesity rate has more than doubled in all ages. The United States now \nhas the highest prevalence of obesity among the developed nations. In \nfact, the prevalence of obesity in U.S. in 2006, 34 percent is more \nthan twice the average for other developed nations, 13 percent. The \nprevalence of obesity in the next closest country, the United Kingdom, \nis over 25 percent less than that of the U.S.\n  The Obesity Prevention, Treatment and Research Act of 2008 \ncomprehensively addresses the obesity and overweight epidemic by \nfocusing on coordinating and augmenting existing prevention and \ntreatment activities. The legislation is based on the extensive work on \nobesity of the Institutes of Medicine, IOM, over the last few years.\n  The legislation focuses on developing dynamic new collaborations and \ncollective actions, which IOM recommends as essential to successfully \naddressing the problems of obese and overweight individuals throughout \nthe nation. In addition, the legislation focuses on supporting \ninterventions that will improve access to obesity prevention and \ntreatment services in our federal healthcare programs in recognition \nthat the high prevalence of overweight and obese individuals \ndramatically increases the costs in Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP, and \nother public and private health insurance programs.\n  I note that interventions aimed at significantly decreasing the \nprevalence of these illnesses are extremely cost effective and are \ncritical to overall disease prevention and health promotion efforts. \nThe Trust for America's Health recently reported that an investment of \njust $10 per person per year in proven community based disease \nprevention programs would yield a $2.8 billion annual health \nexpenditure reduction. Put another way, our nation would recoup nearly \n$1 over and above the cost of a comprehensive disease prevention and \nhealth promotion program for every $1 invested in the first 1 to 2 \nyears of the program.\n  The Obesity Prevention, Treatment and Research Act of 2008 \nestablishes the United States Council on Overweight & Obesity \nPrevention, USCO-OP, which is charged with creating a comprehensive \nstrategy to prevent, treat and reduce the prevalence of overweight \nindividuals and obesity. This advisory council will update Federal \nguidelines, identify best practices, conduct ongoing surveillance and \nmonitoring of existing Federal programs, and make recommendations to \ncoordinate budgets, policies and programs across Federal agencies in \ncollaboration with private and public partners. In addition, the \nCouncil will provide guidance to the Federal Government for a new \nseries of grant programs established by the legislation to combat \nobesity and the high prevalence of overweight individuals.\n\n  It is important to note that in July the Journal of the American \nMedical Association reported that physical activity levels drop sharply \nas children age. Children should be engaging in 60 minutes of moderate \nto vigorous physical activity most days of the week. While 90 percent \nof children met the recommended activity at age 9, by age 15 only 31 \npercent met the level on weekdays, and only 17 percent on weekends. \nMoreover, these behaviors become worse as they get older. I find these \ntrends very disturbing.\n  In addition, experts tell us that Americans want and need better and \nmore accessible information about healthier foods, beverages and \nexercise programs. The Council will help develop and update the daily \nphysical activity requirements in our schools, and identify activities \nthat families can do together, involving parents and their children \nthroughout the week, and as lifelong participants.\n  My legislation also creates grant programs to provide funding to \nschools, community health centers, academic institutions, state medical \nsocieties, state health departments, and communities to reduce the \nprevalence and improve the prevention and treatment of individuals that \nare obese or overweight.\n  It is also critical to point out that certain populations are more \nvulnerable than others to the obesity and overweight epidemic. In my \nhome state of New Mexico, for example, the consequences are \ndevastating. 74 percent of Native American adults in New Mexico are \noverweight or obese, as are 38 percent of Native American High School \nstudents. I take steps in this legislation to address populations more \nseverely impacted by the obesity and overweight epidemic, including: \nprioritizing grants to these populations\n\n[[Page S9499]]\n\nand requiring Federal reporting on research and data related to obesity \nin these populations.\n  The legislation also doubles existing funding levels for the \nDepartment of Agriculture's Fresh Foods and Vegetables program to \nlevels that will assure that most low-income children will have access \nto these foods within their schools.\n  The legislation also requires the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices and the Secretary of Agriculture to consult with USCO-OP to \nupdate and reform Federal oversight of food and beverage labeling. Such \nreforms include improving the transparency of labeling with regard to \nnutritional and caloric value of food and beverages. These updates and \nreforms are critical. Research suggests that high-energy dense foods \nthat are low in nutrients represent 30 percent of the average American \ntotal calorie intake. Research also suggests that these foods don't \ntrigger the brain's normal pathways and responses to let the body know \nthat it is full.\n  My legislation also amends the Social Security Act to expand access \nto medical nutrition therapy and exercise counseling when determined \ncost effective by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. We have \nto figure out a way to prevent the development of end stages of morbid \nobesity, such as kidney failure, heart failure and disability from \narthritis and other problems. My bill seeks to invest our Federal \ndollar more wisely. This is truly the case where an ounce of prevention \nis worth a pound of cure.\n  I would like to thank Dr. Dan Derksen, who served as a Robert Wood \nJohnson Health Policy Fellow in my office this year, for his great work \nin developing this legislation. In addition, I would like to thank the \nInstitutes of Medicine, the Campaign to End Obesity, and First Focus \nfor their assistance in developing this legislation.\n  The legislation has received the endorsement of: the Campaign to End \nObesity, American College of Gastroenterology, First Focus, Shaping \nAmerica's Health, YMCA of the USA, the National Coalition for Promoting \nPhysical Activity, the Sporting Goods Manufacturers of America, and the \nNew Mexico Medical Society.\n  I urge my other Senate colleagues to join in supporting this critical \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3584\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Obesity Prevention, \n     Treatment, and Research Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 2001, the United States Surgeon General released the \n     Call to Action to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity \n     to bring attention to the public health problems related to \n     obesity.\n       (2) Since the Surgeon General's call to action, the \n     problems of obesity and overweight have become epidemic, \n     occurring in all ages, ethnicities and races, and individuals \n     in every State.\n       (3) The United States now has the highest prevalence of \n     obesity among the developed nations, according to 2006 data \n     by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \n     Development. The prevalence of obesity in the United States \n     (34 percent) is more than twice the average for other \n     developed nations (13 percent). The closest nation in \n     prevalence of obesity is the United Kingdom (24 percent) \n     which is over 25 percent less than the United States.\n       (4) The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in \n     2006 estimated that 32 percent of children and adolescents \n     aged 2 to 19 and an alarming 66 percent of adults are \n     overweight or obese.\n       (5) More than 30 percent of young people in grades 9 \n     through 12 do not regularly engage in vigorous intensity \n     physical activity, while almost 40 percent of adults are \n     sedentary and 70 percent report getting less than 20 minutes \n     of regular physical activity per day.\n       (6) The Institute of Medicine, in their 2005 publication \n     ``Preventing Childhood Obesity: Health in the Balance'', \n     reported that over the last 3 decades, the rate of childhood \n     obesity has tripled for children aged 6 to 11 years, and \n     doubled for children aged 2 to 5 years old and in adolescents \n     aged 12 to 19 years old. In 2004, approximately 9,000,000 \n     children over 6 years of age were obese. Only 2 percent of \n     children eat a healthy diet consistent with Federal nutrition \n     guidelines.\n       (7) For children born in 2000, it is estimated the lifetime \n     risk of being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes is 40 percent \n     for females and 30 percent for males.\n       (8) Overweight and obesity disproportionately affect \n     minority populations and women. According to the 2006 \n     Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System of the Centers for \n     the Disease Control and Prevention, 61 percent of adults in \n     the United States are overweight or obese.\n       (9) The Centers for the Disease Control and Prevention \n     estimates the annual expenditures related to overweight and \n     obesity in the United States to be $117,000,000,000 in 2001 \n     and rising rapidly.\n       (10) The Centers for the Disease Control and Prevention \n     estimates that the increase in the number of overweight and \n     obese Americans between 1987 and 2001 resulted in a 27 \n     percent increase in per capita health costs, and that as many \n     as 112,000 deaths per year are associated with obesity.\n       (11) Being overweight or obese increases the risk of \n     chronic diseases including diabetes, heart disease, stroke, \n     certain cancers, arthritis, and other health problems.\n       (12) According to the National Institute of Diabetes and \n     Digestive and Kidney Diseases, individuals who are obese have \n     a 50 to 100 percent increased risk of premature death.\n       (13) Healthy People 2010 goals identify overweight and \n     obesity as 1 of the Nation's leading health problems and \n     include objectives for increasing the proportion of adults \n     who are at a healthy weight, reducing the proportion of \n     adults who are obese, and reducing the proportion of children \n     and adolescents who are overweight or obese.\n       (14) Another Healthy People 2010 goal is to eliminate \n     health disparities among different segments of the \n     population. Obesity is a health problem that \n     disproportionally impacts medically underserved populations.\n       (15) Food and beverage advertisers are estimated to spend \n     $10,000,000 to $12,000,000,000 per year to target children \n     and youth.\n       (16) The United States spends less than 2 percent of its \n     annual health expenditures on prevention.\n       (17) Employer health promotion investments net a return of \n     $3 for every $1 invested.\n       (18) High-energy dense and low-nutrient dense foods \n     represent 30 percent of American's total calorie intake. Fast \n     food company menus are twice the energy density of \n     recommended healthful diets.\n       (19) Research suggests that individuals eat too much high-\n     energy dense foods without feeling full because the brain's \n     pathways that regulate hunger and influence normal food \n     intake are not triggered by these foods.\n       (20) Packaging, product placement, and high-energy dense \n     food content manipulation contribute to the overweight and \n     obesity epidemic in the United States.\n       (21) Such marketing and content manipulation techniques \n     have been used by other industries to encourage consumption \n     at the expense of health. To help individuals make healthy \n     choices, education and information must be available with \n     clear, consistent, and accurate labeling.\n\n         TITLE I--OBESITY TREATMENT, PREVENTION, AND REDUCTION\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to provide grants for use by rural local educational \nagencies in purchasing new school buses; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, many years ago, when I attended school in \nSearchlight, I walked to school. When it was time for high school, I \nhitched a ride into a town 40 miles away and had to stay with family \nduring the week. There weren't many options back then. That was how \nmany kids got to school in rural Nevada--walk or hitchhike.\n  Now, of course, in both urban and rural America, most children take \nschool buses to school.\n  Unfortunately, rural school districts across America are strapped. \nThey can't afford to buy newer, safer buses. With gas near $4 a gallon, \ntheir budgets have been stretched to the limits. As a result, many \nrural areas have no choice but to operate outdated, unsafe school buses \nfor as long as they can pass inspection.\n  Over the years, I have met several times with the school \nsuperintendents in my State--all 17 of them. While each district has \ntheir own unique challenges, they all have an urgent need for safe and \nreliable school buses.\n  In some rural Nevada counties, school buses must travel a million \nmiles in a single school year. Last school year, the buses in one of \nNevada's rural school districts traveled close to 5 million miles \ncombined. I am fairly confident that many of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle would agree that the need for newer and safer school \nbuses is not unique to Nevada's rural school districts.\n  From my meetings with our State's superintendents, it was clear that \nour school districts needed assistance. In the 108th and 109th \nCongresses, I introduced legislation to help these and other rural \ndistricts transport children to school in a way that is safe, \naffordable, and environmentally sound.\n  The Bus Utility and Safety in School Transportation Opportunity and \nPurchasing Act of 2008--or BUS STOP--allows school districts across \nrural America to be eligible for transit funding through the Department \nof Transportation, with the Federal Government contributing 75 percent \nof the cost.\n  Some may wonder why we need such a program when the Environmental\n\n[[Page S9503]]\n\nProtection Agency already has a cost-share grant program--the Clean \nSchool Bus USA program--to help school districts purchase new buses \npowered by natural gas or other alternative fuels.\n  Unfortunately, most of the rural districts in my State, and, I would \nimagine, across the country, cannot apply for these grants because they \ndon't have the infrastructure in place to support this technology.\n  However, working in the spirit of a cleaner environment and healthy \nchildren, this bill will help rural school districts buy newer buses \nthat are better for our air, and safer for our children.\n  There are many small, rural towns in America, like Searchlight, where \nkids travel to school in outdated buses. They deserve no less than \nsafe, clean, economical buses to get them to school.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3590\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bus Utility and Safety in \n     School Transportation Opportunity and Purchasing Act of \n     2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey to \nthe Nevada System of Higher Education certain Federal land located in \nClark and Nye counties, Nevada, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend Senator \nEnsign to introduce the Southern Nevada Higher Education Land Act of \n2008. This bill will expand opportunities for higher education in one \nof the Nation's fastest growing areas, southern Nevada.\n  In July 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Land Grant College \nAct into law, creating a higher education legacy that continues to \nbenefit our country today. That bill, now referred to as the Morrill \nAct, provided 30,000 acres of Federal land per Member of Congress to \nestablish institutions of higher education in each State. Today, thanks \nin large part to the foresight of Senator Justin Smith Morrill from \nVermont and others from his time, this Nation has one of the finest \npublic university systems in the world.\n  Among the many universities established as a result of this forward-\nlooking legislation was the University of Nevada. The State's first \nuniversity was originally founded in Elko in 1874. Two years later, \nNevada's State legislature voted to move the university to its current \nhome in Reno. The University of Nevada remained the State's only higher \neducation institution for 75 years.\n  From these humble beginnings, the State of Nevada has expanded its \nhigher education system to now include two research universities, one \nState college, one research institution, and four community colleges. \nThe Nevada System of Higher Education, which was formed in 1968 and \nencompasses all 8 institutions, has grown to serve roughly 98,000 \ndegree-seeking students.\n  As the State of Nevada continues to grow, so too must its university \nsystem. With over 2 million residents in 2007, greater Las Vegas is the \nfourth-largest metropolitan area in the Mountain West. In this decade \nalone, the area's population has grown by 31 percent, 5 times faster \nthan the Nation as a whole. By the year 2040, the area's population is \nprojected to double to nearly 4.3 million residents. We must expand \nhigher education opportunities to meet the demands of this growing \nregion.\n  Consider the following--the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, with \n28,000 students and 3,300 faculty and staff, is the fourth fastest-\ngrowing research university in the Nation. The College of Southern \nNevada, also in Las Vegas, serves 39,000 students and its three\n\n[[Page S9504]]\n\nurban campuses are at near capacity. The town of Pahrump, 60 miles from \nLas Vegas in rural Nye County, has grown by 20 percent since 2000. \nGreat Basin College's small branch campus in Pahrump uses high school \nclassrooms at night to serve the city's 41,000 residents.\n  Our legislation will make selected parcels of Federal lands available \nfor the future growth of the university system. Land will be provided \nfor new campuses for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas; the College \nof Southern Nevada; and a Pahrump campus of Great Basin College. The \ncurrent campuses for these three institutions comprise 1,150 acres in \nsouthern Nevada. With the passage of this legislation, an additional \n2,400 acres will be available for new classroom, research, and \nresidential facilities to help further the missions of these three fine \ninstitutions.\n  To establish these new campuses, three parcels of land would be \nconveyed from the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, to the Nevada System \nof Higher Education. Two of the parcels are located in Clark County, \nwithin the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act, SNPLMA, disposal \nboundary. The third parcel is located in Pahrump, west of Las Vegas, in \nNye County. BLM has designated all of these parcels for disposal \nbecause they are surrounded by development and are difficult to manage.\n  It is important to point out that the land our legislation conveys \nfor the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, borders Nellis Air Force Base. \nNellis was once on the outskirts of town, but now development is on its \ndoorstep. In order to protect the mission of the Nellis Air Force base, \nwe have put a special provision in the legislation requiring that the \nuniversity system and Air Force sign a common agreement regarding \ndevelopment plans for the campus before any land is conveyed. The \nuniversity system and the Air Force have been in conversations about \nthis agreement for at least 2 years and seem to have found a middle \nground that will serve the interests of both parties. We greatly \nappreciate the efforts of the university system and the Air Force to \nmake this work.\n  This same land bordering Nellis was once used as a small arms range \nduring World War II and will need to be cleaned up before it can be \nconveyed to the university system. Because it will take time to \naccomplish this, our legislation allows the land to be conveyed in \nphases, as the remediation is completed.\n  This proposal to expand higher education opportunities in southern \nNevada has been welcomed by area leaders. City and county officials \nhave worked closely with the Nevada System of Higher Education to plan \nthe development of world-class facilities in their communities. These \nfacilities are critical to meeting the challenge of diversifying their \neconomies and attracting and growing knowledge industries in the area.\n  Just as the Morrill Act opened up Federal land to expand higher \neducation across the Nation, I am hopeful that this important, though \nmuch more modest effort can do the same for the residents of southern \nNevada. We look forward to working with Chairman Bingaman, Ranking \nMember Domenici and the other distinguished members of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee to move this legislation in an expeditious \nmanner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3595\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to stabilize the small business lending market, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, over the past several days the Federal \nGovernment has been called upon to bail out some of America's largest \nfinancial companies. While I recognize that swift action must be taken \nto prevent the collapse of our Nation's major financial institutions, \nlike many other Americans, I believe we also should come to the aid of \nour Nation's small businesses, which are also imperiled by this \nfinancial crisis.\n  Today the problems facing small firms and the banks that typically \nlend to them are not unlike those being faced by corporate America--\nfirms simply cannot access the capital they need to keep their small \nbusinesses afloat in the wake of this economic crisis. Although the \nSmall Business Administration's loan programs were designed to reach \nthese marginalized borrowers, there is ample evidence that the programs \nare failing to do so at this critical juncture.\n  Last year, the SBA's 7(a) and 504 loan guarantee programs combined to \nprovide over 100,000 American small businesses with essential \nfinancing, and they injected approximately $20 billion into our local \nbusinesses and communities. As a result of the financial crisis, 7(a) \nloans are down about 30 percent in terms of the number of loans made, \nand down about 11 percent in terms of dollars. Meanwhile, the number of \n504 loans has decreased about 16 percent and they are down \napproximately 15 percent in terms of dollars loaned for fiscal year \n2008. But these are more than just statistics; they are stark \nindications that the SBA's loan programs are not reaching enough of the \nsmall businesses that are now struggling to obtain affordable credit.\n  The recent drop in SBA lending paints a picture of small business \nborrowers and lenders caught in a vicious cycle driven by the financial \ncrises of the past year. On the lender side of the equation, struggling \nbanks have become so concerned with risk that they have virtually cut \noff conventional small business borrowing, even to well-qualified \nfirms. On the borrower side, the banks' extremely tight lending \npractices are preventing loans--SBA loans in particular--from serving \nsmall businesses that need capital to survive the current economic \ncrisis. That is why I am introducing the Small Business Lending Market \nStabilization Act of 2008--which will jump start SBA lending, helping \nthousands of American small businesses receive the financing they need \nto survive the current financial crisis.\n  In April, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I held a hearing to learn why the SBA loan programs \nwere not reaching small businesses that were being squeezed out of the \nconventional loan markets by the credit crunch. Although the \nAdministration refused to admit it at the time, virtually every other \nwitness at the hearing told me that the SBA's increased fees played a \nsignificant role. The bill I have introduced today will address that \nproblem by temporarily eliminating the fees that the SBA charges to \nborrowers, lenders, and ``Certified Development Companies'' for the \n7(a) and 504 loan guarantee programs. This will immediately reduce the \ncost of capital for SBA borrowers. With lower monthly loan payments, \nmore money will be placed into the hands of small business owners--\nmoney that will allow them to continue purchasing inventory and \nequipment. At the same time, the fee relief will also reduce the cost \nof lending for SBA's partners in the private sector, allowing them to \nmake more small business loans through the programs.\n  The bill also includes several provisions that will expand the \nuniverse of small businesses that can access the SBA's loan programs. \nFor instance, one measure will permit certain borrowers to refinance a \nlimited amount of their preexisting debt through a new 504 loan. This \nadjustment will allow 504 loans to reach small business owners who want \nto refinance their company's existing debt, but have been turned down \nby conventional lenders.\n  The bill also contains measures that will give lenders greater \nflexibility in making SBA loans. One provision would allow the SBA to \nuse ``weighted average rates'' when pooling loans for sale on the \nsecondary market, making the secondary markets for SBA loans more \nefficient and improving liquidity among participating banks. Another \nprovision would provide greater flexibility by directing the SBA to \ngive lenders at least one alternative interest rate to the Wall Street \nprime rate, which will help reduce interest rate typically charged on \n7(a) loans.\n  In short, the bill I am introducing today will provide much needed \nsupport for America's small businesses, helping them break free from \nthe vicious cycle caused by the crisis in our financial markets. I will \ncontinue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nensure that the massive Wall Street bailout proposal we have been asked \nto approve contains adequate protections for taxpayers. But I also urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this bill, which will provide a \nlifeline to hundreds of thousands of American small businesses along \nMain Street.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL:\n  S. 3599.

Res. 685\n\n       Whereas the Framers of the Constitution established the \n     United States as a representative democracy, with the \n     fundamental principle of civic engagement on the part of all \n     eligible citizens;\n\n[[Page S9519]]\n\n       Whereas an essential element of an effective democracy is \n     the ability of each eligible and qualified citizen to be able \n     to vote in fair and open elections;\n       Whereas Congress has passed important election laws such as \n     the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) of 2002, the National Voter \n     Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA- Motor Voter Act), and the \n     Voting Rights Act of 1965, dedicated to increasing the \n     transparency of the election process, strengthening our \n     voting systems, and protecting the right of all citizens to \n     vote;\n       Whereas the 26th amendment of the Constitution requires \n     that ``the right of citizens of the United States, who are \n     eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be denied \n     or abridged by the United States or by any State on the \n     account of age'';\n       Whereas Minnesota, Maine, New Hampshire, Idaho, Wisconsin, \n     and Wyoming allow same day registration of voters at the \n     polls, and also experience the highest voter turnout rates in \n     the country;\n       Whereas most States have 30-day voter registration \n     deadlines, and the public must be informed of their local and \n     State election laws in September in order to participate \n     fully in the Federal elections in November;\n       Whereas experts estimate that more than 20 percent of \n     voters nationwide will cast their ballots before election day \n     by mail or at early-voting locations, a proportion of the \n     electorate that is rising with each election;\n       Whereas many election officials note that early voting is \n     convenient for voters, increases turnout, and reduces the \n     strain on polling places and poll workers on election day;\n       Whereas, according to the Fair Vote Center for Voting and \n     Democracy, voter turnout in the United States is lower than \n     in most other developed nations, with the United States \n     coming 20th out of 21 in voter turnout among established \n     democracies; and\n       Whereas S. 1901, introduced in the 102nd Congress, would \n     have amended section 6103 of title 5, United States Code, to \n     establish Democracy Day as a legal public holiday on election \n     day, in recognition of the need for increased participation \n     of an educated electorate to preserve the legitimacy of \n     democracy: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the last week of September 2008 as \n     ``National Voter Awareness Week'';\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     such a week with appropriate programs and activities, \n     including helping State and local institutions deliver sample \n     ballots, voter registration forms, absentee ballots, and \n     other educational materials to all eligible voters; and\n       (3) encourages all grassroots organizations and \n     educational, cultural, and community institutions to promote \n     voter awareness and registration programs that befit local \n     election procedure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/25/senate-section/article/S9519-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 5645.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds, on this, the 50th anniversary of the \n     establishment of the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration, the following:\n       (1) NASA is and should remain a multimission agency with a \n     balanced and robust set of core missions in science, \n     aeronautics, and human space flight and exploration.\n       (2) Investment in NASA's programs will promote innovation \n     through research and development, and will improve the \n     competitiveness of the United States.\n       (3) Investment in NASA's programs, like investments in \n     other Federal science and technology activities, is an \n     investment in our future.\n\n[[Page S9525]]\n\n       (4) Properly structured, NASA's activities can contribute \n     to an improved quality of life, economic vitality, United \n     States leadership in peaceful cooperation with other nations \n     on challenging undertakings in science and technology, \n     national security, and the advancement of knowledge.\n       (5) NASA should assume a leadership role in a cooperative \n     international Earth observations and research effort to \n     address key research issues associated with climate change \n     and its impacts on the Earth system.\n       (6) NASA should undertake a program of aeronautical \n     research, development, and where appropriate demonstration \n     activities with the overarching goals of--\n       (A) ensuring that the Nation's future air transportation \n     system can handle up to 3 times the current travel demand and \n     incorporate new vehicle types with no degradation in safety \n     or adverse environmental impact on local communities;\n       (B) protecting the environment;\n       (C) promoting the security of the Nation; and\n       (D) retaining the leadership of the United States in global \n     aviation.\n       (7) Human and robotic exploration of the solar system will \n     be a significant long-term undertaking of humanity in the \n     21st century and beyond, and it is in the national interest \n     that the United States should assume a leadership role in a \n     cooperative international exploration initiative.\n       (8) Developing United States human space flight \n     capabilities to allow independent American access to the \n     International Space Station, and to explore beyond low Earth \n     orbit, is a strategically important national imperative, and \n     all prudent steps should thus be taken to bring the Orion \n     Crew Exploration Vehicle and Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle to \n     full operational capability as soon as possible and to ensure \n     the effective development of a United States heavy lift \n     launch capability for missions beyond low Earth orbit.\n       (9) NASA's scientific research activities have contributed \n     much to the advancement of knowledge, provided societal \n     benefits, and helped train the next generation of scientists \n     and engineers, and those activities should continue to be an \n     important priority.\n       (10) NASA should make a sustained commitment to a robust \n     long-term technology development activity.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON EARTHKAM AND ROBOTICS \n                   COMPETITIONS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that NASA's educational \n     programs are important sources\n\n[[Page S9531]]\n\n     of inspiration and hands-on learning for the next generation \n     of engineers and scientists and should be supported. In that \n     regard, programs such as EarthKAM, which brings NASA directly \n     into American classrooms by enabling students to talk \n     directly with astronauts aboard the International Space \n     Station and to take photographs of Earth from space, and NASA \n     involvement in robotics competitions for students of all \n     levels, are particularly worthy undertakings and NASA should \n     support them and look for additional opportunities to engage \n     students through NASA's space and aeronautics activities.\n\n     SEC. 704. ENHANCEMENT OF EDUCATIONAL ROLE OF NASA.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the International Space Station offers a unique opportunity \n     for Federal agencies to engage students in science, \n     technology, engineering, and mathematics education. Congress \n     encourages NASA to include other Federal agencies in its \n     planning efforts to use the International Space Station \n     National Laboratory for science, technology, engineering, and \n     mathematics educational activities.\n       (b) Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive \n     Research.--In order to ensure that research expertise and \n     talent throughout the Nation is developed and engaged in NASA \n     research and education activities, NASA shall, as part of its \n     annual budget submission, detail additional steps that can be \n     taken to further integrate the participating EPSCoR States in \n     both existing and new or emerging NASA research programs and \n     center activities.\n       (c) National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program.--\n     NASA shall continue its emphasis on the importance of \n     education to expand opportunities for Americans to understand \n     and participate in NASA's aeronautics and space projects by \n     supporting and enhancing science and engineering education, \n     research, and public outreach efforts.\n\n                     TITLE VIII--NEAR-EARTH OBJECTS\n\n     SEC. 801. REAFFIRMATION OF POLICY.\n\n       (a) Reaffirmation of Policy on Surveying Near-Earth \n     Asteroids and Comets.--Congress reaffirms the policy set \n     forth in section 102(g) of the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Act of 1958 (42 U.S.C. 2451(g)) (relating to surveying near-\n     Earth asteroids and comets).\n       (b) Sense of Congress on Benefits of Near-Earth Object \n     Program Activities.--It is the sense of Congress that the \n     near-Earth object program activities of NASA will provide \n     benefits to the scientific and exploration activities of \n     NASA.\n\n     SEC. 802. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Near-Earth objects pose a serious and credible threat \n     to humankind, as many scientists believe that a major \n     asteroid or comet was responsible for the mass extinction of \n     the majority of the Earth's species, including the dinosaurs, \n     nearly 65,000,000 years ago.\n       (2) Several such near-Earth objects have only been \n     discovered within days of the objects' closest approach to \n     Earth and recent discoveries of such large objects indicate \n     that many large near-Earth objects remain undiscovered.\n       (3) Asteroid and comet collisions rank as one of the most \n     costly natural disasters that can occur.\n       (4) The time needed to eliminate or mitigate the threat of \n     a collision of a potentially hazardous near-Earth object with \n     Earth is measured in decades.\n       (5) Unlike earthquakes and hurricanes, asteroids and comets \n     can provide adequate collision information, enabling the \n     United States to include both asteroid-collision and comet-\n     collision disaster recovery and disaster avoidance in its \n     public-safety structure.\n       (6) Basic information is needed for technical and policy \n     decisionmaking for the United States to create a \n     comprehensive program in order to be ready to eliminate and \n     mitigate the serious and credible threats to humankind posed \n     by potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids and comets.\n       (7) As a first step to eliminate and to mitigate the risk \n     of such collisions, situation and decision analysis \n     processes, as well as procedures and system resources, must \n     be in place well before a collision threat becomes known.\n\n     SEC. 803. REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION.\n\n       The Administrator shall issue requests for information on--\n       (1) a low-cost space mission with the purpose of \n     rendezvousing with, attaching a tracking device, and \n     characterizing the Apophis asteroid; and\n       (2) a medium-sized space mission with the purpose of \n     detecting near-Earth objects equal to or greater than 140 \n     meters in diameter.\n\n     SEC. 804. ESTABLISHMENT OF POLICY WITH RESPECT TO THREATS \n                   POSED BY NEAR-EARTH OBJECTS.\n\n       Within 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Director of the OSTP shall--\n       (1) develop a policy for notifying Federal agencies and \n     relevant emergency response institutions of an impending \n     near-Earth object threat, if near-term public safety is at \n     risk; and\n       (2) recommend a Federal agency or agencies to be \n     responsible for--\n       (A) protecting the United States from a near-Earth object \n     that is expected to collide with Earth; and\n       (B) implementing a deflection campaign, in consultation \n     with international bodies, should one be necessary.\n\n     SEC. 805. PLANETARY RADAR CAPABILITY.\n\n       The Administrator shall maintain a planetary radar that is \n     comparable to the capability provided through the Deep Space \n     Network Goldstone facility of NASA.\n\n     SEC. 806. ARECIBO OBSERVATORY.\n\n       Congress reiterates its support for the use of the Arecibo \n     Observatory for NASA-funded near-Earth object-related \n     activities. The Administrator, using funds authorized in \n     section 101(a)(1)(B), shall ensure the availability of the \n     Arecibo Observatory's planetary radar to support these \n     activities until the National Academies' review of NASA's \n     approach for the survey and deflection of near-Earth objects, \n     including a determination of the role of Arecibo, that was \n     directed to be undertaken by the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus \n     Appropriations Act, is completed.\n\n     SEC. 807. INTERNATIONAL RESOURCES.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that, since an estimated 25,000 \n     asteroids of concern have yet to be discovered and monitored, \n     the United States should seek to obtain commitments for \n     cooperation from other nations with significant resources for \n     contributing to a thorough and timely search for such objects \n     and an identification of their characteristics.\n\n                    TITLE IX--COMMERCIAL INITIATIVES\n\n     SEC. 901. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that a healthy and robust \n     commercial sector can make significant contributions to the \n     successful conduct of NASA's space exploration program. While \n     some activities are inherently governmental in nature, there \n     are many other activities, such as routine supply of water, \n     fuel, and other consumables to low Earth orbit or to \n     destinations beyond low Earth orbit, and provision of power \n     or communications services to lunar outposts, that \n     potentially could be carried out effectively and efficiently \n     by the commercial sector at some point in the future. \n     Congress encourages NASA to look for such service \n     opportunities and, to the maximum extent practicable, make \n     use of the commercial sector to provide those services. It is \n     further the sense of Congress that United States \n     entrepreneurial space companies have the potential to develop \n     and deliver innovative technology solutions at affordable \n     costs. NASA is encouraged to use United States \n     entrepreneurial space companies to conduct appropriate \n     research and development activities. NASA is further \n     encouraged to seek ways to ensure that firms that rely on \n     fixed-price proposals are not disadvantaged when NASA seeks \n     to procure technology development.\n\n     SEC. 902. COMMERCIAL CREW INITIATIVE.\n\n       (a) In General.--In order to stimulate commercial use of \n     space, help maximize the utility and productivity of the \n     International Space Station, and enable a commercial means of \n     providing crew transfer and crew rescue services for the \n     International Space Station, NASA shall--\n       (1) make use of United States commercially provided \n     International Space Station crew transfer and crew rescue \n     services to the maximum extent practicable, if those \n     commercial services have demonstrated the capability to meet \n     NASA-specified ascent, entry, and International Space Station \n     proximity operations safety requirements;\n       (2) limit, to the maximum extent practicable, the use of \n     the Crew Exploration Vehicle to missions carrying astronauts \n     beyond low Earth orbit once commercial crew transfer and crew \n     rescue services that meet safety requirements become \n     operational;\n       (3) facilitate, to the maximum extent practicable, the \n     transfer of NASA-developed technologies to potential United \n     States commercial crew transfer and rescue service providers, \n     consistent with United States law; and\n       (4) issue a notice of intent, not later than 180 days after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, to enter into a funded, \n     competitively awarded Space Act Agreement with 2 or more \n     commercial entities for a Phase 1 Commercial Orbital \n     Transportation Services crewed vehicle demonstration program.\n       (b) Congressional Intent.--It is the intent of Congress \n     that funding for the program described in subsection (a)(4) \n     shall not come at the expense of full funding of the amounts \n     authorized under section 101(3)(A), and for future fiscal \n     years, for Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle development, Ares I \n     Crew Launch Vehicle development, or International Space \n     Station cargo delivery.\n       (c) Additional Technologies.--NASA shall make International \n     Space Station-compatible docking adaptors and other relevant \n     technologies available to the commercial crew providers \n     selected to service the International Space Station.\n       (d) Crew Transfer and Crew Rescue Services Contract.--If a \n     commercial provider demonstrates the capability to provide \n     International Space Station crew transfer and crew rescue \n     services and to satisfy NASA ascent, entry, and International \n     Space Station proximity operations safety requirements, NASA \n     shall enter into an International Space Station crew transfer \n     and crew rescue services contract with that commercial \n     provider for a portion of NASA's anticipated International \n     Space Station crew transfer and crew rescue requirements from \n     the time the commercial provider commences operations under \n     contract with NASA through calendar year 2016, with an option \n     to extend the period of performance through calendar year \n     2020.\n\n[[Page S9532]]\n\n       TITLE X--REVITALIZATION OF NASA INSTITUTIONAL CAPABILITIES\n\n     SEC. 1001.

Mr. President, this spring, I was proud to introduce the \nbipartisan Runaway and Homeless Youth Protection Act of 2008 along with \nSenator Specter, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee. I \nam pleased that finally, after four months of delay due to an \nobjection, the Senate has acted to pass this important bill.\n  The Runaway and Homeless Youth Protection Act was included in the \nAdvancing America's Priorities Act, a larger package of bills the \nSenate considered this summer. All of the bills contained in the \nAdvancing America's Priorities Act should have passed by consent, but \nwere stalled on the Senate floor by Republican objection. Like most of \nthe measures in the bill, the Runaway and Homeless Youth Protection Act \nhas bipartisan backing and passed the House with overwhelming support. \nThis is legislation on which we should all agree, and I am glad the \nobjection has been lifted. I hope the House will quickly consider this \nlegislation and send it to the President to be signed into law.\n  Regrettably, the junior Senator from Oklahoma, who neither attended \nthe Judiciary Committee hearing we had on this bill, nor objected when \nthe legislation was reported out of the Judiciary Committee, has \ninsisted on substantive changes to the bipartisan and bicameral \nconsensus bill before he will lift his objection. He opposes including \na public awareness campaign so that the youth who might benefit from \nthese programs know about the services their community provides. We \nremoved it at the request of the Senator. He has also objected to \nallowing youth to stay in the Transitional Living Program a few extra \nmonths in order to make sure they are able to leave the program safely. \nI have worked with the House to clarify language that the extended \nlength of stay would only be used by programs in exceptional \ncircumstances. He has also required that the authorized level of \nfunding for these programs that help our Nation's youth be slashed. I \nintend to work with Senators Harkin and Specter and others on the \nAppropriations Committee to ensure that these programs are funded at \nthe appropriate level that should have been authorized into law. We \nhave made further concessions on other legislation to accommodate him. \nI have made still more concessions to the junior Senator from Arizona, \nwho made additional extraneous demands at the eleventh hour.\n\n[[Page S9551]]\n\n  The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act is the way in which the Federal \nGovernment helps communities across the country protect some of our \nmost vulnerable children. It was first passed the year I was elected to \nthe Senate. We have reauthorized it several times since then, and \nworking with Senator Specter and Senators on both sides of the aisle, I \nam glad the Senate has done so again this year. The programs authorized \nduring the past 30 years by the RHYA have consistently proven critical \nto protecting and giving hope to our Nation's runaway and homeless \nyouth.\n  Under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, every State receives a \nbasic center grant to provide housing and crisis services for runaway \nand homeless youth and their families. Community-based groups around \nthe country can also apply for funding through the Transitional Living \nProgram and the sexual abuse prevention/street outreach grant program. \nThe transitional living program grants are used to provide longer term \nhousing to homeless youth between the ages of 16 and 21, and to help \nthem become self-sufficient. The outreach grants are used to target \nyouth susceptible to engaging in high-risk behaviors while living on \nthe street.\n  Despite the changes to the bill made in response to Republican \nobjections, our bill makes improvements to the Runaway and Homeless \nYouth Act reauthorizations of past years. It doubles funding for states \nby instituting a minimum of $200,000, which will allow states to better \nmeet the diverse needs of their communities. This bill also requires \nthe Department of Health and Human Services to develop performance \nstandards for grantees. Providing program guidelines would level the \nplaying field for bidders, ensure consistency among providers, and \nincrease the effectiveness of the services under the Runaway and \nHomeless Youth Act. In addition, our legislation develops an incidence \nstudy to better estimate the number of runaway and homeless youth and \nto identify trends. The incidence study would provide more accurate \nestimates of the runaway and homeless youth population and would help \nlawmakers make better policy decisions and allow communities to provide \nbetter outreach.\n  On April 29, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing to focus \nthe Senate's attention on these problems and to identify and develop \nsolutions to protect runaway and homeless youth. It was the first \nSenate hearing on these matters in more than a decade. We heard from a \ndistinguished panel of witnesses, some of whom spoke firsthand about \nthe significant challenges that young people face when they have \nnowhere to go.\n  Our witnesses demonstrated that young people can overcome harrowing \nobstacles and create new opportunities when given the chance. One \nwitness went from living as a homeless youth in his teens to earning \ntwo Oscar nominations as a distinguished actor. Another witness is \nworking with homeless youth at the same Vermont organization that \nenabled him to stop living on the streets and is on his way to great \nthings. Our witness panel gave useful and insightful suggestions on how \nto improve the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act to make it more \neffective. We have included many of these recommendations in our bill.\n  The prevalence of homelessness among young people in America is \nshockingly high. The problem is not limited to large cities. Its impact \nis felt strongly in smaller communities and rural areas as well. It \naffects our young people directly and reverberates throughout our \nfamilies and communities. That this problem continues in the richest \ncountry in the world means that we need to redouble our commitment and \nour efforts to safeguard our Nation's youth. We need to support the \ndedicated people in communities across the country who work to address \nthese problems every day.\n  In my home State of Vermont, the Vermont Coalition for Runaway and \nHomeless Youth, the New England Network for Child, Youth, and Family \nServices, and Spectrum Youth and Family Services in Burlington all \nreceive grants under these programs and have provided excellent \nservices that provide assistance to thousands of youth.\n  The overwhelming need for services is not limited to any one state or \ncommunity. Many transitional living programs are forced to turn away \nyoung people seeking shelter. We heard testimony of an exemplary \nprogram within blocks of our Nation's Capitol that has a waiting list \nas long as a year. This is unacceptable. The needs in our communities \nare real, and reauthorizing the law will allow these programs to expand \ntheir enormously important work.\n  These topics are difficult but deserve our attention. I am glad the \nSenate has taken an important step toward addressing these issues by \npassing the Runaway and Homeless Youth Protection Act today.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 6894, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6894) to extend and reauthorize the Defense \n     Production Act of 1950, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today we are acting on House-passed \nlegislation which contains a 1-year extension of the Defense Production \nAct, DPA, which I hope will be swiftly approved by the Senate. While I \nam delighted that this extension legislation was passed by the House \nTuesday night, it is crucial to remember that many of this law's \nauthorities, last renewed in 2003, expire on September 30. We have just \na few legislative days to get this done. As the United Sates continues \nto fight two wars and respond to various natural disasters, it is \nimportant that we not allow key provisions to expire--provisions \nallowing our Government\n\n[[Page S9552]]\n\nagencies to ensure that American industry meets varying demands of \nnational emergencies. Such measures involve mandates to keep industry \nproducing critical resources for our military and first responders in \ntimes of crisis, and initiatives for maintaining crucial investments in \nstrategic technologies.\n  During the Korean war, what was then the Senate Banking & Currency \nCommittee--the precursor to today's Committee on Banking, Housing and \nUrban Affairs--authored the Defense Production Act to ensure the \navailability of key industrial resources for the Department of Defense, \nDOD. Over time, the Defense Production Act has been amended to include \nenergy supply, emergency preparedness, and critical infrastructure \nprotections, thereby allowing civilian agencies to respond rapidly to \ncrises such as natural disasters and terrorist attacks.\n  In the last several months, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs received two reports mandated by law from the Government \nAccountability Office and Department of Homeland Security. These \nreports highlighted major shortfalls in the administration's \napplication of DPA authorities. Furthermore, I have been informed that \nin 2004, FEMA and other Federal agencies conducted their own internal \nreview of DPA authorities and made several recommendations to the White \nHouse's Homeland Security Council. The White House chose not to act on \nthose recommendations, and Congress has still not been fully briefed on \nthese findings.\n  In a perfect world, we would fully analyze and incorporate \nappropriate findings of pertinent reviews. Unfortunately, due to time \nconstraints of the current legislative session, including our work on \nmeasures to address the crisis in our financial system, it is clear \nthat a complete assessment now of their conclusions would be \nimpossible. But we should not simply reauthorize this act for another 5 \nyears. The recommendations gathered in these valuable reports should be \nreviewed, considered for legislation in a workable bill, and enacted \ninto law in the near future; not 5 years from now.\n  Simply put, granting a 1-year extension would provide our agencies \nwith the authorities they need in the short term, but will also \nmaintain the expectation that in 2009 the Banking Committee and the \nU.S. Senate will conduct a thoughtful review of these recommendations \nin hearings, mark-up, and floor consideration. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in the Senate, as well as in a new \nadministration, to see to it that the DPA is modernized to address the \nchallenges of the 21st century. In the meantime, I thank my colleagues \nfor working with me to approve this 2009 reauthorization.\n  Mr. DURBIN.
