Mr. President, this afternoon we will indulge in a \nlittle bit of nostalgia with another vote on the Feingold bill to cut \noff funds for our troops in Iraq. I don't know what our friends on the \nother side expect to accomplish, but if past experience is any guide, \nwe already know the outcome.\n  Last May, 67 of us voted against the proposal to cut off funds for \nour troops in the field. Mr. President, 4 months later, 70 Senators--3 \nmore--voted against it the second time. Two weeks after that, 68 \nSenators voted against it for a third time. And in December, 71 of us--\nmore than three-fourths of the Senate--voted no once again to cutting \noff funds for troops in the field.\n  So the outcome of the final vote on the Feingold bill is obvious: The \nSenate is on record not once but four times\n\n[[Page S1150]]\n\nthat it will not cut off funds while our troops are in the field.\n\n  All the more so will we oppose it when the fight in Iraq, by all \naccounts, is showing clear-cut tactical progress, and now, at last, \nsome important political progress is also apparent over in Iraq.\n  This bill does give us an opportunity--an opportunity to step back \nand highlight the remarkable progress that has been made in Iraq since \nthe first time our friends proposed cutting off funds last May. It \ngives us a chance to highlight why we were wise to reject it even when \nthe outcome in Iraq was unclear, much less now when progress is clearly \nbeing made.\n  Two months ahead of another visit by General Petraeus and Ambassador \nCrocker, we should acknowledge the heroic sacrifices of our men and \nwomen in uniform and the important turnaround they have achieved in \nIraq on behalf of the American people. The brave Iraqis who have stood \nwith them also deserve our praise. All of this is in our Nation's long-\nterm security interests.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will make a statement prior to the Iraq \nvotes, and I will be happy to lay out why we are doing this. We are \ndoing this because the majority of the American people recognize this \nwar in Iraq is costing huge amounts of money. Some are saying now as \nmuch as $15 billion a month.\n  But let's say it is not that much. Let's say it is only the lower \nfigure of $10 billion to $12 billion a month. I met yesterday with the \nSpeaker and all the 28 Democratic Governors, and they are desperate for \nmoney to do what their States need in dealing with health care, \ninfrastructure, and fighting crime. They are desperate. Where is the \nmoney they need? It is going to Iraq in the sum of about $400 million a \nday.\n  So we are going to continue to debate this because the American \npeople know what is taking place, and I will discuss this more fully \nright before the votes on the two cloture motions that have been filed \non the Iraq situation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/26/senate-section/article/S1150-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate resumes consideration of S. 1200, which the clerk will report by \ntitle.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1200) to amend the Indian Health Care \n     Improvement Act to review and extend that act.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Vitter amendment No. 3896 (to amendment No. 3899), to \n     modify a section relating to limitation on use of funds \n     appropriated to the Service.\n       Dorgan amendment No. 3899, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Smith amendment No. 3897 (to amendment No. 3899), to modify \n     a provision relating to development of innovative approaches.\n       Murkowski (for DeMint) amendment No. 4015 (to amendment No. \n     3899), to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services to establish an Indian health savings account \n     demonstration project.\n       Murkowski (for DeMint) amendment No. 4066 (to amendment No. \n     3899), of a perfecting nature.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3896\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I believe by previous unanimous consent \nthe Senate will now consider the Vitter amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct. There are 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I strongly urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport this mainstream amendment. The Vitter amendment codifies the \nHyde amendment and simply says in Indian health care no taxpayer funds \nwill be used to support abortions, with the normal exceptions of the \nHyde amendment.\n  Up to now, this has been the practice and the law, but only because \nthe Indian health care law points to whatever the current \nappropriations language is on the subject in Labor, Health, and \nEducation. And so it is a very tenuous policy that is subject to change \nand a vote and a change in policy every year.\n  This amendment will solidify that policy. It will put the Hyde \namendment in permanent Federal authorization law with regard to the \nIndian health care act, just as was done decades ago in the Defense \nauthorization bill. It is a solid mainstream amendment, and I urge \nsupport from both sides of the aisle.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is not a debate about whether Federal \ndollars should be used for abortion services. Current law already \nprohibits that. I oppose Federal funding for abortions, and I have \nsupported the Hyde provision. But the Vitter amendment is completely \nunnecessary.\n  First of all, we have a provision in the underlying bill that relates \nto the Hyde provision that applies to all other appropriations bills. \nBut I do want to say this: This is not a mainstream amendment that \neverybody is clear about. In fact, there is a provision in this \namendment on page 2, section B. I don't know what it means, and I don't \nthink Senator Vitter knows what it means. There have been no hearings, \nno discussion, yet onward through the fog on amendments like this.\n  The fact is, we ought to have a hearing, but there has been no \nhearing. I don't understand what section B means, nor does the author, \nI believe.\n  Having said all that, again, this is not a debate about whether \nFederal dollars should be used for abortion services. Current law \nalready prohibits the use of Federal funds for abortion services, and \nthe underlying bill contains a provision that relates to current law \nand continues the same policy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will agree, provided I am allowed 30 additional seconds \nfollowing Senator Vitter.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I do this to ask the distinguished Senator \nabout the provision he is talking about. Maybe we can have a discussion \nabout it rather than him vaguely alluding to it without pointing out \nthe language and claiming nobody knows what it means.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, Mr. President, the appropriate place for that kind \nof discussion would have been a congressional hearing. That is where \nyou discuss what provisions mean and how they are written.\n  The provision reads: As to provide or pay any administrative cost of \nany health benefits coverage that includes coverage of an abortion.\n  I don't understand what that means with respect to facilities or \nother issues. There are a series of issues that relate to that. And \nthat is not, incidentally, just codifying the Hyde amendment, as the \nSenator alleges. This provision doesn't exist with the Hyde amendment. \nThis is something the Senator conceived of and added.\n  My point is, it ought to be the subject of a hearing. We don't \ndisagree on the issue of Federal funding for abortion. We agree on \nthat. But the Senator has mischaracterized his amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. Reclaiming my remaining time, that was language I pointed \nout to the distinguished Senator 3 weeks ago when I introduced my \namendment and we discussed it. So I think it is a little disingenuous \nto bring it up at this point.\n  Mr. DORGAN. And, Mr. President, he indicated when he pointed it out \nto me that this is why it was different than the Hyde amendment, which \ndoesn't point to what he claims today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nappears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1151]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I move to reconsider the vote and to lay that motion on \nthe table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3897\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There will now be 2 minutes of \ndebate equally divided in relation to amendment No. 3897.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, 8 years ago, Congress asked the Indian \nHealth Service and the tribes to revise a failed system for allocating \nfacilities funding. The compromise they reached may amount to nothing \nwithout this amendment. That is why I feel so strongly about it. It is \nnot only about one region or group of regions; this amendment is about \nholding true the government-to-government relationship the United \nStates holds with all tribes. I ask my colleagues to support the \namendment to ensure that all Native Americans receive the health care \nthey need and deserve.\n  Members should know it is unlikely that Native Americans in their \nStates are receiving construction funding for Indian Health Service \nfacilities. All this does is say to the Indian Health Service: Come up \nwith a formula that is fair. Otherwise, your State, the tribes you \nrepresent, will receive nothing.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator Smith's \namendment, No. 3897, to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, S. \n1200, and urge my fellow Senators to vote against this amendment.\n  This amendment would expressly authorize the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, HHS, to utilize a new ``area distribution fund'' \nmethodology to allocate Indian Health Service, IHS, health care \nfacilities construction, HCFC, funding.\n  This approach could result in critical projects that are on the \ncurrent IHS HCFC priority list from receiving funding. These projects \nhave been waiting for many years, and in some cases decades, to receive \nfunding. Furthermore, section 301 of the underlying bill, which the \nSmith amendment would amend, represents the results of hours of \nbipartisan negotiations on this issue throughout the last 2 years. \nWhile I understand Senator Smith's desire to provide a possible avenue \nfor his tribes to receive funding, this amendment would undo the very \ndelicate compromise that was reached in the underlying bill.\n  According to the IHS staff briefings, the entire concept of an area \ndistribution fund does not guarantee that all IHS service areas receive \nHCFC funding; instead, it creates a new criterion that must be used to \ndetermine IHS HCFC funding priorities. The current criteria utilized by \nIHS are focused on directing funding to the IHS areas in most need, \nwhere IHS patients are most isolated and least likely to have access to \ncare. This geographic criterion does not represent good policy but \nsimply an attempt to spread the very paltry funding provided for IHS \nHCFC projects even more thinly based on location instead of need. \nInstead of playing games with the distribution formula, we in Congress \nshould be working to ensure that there is adequate funding for IHS HCFC \nprojects so that the current backlog is addressed and new projects from \nthroughout the country may be added.\n  I note that Navajo Nation also strongly opposes this amendment. The \nfollowing discussion provides a summary of their concerns.\n\n\n    I. CONGRESS SHOULD LEAVE THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF SECTION 301 AS \n            CONTAINED WITHIN H.R. 1328 AND S. 1200 UNCHANGED\n\n       The current language of section 301 ``grandfathers'' in \n     those health facility projects that have completed phase one \n     and two of the current health care facilities construction \n     priority system, and places them on the construction priority \n     list upon enactment of the Indian Health Care Improvement \n     Act.\n       The following projects have completed phase one and two of \n     the current health facilities construction funding process: \n     Winslow Dilkon, AZ, Pueblo Pintado, NM, Bodaway-Coppermine, \n     AZ, Gallup Indian Medical Center, NM, Alamo, NM, Albuquerque, \n     NM, Ft. Yuma, AZ, Rapid City, SD, Sells, AZ, Crown Point, NM, \n     and Shiprock, NM. These projects should not be penalized for \n     following the rules by eliminating the old process and \n     instituting a new ill-defined funding system.\n\n\n     II. A LACK OF CONGRESSIONAL FUNDING CREATED CONTROVERSY OVER \n         DISBURSEMENT OF HEALTH FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION DOLLARS\n\n       According to the Conference Report for H.R. 2466, the \n     fiscal year 2000 Interior appropriations bill, the managers \n     recognized the need for a ``base funding amount'' for \n     facilities: ``Given the extreme need for new and replacement \n     hospitals and clinics, there should be a base funding amount, \n     which serves as a minimum annual amount in the budget \n     request.'' Unfortunately, the managers' intent was never \n     fulfilled, and funding levels have dropped consistently for \n     several years. Congressional funding for health care \n     facilities construction has decreased from a high of \n     $134,300,000 in fiscal year 1993 to $13 million in fiscal \n     year 2007.\n       Given the limited amount of funding, tribes are now \n     competing over an ever-decreasing pool of money for tribal \n     health facilities.\n\n\nIII. THE CURRENT SYSTEM RIGHTLY HONORS FUNDING FACILITIES BASED UPON A \n                           VOLUME OF SERVICES\n\n       Most of the health facility projects on the current \n     priority list have been in the planning process for 20 to 30 \n     years. These projects have done all that is asked of them \n     including adapting to any new requirements imposed on them \n     midway through the planning process.\n       The current health facilities construction priority system \n     prioritizes projects based on several relevant factors such \n     as volume of services provided; square footage needs; size; \n     age; condition of existing facilities; demographics; \n     population density; isolation; and distance to inpatient, \n     outpatient, and alternative facilities.\n       The current priority system favors providing health \n     facility construction dollars to those facilities that will \n     provide a large volume of services over 10 years. For \n     example, if a facility will serve 90,000 patient visits a \n     year, calculated over 10 years, then this amount would total \n     900,000 patient visits in a 10 year period. The current \n     system favors providing a volume of services that provides \n     the most access to health care by the largest pool of people \n     and need.\n       On the other hand, any system that distributes funding \n     based upon equal distribution among the Indian health care \n     regions could not provide a sufficient volume of services \n     because some regions have larger native populations with less \n     access to health care than others. In other words, fewer \n     people would be provided health care by more facilities.\n       Keeping the current priority system would provide certainty \n     and reinforce the work put into developing existing health \n     facility projects.\n\n\n                  IV. DO NOT AUTHORIZE A VAGUE CONCEPT\n\n       There is currently no consensus as to the meaning or impact \n     of an area distribution fund. In fact, the Federal \n     Appropriation Advisory Board, the workgroup created by the \n     IHS to evaluate various facilities construction funding \n     schemes, did not define the area\n\n[[Page S1152]]\n\n     distribution fund. It is at best only a concept without a set \n     methodology, structure, or any idea of what effects such a \n     change may have on the current funding system. Randall \n     Gardner, Acting Director of the IHS Office of Environmental \n     Health and Engineering, OHE, has referred to the area \n     distribution fund as only a concept in need of further \n     evaluation. It would be the height of irresponsibility for \n     Congress to replace a known system with the uncertainty of a \n     concept without further investigation.\n\n\n V. THE ISSUE IS ABOUT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND NOT WHETHER TO BUILD \n                            ANOTHER HOSPITAL\n\n       Some groups have argued that their IHS service areas have \n     not received much needed health facility funding. However, \n     the statistics, when weighed against isolated areas like \n     Sells and the Navajo Nation, do not support the need for \n     another hospital in, for example, the Portland, California, \n     Bemidji, or Nashville service areas. According to the IHS, \n     the Portland area has 218 hospitals providing health services \n     to 157,000 tribal members.\n        The California, Bemidji, and Nashville areas are similarly \n     situated with respect to health care. In fiscal year 2001, \n     California tribal health programs had 119,362 registered \n     users with 69,238 active users served by 438 hospitals. The \n     Bemidji area comprising Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan, \n     is made up of 34 tribes with 90,000 individual patients \n     served by 494 hospitals. Finally, the Nashville area, which \n     is the largest service area, has a native population of \n     45,000 Indian people with access to over 1,000 hospitals.\n        However, the Navajo Nation area, which is as large as West \n     Virginia, has 238,515 users living on, or near, the \n     reservation with access to only 6 hospitals. That is 1 \n     hospital for every 39,753 users. The need for more health \n     care facilities within the Navajo Nation area is clear.\n        Further, IHS statistics show that while the Portland, \n     California, Bemidji, or Nashville service areas have not \n     received any health facility construction dollars, the native \n     people in these areas have always had access to superior \n     health care. All Native Americans living within IHS areas \n     also do not receive health facility dollars receive contract \n     health care dollars that cover expenses incurred at non-IHS \n     facilities.\n        The current priority system rewards basic health care \n     access over building redundant hospitals in areas with many \n     non-IHS facilities that can provide much needed health care \n     services. Building another hospital in the Portland, \n     California, Bemidji, or Nashville service areas when the \n     Navajo Nation and other IHS area have significant unmet needs \n     is redundant and inefficient use of federal funds.\n\n\n                             VI. CONCLUSION\n\n        The current HCFC system now provides funding to ensure \n     that large populations without access to nearby hospitals \n     receive health care facilities funding. The area distribution \n     fund concept has yet to be established with any certainty as \n     to its meaning or impact. A new ill-defined system should not \n     replace the existing priority system without some study. \n     Authorizing such a concept without investigating thoroughly \n     the overall effect of such a dramatic change to how IHS \n     health care facilities funded would be irresponsible.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I share the frustration of the Senator \nfrom Oregon, but I must oppose the amendment. We have a backlog of $3 \nbillion in facilities. If the Secretary chooses to establish what is an \narea distribution fund, moneys would be taken from the priority list. \nMany of the tribes on that list have waited a long time for funding for \nfacilities. If the Secretary begins to take money from that priority \nlist and does an area-wide distribution, it would be a serious problem. \nI want to work with the Senator from Oregon. We desperately need new \nand improved facilities. We need more money addressed to that. He is \nraising the right question. I happen to believe it is the wrong answer. \nI regretfully will vote against it.\n  Mr. SMITH. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

There will now be 2 minutes of \ndebate in regard to amendment No. 4015.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4066\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have also been in discussions with \nSenator DeMint, and we are prepared--and I believe it has been agreed \nto on both sides--to accept amendment No. 4066 without debate. I ask \nunanimous consent that the amendment be adopted.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4066) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in strong \nsupport of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Today has been a \nlong time in coming. I want to particularly recognize the work of my \nfriend Senator Dorgan, the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. We \nwould not be here today without his dedication and persistence.\n  In 2004, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issued a report on the \nNative American health care system. One item in the report struck a \nvery somber note with me. The report notes that as early as 1926 the \nadequacy of the delivery of health care to Native American was formally \nquestioned by the government. In response, a report was issued 2 years \nlater that sparked a host of statements by the Federal Government that \nthe health status of Native Americans was ``intolerable.''\n  Unfortunately, the Commission notes that much of the 1928 report \nremains true today. It is indeed sad that in the 21st century Native \nAmericans still do not have the access to and quality of health care to \nwhich they are entitled.\n  As my colleague from North Dakota has so poignantly illustrated time \nand time again, there is a health care crisis in Indian country. Native \nAmericans are 200 percent more likely to die from diabetes, 500 percent \nmore likely to die from tuberculosis, 550 percent more likely to die \nfrom alcoholism, and 150 percent more likely to die from accidents. \nSuicide is the second-leading cause of death for Native American \nadolescents, 2\\1/2\\ times the national average. Native Americans have a \nlife expectancy nearly 6 years less than the rest of the U.S. \npopulation.\n  That is unacceptable. And it is why it is so important that we pass \nthe reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.\n\n[[Page S1153]]\n\n  More than 1.8 million Native Americans and Alaska Natives rely on the \nIndian Health Service for health care. Since the act was first \nauthorized in 1976, the ways in which health care is delivered in this \ncountry have changed enormously. The bill before us helps meet the \ncontemporary needs of Indian country.\n  I believe that the inability of many Indian people to receive \npreventive and nonemergency care is one of the reasons why there are \nsuch significant health disparities that exist between Native Americans \nand the rest of the U.S. population. In North Dakota, when the IHS \nclinic closes at 5 p.m. on the weekdays and is closed on the weekends, \nmany go without care. I am pleased the bill before us addresses this \nchallenge by establishing grants for demonstration projects including a \nconvenient care services program to expand the availability of health \ncare. It also has a renewed emphasis on disease prevention and health \npromotion.\n  The bill also takes important steps to provide training and \nincentives to increase the number of health care professionals in \nIndian country, especially Native health care professionals who \nunderstand the unique conditions facing their own communities and can \nprovide care with greater cultural awareness. At the University of \nNorth Dakota, three programs authorized by the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act--the Quentin N. Burdick Indians Into Medicine, Indians \nInto Nursing, and Indians Into Psychology Programs--are recruiting \nincreasing numbers of Native Americans into medical professional \nprograms. Graduates of these programs are making a real difference \nthroughout Indian country, and I am pleased these successful programs \nare continued in the bill.\n  It also includes much needed provisions to address the youth suicide \ncrisis that exists throughout Indian country by authorizing grants to \ndeliver more counseling and suicide prevention services to tribal \ncommunities.\n  Finally, I am pleased my amendment to increase the use of video \nservice delivery to assist in the outreach and enrollment of individual \nIndians in Medicare and Medicaid was incorporated into the managers' \namendment. Remote video access to government services has all the \nbenefits of face-to-face communication, without the costs and \ndifficulties associated with traveling long distances from rural and \nremote reservations. To date, video service delivery has allowed for \nmore than 300 completed applications for benefits, more than double \nwhat would be expected through conventional delivery methods. My \namendment will allow for the expansion of this successful effort to \nother reservations across the country.\n  We have been working on reauthorization of the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act for a number of years. I think Native Americans have \nwaited long enough and it is time we deliver them this bill which \nbegins to reverse the disparate health disparities that exist.\n  I do not expect that we will be able to solve all of the health care \nchallenges that exist in Indian country with this one bill, but I \nexpect that we will be able to make substantial progress in addressing \nsome of the most pressing needs and creating a stronger system for the \nfuture.\n  Again, I want to recognize the extraordinary work of Senator Dorgan \nin delivering a truly bipartisan bill that meets the urgent health care \nneeds of Native Americans in North Dakota and across the country. I \nurge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today the Senate will pass the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act of 2008. This bill would reauthorize and \nmodernize the Indian Health Care Improvement Act which funds and \nauthorizes health care services and programs to Native American Indians \nand Alaska Natives and reaffirms our commitment to ensuring that we \nmeet our treaty and legal obligation to provide these communities with \naccess to quality health care.\n  Reauthorizing the Indian Health Care Improvement Act has been long \noverdue. The last time the Congress reauthorized the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act was in 1992, and this act has been up for \nreauthorization since 2001. The Indian Health Service has not been \nupdated for far too long. As health care evolves and improves programs \nmust be modernized to reflect new advances in the health care system. \nThe Indian Health Care Improvement Act has not been modernized since \n1992, 16 years ago, and is falling behind. We have a trust \nresponsibility to provide health care to Native American Indians and \nAlaska Natives. We have not met that responsibility.\n  The disparities that exist between Indian communities and other \nAmericans are overwhelming. The life expectancy for Indians is almost 6 \nyears less than the rest of this country's population and the suicide \nrate is 2.5 times higher than the national average. Death due to \nalcoholism or tuberculosis is more than 600 percent more likely; and, \nIndians are 318 percent more likely to die from diabetes. These \nstatistics are unacceptable and we need to continue to ensure that we \nclose the gap.\n  The passage of this bill brings us one step closer to ensuring that \nthe Indian Health Service is adequately funded and that programs to \naddress the health care needs of these communities are available.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to support final passage of \nthe Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2007. This bill is \nlong overdue, and I hope that House works expediently to move this bill \nforward so that we can get this bill to the President and signed into \nlaw.\n  Throughout the Senate's work on this bill, I have been impressed with \nthe bipartisan work that Senator Dorgan and the Senate Indian Affairs \nCommittee have put into moving this bill forward. It was not any easy \nprocess, but I commend the committee for its ongoing dedication to \nsignificant consultation with Indian Country in drafting this bill and \nseeing it through to completion.\n  There are significant unmet needs in Indian Country throughout this \nNation, and addressing the unmet health care needs ranks as one of the \nmost significant problems that we must address. The Federal Government \nhas a longstanding and well-established trust responsibility with \nregard to American Indian affairs, and this trust responsibility \nextends to providing good health care to communities throughout Indian \nCountry.\n  For too long, the Federal Government has not lived up to its Federal \ntrust responsibility commitments, but I hope that passage of this \nlegislation will set the Federal Government on a course toward better \nsupporting the needs of our American Indian communities, whether they \nbe health care, education, or housing needs. While this bill is a vital \nstep in the right direction, we need to follow through with fiscally \nresponsible increased funding for the important programs authorized in \nthis legislation.\n  This bill has the support of tribal governments throughout the United \nStates, including the 11 tribes in my State of Wisconsin. I have heard \nfrom a number of constituents in Wisconsin about the need to pass this \nbill this year. The improvements that the legislation will make to \nvarious Indian Health Service programs including clinical programs on \nthe various reservations throughout the State and urban Indian programs \nin Milwaukee and Green Bay are significant, and it is my hope that this \nbill will help improve the quality of health care provided to American \nIndians living throughout Wisconsin.\n  Health care is consistently the No. 1 issue that I hear about all \nover my home State of Wisconsin. When I hold my annual townhall \nmeetings across the State, many people come to tell me about problems \nwith our overall health care system, and data shows us that these \nproblems are often most acutely felt in Indian Country. Lack of access \nto good health care is a problem that disproportionately affects \nAmerican Indians throughout the United States. According to recent \nstudies, American Indians and Alaska Natives are 200 percent more \nlikely to die from diabetes, more than 500 percent more likely to die \nfrom alcoholism, and approximately 500 percent more likely to die from \ntuberculosis.\n  Some may doubt whether this legislation is needed or whether it will \nreally help improve the lives of Americans. The staggering statistics \nthat highlight the health care disparities faced by American Indians \nshow just how imperative it is that we pass this legislation, which is \nlong overdue. These statistics also help illustrate the vast\n\n[[Page S1154]]\n\namount of work that remains to be done to improve the quality of health \ncare in American Indian communities beyond passage of this legislation. \nNevertheless, this bill takes an important first step toward addressing \nthese health care disparities through the many reforms it makes to \nIndian health care programs. For example, modernizing Indian Health \nServices programs through this legislation will help to address the \ndiabetes and suicide crises that exist on reservations--just two \nexamples of the many health care issues that impact the daily lives of \nAmerican Indians across the country.\n  Reauthorization of this bill will help encourage health care \nproviders to practice at facilities in Indian Country and encourage \nAmerican Indians to enter the health care profession and serve their \ncommunities. Recruiting talented and dedicated professionals to serve \nin IHS facilities, whether urban or rural, is a key challenge facing \nmany tribal communities in Wisconsin and around the country. I hope \nthese provisions will help bring additional dedicated doctors, nurses, \nand other health care professionals to our tribal populations.\n  This bill also reauthorizes programs that assist urban Indian \norganizations with providing health care to American Indians living in \nurban centers around the country. The Urban Indian Health Program \nrepresents a tiny fraction of the Indian Health Services budget, but \nthe small amount of resources given to the urban programs provides \ncritical health services to those Indians living in urban areas. \nContrary to what some people may think, the majority of American \nIndians now live in urban areas around the country, including two urban \nareas in my State--Milwaukee and Green Bay. Throughout our Nation's \nhistory, some American Indians came to urban centers voluntarily, but \nmany were forcibly sent to urban areas as a result of wrongheaded \nFederal Indian policy in the 1950s and 1960s and have since stayed in \nurban areas and planted roots in these communities.\n  As a result of this movement to urban centers, Congress created the \nurban Indian program in the late 1970s to address the growing urban \nIndian population around the country. The Federal Government's \nresponsibility to American Indians does not end simply because some \nAmerican Indians left their ancestral lands and moved to urban \nlocations--particularly when some of them had little choice in the \nmatter.\n  While this legislation takes important steps toward improving urban \nIndian health care programs, we need to do much more to support these \nurban programs, including fighting for increased appropriations. I have \nbeen disappointed that the President has proposed zeroing out the urban \nIndian program in past budgets, and unfortunately, the President's \nbudget request for fiscal year 2009 is no different. As in years past, \nI have joined with my colleagues to urge the Senate to restore funding \nfor urban Indian programs to the Federal budget for fiscal year 2009, \nand I hope this year the Senate can also provide a much-needed boost in \nfunding for the urban Indian programs.\n  I voted for an amendment offered by Senators Smith and Cantwell that \nwould permit, but not require, the Secretary of HHS to create an area \ndistribution fund to allocate funding resources for IHS facilities \nconstruction to all 12 of the IHS service areas. I have heard a lot of \nconcern from tribes in my State of Wisconsin about the way that \nconstruction facility funds are allocated and the fact that certain IHS \nservice areas, including the Bemidji region covering Wisconsin, do not \nfare well under the current system. I recognize that there needs to be \nan overall boost in the appropriations for IHS facilities construction \nto help tribes currently on the construction priority list as well as \nthose tribes that cannot even get on the current list, and I look \nforward to supporting fiscally responsible efforts to boost funding for \nvarious IHS programs, including this one. But in the meantime, we \nshould explore opportunities to address innovative solutions to this \nproblem, and this amendment takes a reasonable approach to addressing \nthis problem. Any efforts to create an area distribution fund should \ninvolve significant consultation with tribes throughout Indian Country, \nand I am pleased this amendment makes clear that such consultation \nwould be required.\n  I also voted for amendment 4032, offered by the Senator from \nOklahoma, because it is critically important that sexual assault \nvictims be able to find out whether they have been exposed to HIV. \nHowever, I am concerned about the way that the amendment was drafted. \nIf there is a conference on this bill, I would urge conferees to \nconsider making this provision consistent with the existing provision \ngoverning the testing of defendants in Federal cases, 42 U.S.C. section \n14011, or at a minimum to clarify how it would relate to that law. I \nalso would urge them to ensure that the new provision complies fully \nwith the requirements of the fourth amendment.\n  Mr. President, Indian Country has made many compromises in order to \nmove this bill forward, and passage of this bill is long overdue. The \nSenate's actions today mark an enormous victory for Indian Country, and \nI hope that the House will quickly take this bill up so that we can get \nthis bill signed into law by the President this year.\n  This bill takes concrete and positive steps toward addressing some of \nthe health care needs facing American Indian communities around the \ncountry, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to build on \nthis legislation in the coming months and years. Challenges facing \nAmerican Indians throughout the United States extend beyond health care \nissues into issues of improving economic development, educational \nopportunities, and affordable and safe housing opportunities, and I \nhope we can continue to work together in a bipartisan way to pass other \nimportant measures this year. Together, tribal nations throughout all \nour States can work closely with the Federal Government to address the \nvast array of these unmet needs. Passage of the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act Amendments of 2007 today provides an important \nfoundation going forward, and it is up to all of us to see that this \nfoundation is strengthened in the coming months and years.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to talk about \nthe vote we had earlier today on an amendment offered by Senator Vitter \nto the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Senator Vitter described his \namendment, which was adopted by the Senate, as codifying a longstanding \npolicy that prohibits Federal funds from being used to pay for \nabortions.\n  I agree that Federal funding should not be used to pay for abortions. \nI have always supported the existing funding prohibition known as the \nHyde amendment that has been added in the appropriations process every \nyear since 1976.\n  That being said, I opposed Senator Vitter's amendment because the \namendment would only codify the Hyde amendment with respect to the \nIndian Health Service. I think we should apply the same standard to all \nFederal health programs and not set up a separate standard that only \napplies in Indian Country.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the next vote will be a vote on final \npassage. I will take just 30 seconds.\n  I do want to say that Senator Murkowski has helped get us to this \npoint in a very significant way. As to Senators Baucus, Grassley, \nKennedy, Enzi, Kyl--and especially Senator Reid, who allowed us to \nspend time on the floor on this bill--and the 31 cosponsors of the \nlegislation, I thank all of them.\n  I thank Allison Binney, the majority staff director, and David \nMullon, the minority staff director, and the really talented group of \nstaff members who worked very hard on this legislation. I say a hearty \nthank-you to them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of all their names \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n      Indian Affairs (Democratic staff)\n       Allison Binney (Staff Director), Ted Charlton, Cindy Darcy, \n     Heidi Frechette, John Harte, Tracy Hartzler-Toon, David \n     Holland, Jerci Powell (intern), Eamon Walsh, Rollie Wilson.\n      Indian Affairs (Republican staff)\n       David Mullon (Staff Director), Megan Alvanna-Stimpfle, Jim \n     Hall, Rhonda Harjo, Gerald Moses, Jonathan Murphy.\n      Finance Committee (Senator Baucus' staff)\n       Catherine Dratz, Michelle Easton, Deidre Henry-Spires, \n     Richard Litsey, David Schwartz, Russ Sullivan.\n\n[[Page S1155]]\n\n     Finance Committee (Senator Grassley's staff)\n       Becky Schipp, Rodney Whitlock.\n     Democratic Policy Committee (DPC)\n       Kory Caro, Liz Engel, Ryan Mulvenon.\n     HELP Committee (Senator Kennedy's staff)\n       David Bowen, Caya Lewis, Lauren McFarran, Peter Romer-\n     Friedman, Tanchia Terry, Portia Wu.\n     HELP Committee Staff (Senator Enzi's staff)\n        Greg Dean, Shana Christup, Katherine McGuire, Randy Reid \n     (Senator Enzi's Legislative Director), Amy Shank.\n     Senator Reid's Leadership staff\n       Carolyn Gluck, Kate Leone, Darrel Thompson, Marcela Zamora.\n     Senator Kyl's staff\n       Jennifer Romans.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. It has been 8 years now that we should have advanced this \nlegislation to improve Indian health care, and after 8 long years we \nfinally have it done--at least through the Senate after this final \npassage vote. I say thanks to all of my colleagues for their patience \nand also their help.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Murkowski.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I, too, want to thank so many who have \ndone so much to advance this legislation. Very rarely do we see an \nopportunity for Indian bills of any nature to receive floor time, so I \nwant to thank all our colleagues to be able to debate this very \nimportant issue with them.\n  I thank especially Chairman Dorgan for his leadership on this \nlegislation. He has mentioned so many who have participated throughout \nthe years, including the staffs, but we also need to recognize the \nleadership of the former chairman, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, \nand, of course, Senator McCain, Senator Dorgan, Senator Inouye--so many \nwho have done so much.\n  I also want to acknowledge the National Tribal Steering Committee for \ntheir efforts--great tribal leaders coming together to advance this \nvery important legislation.\n  I have a long list of thank-yous, but truly it has been a great \neffort, and we appreciate the leadership on both sides in advancing \nthis legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the one thing both of these Senators did not \nmention is the wonderful work they have done. The chairman and ranking \nmember of the Indian Affairs Committee were able to reach out to \nMembers on both sides of the aisle. This is truly a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation. Is it everything we wanted? Is it everything they wanted? \nNo. But it is a good piece of legislation. For the Indians around \nAmerica today, it is a really bright day. So I appreciate the good work \nof Senators Dorgan and Murkowski, who have done very good work.\n  Mr. President, I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me add my congratulations to \nSenator Dorgan and particularly Senator Murkowski for their excellent \nwork in putting together this very important piece of legislation. I \ncommend them both for outstanding work.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding \nthe previous order, the Senate recess from 12:30 to 2:25 p.m. for the \nweekly caucus lunches; that at 2:25 p.m. the Senate begin the 20 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on \nthe motion to proceed to S. 2633 as provided under the previous order, \nwith all other provisions of the previous order remaining in effect; \nfurther, that if cloture is not invoked, the next rollcall vote on the \nmotion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 2634 occur at 4 \np.m, with the Senate in a period of morning business until 4 p.m., with \nthe time equally divided and Senators permitted to speak up to 10 \nminutes each.\n  So, Mr. President, because of problems that sometimes come here with \nscheduling, we are going to bifurcate, but it will only be for about 50 \nminutes. We will have about 50 minutes of morning business until the \nvote at 4 o'clock. I appreciate everyone's cooperation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Dorgan substitute amendment, as \namended, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3899), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment \nand third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The bill having been read the third \ntime, the question is, Shall it pass?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Lieberman), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nConnecticut (Mr. Lieberman) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Texas (Mr. Cornyn), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), and the \nSenator from Virginia (Mr. Warner).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cornyn) \nwould have voted ``yea.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Are there any other Senators in the \nChamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 83, nays 10, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 32 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--83\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Voinovich\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--10\n\n     Allard\n     Coburn\n     Corker\n     DeMint\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Inhofe\n     Sessions\n     Sununu\n     Vitter\n\n                             NOT VOTING--7\n\n     Clinton\n     Cornyn\n     Dodd\n     Lieberman\n     McCain\n     Obama\n     Warner\n  The bill (S. 1200), as amended, was passed.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate has taken an important step today \nby passing S. 1200, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments \nof 2007.\n  I am now pleased to join the other 30 cosponsors of this legislation \nin sending it to the House for their consideration.\n  When signed into law, this legislation will:\n\n       increase and improve recruitment and retention programs for \n     Indian health professionals;\n       improve communicable and infectious disease monitoring and \n     provide for more research on issues unique to those living on \n     reservations;\n       improve and expand diabetes screening and treatment \n     programs;\n       expand programs to prevent domestic violence, sexual abuse, \n     and substance abuse, in Native American communities;\n       incorporate and encourage the use of technology in \n     delivering health care services and\n\n[[Page S1156]]\n\n     providing treatment, which is so important to our rural \n     Indian communities;\n       and encourage States to increase outreach to Indians to \n     help them to enroll in Medicaid and SCHIP programs.\n\n  This legislation is supported by a broad, bipartisan coalition, those \nin Indian Country, and many organizations that advocate for eliminating \ndisparities in health care.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the support and \nleadership of particular Senators and their staffs.\n  The bill managers have been strong and articulate advocates for the \nbill, and shown great flexibility.\n  I commend Senator Dorgan and his staff, particularly Allison Binney, \nCindy Darcy, Heidi Frechette and Ben Klein.\n  I commend Senator Murkowski and her staff, including David Mullon and \nNathan Bergerbest.\n  I commend Senator Baucus, and his staff, particularly David Schwartz \nand Richard Litsey; and Senator Grassley and his staff, including \nRodney Whitlock, who have insisted on improvements in the \nadministration of Indian health programs.\n  I commend Senator Kennedy and his staff, particularly Caya Lewis, and \nSenator Mike Enzi and his staff, including Randi Reid, Shana Christrup, \nGreg Dean and Amy Shank, who helped us negotiate many difficult issues.\n  On my staff and part of the Democratic leadership team, I commend \nKate Leone, Carolyn Gluck; Kory Vargas Caro, Elizabeth Engel, and Ryan \nMulvenon.\n  I want to say a special word of thanks to Tracy Hartzler-Toon, who \nhas worked tirelessly for over a year to help make today possible.\n  She has served me, the Indian Affairs Committee, and the Senate very \nwell. And most importantly, she has served the residents of Indian \nCountry exceedingly well.\n  I also thank my colleagues, the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, \nand his health policy advisor, Megan Hauck, and Senator Jon Kyl, and \nparticularly Jennifer Romans, for their agreement and commitment to see \nthat this bill finally received its due consideration.\n  Lastly, I want to acknowledge the support of the late Senator Craig \nThomas of Wyoming. Before he passed away last year, his leadership on \nthe Indian Affairs Committee was helpful in bringing the Senate to this \nmoment.\n  With the help of so many, both in the Capitol and around the country, \nwe have taken an important step toward providing Indian Country some of \nthe health care services that many in the rest of this Nation have \nenjoyed for years.\n  I urge the House to take quick action on H.R. 1328, the companion \nbill to what we passed today, so we can get this important legislation \nto the President's desk and make these services a reality.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about this vote, \nand then I am going to ask unanimous consent that Senator Murkowski be \nrecognized, then Senator Enzi, Senator Feingold, and Senator Boxer. I \nbelieve Senator Enzi is going to ask for 10 minutes, Senator Feingold \n20 minutes, and Senator Boxer 15 minutes. I ask by unanimous consent \nthat be the order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will take a couple of additional minutes \nto say how pleased and proud I am that we have passed by a very wide \nmargin the first improvement in Indian health care since 1992. These, \nafter all, are the first Americans. They were here first. We signed \ntreaties with them, we took their land, we put them on reservations, \nmade promises, and we have a trust responsibility. We said ``we \npromise.'' The fact is, we have not kept those promises for a long \ntime, especially with respect to Indian health care.\n  Finally, at long last, this Congress--and thanks to Senator Reid and \nall the folks who allowed this to be on the floor of the Senate for the \ntime that it was--we finally have made some progress, the first time \nsince 1992 that we have reauthorized the Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct. This is a big deal. This will save lives. We have more steps to \ntake. The House has a bill with which it has to deal. It will, and we \nwill be in conference, and finally we will be able to have a bill \nbefore the President of the United States for his signature in this \nyear.\n  I have spoken at length. I know people are tired of hearing me. The \nPresiding Officer is from Montana. He and I held a hearing on the Crow \nIndian Reservation in Montana. We heard an earful about Indian health. \nI have held listening sessions around the country in different States \nwith Indian tribes. I cannot tell you the number of stories I have \nheard that had me going away from these meetings shaking my head \nwondering: What on Earth can we do to fix this situation? How much will \nit take for us to fix this situation?\n  I recall a grandmother on the Crow Reservation, MT, standing up with \na beautiful picture of her 5-year-old granddaughter who had died. After \nessentially a rather lengthy story, she asked: How do you justify this, \na young girl spending the last 3 months of her life in unmedicated pain \nbecause the health care system does not work for that young girl? The \nstories go on and on.\n  I am convinced we must do better, and I am determined and it was my \npriority when I became chairman of this committee to finish this job. I \nknow Ben Nighthorse Campbell worked hard on it, and Senator McCain, \nwhen he was chairman of the committee, worked hard on it. Finally, \nSenator Murkowski and I made it a priority for this committee to say: \nWe have to fix this situation. This is not some option. The promise of \nhealth care means if we do not keep this promise, people will die. I \nhave named some of those people, some of them children.\n  We have to do better. And this vote today, a very significant vote in \nthe Senate, an overwhelming vote, 90 percent of the Senate saying we \nagree, let's fix it, that is something I think is going to be \nunbelievably welcome news to American Indians all across this country \ntoday. It has been a long time coming, 16 years, but finally--finally--\nwe made progress, and I believe this progress will save lives.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Murkowski who has been an enormous \npartner in trying to get this bill completed. As I close, I will \nmention our staff director, Allison Binney, also Ted Charlton, Cindy \nDarcy, Heidi Frechette, John Harte, Tracy Hartzler-Toon, David Holland, \nJerci Powell, Eamon Walsh, and Rollie Wilson on our side; and David \nMullon, staff director on the minority side, Megan Alvanna-Stimpfle, \nJim Hall, Rhonda Harjo, Gerald Moses, Jonathan Murphy, and so many \nothers.\n  Those people I have named have worked a lot. They worked behind the \nscenes, long hours, late at night, and on weekends to help make this \npossible. I say a heartfelt thanks to them for their wonderful work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the passage of the \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act. I again thank the majority leader \nand minority leader for committing floor time for this bill. Rarely \nhave Indian bills received time on the Senate floor, but this is one \nthat is very important to the well-being of our country's Native people \nthat the attention it has been given by the Senate is more than \njustified.\n  I thank my colleagues for their commitment in considering this \nlegislation, addressing the issues, and supporting our efforts to \nimprove health care services for American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n  As with many bills, the provisions fall under more than one \ncommittee's jurisdiction. The Committee on Indian Affairs, on which I \nserve as the vice chairman, has shared this bill with the Finance and \nHELP Committees, and both of these committees have worked in earnest to \nassist us in crafting a bill to carry the Indian health care system \ninto the 21st century.\n  I am fortunate to have a chairman on the Indian Affairs Committee--\nSenator Dorgan--with whom I share a close working relationship. We both \nhave significant populations of Native people in our States with \nsimilar issues and challenges in many areas such as health care, \neducation, housing, economic development and transportation.\n\n[[Page S1157]]\n\n  We have had numerous opportunities to work together in our committee, \nparticularly on youth suicide prevention and treatment and \ntelemedicine. I truly appreciate his persistence and dedication in \nadvancing this bill.\n  Senators Grassley and Baucus have also worked with us closely to \nadvance this measure through the Finance Committee last year which \nreported the bill out favorably in both the 109th and 110th Congresses. \nI also wish to recognize their staff Rodney Whitlock, Becky Shipp, and \nDavid Schwartz, who worked so closely with the Indian Affairs staff on \nthis bill.\n  Likewise, Senator Enzi, in his capacity as chairman and now as \nranking member of the HELP committee--worked very diligently on this \nlegislation to refine key pieces of the legislation during the 109th \nCongress and again this year. Greg Dean, Shana Christrup, Randi Reid \nand Amy Shank devoted countless hours of work with the Indian Affairs \nCommittee to work out issues, which I appreciate. I especially \nappreciate the leadership and commitment of Senator Kyl. He has one of \nthe largest Indian populations in his State. His commitment to Indian \nissues was reflected by his continued involvement and that of his \nstaff, Jennifer Romans, in working out issues to advance this bill.\n  We must not forget that this bill reflects the work of our dear \ncolleague and my predecessor, the late Senator Craig Thomas, who held \nthe reins as vice chairman last year. He eagerly pursued efforts to \nimprove health care services for all American Indian communities, \nincluding those in his home State of Wyoming on the Wind River Indian \nReservation, and it is most fitting that we will honor his work with \nthe passage of this bill. I pointed out on the floor yesterday, in the \n109th Congress, Senator McCain made a great effort to reauthorize the \nact in his role as chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. Before \nthat, Senator Campbell, who also served as chairman of the Indian \nAffairs Committee, carried this legislation since the 106th Congress as \nthe original sponsor, along with Senator Inouye, until Senator \nCampbell's retirement in 2004.\n  Between Chairmen Campbell and McCain in the 108th and 109th \nCongresses, there were 8 hearings on the reauthorization, including \njoint hearings with the HELP Committee and with the House Resources \nCommittee.\n  Our efforts had also great help from my good friends Senators \nStevens, Domenici, Smith, Cochran, Hatch, and Thune. These Senators \nhave been long-time friends of our country's Native people, and I want \nto acknowledge their dedication in promoting American Indian and Alaska \nNative health.\n  The Republican staff of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs has \nwaited a long time for this day to come. David Mullon, the Republican \nstaff director and chief counsel, and Rhonda Harjo, the deputy chief \ncounsel, came to the committee during Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell's \ntenure.\n  Rhonda Harjo has been the lead Republican staff member of the \ncommittee for Indian Health Care Improvement Act reauthorization since \n2003. Indian country takes pride in her devotion to the betterment of \nher Native people and I share that pride today.\n  I also wish to acknowledge the efforts of Jim Hall and Jon Murphy and \ntwo Alaskans who recently joined the committee--Gerald Moses and Megan \nAlvanna-Stimpfle--in preparing this bill for floor consideration.\n  I also acknowledge the tireless efforts over the past 8 years of the \nIndian tribal and health care leaders and advocates across the U.S. in \nhelping develop the legislative proposal which served as the basis for \nthis bill. In particular, the National Tribal Steering Committee, \nconsisting of tribal leaders and Indian health representatives, brought \ntogether the diverse interests of over 560 tribes across the country to \na consensus on this very important measure.\n  That is no small task and it was handled dutifully by the cochairs of \nthe National Tribal Steering Committee, Chairman Buford Rolin of the \nPoarch Band of Creek Indians in Atmore, Alabama, Rachel Joseph, former \nChairwoman of the Lone Pine Paiute-Shoshone Tribe, in Lone Pine, \nCalifornia, and staff, Kitty Marx from the National Indian Health \nBoard.\n  Three key Alaska Native leaders played significant roles on the \nNational Tribal Steering Committee: Sally Smith, the chairman of the \nNational Indian Health Board and the Bristol Bay Area Health \nCorporation; Don Kashevaroff, the president of the Seldovia Village \nTribe and chair of the Tribal Self-Governance Advisory Committee; and \nValerie Davidson from the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. I \nappreciate their leadership and thoughtful consideration in the \ndevelopment of this legislation.\n  A lot of good work went into this bill and our efforts should not go \nin vain. I look forward to working with my House colleagues and getting \nthis bill on to the President's desk for signature.\n  Mr. President, we had a brief opportunity to express our thanks to \nthose who have worked so hard on the reauthorization of the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act. Again, my sincere thanks and gratitude to \nChairman Dorgan for all that he has done.\n  This is a good day for Indian country, for Alaska Natives who are \njust waking up back home right now. They are going to wake up to news \nthat they have been waiting to hear for a good decade: that finally we \nhave advanced the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. We have taken \nthat step. We recognize this is not the end-all and be-all in terms of \nproviding for the health care needs of American Indians and Alaska \nNatives. We know we need to do more, and we are challenged to do that.\n  We talked about the funding issue and how we must make that next step \nto make sure it is not just what we put in the authorization, but we \nback that up with the dollars for the programs.\n  We have a long way to go, but I think we have made a very significant \nstep today. I am proud of the work of my colleagues today and those who \ncame before us on this very important issue.\n\n\n                       ``Exxon Valdez'' Oilspill\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes this morning to talk \nabout tomorrow because tomorrow the United States Supreme Court will \nhear the appeal of the ongoing litigation between ExxonMobil and \ncommercial fishermen and other plaintiffs whose livelihoods were \nnegatively impacted, devastated, in fact, by the 1989 Exxon Valdez \noilspill. The Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef at 12:04 a.m. on \nMarch 24, 1989. It spilled 11 million gallons of oil--this is about the \nsame size as 125 Olympic-sized swimming pools--directly into Prince \nWilliam Sound in Alaska. The oil from the spill migrated several \nhundred miles from Bligh Reef and polluted roughly 1,300 miles of \nAlaskan shoreline. There were 11,000 square miles of ocean that were \nultimately affected by this spill, which is believed to be the worst \noilspill worldwide with respect to environmental damage.\n  Regrettably, the spill area is still affected some 19 years later. In \n2001, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration studied the \nshoreline of Prince William Sound for any remaining effects of the \nspill. Scientists reviewed 91 sites within Prince William Sound and \nfound that 58 percent of these locations were still polluted by oil. \nAgain, this is 19 years after the fact. Some estimates note that \nbeaches and streams in this area are still polluted with over 25,000 \ngallons of oil.\n  Of course, the fisheries in Prince William Sound were affected. The \nherring fishery in this area experienced a dramatic decrease in the \nyears immediately after the 1989 spill. As of 2007, the herring fishery \nhad not improved to the pre-1989 levels. Another example is what has \nhappened with the value of the fisheries permits in this part of the \nState. In 1988, a fishing permit in Prince William Sound was worth \n$400,000. As of 2004, the value of each such permit was less than \n$70,000, a drop of more than 82 percent.\n  There was a class action jury trial held in Federal court in \nAnchorage, AK, in 1994. The plaintiffs at that time included over \n30,000 commercial fishermen, among those whose livelihoods were gravely \naffected by the disaster. The jury awarded $5 billion in punitive \ndamages to the plaintiffs. This punitive damage award has been on \nrepeated appeal by ExxonMobil since that time. On December 22, 2006, \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reduced the punitive damage award to \n$2.5 billion. In early 2007, ExxonMobil petitioned the Ninth Circuit \nfor a rehearing en banc. Within a few months, the Ninth Circuit denied\n\n[[Page S1158]]\n\nthis petition and ExxonMobil appealed to the Supreme Court. \nUnfortunately, in this intervening time period, with years and years of \nlitigation bringing delay in resolution, we have had several thousand \nplaintiffs pass away since this litigation began.\n\n  Due to the limitations in admiralty law with respect to the recovery \nof compensatory damages, many Exxon Valdez plaintiffs were not able to \nrecover the financial losses they sustained in the aftermath of this \nspill. So the punitive damages that are under consideration by the \nSupreme Court will provide them that level of compensation.\n  Once the Supreme Court decided to hear this case, I joined with \nSenator Stevens and Representative Young in submitting an Alaska \ncongressional delegation amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court. In \nthat brief, we argue that the award of punitive damages in this case of \nreckless and wanton conduct by Exxon not only is permissible under the \nClean Water Act, but it is supported by Federal maritime law. Only \npunitive damages will provide those who were harmed--and who continue \nto be harmed--with the justice and the fair compensation they deserve.\n  This litigation needs to end. Nineteen years is far too long for \nthese plaintiffs to wait to be compensated for their loss of income.

Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, and the Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski, \non the piece of legislation we just passed. It is extremely critical to \na number of people in the United States, the Native Americans.\n  It was an extremely difficult piece of legislation to do because it \nis such a diverse group of people. There are Native Americans who are \nliving in cities, there are Native Americans living on reservations, \nand there is even a difference in reservations because there are some \nthat have a lot of land and a few people, and some have a lot of people \nand very little land. To come up with a one-size-fits-all is not \npossible. This bill takes care of all of those people wherever they are \nand under the circumstances they are under, and it does meet the \npromise that was given. It culminates 15 years of work that should have \nbeen done 15 years ago, but because of the diversity, it was extremely \ndifficult to do. And the chairman and the ranking member, working \ntogether, were able to pull that together. So I congratulate both of \nthem for their efforts and their capability of working with everybody \nin this body, with probably about 100 amendments that were thought \nabout, though not all were offered. The solutions, the ways to solve a \nlot of those problems are included in the bill. I think it is a very \ngood bill, and they deserve a lot of credit for the way they worked on \nit and the effort they put into it and the result they got. I am \nlooking forward to getting it resolved on both ends of the building and \nthe President signing it, and I congratulate both of them.\n  I do rise today, however, to talk about finding other solutions to \nour health care crisis. That is a part of it. We have extended the \nchildren's health insurance plan until March of 2009, so that part has \nbeen partly solved, but my wife Diana and I travel to different parts \nof Wyoming most weekends, and the No. 1 issue on people's minds is \ntheir health care. They all ask me what I am going to do to make sure \nthey have the health care they need. I am able to tell them a lot of \nthings I am working on, but I am not able to tell them very much about \nthings actually getting accomplished. This troubles me because our \nconstituents deserve our help. It is time for real action, and I hope \nwe are able to do something on health care this year.\n  As the senior Republican on the Committee on Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions, I spend a lot of time working on health care issues. I \nhave spoken to this body many times about a bill that I am working on, \nthat I have been working in conjunction with anybody in this Chamber \nwho is interested in health care, and trying to pull together the idea \nso that we can do some things in health care, any one of which would \nhelp us to get closer to a solution for all Americans.\n  The bill I have put together is one called Ten Steps to Transform \nHealth Care in America. That will fix many of the common complaints I \nhear from my constituents. Why ten steps? Well, I have discovered over \nthe course of the years I have been in this Chamber that if you try to \nput together one massive comprehensive bill that solves everything, you \nwill have one piece that 5 people don't like, another piece 8 people \ndon't like, another 11 people don't like, and another 3 people don't \nlike, until pretty quickly you are at 51 votes and you can't get the \nbill done. When you try to do something comprehensively, it often looks \nrevolutionary. And we don't do things revolutionarily; we do them \nevolutionarily. So I put together 10 pieces, any one of which gets us \ncloser to having every American insured. All 10 would get every \nAmerican insured. So I hope people will take a look at it.\n  Today, I am just going to focus on one step; that is, the first, and \nthat is equalizing the tax insurance treatment for all Americans, not \njust the ones who get health insurance at work. I encourage everyone \nwatching to look at my Web site, enzi.senate.gov, to learn more about \nall the steps of the bill. Again, I emphasize that these are bipartisan \nideas people have given me.\n  Because the chairman of the committee has been so involved in the \neducation portion--and we are making progress on the education portion, \nhaving sent several pieces to the President already, and we are going \nto finish the higher education bill, and we are going to finish No \nChild Left Behind--I have been given the flexibility to look into this \nhealth care area. The chairman and I sat down and worked on principles \nof health care, and then I have sought to get ideas from both sides of \nthe aisle and incorporated them as much as I can into 10 steps.\n  Before I go into the details of step 1, I wish to say a few things \nabout the entire proposal.\n  If the Ten Steps bill were to become law, the end result would be an \ninsurance card for everyone. Now, lots of people have insurance cards--\nMembers of Congress have them, people who work for big companies have \nthem, the kids in Wyoming who participate in the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program have them. Lots of people have them, and most \nof those people who have insurance cards are happy with the care they \nare getting. They do not want change. And the bill doesn't change that. \nIf you have an insurance card now, you can keep that card and keep \ngetting the exact same care you are getting. The problem is the 47 \nmillion or so Americans who don't have an insurance card. My bill gives \nall those people cards. If they can't afford the cards because they are \nlow income, this bill helps them by giving them the money they need to \npurchase the insurance card. The bottom line is that everyone has a \ncard and everyone will be able to get the care they need.\n\n  So how does the bill get everyone an insurance card, and will we bust \nthe budget in the process of getting everyone an insurance card? The \nbill won't bust the budget. It won't be free, but it won't bust the \nbudget. So how is this possible? Well, in order to understand how the \nbill works, it is important to review a few facts about the history of \nhealth insurance in this country.\n  Right now, about 60 percent of the folks under age 65 are getting \ntheir health insurance through their job. The question is why. Why are \n60 percent of Americans getting their health insurance through their \njob? Well, the short answer to that question is, because of the way \nemployer-sponsored\n\n[[Page S1159]]\n\nhealth insurance is treated for tax purposes.\n  Our current health insurance system is biased toward employer-based \ncoverage due to a historical accident.\n  During World War II, we had wage controls. Wage controls increased \ncompetition among employers for recruiting the best employees, and \nhealth care incentivized employers by allowing them to offer health \nbenefits instead of prohibited wage increases.\n  In 1954, Congress codified a provision declaring that such a \ncontribution would not count as taxable income--an added incentive. \nThis tax policy made it very favorable for individuals to get their \nhealth benefits through their employers and consequently has penalized \nindividuals who get their coverage through the individual market.\n  We must eliminate the unfair tax treatment of health insurance, which \nwill expand choices in coverage and give all Americans more control \nover their own health care.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that removing this tax \nbias--and a few related health care tax policies--would save the \nFederal Government $3.6 trillion over the next 10 years. That is a lot \nof money--even around here, that is a lot of money--that can and should \nbe used to expand choices and access and give individuals more control \nover their health care.\n  Ten Steps ensures that every American can benefit from this savings \nwhether they get their health care from their employer, from the \nindividual insurance market, or they decide they want to get off of \nMedicaid and switch to private insurance. So how does the bill do this? \nThe plan gives all Americans who have at least a certain amount of \nhealth insurance a standard deduction. The national above-the-line \nstandard deduction for health insurance would equal $15,000 for a \nfamily and $7,500 for an individual. The bill also gives low-income \nfolks a tax credit equal to $5,000 for a family or $2,500 for an \nindividual. The subsidy amount phases out as income gets higher, so \nfolks won't be eligible for the subsidy at all, but everyone is \neligible for the standard deduction. Because the bill takes this hybrid \napproach to coupling the standard deduction proposal with the tax \ncredit proposal, no particular population is adversely affected. The \nTax Code would no longer penalize folks who don't get their insurance \nthrough their job.\n  Let me be clear. My goal is not to erode employer-based health \ninsurance, given that Ten Steps does not alter the way employers treat \nhealth insurance. Rather, I wanted to provide more options for \nindividuals who don't currently have insurance through their employer. \nCorrecting a flawed tax code would make it easier for working Americans \nto buy health insurance. Jobs don't need health insurance, people need \nhealth insurance. American families who aren't insured through their \nemployers should have the same accesses to care. Everyone should be \ntreated equally.\n  I hope we can move forward quickly on making these changes so that \nevery American can get health insurance. It is time for real action. We \nneed to do something. It isn't necessary to wait for the end of a \nPresidential election to solve basic problems for the American people. \nThese 10 steps will take care of a lot of things. We can do any one of \nthem and make a difference now and show that Congress can get things \ndone.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/26/senate-section/article/S1159-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1159-S1162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMPREHENSIVE REPORT ON AL-QAIDA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Senate will vote later today in \nrelation to two bills I recently introduced with Majority Leader Reid \naddressing the war in Iraq and the disastrous toll it continues to take \non our top national security priority, the global fight against al-\nQaida.\n  Many of my colleagues have expressed concern that the exhausting rate \nof deployments in Iraq and the resources we are committing to that \ncountry are undermining our ability to protect ourselves at home and \nrespond to dangers abroad, including the deteriorating situation in \nAfghanistan and the global threat posed by al-Qaida. While we all hope \nthat the recent decline in violence in Iraq will hold, lasting \nstability remains elusive and there is a serious danger that our troops \nwill remain mired in Iraq while our ability to combat al-Qaida \nelsewhere and protect ourselves at home continues to deteriorate.\n  Senator Reid and I have introduced two bills to address these \nproblems head-on. One of these bills, S. 2633, is similar to \nlegislation we have offered before. I am pleased that this bill is also \ncosponsored by Senators Boxer, Brown, Byrd, Cardin, Clinton, Dodd, \nDurbin, Harkin, Leahy, Menendez, Obama, Sanders, Schumer, Whitehouse, \nand Wyden. It requires the President to safely redeploy U.S. combat \ntroops from Iraq with very narrow exceptions. Effective 120 days from \nenactment of this bill, U.S. troops could only remain in Iraq for the \nfollowing purposes: conducting targeted military operations against al-\nQaida and its affiliates, providing security for U.S. personnel and \ninfrastructure, providing limited training of Iraqi Security Forces, \nproviding equipment and training to our own troops, and continuing to \nredeploy from Iraq.\n  Unlike previous legislation I have offered, this bill does not have \nan end date for redeployment. Some of my colleagues who oppose the war \nhave expressed concern about Congress setting such a date, and in \ndrafting this legislation we have tried to address their concerns. By \nnot including an end date, we are trying to provide additional \nflexibility in how the troops are redeployed. And we are also making \ndoubly clear that at no point will funding be denied to the troops--\nthey will continue to be fully funded throughout their redeployment.\n  If there is no end date for redeployment, then (what is to stop the \nadministration keeping troops there indefinitely? The answer is that, \nafter 120 days, troops can only remain in Iraq for the narrowly defined \npurposes in the bill. Because these exceptions are so narrow, the bill \nremoves any incentive for the President to delay or ``slow walk'' \nredeployment.\n  Now, some on the other side are arguing that this new bill is tougher \nthan previous versions, because the funding restriction kicks in \nsooner, in 120 days. Of course, these are the same people who oppose \nany limitations on the war, so I don't take their arguments too \nseriously. I suspect they haven't actually read the new bill, or they \nwould realize that the bill is quite a bit more flexible, for the \nreasons I just mentioned.\n  Right now, the administration is considering various ``drawdown'' \nplans, all of which would leave well over 100,000 troops in Iraq \nthrough the end of the year. That would continue to require an \nexhausting rate of deployments that we simply cannot afford--for our \nmilitary readiness, our fiscal bottom line, and our national security.\n  This administration has put Iraq first for too long. In an effort to \nrefocus our national priorities, the second bill Senator Reid and I \nhave introduced with Senators Boxer, Brown, Byrd, Cardin, Casey, \nClinton, Dodd, Harkin, Lautenberg, Leahy, Menendez, Obama, Schumer, and \nWhite-house, would require the administration to come up with a \nstrategy to wage a comprehensive, global campaign against al-Qaida, \nwithout undermining our military readiness. The legislation, S. 2634, \ndoes this by requiring a comprehensive report from the Secretaries of \nDefense, State and Homeland Security, working in coordination with the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National \nIntelligence. The report will examine the threat posed by al-Qaida and \naffiliates around the world and recommend ways to ensure that our \nnational security assets are properly deployed to address this threat. \nTo be clear, I am not just talking about military assets, we also have \nintelligence, diplomatic and other assets that we need to use to defeat \nal-Qaida. We can't just rely on boots on the ground--we need to use all \nof the other facets of U.S. power, including aggressive public and \nprivate diplomacy, to counter al-Qaida.\n  Some of the information called for in this bill will probably need to \nbe contained in a classified annex. But there is no reason the \nadministration cannot also provide a public report identifying in broad \nterms the threat we face and how to respond to it. The American public \nshould be kept as informed as\n\n[[Page S1160]]\n\npossible about how we are protecting them from the number one threat we \nface.\n  I know some of my colleagues do not want to be talking about Iraq \nagain. I know some of them complain that we spent too much time \ndebating Iraq last year and I know some of them have concerns about \nwhether now is the right time to bring these bills up for a vote. But \nwe cannot allow the focus on Iraq to fade because violence has declined \nin parts of Iraq. It is true violence levels are down to where they \nwere in 2005, but Iraq is still extremely and unacceptably violent, as \nit was in 2005. Violence has risen in Mosul and in the south, and U.S. \ncasualty rates in January were higher than in December. All is not calm \nin Iraq, as the administration would have you believe.\n  Moreover, the surge has not brought Iraq any closer to legitimate \npolitical reconciliation at the national level--and it may, in fact, \nhave undermined the prospects for such reconciliation in the long term. \nThe President's policies have empowered former insurgents and militia-\ninfiltrated security forces with questionable loyalties. By supporting \nsheiks in al Anbar--and elsewhere--we may have reduced violence in the \nnear term, but only by making it more difficult to achieve national \nreconciliation in the long run. The Director of National Intelligence, \nor DNI, testified this month that many Sunnis who participate in local \nsecurity initiatives remain hostile to the Shi'ite leaders in Baghdad, \nand that some of those leaders see the Sunnis we are supporting as \n``thinly disguised insurgents'' who are plotting against them. Mr. \nPresident, we cannot, and should not, ask our brave men and women in \nuniform to resolve these sectarian disputes. Military operations are \nnot a substitute for a viable political settlement, and the American \npeople are simply not willing to leave our troops on the front lines \nindefinitely in hopes that some day such a settlement will arrive.\n\n  Recent gains in Iraq are tactical successes at best, devoid of an \noverarching strategy to integrate local powerbrokers into a broader \nnational framework. Our presence has only added to the complexities in \nIraq as we meddle in local dynamics and contribute to internal \ndivisions and sectarian tensions. Keeping a significant military \npresence in Iraq will not bring lasting stability to that country. \nIndeed, the Iraqi people and the Iraqi parliament continue to oppose an \nopen-ended U.S. military presence in their country, which is something \nthey have in common with the American people.\n  Keeping our troops in Iraq will not solve Iraq's problems, and it \nwon't help us address the growing threat posed by al-Qaida around the \nworld. It makes no sense to devote so many of our critical resources \nand so much of our attention to one country, rather than to the global \nfight against al-Qaida.\n  Every year, I hold town hall meetings in each of the 72 counties of \nWisconsin, and over the January and February recess I held some 30 \nmeetings in some of the most conservative parts of the state. I didn't \nbring up Iraq at those January meetings because I wanted to see whether \nit was still a major concern, particularly with these audiences. And \nguess what, in every single meeting, they brought it up with me. And \nthey didn't just bring it up, they asked what we are doing to bring \nhome the troops. But I had to tell them that, instead of getting out of \nIraq, we will likely be sending one-third of the members of the \nWisconsin National Guard back to Iraq next year, many of whom have \nserved within the last 2 or 3 years.\n  They will be torn from their family, their jobs, their communities, \nto be put in harm's way, all in order to create space for a political \nreconciliation in Iraq that is always just over the horizon. They will \nnot be there to protect the people of Wisconsin in the event of an \nemergency, nor will they be reinforcing our troops in Afghanistan, who \nface what one recent report described as a ``stalemate'' in fighting \nal-Qaida's ally, the Taliban. Like Americans all across the country, \nthe people of Wisconsin don't think this makes sense. They want an end \nto our involvement in this war in Iraq, and they want to know what's \nstopping us from making it happen.\n  This administration has been so distracted by Iraq that it has \nneglected to address the top threats to our national security. It has \nallowed security conditions in Afghanistan to deteriorate tremendously, \nto the point where former NATO Commander General Jones recently \nconcluded that we are in a ``strategic stalemate.'' I need hardly \nremind my colleagues that this is the country from which al-Qaida \nlaunched the 9/11 attacks, and where it continues to operate.\n  While agreeing to provide 3,200 U.S. troops to Afghanistan, Secretary \nGates has also requested additional ground troops from our allies. If \nour allies are unwilling to provide those troops or worsening \nconditions require additional troops, it is far from clear that we will \nhave the forces we need in Afghanistan without further undermining \nmilitary readiness and homeland security.\n  Across the Afghan border, in Pakistan, things are also looking bad. \nThe Director of National Intelligence testified recently that ``al-\nQaida's central leadership based in the border area of Pakistan is al-\nQaida's most dangerous component.'' The DNI also said that since the \nmiddle of 2006, there has been an influx of ``new Western recruits'' \ninto this part of the world, an indication that al-Qaida is ``improving \nthe last key aspect of its ability to attack the United States: the \nidentification, training, and positioning of operatives for an attack \nin the homeland.'' His testimony closely echoed his warnings from \nalmost a year ago when he noted that future attacks against our nation \nwere likely to come from that part of the world. It is worth mentioning \nthat this is the same exact warning we received from the July 2007 NIE, \nwhich assessed that al-Qaida has regenerated and reconstituted itself \nin the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region.\n  The administration has made matters worse by associating itself with \nan undemocratic, authoritarian regime in Pakistan, one that the \nPakistani people, finally given the chance to make their voices heard, \nroundly rejected. In return for questionable anti-terrorism assistance, \nwe have given the Musharraf regime billions of dollars, not to mention \nthe cost to our credibility, and to our ability to build strong, \nsustainable partnerships in Pakistan.\n  Our endless presence in Iraq is distracting us from these core \nthreats to our national security. Instead of dancing around these vital \nconcerns, we need to address them head on and that is why we need a \nstrategy for defeating al-Qaida and its affiliates around the globe. We \nneed a strategy which identifies the gravest threats to our national \nsecurity and makes recommendations for addressing them with both \nmilitary and nonmilitary initiatives.\n  I know there is no silver bullet to defeat al-Qaida. But it has been \nmade very clear to Congress, and to the American public that if we are \nto protect ourselves at home, there must be a dramatic shift in how we \norder our national priorities. We cannot continue with the current \nagenda. We must refocus not just so we have the capacity to respond to \nother contingencies abroad but also because our heavy footprint in Iraq \nmakes us more vulnerable at home.\n  We need to rebuild our domestic response capability, which has been \nseverely compromised by repeated deployments of our National Guard. As \nlong as we keep over 100,000 troops in Iraq we will have to continue to \ndeploy Guard units in a manner that compromises their ability to \nprepare for domestic incidents. Deployments to Iraq have left those \nresponsible for protecting us at home with, on average, only 56 percent \nof the essential ``dual-use'' equipment needed to respond to a domestic \nincident.\n  Indeed, the National Guard Bureau estimates that it is facing a $47 \nbillion equipment shortfall, including a $20 million shortfall in \nequipment needed to respond to a chemical, biological, or radiological \nincident at home, notwithstanding the fact that it is the stated \nintention of al-Qaida to pursue such weapons. The Commission on the \nNational Guard and Reserves concluded that ``[b]ecause our nation has \nnot adequately resourced its forces designated for response to weapons \nof mass destruction, it does not have sufficient trained, ready forces \navailable.''\n  (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries).\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Sergeant at Arms will restore \norder in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S1161]]\n\n  The Senator may continue.\n  The Commission characterized this as an ``appalling gap.'' I \nwholeheartedly agree. This is unacceptable more than 6 years after 9/\n11, and is clear evidence that our national security priorities need to \nbe reexamined and realigned.\n  Rather than giving the National Guard the $47 billion it needs, the \nPresident has asked for another $100 billion for operations in Iraq in \n2008 alone, in addition to the $86 billion we have already \nappropriated. If we don't significantly draw down our troops in Iraq \nthis year, we will end up spending another $170 billion in Iraq next \nyear.\n  The Army Chief of Staff has stated that our current rate of \ndeployment is unsustainable, and a recent survey of military officers \nfound that 88 percent believe the demands of the Iraq war have \n``stretched the U.S. military dangerously thin.''\n  There are other costs to the war in Iraq, Mr. President, and they are \nconsiderable. The war is simultaneously deepening instability \nthroughout the Middle East, undermining the international support and \ncooperation we need to defeat al-Qaida, and providing al-Qaida and its \nallies with a rallying cry and recruiting tool.\n  That is why I am offering, with Majority Leader Reid, legislation to \nredeploy our troops and refocus our national priorities. It is our job \nto listen to the American people, to save American lives, and to \nprotect our Nation's security by redeploying our troops from Iraq \nbecause the President will not.\n  This war is exhausting our country, straining our military, and \ndistracting us from our top national security priorities. Even with the \nrecent decline in violence in Iraq, the American people know the war is \nmisguided and they continue to call for its end. They know we need to \ndo a better job of protecting ourselves at home and fighting al-Qaida \nabroad. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on both of these Feingold-Reid \nbills so we can finally heed their call to action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am proud to rise in support of Senator \nFeingold's two bills. The first bill requires that the President begin \nthe safe redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq within 120 days. There \nis no end date for redeployment. It only starts the redeployment. It \nincludes exceptions for missions against al-Qaida, force protection, \nand training. The second bill requires that the administration provide \nto Congress a full report outlining a comprehensive global strategy to \ndefeat al-Qaida and its affiliates.\n  As someone who voted to go get bin Laden after 9/11, I am dismayed \nthat this President has turned away from that mission and put so much \ninto an ill-fated war in Iraq. Senator Feingold is proposing a policy \nfor us that is consistent with common sense and our national security \nbecause the war in Iraq has not made us safer. It has made us \nvulnerable. The war in Iraq has not reduced the influence of al-Qaida. \nActually, it has made al-Qaida a hero, unfortunately. It has been seen \nas one of the best recruiting tools of al-Qaida. I want to get al-\nQaida, and that is what Senator Feingold's bills will result in because \nwe will refocus our attention on capturing bin Laden and getting al-\nQaida.\n  We are in a quagmire in Iraq. We are told that quagmire will go on \nindefinitely. I believe it is undermining our national security. It is \nundermining our economic security. When I tell you what it is costing, \nit is a stunning number. It has diverted critical resources from the \nhunt for Osama bin Laden. He has been at large more than 6 years. And \ndespite the administration's rhetoric, our own intelligence agencies \nagain are telling us that the war in Iraq is proving to be a critical \nrecruitment and fundraising tool for the terrorists we want to beat.\n  We see a toll on our military. We hear phrases such as a ``death \nspiral.'' The Washington Post reported that Army and Marine officials \nrefer to the readiness death spiral that senior officers warn puts our \nNation at risk. Why? Because we lack the strategic reserve of ground \nforces to be able to respond to crises throughout the world. This \nsingle-minded focus on Iraq and the ever-changing mission there is not \nmaking us stronger. It is making us weaker. We now see that suicide \nattempts among U.S. troops have reached a record high, a sixfold \nincrease since 2002. And while promising junior officers are leaving \nthe military at record rates, we hear that the services are lowering \ntheir standards to meet recruitment goals. They are recruiting \nconvicted felons now, people convicted of sex crimes, people convicted \nof making a false terror threat, assault with a deadly weapon. We are \ntaking felons into the military. This is wrong for our Nation.\n  Once upon a time we were told that this Iraq war was about weapons of \nmass destruction that Saddam Hussein was hiding, and it was about also \nSaddam's ties to al-Qaida. Our military did its job. They found out \nthere weren't weapons of mass destruction, and our intelligence people \ndid their job. They said there were no al-Qaida cells in Iraq at the \ntime of 9/11.\n  Then we were told the war was about getting rid of Saddam and \nliberating Iraq from that brutal tyrant. Our military did that. Then we \nwere told the war was about holding elections and promoting democracy. \nYou remember President Bush in his flight suit with big words ``mission \naccomplished.'' Well, there were many missions accomplished. There were \nno weapons of mass destruction. There were no ties to al-Qaida. We got \nSaddam Hussein. We got his relatives. Three elections were held. Our \nmilitary did every single thing that was asked of them to the point \nwhere the President said ``mission accomplished.'' But, no, the troops \nare there. They are suffering. Believe me, there is no end in sight \nbecause I personally asked our Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice how \nlong she, at the time, thought we would be in Iraq. She said she \ncouldn't answer. I said: How much do you think we will have to spend? \nShe couldn't answer. What kind of administration comes forward with a \nwar and has no way out?\n  Russ Feingold is saying: All right. We won't set an end date. We will \nchange the mission to get our troops out of harm's way. Let them \ncontinue to train Iraqis. Let them go after al-Qaida. Let them protect \nour forces there and our personnel there. But get them out of the \nbusiness of kicking down doors in Iraq. We have lost so many of these \nbrave men and women, and so many are coming home who will never be the \nsame.\n  We have this war based on shifting missions. The President said: \nMission accomplished. Dick Cheney said we are in the last throes. But \nit goes on and on under shifting rationales, going on 5 long years. \nWill it be another 5 years? They will not tell us. Will it be another \n10 years? They will not tell us.\n  Some of this administration's supporters say it will be 50 years. \nSome say it will be 100 years. How many brave men and women will die in \naddition to those who have already died? How many will be wounded? \nThere are no answers.\n  Will we spend $1 trillion? Will we spend $2 trillion, $3 trillion? No \nanswer. The toll is too high already. Thousands dead, tens of thousands \ninjured, $10 billion a month for Iraq.\n  The Nation's Governors met with the President yesterday. On a \nbipartisan basis they asked to see increased spending on America's \ncrumbling roads and highways and bridges. They said it would help our \nstruggling economy, and we can't grow economically if we don't have an \ninfrastructure. I am chair of the Public Works Committee of the Senate. \nMy friend, Senator Inhofe, and I do not agree on the war in Iraq, but \nwe certainly agree that we need to have an infrastructure. The \nPresident said: No, there is no money. There is only money for Iraq, an \nopen checkbook, $10 billion a month. We can't fix our falling bridges. \nThe $10 billion a month is equivalent to $2.5 billion a week, $357 \nmillion a day.\n\n  For less than the cost of 3 months in Iraq, we could enroll every \neligible child in America in the Head Start program for 1 long year. \nFor the cost of 1 month in Iraq, we could provide afterschool care for \nour kids for 4 years. For the cost of 2 weeks in Iraq, we could provide \nhealth insurance for a year to 6 million uninsured kids. Last year we \nasked the President to help us with children's health. He said no. He \nvetoed that critical investment. He just said no to the Governors on \nrebuilding the roads and highways. Open checkbook for Iraq; closed \ncheckbook for America.\n\n[[Page S1162]]\n\n  Do you remember when the President's then-Budget Director, Mitch \nDaniels, told us the war in Iraq would cost no more than $60 billion? \nHe was wrong. Paul Wolfowitz assured us Iraqi revenue would pay for the \nwar. No, we remember there were a couple in the administration who said \nthe war might cost as much as $200 billion. They were ridiculed. The \nPresident's most recent supplemental request for Iraq was $200 billion \nin itself, bigger than the stimulus package we just passed. The \nPresident has spent more than a half trillion dollars on his failed \npolicy, and there is literally no end in sight. I think we need to \nremember this is all borrowed money. The cost of interest on Iraq-\nrelated debt is $23 billion a year for fiscal year 2008 alone. The \nPresident's policy is being paid for on a credit card, and we are \nsticking my grandchildren and yours with the tab.\n  The cost of a barrel of oil has tripled since the war began, much to \nthe benefit of countries such as Russia, Sudan, and Iran. According to \nthe Joint Economic Committee, if you factor in the cost of the oil, the \nPresident's policy in Iraq has already cost the average family \n$416,500, and no end in sight.\n  It needs to stop. We are hemorrhaging money. The waste in this war is \nbeyond disgraceful. We spent $32 million for a base in Iraq that was \nnever built. We paid a contractor $72 million to build a barracks for \nthe police academy in Baghdad and instead got a building with giant \ncracks snaking through newly built walls and human waste dripping from \nthe ceiling. That is from a report. The administration loaded $9 \nbillion in cash on to pallets and shipped it into Iraq where it \npromptly disappeared.\n  I ask you: Imagine what would happen if $9 billion disappeared from \none of our cities. The people responsible would be in prison. But in \nIraq, the President shrugs it off.\n  When the President vetoed the Water Resources Development Act, he \nsaid it lacked fiscal discipline. He said it wasn't fiscally \nresponsible. I would ask rhetorically: Not fiscally responsible to \nmaintain our waterways and keep our commerce moving in this, the \ngreatest Nation in the world? This, coming from a President who \ninherited a budget surplus and turned it into a huge debt, with the \nlargest budget deficits in history as well, and money for Iraq every \nday, every hour, every minute, no end in sight, billions missing, \nbillions on bases that were never built. It is breathtaking. The \nPresident and his supporters shrug it off. They don't even address it. \nIt is unbelievable. The sky is the limit. But when it comes to \ninvesting in America or extending the stimulus for seniors and disabled \nvets, we are told: Sorry, we need to show fiscal discipline. Thank \ngoodness we were able to get that through above the President's \nobjections.\n  Our own military leaders tell us time and time again there is no \nmilitary solution. God bless our soldiers. They have given us a \nbreathing space. Yet the Iraqi Government is just making changes around \nthe edges.\n  We have trained 440,000 Iraqis militarily. Imagine, 440,000 Iraqis. \nWhy can't they defend themselves? Countries defend themselves. We have \ngiven so much in blood, in tears, in sweat, in dollars, in commitment, \nin trust. After the elections last year, I thought the President would \ncome to the table when the Democrats took over and said we wanted to \nend the war. We thought he would come to the table. We were wrong. He \ndid not come to the table. He is continuing this war, no end in sight, \nno plan to get out.\n  When I asked that question to Condoleezza Rice, I was stunned. She \nsaid: I can't answer the question of how long we will be there. I can't \nanswer the question of what it will cost--as if I didn't have a right \nto ask the question. That is why I am sent here.\n  I represent, along with Senator Feinstein, 37 million people. We have \ntaken a hit on soldiers killed. We have taken a hit on soldiers burned. \nWe have taken a hit on soldiers permanently disabled. So you better \nknow I am going to ask these questions.\n  Today, Senator Feingold is saying: Let's get started. Let's start \ntelling the Iraqis, by our actions not just our words, that they have \nto step up to the plate.\n  We have to make a choice as a nation.\n  Is it time for America? It is time for our families, for our \nsoldiers, for our children, for our grandchildren?\n  Or is it time to continue this open-ended commitment to a war without \nan end, a war that has no plan of ever ending, a war that is tying our \nhands in this recession?\n  I say it is time for a change in America. It is time to vote for the \nFeingold bill and start bringing our troops home.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak against the measure \nintroduced by Senator Feingold.\n  It has been only a year since GEN David Petraeus arrived in Baghdad \nand took command of American forces in Iraq. But in these brief 12 \nmonths, he and the American and coalition troops under his command have \nbrought about a tectonic shift in Iraq that has altered the course of \nthe war there and, with it, the future of at least two great nations--\nIraq and the United States of America--and the lives of hundreds of \nmillions of people in those two nations and so many others threatened \nby violent jihadist terrorists in the Middle East and beyond.\n  When the surge first began a year ago, many doubted that the violence \nthen raging in Iraq could be brought under control. Even as American \ntroops began implementing this bold new counterinsurgency strategy, \nsome opponents of the war inside and outside of Congress declared that \nthe war in Iraq was already ``lost,'' that the surge had already been \n``tried and failed,'' and that it mattered more, frankly, that we get \nout of Iraq than that we succeed in Iraq.\n  They could not have been more wrong. Thanks to the surge, the bravery \nand skill of American and Iraqi troops and the will of the Iraqi people \nto be free from terrorists, conditions on the ground in Iraq have been \ntotally transformed from those of a year ago.\n  A year ago, al-Qaida in Iraq was entrenched, in control of, \nexercising murderous control in Anbar Province and Baghdad. Now those \nevil forces of Islamist extremism are facing their single greatest and \nmost humiliating defeat since 2001.\n  This is not just my opinion. It is a matter of fact. In Baghdad, a \nfact: sectarian killings are down 95 percent in the last year; suicide \nbombings are down nearly 70 percent; IED attacks have been cut nearly \nin half.\n  In the face of those extraordinary improvements in Iraq--and many \nmore I will speak of in a moment in the social and political and \neconomic life of that great country--however, antiwar forces here in \nAmerica have reacted not with sighs of relief and gratitude but, \ninstead, by doing everything in their power to downplay or diminish our \nhard-won gains in Iraq.\n  Rather than admit the possibility that they had been wrong about the \nsurge and about the capability of reestablishing security in Iraq, \nthey, instead, reached for another rationale for retreat. What they \nargued was the lack of political progress in Iraq and, therefore, that \nthe surge had failed.\n  But this argument has also now been defeated by facts on the ground \nin Iraq.\n  In the first place, the Iraqi people have taken over their local and \nprovincial governments in a grassroots up democratic revolution. At the \nnational level, a response is occurring. It took too long, but it is \nnow significant. Benchmark legislation has surged forward in the Iraqi \nParliament. The budget law, passed; the debaathification law, passed; \nthe provincial powers and election law, passed; the amnesty law, \npassed.\n  Thanks to the surge, the Sunni Arabs, who once constituted the core \nof the insurgency, have now risen, because we stood by them, to join \nwith us\n\n[[Page S1163]]\n\nand go ahead on their own to fight against al-Qaida and put al-Qaida--\nthe same al-Qaida that attacked us on 9-11-01--on the run.\n  Thanks to the surge, the Shiites, who had turned in desperation to \nmilitias and death squads for protection from al-Qaida and Iranian-\nbacked extremists, are now rejecting those militias, death squads, and \nextremists. They want a better, more peaceful life for themselves and \ntheir families. And the American-led surge has put that within their \nreach.\n  Last week, Moqtada al-Sadr announced he is extending his unilateral \ncease-fire. He did not do this as a favor to the United States of \nAmerica or the Maliki Government in Baghdad. He did it because in Iraq \ntoday, thanks to the surge, and all that has been part of it, the rules \nof the game have changed. Violence and extremism are no longer the \nclear path to power in Iraq. In fact, they are becoming the path to \npolitical oblivion in Iraq. The people of Iraq want peace and stability \nand hope.\n  What then has been the reaction of antiwar groups here at home to \nthese enormous achievements in Iraq? Are they now ready to admit they \nwere wrong about the surge? Even if they were opposed to the war in \nIraq in the first place, are they now ready to acknowledge that we are \nthere, we are succeeding, and it would be wrong and hurtful to the \nUnited States for Congress to force a retreat now that would, in \nChurchill's terms, ``snatch defeat from the jaws of victory''?\n\n  To judge by the resolution now before us, the answer to that question \nis no. On the contrary, even as the facts on the ground have changed so \nmuch for the better, the resolution before us offers the same familiar \nprescription for retreat and surrender--ordered by Congress, not by our \nmilitary leaders in the field or here at home--and it orders that, no \nmatter what the consequences for the freedom of the Iraqi people, the \nfuture of the Islamic world, and the future national security of the \nUnited States of America.\n  Some claim the war in Iraq is a distraction from the ``real'' war on \nterror. Al-Qaida disagrees. And so do I. Al-Qaida's leadership has \nrepeatedly made clear they consider Iraq to be the central front of \ntheir campaign against us and most of the rest of the civilized world. \nAccording to our intelligence agencies, al-Qaida in Iraq remains al-\nQaida's most visible and capable affiliate worldwide and the only one \nknown to have expressed a desire to attack the American homeland--us \nhere at home.\n  I know there are some who hear these arguments, watch what is \nhappening, and say: Oh, no. The sponsors of this legislation certainly \nunderstand exactly how much political and military progress we are \nmaking against al-Qaida and Iranian-backed extremists in Iraq and how \nmuch is riding on the line there for America and most of the rest of \nthe civilized world faced by this threat of violent jihadist terrorism. \nBut this argument goes that the sponsors of this kind of resolution \nfeel compelled to offer it to show antiwar groups in the United States \nthat they have not forgotten them.\n  I refuse to believe that. I refuse to believe--I do not believe it--\nthat my colleagues would so trifle with the honor of American soldiers \nwho have served and are serving in Iraq--too many of whom have given \ntheir lives in that service--or they would play such a political game \nwith our national security. I respect my colleagues too much to take \nthis legislation as anything other than what it says. It orders a \nretreat within 120 days.\n  It actually imposes so-called caveats on American forces after that \n120 days, which are exactly the kind of caveats, limitations, on what \nthey can do that we are now arguing with our European allies to stop in \nAfghanistan. In Afghanistan, some of our NATO allies are there, but \nthey can only do certain things. They cannot enter into battle, et \ncetera. They cannot go out into the field with the Afghani National \nArmy. We are saying you cannot fight a war that way.\n  Listen to what one section of this matter before us offered by the \nSenator from Wisconsin says. Our troops, after the 120 days, can \nprovide training to members of the Iraqi Security Forces ``provided \nthat such training does not involve members of the United States Armed \nForces taking part in combat operations or being embedded with Iraqi \nforces.''\n  That is a caveat, a limitation, exactly what we are arguing with our \nEuropean allies to stop doing in Afghanistan.\n  The fact is, the legislation, this measure now before this Chamber, \nflies in the face of the recommendations of our proud and tested \ncommanders on the ground in Iraq. If enacted, it would unravel all the \nhard-won gains our troops have made in the past year. It would hand \nvictory to the suicide bombers and fanatics who are now on the run. It \nwould betray the millions of Iraqis who are standing with us today \nbecause they desire a better, freer life for themselves and their \nchildren. And it would endanger the lives of and hopes of hundreds of \nmillions more who live in the Middle East and throughout the Islamic \nworld who yearn for a life of peace and justice, not a life of \nextremism, death, and primitivism that al-Qaida offers them.\n  I wish to close, if I may, with a word directed to my colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle, the Democratic Members of this Senate. I have \nthought a lot about this war, and I cannot help but wonder, in a moment \nsuch as this, what some of the political heroes of my youth, who were \nDemocrats, would think if they were here and could see and listen to \nthis debate and read this resolution.\n  I think of President Kennedy, who declared:\n\n       We shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, \n     support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the \n     survival and the success of liberty.\n\n  In my opinion, that is exactly what we are doing in Iraq today.\n  I ask my colleagues: Do these words have meaning, have significance \nor are these just words?\n  I think of President Harry Truman, who proclaimed, at the outset of \nthe Cold War:\n\n       It must be the policy of the United States to support free \n     peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed \n     minorities or by outside pressures.\n\n  Are these too just words? Isn't that exactly what is happening in \nIraq today? The people of Iraq, liberated from the terrible \ndictatorship of Saddam Hussein, hoping to secure a better future for \nthemselves, now, with our assistance and encouragement, ``are resisting \nattempted subjugation by armed minorities''--read here: al-Qaida--``or \nby outside pressures''--read here: Iran. Are these just words? I hope \nnot. I do not believe they are.\n  There was a time when these were not just words, but they were the \nconvictions that lay at the heart of the Democratic Party's foreign and \nnational security policy.\n  The legislation now before this Chamber, if implemented, would not, \nin my opinion, only betray our friends in the Middle East, it would not \nonly betray America's own vital national interests against our \ndeadliest enemies, al-Qaida and Iran, it would also betray the best \nideals of the Democratic Party that I joined decades ago.\n  They were strong and liberal ideals, and I use those words \nintentionally. Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, and Kennedy, great \nDemocratic Senators such as Hubert Humphrey and ``Scoop'' Jackson, \nbelieved that the party stood for being liberal at home and liberal \nabroad. What did that mean? Liberal in the classic sense of the term \n``freedom,'' which is what America is all about: the self-evident truth \nthat we are all endowed by our Creator with the rights to life and \nliberty.\n  So I wish to appeal particularly today to my Democratic colleagues in \nthe Senate to reject this resolution, and in that sense to return to \nwhat I believe are the strongest, proudest, most purposed moments of \nthe history of the Democratic Party in recent decades on matters of \nforeign and national security policy.\n  In sum, a year ago, the Bush administration acknowledged its mistakes \nin Iraq and changed course there. It is now time for opponents of the \nwar and the surge to do the same. It is time for them to admit that the \nsurge has worked and that America's security and freedom are on the \nline in Iraq today, that we are winning there, and it would be a \ndisastrous mistake to impose the policies ordered by this resolution, \nthis amendment, which would deprive our brave American men and women in \nuniform and the brave soldiers of other countries, including Iraq,\n\n[[Page S1164]]\n\nof the victory that they are winning now for the people of Iraq, the \npeople of America, and the cause of freedom, which is America's cause.\n  I implore my colleagues, vote against this resolution.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me, first of all, commend our \ncolleague who just spoke. Senator Lieberman is very knowledgeable. It \nhas been such an honor for me, in the years I have been in the Senate, \nto be serving on both the Armed Services Committee with him as well as \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  I very much am opposed to Senator Feingold's bills. But I wonder, in \nthis short session, in the short time we have left--we have such things \nto debate: the budget, housing, energy, consumer product safety, \neducation, farm programs--and I have to ask: Why are we wasting \nvaluable time on these bills? And why at this time do we need another \nreport?\n  The National Security Strategy was written in 2006, and another will \nbe required 150 days after the new administration comes in. The \nNational Military Strategy review has been completed, and the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs is conducting his own additional review. The \nQuadrennial Defense Review will be out later this year. And the \nNational Defense Strategy is also mandated by law. We currently have \nthe strategy in place to win the global war on terror.\n\n  The study prescribed by S. 2634 ties the hands of our military by \ntelling them to outline a strategy that does not let them utilize the \nfull extent of their resources.\n  Furthermore, the substance of Senator Feingold's bills has been \ndebated and defeated. On December 18, 2007, we voted against an \namendment of the same nature as S. 2633 from the very same Senator, \nSenator Feingold. It was a troop withdrawal amendment, it was No. 3875, \nand it was defeated 71 to 24. We have already done this. Senator McCain \nsaid it best when he said that a majority had, by December 18, engaged \nin no less than 40 legislative attempts to achieve the misguided \noutcome of precipitous withdrawal. This makes Nos. 41 and 42. All of \nthese 40-odd, time-wasting attempts have been defeated. Why? Because we \nare doing the right thing in Iraq.\n  We did away with the oppressive regime of Saddam Hussein, where mass \ngraves, torture, and rape were normal and everyday occurrences. We did \naway with terrorist training camps in Samarra, Ramadi, Sargat, Salmon \nPak--and incidentally, Salmon Pak, in that training camp, they had a \nfuselage of an old 707 there, teaching people how to hijack airplanes. \nI guess we will never know whether the perpetrators of 9/11 were \ntrained there. But nonetheless, there were four training camps there. \nThey are gone now. They are closed.\n  We helped the Iraqi people create a free and Democratic country, \nwhere representation and the rule of law are replacing coercion and \nterror. The Iraqi Parliament has passed legislation that has reformed \nthe de-Ba'athification, enacted pension reform that allowed former \nBa'athists to collect their pensions. They enacted a law defining the \nprovincial and central government roles and responsibilities. They \npassed the 2008 budget--faster than we are doing it, actually--and \nenacted an amnesty law that could lead to the release of thousands of \ndetainees, removing a stumbling block standing in the way of \nreconciliation.\n  We have done the right thing, and we are winning.\n  It is interesting. A lot of the people who were the defeatists come \nback now--Katie Couric is an example--who says we are actually winning. \nLess than half the al-Qaida leaders who were in Baghdad when the surge \nbegan are still in the city. They have either fled or were killed and \ncaptured.\n  In addition to the list Senator Lieberman talked about and in terms \nof the successes, there has been a 75-percent reduction in religious \nand ethnic killings in the capital, they have doubled the seizure of \ninsurgents' weapons caches, there has been a rise in the number of al-\nQaida killed and captured, they have knocked out six media cells, \nmaking it harder for al-Qaida to spread their propaganda, and Anbar \nincidents of attacks are down from 40 a day to less than 10 a day. \nThere has been economic growth, markets are open, and the streets are \ncrowded.\n  We have been over there and we have seen it. You didn't used to be \nable to do that. The Iraqi Army is performing well.\n  The Iraqi citizens formed a grassroots movement called Concerned \nCitizens Leagues. This is interesting because this is allowing \ncitizens, as we have in Washington, DC, and in Tulsa, OK--we have \ngroups that go out there to protect ourselves, and that is what these \npeople are doing. They are unarmed. They are going out now with paint \ncans and drawing circles around undetonated IEDs and unexploded \nordnance.\n  COL Tom James, one of the commanders of the 3rd I.D. in Iraq, said \nlast Friday, February 22:\n\n       The current security situation is stable and I am \n     optimistic about the future. Sunni extremists are severely \n     disrupted. They no longer find sanctuary and support from the \n     population.\n\n  We are winning because we are supporting our war fighters with a \nfundamental advantage, allowing them to command and control their \nforces--not doing it from here. Senator Feingold's amendment serves to \ntie the hands of our commanders on the ground.\n  S. 2633 legislates defeat. There is no other way to put it. The \namendment legislates defeat. Secretary Gates said: If we were to \nwithdraw, leaving Iraq in chaos, al-Qaida most certainly would use \nAnbar Province . . . as another base from which to plan operations not \nonly inside Iraq, but first of all in the neighborhood and then \npotentially against the United States.\n  I must remind Senator Feingold and the cosponsors of this amendment \nthat al-Qaida is not the only threat to America and to our ideals. \nAhmadinejad said on August 28--this is very interesting. He said:\n\n       Soon we will see a huge power vacuum in the region.\n\n  A power vacuum.\n  He said this expecting our defeatism--he is talking about these \nresolutions--he said:\n\n       Of course, we are prepared to fill the gap.\n\n  Now here is Iran, a country which recently declared a doubling of its \nuranium enrichment program and has been testing ballistic missiles, \ntalking about filling this gap, the void that would be created.\n  A lack of a secure and stable Iraq means instability in the Middle \nEast and a clear avenue for terror and oppression to spread, and \nalready has spread, into Africa.\n  I have had occasion to be in what we refer to as the CENTCOM and now \nAFRICOM and EUCOM some 27 times since 9/11. A lot of that time is down \nin areas such as Djibouti and in the heart of Africa, where we have our \nforces down there, because with this squeeze taking place in the Middle \nEast, there is a lot of the terrorist traffic going into Africa. As for \nS. 2634, as the one before it, it is a thinly veiled attempt to end the \nwar in Iraq by legislating defeat.\n  The bill proposes to micromanage military strategy by forcing the \nadministration to narrowly define the future movement and employment of \nmilitary personnel. It attempts to define the type of missions the \nmilitary can conduct and places constraints on the length of time the \nmilitary can deploy. It falsely presumes our professional warriors \nwould be better served by limiting their deployments rather than \nsupporting their victory over the enemy.\n\n  By the way, all these people who now talk to me about the long \ndeployments--and I agree the deployments are too long--I wonder where \nthey were in the 1990s when we cut down the size of our military, when \nwe brought the number of divisions down from 18 to 10. I can remember \nbeing on the floor saying this day was going to come and that some day \nwe were going to say: Why did we cut back so far?\n  Again, COL Tom James, speaking about our recent successes, said:\n\n       It all goes back to this window of security being opened, \n     and being able to exploit that window of opportunity through \n     governance and economics and building the capacity of the \n     Iraqi security forces. This has all been enabled because of \n     the surge.\n\n  Proposing specific deployment and dwell times would limit the \nflexibility\n\n[[Page S1165]]\n\nof our commanders to conduct operations in the field and infringe on \nthe President's authority as Commander in Chief.\n  So this is the same flexibility that allowed the Commander in Chief \nto surge forces and turn the tide in Iraq. I am one of those who \npersonally observed the changes that took place in Iraq with the surge. \nIt was about a year ago right now. I recall a report where our \nintelligence was actually attending all the weekly Friday mosque \nmeetings, and at that time, my recollection is 85 percent of those \nmessages given by the imams and the clerics were anti-American \nmessages. That stopped in April, and they realized things are working \nthere. There is so much talk about the political leaders, I kind of \nlook at the religious leaders as part of the reason for the successes \nwe have had.\n  So I think we have already voted on these. They have been voted down, \nand we don't need to waste any more time on it. I think common sense--\nwhen we sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee, as we did this \nmorning, and we looked at the brilliant generals who were testifying \nbefore us, such as General Casey, these people spend a lifetime knowing \nwhat is going on and how to negotiate wars. We are winning. Things are \ngood right now. I have often thought--I was honored in 1991 to be on \nthe first freedom flight back to Kuwait. At that time, the Iraqis \ndidn't know the war was over. They were still burning the fields. I \nremember going into one of the houses that actually was the Ambassador \nto the United States from Kuwait, a family of nobility, going into \ntheir home. They wanted to see what it looked like. Saddam Hussein had \nused it for one of his headquarters, and the little daughter going up \nto her bedroom to see what it looked like, they had used her bedroom \nfor a torture chamber. The unimaginable things that were going on over \nthere: Looking into the mass graves. I would think that those \nindividuals on the other side, if nothing more--if that were all there \nwere to it--would say we have to finish. It is our humanitarian \nresponsibility.\n  We are experiencing a victory, the surge is working, and I hope we \nwill be able to dispose of, in a very quick way, these two bills \nauthored by Senator Feingold.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/26/senate-section/article/S1165-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate, at 12:40 p.m., recessed until \n2:25 p.m., and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding \nOfficer (Mr. Carper).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/26/senate-section/article/S1165-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1165-S1194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPROVIDING FOR THE SAFE REDEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES TROOPS FROM IRAQ--\n                           MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as we take up the issue of Iraq once \nagain, the question that should be foremost in our minds is this: Has \nthe situation improved since the Petraeus plan was put into place? And \nif so, if the terrorists who have been murdering coalition and Iraqi \nsoldiers and civilians there for years are now seriously wounded and on \nthe run, as we are told they are, then the obvious followup question is \nthis: How do we ensure that the progress not only continues but \nactually lasts?\n  Our friends on the other side never seem to let the facts get in the \nway of their proposals for securing Iraq. When the President announced \na new counterinsurgency strategy last year, many of them said it would \nnot work. Even the plan's most vocal critics voted to confirm the \ngeneral who would carry it out. The junior Senator from Illinois \nembodied this approach when he predicted: The President's strategy will \nnot work, and then cast a vote confirming General Petraeus for the job. \nThen, when General Petraeus returned from Iraq to report that the \nstrategy was bearing fruit, some of our friends on the other side \ncovered their ears and questioned his integrity.\n  The junior Senator from New York embodied this view when she said the \ngeneral's report required ``a willing suspension of disbelief,'' then \nvoted against a resolution that condemned an ad accusing him of lies. \nAnd now, after months of positive reports on improved safety and even \nimportant political progress, some of our friends on the other side \nonce again want to cut funding for the troops.\n  In the words of the first Feingold bill that we might be voting on, \nthey want to ``promptly transition the mission.'' They want to tear up \nthe Petraeus plan and cut off funds for the very troops who are \ncarrying it out.\n  The second Feingold bill is just as odd. It would require the Bush \nadministration, now in its final months, to set out a new global \nstrategy for fighting terrorism even as our military fights the \nterrorists neighborhood by neighborhood in Iraq and even as \ncongressional Democrats continue to block a bipartisan surveillance \nbill that we know would improve our ability to disrupt terrorist plots. \nThe second Feingold bill would also require reducing the pace of \ndeployments and an increase in overall military readiness. This would \nmean not only full funding for the Defense Department but also \ndirecting an even greater share of the Nation's resources to defense--\nsomething the junior Senator from Wisconsin has not been known to \nchampion in the past.\n  In other words, the second Feingold bill claims to advance an \neffective antiterrorist program even though the first one attempts to \nblock a counterinsurgency plan that even early critics of the war are \nnow calling a success. It calls for a new strategy against al-Qaida \neven while Democrats in the House block one of the most effective tools \nwe have in the fight against al-Qaida.\n  All of which leads me to wonder, what possible deduction of reason \nhas prompted our friends on the other side to believe either of these \nbills is a good idea? We already know what will happen to the first \nbill. Last year, we overwhelmingly rejected it--not just once but four \ntimes. It never achieved more than 29 votes. And that was before the \nsuccess of the Petraeus plan.\n  But given what has happened since then, the proposal to cut funds, to \nscrap the Petraeus plan, makes even less sense today. Just consider \nwhat has taken place in Iraq over the last year.\n  Since the implementation of the Petraeus plan, violence in Iraq has \nfallen dramatically. Over the past year, civilian deaths are one-sixth \nof what they were in November of 2006. High-profile bombings are down \nby two-thirds since June. The discovery and seizure of guns and other \nweapons caches has more than doubled nationally and tripled in Anbar. \nThe worst kind of violence is dramatically down. Ethno-sectarian \nconflict--the fighting has fallen from a peak of about 1,100 incidents \nin December of 2006 to about 100 such incidents this past November. \nThat is less than 1 year. Locals are energized about fighting back \nagainst terrorists, with between 70,000 and 100,000 ordinary citizens \nstepping forward to help local police root out terrorists. And the \nterrorists themselves are becoming demoralized, with even those who \nshare their religious beliefs driving them into hiding.\n  This kind of progress is changing minds. One harsh early critic of \nthe war, Anthony Cordesman, recently visited Iraq, looked at the new \ndata, and came to a different conclusion.\n  Here is what Anthony Cordesman says now:\n\n       No one can spend 10 days visiting the battlefields in Iraq \n     without seeing major progress in every area. If the U.S. \n     provides sustained support to the Iraqi Government, in \n     security, governance, and development, there is now a very \n     real chance that Iraq will emerge as a secure and stable \n     state.\n\n  A very real chance that Iraq will emerge as a secure and stable \nstate. These are the words of a man whose judgment our friends on the \nother side were appealing to just last year in arguing for withdrawal. \nLast July, the junior Senator from New Jersey, speaking on the Senate \nfloor, cited the opinion of Mr. Cordesman before declaring: Mr. \nPresident, it is over; your\n\n[[Page S1166]]\n\nfailed strategy, your ill-conceived war must come to an end before more \ndamage is done.\n  All of this reminds me of something we saw last summer after the New \nYork Times ran an op-ed by two early critics of the war who had begun \nto change their views on the Petraeus plan once those views became \ninconsistent with the facts on the ground. About a week after the piece \nappeared in print, the senior Senator from Illinois concurred with its \ncentral point, after early and outspoken opposition to the Petraeus \nplan.\n\n       More American troops have brought more peace to more parts \n     of Iraq. I think that is a fact.\n\n  Yet, since those comments, violence in Iraq has gone down even more, \nand the kind of political progress the authors of that New York Times \npiece were hoping for is finally taking place.\n  A provincial powers law passed, with elections set to take place \nsometime before October. The Iraqi Parliament passed a partial amnesty \nlaw for prisoners--a sign of thawing relations between the Sunnis, who \nmake up most of the prison population, and the majority Shias. The \nIraqi Parliament has also approved a national budget that allocated \nGovernment revenue, most of it from oil, out to the provinces.\n  To most people, the lesson of the last year is obvious: Coalition \nforces are winning this fight, and they deserve our full support and \nour thanks. The response from most of us has been a mix of pride and \nnew confidence, especially now that some concrete political progress is \nbeing made. For others, however, the lesson to be drawn from success is \nthe same as it was when we faced the strongest adversity: Cut the \nfunds, withdraw the troops, and leave Iraq to the terrorists. \nFortunately, most of the Senate will reject this view when we defeat \nthe Feingold bills, hopefully for the last time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will use my leader time and ask unanimous \nconsent that the vote not occur at 2:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, during the recess we had, I was in Nevada. \nPeople all across the State of Nevada, just like people all across this \ncountry, are committed to ending the war in Iraq.\n  These are the facts. We need to end the worst foreign policy blunder \nin our Nation's history, which started with the invasion of Iraq. What \nhas 5 years of war brought to America, to the Middle East, to the \nworld? It has brought thousands of deaths, almost a trillion dollars in \ndebt, catastrophic failure of diplomacy. What has 5 years of war \nbrought to America, to the Middle East, and the world? Debt, \ndepression, and death.\n  My Republican colleagues, think what this war has done to our \nNation's fiscal soundness. It has destroyed it. In less than a year \nborrowed money for Iraq will be $1 trillion--soon $1 trillion of \nborrowed money, with the likely Republican nominee for President saying \nwe may need to be in Iraq for another 100 years. We are nearing the \ntragic milestone of 4,000 dead Americans, more than 30,000 wounded \nAmericans, many gravely wounded, amputations, blindness, hearing loss, \nuntold thousands with head trauma, making life after the war most \ndifficult. This week brings news from the Pentagon that there will be \n140,000 American troops in Iraq still in July, 8,000 more than when the \nsurge began in January of 2007.\n  In Iraq a civil war rages, with the past 2 days bringing us the news \nof Sunni attacks on Shias while the Shias observe a religious holiday, \nattacks that killed at least threescore, wounded more than 100. And, of \ncourse, the Shias will reciprocate; and just in an off place that you \nhave to search hard in the newspaper, three more dead American \nsoldiers. These are the facts.\n  In Israel we find the Bush administration has been too preoccupied to \nbe concerned with the volatility of the Palestinian-Israeli situation. \nNow we have a raging civil war in the Palestinian territory, Hamas \nversus Fatah. A government can't be formed in Lebanon where some say is \nalso a civil war. Iran is thumbing its nose at us and the world \ncommunity. Torture, Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, warrantless spying on \nAmerican citizens--all as a result of this misplaced war. These are the \nfacts.\n  In an op-ed published in today's Washington Post, three noted writers \nand foreign policy experts said this:\n\n       Republicans will claim that after four years of disastrous \n     mistakes, the Bush administration finally got it right with \n     its troop ``surge.'' Yet despite the loss of nearly 1,000 \n     American lives and the expenditure of $150 billion, the surge \n     has failed in its stated purpose: providing the Iraqi \n     government with the breathing space to pass the 18 \n     legislative benchmarks the Bush administration called vital \n     to political reconciliation.\n       To date it has passed only four.\n\n  And some say the four passed are for show; they have no substance.\n\n       Moreover, as part of the surge, the administration has \n     further undermined Iraq's government by providing arms and \n     money to Sunni insurgent groups even though they have not \n     pledged loyalty to Baghdad.\n\n  My high school pal, my buddy, I named one of my boys after him, he \nnamed one of his boys after me. I am proud of my namesake. He is a \nheroic helicopter pilot, having served a very difficult tour in \nAfghanistan and now Iraq. We exchanged regular e-mails during his time \noverseas. These e-mails were wonderful. Before going to Iraq, we had \nthe opportunity to meet in Las Vegas for dinner. He was on his way. It \nwas a nice dinner. He proudly told me of his war stories, stories of \nreal-life valor. Now the e-mails have stopped. I had the good fortune \nof meeting my friend at my home in Searchlight last week, last Monday, \na week ago yesterday.\n  I said: Why don't I get e-mails anymore. His dad told me that his son \nsaid: They need to get us out of here. He wants to come home with the \nrest of our gallant, even heroic troops. These are the facts.\n  The mission has not been accomplished. We have not been met as \nliberators. After 5 years of war, we are still an occupying force. \nIraq, with untold wealth because of its oil supply, must take care of \nits own citizens. Americans need to start taking care of Americans. We \ncannot spend a half billion dollars every day in Iraq. These are the \nfacts.\n  We will soon vote on two amendments that will begin to change course \nin the bloody Iraq civil war. Our first vote is on a bill to \nresponsibly begin to redeploy our troops so we can refocus on other \nthreats and challenges around the world. Do we have them? General Casey \ntestified today in a building a short distance from here that the Army \nis in a state of distress. We heard on the media this morning about \nwhat is going on in the Pacific. The admiral in charge there doesn't \nhave the necessary force to do even intelligence. It has been shipped \nto Iraq.\n  We need to begin to redeploy our troops. That is what this amendment \nis about. We can refocus on other threats and challenges, and there are \nmany, and limit the troops to counterterrorism, force training, and \nprotecting our assets.\n  The other bill we will vote on later is also extremely important. It \ncalls for a report from the administration on the status of the fight \nagainst al-Qaida, the fight against terrorism. As the war in Iraq \nrages, bin Laden remains free, and his terrorist network is gaining \npower worldwide. This legislation will shine the spotlight on this \nunmet challenge of fighting terrorism and keeping America safe--today, \ntomorrow, and beyond.\n  I urge my colleagues to seek common ground toward a new American \nforeign policy that strengthens our security, supports our troops, and \nbegins to restore our Nation's ability to once again lead in the way we \nhave in generations past.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nhours of postcloture debate prior to the motion to proceed being agreed \nto, with the time equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees; further, that upon disposition of this \nlegislation, S. 2633, the Senate then proceed to a cloture vote with \nrespect to S. 2634.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill object, we now have an opportunity to discuss the issue the \nmajority feels we ought to be talking about. I have a number of \nspeakers lined up on my side. I assume that is the case on the other \nside. So it is time to debate the Feingold proposal; therefore, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am satisfied that we got cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to this important legislation, and I appreciate the \nbipartisan vote in this regard. Usually, however, when we get cloture \non a motion to proceed, it means Senators are prepared to actually \nbegin consideration of that legislation. However, I have asked consent \nthat we do just that. My minority colleagues have objected.\n  The only conclusion a reasonable person could have is that they are \nresorting to a new variation of the old theme. Remember, in 1 year--\nlast year--the Republican minority broke all rules in filibusters. In 1 \nyear, we had to file cloture 68 different times. So it is obvious this \nis only an effort to stall, as they have done for the entire time we \nhave been in the majority.\n  Now, we are happy to legislate regarding Iraq, but it is obvious to \nme what the game plan is. They want us to slow the Senate down from \ngetting things done. It is interesting to note that when the 30 hours \nis up, we will automatically go to cloture on the piece of legislation \nthat calls for a reporting requirement on the global war on terror. \nFrom the statements made by the distinguished Republican leader, they \ndon't like that. So it would seem to me it is very clear that they are \ngoing to do everything they can to stop us from getting to the housing \nlegislation, which the American people badly need. I think it is \nimportant that we do the housing legislation and that we do consumer \nproduct safety. Of course, we are going to do the budget resolution. It \nis obvious the Republican minority is in their usual stalling tactic.\n  Now, we have a few people who can speak, too, during these 30 hours, \nbut what we should be doing is legislating on this most important \nlegislation. Remember, the Iraq war is within a matter of days going to \nbe starting the sixth year--the sixth year of this war. It has been \nreported that in less than a year, this war will cost the American \ntaxpayer $1 trillion. Remember, Lindsey was fired because he said it \nwould cost $100 billion. He was fired. Well, he was a little off.\n  We know that in a matter of a few days we are going to have a \nmilestone, a tragic milestone. There will be 4,000 dead Americans. Our \ntroops have fought valiantly. We all acknowledge that. But as I \nindicated in my statement earlier today, they want to come home. \nWherever you go, that is what they tell you. The parents tell you that. \nThe troops tell you that. A Capitol policeman came home. He has been \nover there for almost a year. I talked to him yesterday: When are you \ngoing back?\n  He said: In 2 weeks.\n  How has it been, Jim?\n  He said: It has been pretty tough.\n  He is a different person than he was, having been through what he has \nbeen through.\n  So if the Republicans want to talk about Iraq, we are happy to talk \nabout Iraq and about how this money we have borrowed and continue to \nborrow--$1 trillion--is preventing us--I met with the Governors \nyesterday, the Democratic Governors. They know what they are not doing \nin their States because they have no money, whether it is \ninfrastructure, the deterioration of roads, bridges, and dams or \nwhether it is health care. They can't take care of some of the basic \nneeds of the people from their States, and they know it is because of \nthis war.\n  The President doesn't like to borrow money, except for this war. \nThere is a carte blanche: Borrow as much as you need. This war is \ncosting us now about a half a billion dollars a day--a day. So isn't it \ngood that the American people are hearing us talk about this?\n  As I indicated in an earlier statement I made a few minutes ago, \nlet's not start boasting about the surge. During the surge, we have \nlost about 1,000 American troops--1,000 American troops. We are glad \nthe violence is down, but that is all a matter of degree. The Shia \nreligious holiday they are trying to finish, in 2 days, more than 60 \nkilled, more than 100 wounded, and this is Sunni on Shia, and you can \nbet whatever you have to bet, the Shias will be back to inflict equal \ndamage against the Sunnis, and the Sunnis, to whom we have paid huge \namounts of money, have not even declared loyalty to the Baghdad \nGovernment.\n  So we are happy to talk about Iraq. It is obvious the Republicans are \ndoing everything they can to stop us from going forward on legislation, \nsomething dealing with the economy, of course. What would have been the \nright thing to do, if they were sincere about moving forward, a motion \nto proceed. I want everyone who is within the sound of my voice to \nunderstand that motions to proceed are routine. No one made us go \nforward on motions to proceed, until this Republican minority showed \nup, and then on virtually everything, they are doing the slow walk on \neverything--everything. If they\n\n[[Page S1168]]\n\nwere legitimate and genuine about what they want to do, we would be on \nthis piece of legislation that has been introduced and we would be \ntalking about the merits of it. But, no, that can't start.\n  Understand that at the end of 30 hours, automatically we have a vote \non the next cloture that has been filed because everything we do around \nhere, we have to file cloture on a motion to proceed because of the big \nstalls taking place. So we are ready to talk as long as people want to \ntalk on this issue. We have Democratic Senators who want to talk about \nthis because they know what this war has done to what is taking place \nin our States, as indicated by the Governors whom I met with yesterday.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my good friend, the majority leader, \nseems to regret that we are having a debate on the matter he put in the \nqueue for us to have a debate on. We would not be dealing with this \nissue this week but for his decision to file cloture on two motions to \nproceed on two Feingold bills. The first Feingold bill which is before \nus, we have actually essentially voted on four times already since the \nnew majority took over in January of 2007. In fact, this will be the \n35th Iraq vote we have had since the new majority has taken over.\n  We spent a lot of time discussing Iraq over the last year. During \nmuch of that time, the view of what was happening in Iraq was not \nnearly as positive or optimistic as it is now. Why we should have a \ntruncated discussion of Iraq at a time when things are getting \ndramatically and measurably better strikes me as somewhat curious.\n  So obviously the Iraq debate of the moment has commenced. I have a \nnumber of speakers on my side who wish to talk about the success of the \nsurge, the improvement in Iraq, the improvement on the Government side \nas well as the military side. So we are happy to engage in this debate. \nIt was not our decision to schedule it. This was the decision of the \nmajority to devote whatever time was necessary this week to a \ndiscussion of these two Feingold bills related to Iraq.\n  So we look forward to the discussion. I believe we have a number of \npeople lined up who would be happy to engage in the Iraq discussion, \nand we will continue that until such time as there is a mutual \nagreement to yield back time, which may or may not occur, depending \nupon the situation and how many speakers we have. This is the way the \nSenate frequently operates. It is the way it was when our good friends \non the other side were in the minority. There is nothing unusual about \nthis at all. The one thing we know the majority leader can do is \nschedule, and it was his decision to schedule the two Feingold bills, \nand the first of which is now being talked about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to my friend from \nIllinois in a minute.\n  We are happy to debate the Iraq issue. We have always been happy to \ndo it. Thirty-five times we have, and that is 35 times more than when \nthe Republicans were in the majority. The war went on for years with no \noversight, none whatsoever. We have at least demanded that, and I think \nit is important we have done that.\n  I would also ask my Republican colleagues, why don't they ever talk \nabout the costs of this war? The costs in life, bodily injury, and \nmoney--money that is keeping this country from taking care of its own?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2633 offered by \nSenator Feingold.\n  I think it is unfortunate the Republican leadership has once again \nput the Senate into a stall. It seems as if the Republicans feel that \nit takes them 30 hours to make up their mind to do anything. They want \nto burn off 30 hours of Senate time. I don't know why. What Senator \nReid offered them was a chance to move to this resolution, to debate \nit, and if amendments are going to be offered, they would be offered. \nThey turned it down. They want to wait 30 hours before we even possibly \nreach that point. As Senator Reid explained it, there may be an \nintervening motion that slows us down there. But that is what this is \nall about. This is the Republicans' slow boat for America. They want to \nslow everything down to a snail's pace, and it is unfortunate that they \ndo.\n  They know what we want to do. We want to have a good, open debate on \nthe policy on the war in Iraq, followed this week by emergency \nlegislation to deal with the housing crisis in America. So their \nstrategy is to avoid that debate on Iraq, a debate that leads to the \nactual bill, tie us up in procedural issues, and hope we don't get to \nthe housing crisis by the end of the week. I guess at the end of the \nweek the Republicans will say: Job well done. The Senate went home and \ndidn't do anything for another week. Well, I guess that is what they \nthink the minority is all about, to stop anything from happening. Isn't \nit unfortunate.\n  If you listen to Presidential campaigning on both sides, Republicans \nand Democrats talking about change, they point an accusing finger at \nus, saying that time and again, Senators and Congressmen dream up ways \nto avoid facing the important issues in America. Well, it is time for \nus to face those issues in a timely way, to give ample opportunity to \nminority and majority, to debate, to amend, to move forward. Yet the \nRepublicans, as they did last year, are doing everything this year \nagain to obstruct, to stall, and to stop.\n  Why is this important? The minority leader, Senator McConnell of \nKentucky, was complaining that we have had 35 votes on the war in Iraq. \nHe is war weary of voting on Iraq. Well, I want to say to him I am war \nweary as well. I am weary of 3,972 U.S. service men and women killed in \nIraq. I am weary of 29,000 injured, many seriously, and with permanent \nconditions they will struggle with for a lifetime. I am weary of a war \nthis President won't pay for, that costs us $10 billion to $15 billion \na month. I am weary of the excuses we have made for the Iraqis who have \nfailed to lead their own Nation while we risk and give American lives \nin this conflict. I am weary of the missed opportunities in America \nthat $1 trillion spent on this war could have bought us to make our \nNation stronger at home--better schools, making certain our teachers \nare compensated for good work, the technology we need so our children \ncan be successful in this 21st century, medical research funds that \nhave been cut under this administration, funds for extending health \ncare and insurance for families across America, putting infrastructure \nin place in America so our economy can grow and move forward with good \nAmerican jobs building those roads and highways and airports and mass \ntransit. I am weary of that too.\n\n  No apologies for the Senator from Kentucky for 35 votes on Iraq. That \nis hardly 1 vote for every 100 Americans who have been killed in that \ncountry. It certainly is worth our time to debate this. Even more \nimportant, it is worth our time to change this policy in Iraq.\n  I salute Senator Feingold. He has been a lone voice. There were times \nI didn't agree with him. I thought he had an approach for this that we \nweren't ready for. But over time, I have come to understand his wisdom \nand his insight, and his political courage to bring this issue to the \nfloor. If he didn't fight doggedly to make sure we didn't have this \nIraq war debate, we would skate along perhaps month after month without \never facing the music. What we face is a reality.\n  The Republican plan is to stall and wait 11 months until President \nGeorge W. Bush, on January 20, 2009, can leave the White House, give a \nfond adieu to Washington, DC, and say: Well, I left the war; now it is \nup to the others to try to solve this. Well, it is going to take quite \na bit to try to undo the worst foreign policy decision in modern memory \nin America.\n  Many of us remember that night in October of 2002 when here in the \nSenate Chamber we voted on authorizing this President to go to war. I \nwas a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee then. I listened \nbehind closed doors to classified and confidential information, and I \ncouldn't put it together. I couldn't square with the information we \nreceived in the Intelligence Committee all of the dire predictions \nbeing made by President Bush, Vice President Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, \nand Donald Rumsfeld. It didn't square away.\n\n[[Page S1169]]\n\n  Where in the world were the threats they were talking about--the \nweapons of mass destruction, the nuclear weapons, the connections with \n9/11? It turned out none of them existed--not one. We found no weapons \nof mass destruction. We found no nuclear weapons. We found no \nconnection between Saddam Hussein and the terrible tragedy of 9/11. All \nof the pretenses and reasons given by this President to engage us in \nthis war, to risk American lives, and to drag us on for more than 5 \nyears in this conflict turned out to be false; all of it.\n  There is no greater deception in a democracy than for the leader to \nmislead the people of a nation into a war, to ask families to offer \ntheir children and their children's lives in service to this country \nfor reasons that turn out not to be true. No weapons of mass \ndestruction, no nuclear weapons, no connection with 9/11, and here we \nare, still bogged down, mired in this conflict.\n  It is cold comfort to know that as we sent 20,000 or 30,000 more \nsoldiers into Iraq last year that things got better. I am glad they \ndid. I have been there since then. I am glad the surge brought some \npeace to some sections of Iraq. But that wasn't the reason for the \nsurge. The surge was put in place so the Iraqis could finally take \nresponsibility for their own country, so they could make hard political \ndecisions and govern and lead and defend themselves. Here we are, \nalmost a year later, and what do we have to show for it? An Iraqi \nParliament that when we can get them to meet won't even face the \nserious issues. Time and again they fail to make the decisions they \nneed to make so their Government can govern. Time and again we find \nexcuses from them: They need a little more time. Every day they need is \nat the expense of American soldiers. Every month they take to finally \nreach a decision means that more body bags will come home to America \nand more wounded soldiers will return. So as they take their sweet time \nmaking their decisions, we are paying a heavy price as a Nation. And \nthe complaint from the other side is we have had 35 votes on this; \nhaven't we had enough? No, we haven't had enough until we change this \npolicy, until we start bringing the troops home.\n  You are going to hear a lot of things said about this Feingold \nresolution. I certainly hope that colleagues and Members will take the \ntime to read it. Here is what it says: It says our future role in Iraq \nis going to be limited. We are not going to say to the military: Do \nwhatever you like. We are going to say to our military in Iraq: Here is \nyour role. This is what you can do. This is what we will provide funds \nfor.\n  First: Conduct targeted operations, limited in duration and scope, \nagainst members of al-Qaida and affiliated terrorist organizations.\n  That is certainly something we all agree on. Al-Qaida was behind 9/\n11, not Saddam Hussein, and we should continue to target them. They \nhave used Iraq as a land of opportunity now to go in and sow their \nseeds of division and hatred, to try to kill innocent people and to \nkill American soldiers. Senator Feingold says we will continue to fight \nto eliminate al-Qaida in Iraq.\n  Second: Provide security for personnel and infrastructure of the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  That should never be in question. We should make certain our Armed \nForces are always there to protect our people and to protect important \ninstallations.\n  Third: Provide training to members of the Iraqi security forces who \nhave not been involved in sectarian violence or in attacks upon the \nU.S. Armed Forces.\n  If the Iraqis are ever going to take over defense of their own \ncountry so that we are not in Iraq for 50 years or 100 years or even \n1,000 years, as one of the Presidential candidates has said--if we are \never going to avoid that terrible outcome, the Iraqis have to stand and \nfight and defend their own country. Senator Feingold says that is one \nof the legitimate reasons we can stay in Iraq. I agree with him.\n  Fourth: To provide training, equipment, and other materials to \nmembers of the U.S. Armed Forces to ensure, maintain, or improve their \nsafety and security.\n  No argument there.\n  And finally: The resources to redeploy members of the U.S. Armed \nForces from Iraq.\n  What is missing from this? What is missing is any unilateral combat \noperation that opens a new part of this war. For 5 years we have given \nthe Iraqi people all they could ever ask for. We deposed their \ndictator, we brought the best military in the world to their country, \nwe gave them a chance to elect their own Government, write their own \nConstitution, and govern and defend themselves. What more could they \nask for? We have paid for it mightily, with almost 4,000 lives, the \nhundreds of thousands who have served, and the thousands who have come \nhome wounded, injured.\n  I will tell you, for those who think we ought to look the other way \nfor 11 months so President Bush can get out of town, they ought to go \nto these National Guard deployments and redeployments and look into the \neyes of our guardsmen and their families, their tear-filled eyes as \nthey send their soldiers off for yet another deployment.\n  We have a young man here on the Capitol Police force who works with \nmy office. He is about to face his second deployment with the Navy \nReserve. He is taking it very well, with a smile, but he is going to be \ngone for 8 months--8 months away from his family, making less money \nserving with the Navy than he makes serving as a Capitol policeman--\ntaking a pay cut because the Federal Government is too cheap to provide \nwhat private corporations do for their activated employees--and he will \nbe away from his family for another 8 months.\n  Easy for us to say: Well, it is only 11 months. There will be a new \nPresident. Maybe there will be a change. But what about those soldiers \nand sailors and marines, airmen, all of our military who are called to \nserve? That 11 months will be a lifetime away from their families, and \nduring that 11 months some of them will give their lives. That is why \nthis debate is important and why it is timely and why I am glad Senator \nFeingold has brought it before us.\n  It is unfortunate the Republican side wants to stall this debate, \nstall it for 30 hours in hopes we can drag everything out so we will \nnever quite get to the issue here on Iraq and maybe never get to the \nissue of the housing crisis in America. That is the Grand Old Party's \nbrandnew strategy: Stall, try to delay, find ways to make sure we don't \nget to the important issues. It is little wonder that the opinion of \nthe American people of this Congress is low.\n  What we should do is look to the positive side. If we change this \npolicy in Iraq, if we tell the President on a bipartisan basis that we \nhave had enough of this, that we want to see a change in mission, we \nhave a chance to change this country. We can take the resources that \nwould have been spent in Iraq and spend them in America. We can make \nsure we are providing health care, job training, and building schools, \nroads and bridges. We can create an economic stimulus in the United \nStates instead of an economic stimulus in Iraq. I think a strong \nAmerica begins at home. Wouldn't it be great if we invested our \nprecious tax revenues in that belief?\n  Let me tell you what the National Intelligence Estimate said about \nthe state of this war in Iraq. Last year, they gravely noted that:\n\n       The Iraq conflict has become the cause celebre for \n     jihadists, breeding a deep resentment of U.S. involvement in \n     the Muslim world, and cultivating supporters for the global \n     jihadist movement.\n\n  That is a quote from the National Intelligence Estimate. What it says \nis that as we battle on in Iraq and lose American lives and spend \nAmerican dollars, we are creating a magnet for the extremists around \nthe world to come and kill our troops and to be inspired in their own \nsad and devilish ways to kill other innocent people around the world. \nDid anyone bargain for that when we invaded Iraq? Did anyone think it \nwould make the war on terror more difficult to win? That is what the \nNational Intelligence Estimate tells us.\n  This administration has recklessly diverted critical military \nintelligence and civilian assets from Afghanistan in the process. That \nwas a war I voted for, without reservation--a unanimous vote in the \nSenate, just days after the attack on 9/11. We knew where that attack \ncame from. It didn't come from Saddam Hussein and Iraq, it came from \nOsama bin Laden and the Taliban, and the al-Qaida forces that were \nrunning\n\n[[Page S1170]]\n\nrampant through Afghanistan. Well, the situation in Afghanistan has \ndeteriorated because we have spent so much on human life and American \ndollars on Iraq. That is the reality of this administration's \npriorities.\n  The Taliban and al-Qaida, sadly, are regrouping in Afghanistan, and \nwe know for sure Pakistan, the neighboring country, is increasingly \nunstable. In fact, the strongest military on Earth is apparently so \noverstretched at this moment, the administration can't even find a \nhandful of transport helicopters to help the desperately needed people \nof Darfur with the U.N. peacekeeping force.\n  How long will we stand by this failed foreign policy, this disaster \nin Iraq, at such a high cost in human lives, dollars, reputation, and \nnational security? We are hearing once again that we are seeing \nprogress in Iraq. How many times have we heard this story? At least for \n5 years--from the beginning, from Vice President Cheney's rosy scenario \nof the troops being greeted with parades and arms laden with flowers to \nwelcome them to Iraq, something that unfortunately did not occur--until \nthe present time, when the so-called surge has turned everything \naround. And yet 150,000 American lives are still at risk this morning, \nthis afternoon, and this evening in Iraq.\n  The entire point of the surge was to carve out political space for \nthe Iraqi political leadership. They haven't used the time; they \nhaven't used the surge for that to happen. Does anyone honestly believe \nwe are closer to the day that the Iraqis will take responsibility for \ntheir own future? They will if this passes, because they will know our \ndays are numbered in Iraq. We are not going to be there for 25, 50, or \n1,000 years. That is not fair to our soldiers; it is not fair to \nAmerica.\n  This administration has no strategy beyond ``stay the course'' until \nJanuary 20, 2009. We in Congress have a responsibility to change \ndirection. Our responsibility is for those soldiers and their families, \nit is for those guardsmen and their families, it is for everyone \nrisking their life today in Iraq. They need to come home. And when they \ncome home, we know that we have our hands full.\n  They come home with serious problems. The suicide rate among soldiers \nis at a record high. It is even higher among Guardsmen who are \nactivated to serve. Post-traumatic stress disorders of years gone by \nintensify in the returning soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  We know those who suffered serious injuries--amputations, traumatic \nbrain injury--are going to need our help for a long time to come. This \nadministration has shortchanged the Veterans' Administration. When we \nbegged them to put in the billions of dollars necessary to keep our \npromise to these veterans and those from other wars, they said they did \nnot need it. Then, of course, they were proven wrong.\n  We continued to put billions of dollars into the Veterans' \nAdministration, and we should and we will for the future, trying to pay \nthe long-term costs of this war, a heavy cost that future generations \nwill carry. And those on the other side say: Well, let's just let this \ngo for another 11 months. Let's see how this all works out, another 11 \nmonths of returning veterans, returning wounded, another 11 months of \nmore responsibility to future generations.\n  Staying with the failed strategy is no strategy at all. Changing \ncourse in Iraq is long overdue. Quite simply, we cannot give this \nadministration another blank check because we know what they are going \nto do with it. They are going to continue this policy as we see more \nand more American soldiers in harm's way. The bill before us is \nreasonable, it is measured, it is a thoughtful effort to put before \nthis administration a new approach, a new policy, and a new direction \nin Iraq.\n  Starting to redeploy the majority of U.S. troops from Iraq within 120 \ndays is a reasonable thing to do. Certainly, many of them will stay \nthere for those specified responsibilities, but as they start to leave, \nthe Iraqis may wake up to the reality that it is their country and \ntheir responsibility. The question is no longer whether the surge, or \nmore accurately a significant escalation of troops, has worked. The \nquestion is how we can return our focus to the original al-Qaida \nthreat.\n  Sad to say, 6 years, more than 6 years after 9/11, Osama bin Laden is \nstill on the loose. He is still guiding in his way the al-Qaida forces \nthat threaten us in the rest of the world. We need to help countries \nsuch as Jordan that have been overrun with Iraqi refugees. We certainly \nhave to understand that a country that has been that friendly to the \nUnited States deserves a helping hand, and we have to start to rebuild \nour international image and reputation.\n  It is unfortunate to hear people around the world, once our friends, \nonce our allies, once our supporters, so critical of the United States \nbecause of the colossal mistake made by the Bush administration with \nthis invasion of Iraq. We have to turn that page, and we cannot wait \nuntil January 20, 2009, to do it.\n  Last year, a New York Times-CBS News poll showed that only 5 percent \nof Americans trust this President to successfully resolve the Iraq war; \n1 out of 20 Americans trust President Bush to resolve this war. Well, I \ndo not believe he will either. I would be with the 95 percent. But \nCongress has an equally important responsibility to oversee this war as \nit is fought, to do everything we can to protect our troops and to \nresolve this war so our troops can come home to the heroes, welcome \nthey richly deserve. We need to step into the leadership void that this \nWhite House has left and change directions for our policy in Iraq.\n  I am going to support this bill to bring an end to this war. I was 1 \nof 23 who voted against it. Of all of the votes that I have ever cast \nin this Congress in the House and Senate, I look back with the greatest \nassurance that was the right vote, the right vote for America. I do not \nthink anything that has transpired since that late October night in \n2002 has ever made me waiver in my belief that it was a serious mistake \nfor the United States to give to this President and this administration \nthe authority to begin this war, which has cost us so much over the \nyears.\n  I believe we have to be careful in our foreign policy. Of course, \ndefend America, that is our first responsibility. But never engage in a \nwar when we cannot understand the consequences that might follow, like \nthis war. It is so much easier to get in a war than it is to get out of \none.\n  Senator Feingold is engaging this Senate in a debate that is long \noverdue for a change in policy that is long overdue. The Republicans \nare going to stall, try to avoid the vote, try to speechify us to \ndeath, not going to face this vote or a vote on the housing crisis. But \nthat is nothing new. As the majority leader, Senator Reid has said, \nlast year 68 times they initiated a filibuster. That is a brandnew \nrecord in the Senate. Before that it was 61 filibusters in 2 years. \nThat was the record. Well, they managed 68 in 1 year.\n  It shows you what they are up to. They just want to grind us down, \nslow us down, and make us avoid the issues that count in America. One \nof those issues is ending this war the right way, and another which \nwill follow is the housing crisis which plagues our economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am a little confused. About an hour and a \nhalf ago the majority leader brought up a bill. He and the Senator from \nWisconsin had filed this bill to leave Iraq in 120 days. And he filed \ncloture on that to see whether enough Senators would agree to debate \nthe bill. So that we can start to debate it, it took 60 Senators to \nvote yes. The majority leader must have been surprised when we voted \nyes because he does not seem to want to take yes for an answer.\n  He filed the bill, wanted to debate it, and presumably have a vote on \nit. But when we agreed to debate it, he called foul and said: You are \ntrying to stall because you did not vote no so that we can move on to \nthe next bill and then the next bill which will be the economic \nstimulus package.\n  So I am confused. Maybe I should not be because almost half of the \nmembers of the majority voting voted against cloture; that is to say, \nthey voted against proceeding to the bill that the majority leader had \nfiled. Now, ordinarily members of the majority do not vote against \nthese cloture motions that the majority leader files to take\n\n[[Page S1171]]\n\nup a bill. Ordinarily, all of the members of the party vote with their \nleader on these votes.\n  I gather that the majority leader must have thought that the bill \nwould not get cloture; that is to say, that we would not start the \ndebate. Then I suppose Republicans would be accused of trying to stall, \nof not being willing to vote on the bill that he and the Senator from \nWisconsin had filed, maybe putting Republicans into a no-win situation, \ndamned if we do and damned if we do not.\n  If we agree with the majority leader and take up his bill to debate \nit, we are stalling. And if we do not agree, then I suspect we would \nhave been accused of not being willing to debate Iraq and not being \nwilling to vote on the amendments or the bill that he and the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin filed.\n  So as I say, I am confused. All Republicans did was to say: OK, you \nwanted to debate the bill that you filed. We will agree to proceed with \nthat. Now the distinguished minority whip just said Republicans are \nspeechifying this to death. Well, Republicans have spoken about 5 \nminutes out of the last hour. All of the rest of the time has been \ntaken by members of the majority party. The majority whip himself \nspoke, I think, a little over half an hour. I do not intend to take \nthat long.\n  But I think it is hard to accuse Republicans of speechifying the bill \nto death when all we did was, an hour and a half ago, agree to debate, \nand the minority leader has spoken a total of about 5 minutes. Do you \nwant a debate on Iraq or not? Now that the surge is working, it appears \nmaybe that members of the majority party are not so anxious to have \nthat debate.\n  But as Minority Leader McConnell pointed out, Republicans are willing \nto have that debate. A group of Republicans were just in Iraq over the \ncourse of the last week. Several of us have been there since the first \nof the year and have a very positive story to report about the work \nthat our troops are doing there and the effect of their efforts.\n  There is a positive report that the American people deserve to hear. \nSo I think you will see Republicans agreeing to debate the resolution. \nFor my purpose, I am perfectly happy to vote on it. But under the rule \nthat the majority leader has taken advantage of, as soon as we have had \n30 hours to debate this, then automatically we go to the next Feingold-\nReid bill.\n  That is a bill that does not have us get out of Iraq, but rather says \nwe should try to develop a strategy to deal with al-Qaida. Well, of \ncourse, the administration's first strategy, as we have discussed on \nthis floor many times, the first, best way to deal with terrorists is \nto get good intelligence on them to know what they are up to. Maybe we \ncould have prevented 9/11 had we had better intelligence. And so the \nFISA--this is the law that allows us to listen in on the communications \nof these terrorists--that bill, that law expired.\n  The President said: We are losing good intelligence. You need to act \nto reauthorize that law.\n  The Senate did. I think we had 68 votes, a bipartisan vote. We acted \nin a bipartisan way to support that. Many of our colleagues, I think it \nwas 28 or 29, voted to oppose that. Now the leadership of the House of \nRepresentatives has said: Well, let it expire. And they went on the \nbreak 12 days ago without having acted to reauthorize the so-called \nFISA law.\n  That law needs to be reauthorized. Each day that passes that it is \nnot reauthorized, we are losing intelligence. Now, what happens if \nthere is another 9/11 and we later find out that one of the reasons is \nbecause for a period of several weeks we could not listen in to what \nthose terrorists were saying? We are missing intelligence.\n  Frankly, we ought not to do anything else around here until we get \nthat law reauthorized and the President can sign it into law. But the \nmajority leader said: First, we are going to have a debate on the \nFeingold-Reid bill to get out of Iraq in 120 days. Then we need to have \na debate on developing a new strategy for dealing with al-Qaida.\n  Okay. Republicans are happy to engage in that debate, as I said. But \nto be accused by the majority of trying to stall by simply agreeing to \nthe debate that the majority requested, is not correct.\n  Moreover, nobody is trying to stall consideration of a housing bill \nor an economic stimulus package. We understand that the majority is \ngoing to be bringing such a package to the floor. We have not seen it. \nWe do not know what is in it. We are certainly not stalling it. It is \nnot here yet. The majority leader could have brought that to the floor. \nHe could have told us what is in it. He could have filed cloture on it \nso that we had the vote on whether we are going to take it up, but \ninstead he brought up the first Iraq resolution. Then that is going to \nbe automatically followed by a second resolution dealing with al-Qaida. \nThen, only after that, apparently, do we get to the economic stimulus \nor housing package.\n  So it is not Republicans who are holding it up. We have not done \nanything to hold it up. We have not even seen it yet.\n  So I think this criticism of Republicans for stalling simply because \nwe agreed with the majority leader to take up his bill and debate it is \nnot accurate, and it is not fair to Republicans.\n  Now what about the surge and this Iraq resolution? I think it is \ninteresting that the first criticism was that we had a failed policy in \nIraq. So when General Petraeus developed a new policy, the surge \npolicy, which began to work, the debate suddenly began to shift. Now \nthat it is very clear the surge has worked it is shifting even more. It \nis shifting now to, well, OK, maybe the surge is working, but the Iraqi \nGovernment needs to do more.\n\n  Well, the Iraqi Government is now doing a lot more, too, as we will \nhear. But I suspect nothing is going to be good enough for those who \nwant to get out of Iraq now because, as the majority whip has pointed \nout, we really need to improve America's image abroad. And there a lot \nof people who disagree with us, so that is one of the reasons we need \nto get out of Iraq.\n  But he also said--how many times--that we are doing better in Iraq. \nWell, I do not know how many times, but certainly since General \nPetraeus reported to the Congress, and every week thereafter, there has \nbeen improvement. And all we have to do is listen to our colleagues who \nhave been there recently to see this reported progress in Iraq.\n  I do not know why people are so afraid of good news when you are \nwinning in a war. Why is that not a good thing? Why are you not proud \nof that? Why do you not say: That is great; let's finish the job.\n  I suspect if you ask the majority of our troops: Now that you have \ngot your boot right on the neck of these enemy terrorists, do you think \nwe ought to let it up and walk away or do you think we ought to finish \nthe job? My guess is they would all say: Let's finish the job or you \nall back in Washington let us finish the job. Do not pull the plug on \nus so that we have to leave Iraq before we finish the job.\n  It is interesting there is now a new argument: OK, maybe the surge is \nworking. Maybe the Iraqi Government is going to be taking the action we \nasked them to do. And, in fact, they have. They are now taking action \non the so-called reconciliation there on local elections and the like.\n  But now the argument is, well, we could actually spend this money on \nother things. Of course, you can always spend money on other things. \nWhen you are in a war, however, it is a little different. You cannot \njust pull the plug and say we would rather spend the money on housing \nor transportation or education than we would on the war. You do not \nhave that option. You cannot just pick up stakes and leave because you \nhave to consider the cost of what you leave behind.\n  Most of the experts who have talked about this have made it crystal \nclear if we decide we want to leave because we would rather spend the \nmoney on something else, the ultimate cost would be far greater than if \nwe finished the job. Because by most estimates, the situation would \ndeteriorate. Al-Qaida would reinfiltrate, and the other enemies of the \nIraqi people would create more problems. The next thing you know, we \nwould have to come back in and try to clean up the mess that was \ncreated because we left prematurely. The bottom line is, the cost of \nleaving prematurely would be far greater than the cost of finishing the \njob once and\n\n[[Page S1172]]\n\nfor all. It is also difficult to put a price on our national security, \nespecially because of those young men and women who have given the \nultimate sacrifice. We owe it to them to ensure that what they have \ndone, the sacrifice they have made, is not going to be wasted, is not \ngoing to be lost because we were too anxious to get out of there to \nspend money on something else. That is not good policy. It is not the \nway to win a war. It is certainly not the way to beat the terrorists.\n\n  The final point the majority whip made was we should return to the \noriginal al-Qaida threat. I get back to the point I made before. If you \nwant to return to the original al-Qaida threat, there is no better way \nthan, A, to finish the job in Iraq where we have al-Qaida on the run--\nthey are essentially defeated; let's don't let them rise back up \nagain--and B, pass the FISA legislation, the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, which allows us to collect intelligence on these \nterrorists abroad. Again, we did that in the Senate, though many on the \nother side--28--voted against it.\n  The House of Representatives leadership has an obligation to try to \nget this done. Therefore, I call upon the Democratic House leadership \nto bring up the bill the Senate passed and see if it will pass the \nHouse of Representatives. I suspect the reason it has not been brought \nup is because they know it would pass. That is a bill the President \nwould sign. Why wouldn't that be a good thing? That is the appropriate \nway to move forward.\n  Let me try to summarize. Republicans have put us into a stall, our \nDemocratic friends say, because we agreed to debate the bill they \nwanted us to debate. They expected us to say no, that we wouldn't \ndebate it. Then we would have been accused of trying to avoid debate. \nBut we agreed. We will have the debate. It is only 30 hours. That is \nhardly enough time for all of my colleagues to be able to say the \nthings they want to say, if we have half of that time, but nonetheless \nwe will try to give the report of the truth of what is happening in \nIraq. The American people will be better off for that. So I am glad we \nagreed with the majority leader to proceed to the debate on this bill. \nI suspect we will want to do the same thing on the next bill.\n  If and when the Democratic majority puts together an economic \nstimulus package, then we can take a look at that and see whether we \nwant to debate that as well. But, again, our first priority ought to be \nto get the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act passed because every \nday that goes by that that law is not in effect, we jeopardize our \nnational security. We jeopardize our ability to collect intelligence on \nal-Qaida and other terrorists, and we put the lives of Americans at \nrisk. That is unacceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each Senator may speak up to 1 hour.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I came to the floor to speak in \nsupport of the Feingold amendment. I came purposely to talk about that \nissue, but I am compelled, having heard some of the remarks made by \nsome of our colleagues, to first preface my remarks as it relates to \nthis debate.\n  Yes, we are happy to have a debate, but it doesn't take 30 hours to \ncome to the same conclusion the American people have clearly come to in \nthis country: that continual engagement in the war in Iraq and the \ncourse we are on is not in the national interests of the United States. \nThey have come through the common sense Americans always show. This is \noverwhelmingly the conclusion of a great majority of Americans. They \nunderstand. It doesn't take us 30 hours to do that. We can have an \nopen, honest, and intelligent debate with a few Members on each side \nmaking the case for their respective points of view, but we don't have \nto take 30 hours in order to get to that goal so that we can move to \nthe other important business of the Senate.\n  This is important business. It deserves a thorough debate. But, by \nthe same token, it is clear that the whole process of objecting to the \nmajority leader's effort to limit the scope of time so that we can have \na robust debate but then go on to the other business before the Senate \nis to extend the time, is to delay us.\n  We have seen through a record number of filibusters the Republican \nminority has used in this Chamber in a way that defies all historic \nproportions. It is clear that what was intended to be used as a rare \noccasion to protect the rights of the minority, particularly on \nexceptional critical issues of the time, has now been abused in such a \nway in which it is intended to stall the work of the Senate but, more \nimportantly, the work of the American people. That is the framework in \nwhich we start this debate. We can have a robust debate, but we don't \nneed 30 hours to accomplish it.\n  Secondly, I cannot understand how some Members can come to the floor \nof the Senate and rail against the fact that the foreign intelligence \nsurveillance bill has not been passed by the House of Representatives \nwhen they refused to agree to a 21-day extension of the existing law \nthat gives the administration everything they want to do. So if this is \nsuch a critical issue, as has been described by Members of the \nRepublican side of the aisle, why would they not have agreed to \ncontinue while the Congress debated the opportunity to extend the law \nthat allows you to do all those things you say are critical to the \nprotection of the American people?\n  I can only come to the conclusion that either it is not as critical \nas they define, because fear is what we sell, it seems, on the \nRepublican side--we have been hearing fear for quite some time; the \nAmerican people have caught up to that--or, in fact, they simply want \nto have the proposition for a political purpose. If not, we would have \nhad the 21-day extension. Everything the administration claims they \nneeded, they would have had, and therefore we would have been able to \nmove forward. Those two items need to be put in context.\n  Let me get to the main purpose of what I came to the floor to speak \nabout, and that is in support of the Feingold amendment.\n  The Senate has an opportunity, once again, to vote to transition our \ntroops out of Iraq with honor and refocus our efforts on defeating al-\nQaida. It is long past time for us to make that decision. The \nadministration has never told us the truth about the war in Iraq. Some \npeople want to gloss over that. But if what is past is prologue, then \nwe need to be worried about what we constantly hear.\n\n  The budget they submitted to Congress is the latest proof of that. \nThe budget is terrible in a lot of ways. It leaves millions of children \nwithout full access to health care. It fails to wean us off our \naddiction to foreign oil. It fails to adequately address climate \nchange. It fails to repair our education system or shrink the \nballooning deficit. Basically, it fails to make a serious effort to \ntackle the most pressing problems average Americans face in their lives \neach and every day.\n  Beyond that, the budget is dishonest about the cost of one of the \nmost expensive wars in our history, a war that has lasted more than \nAmerica's engagement in World War II. It lists the cost of the war in \nIraq for next year at $70 billion. All the other calculations in the \nbudget, including the debt and the deficit, in some way assume that $70 \nbillion is all the war is going to cost in the next fiscal year. We \nhave to wonder if whoever wrote the section of the budget on Iraq found \ntheir job after leaving their old post at the accounting department of \nEnron because it is clearly the same type of accounting.\n  Recently, the Secretary of Defense took a baby step toward honesty \nand estimated the true cost for next year at another $170 billion of \nAmerica's money. He said that was just a rough estimate, because when \nyou have already spent more than a half trillion dollars, I guess you \njust round up to the nearest hundred billion. This is from an \nadministration that over 5 years of a historical engagement in Iraq \nknows how many troops we have, knows the projection moving forward, and \ntherefore knows what the consequences in terms of cost are. To send a \nbudget to the Congress that everyone knows in the context of the cost \nin Iraq is a farce, this type of carelessness--if one can call it \ncarelessness--in accounting is offensive to the American people who are \nfunding the war.\n  This administration is so dead set on staying in Iraq. I know some \nPresidential candidates have suggested that\n\n[[Page S1173]]\n\nwe will do so for 100 years, if necessary. They just don't seem to care \nhow much tax money they spend. They don't seem to care how much money \nthey have to borrow from the Chinese to pay the bills, because we don't \npay for this in terms of how we are going to afford the war. We don't \ndomestically decide, well, this is going to be offset by some either \nrevenue stream or cuts in programs. No, under this administration, we \njust keep adding it to the next generation--more debt, more debt. They \ndon't seem to care how much wind gets knocked out of our economy \nbecause the money could have gone to creating jobs, stimulating the \nproduction of green energy, or helping families make ends meet.\n  As a matter of fact, we could use that money to do something that is \ncritically important as well--protect America here on domestic soil. \nBecause as we look at the President's budget, what does it do? It \neliminates COPS funding that put 100,000 police officers on the streets \nof the cities. It cuts homeland security grants to States by 70 \npercent. It cuts port security by half. It cuts infrastructure security \nby half. This at a time in which every report, including those of the \nadministration, has al-Qaida reconstituted on the Pakistan-Afghanistan \nborder, and reports are coming out that they have been reconstituted \nwith the strength and the ability to perform another attack on the \nUnited States.\n  The terrorists have to only get lucky once. We have to be right 100 \npercent of the time. How can you achieve those goals when you eliminate \nthe very essence of the funding for those who, as we learned on \nSeptember 11, came to respond on that fateful day? It wasn't the \nFederal Government, it was local police and firefighters and emergency \nmanagement and hospital personnel. That is who came. What does this \nbudget do? It slashes the living daylights out of those very first \nresponders who are critical to our domestic security.\n  What does it do about one of the gaping wounds we have in the country \nin terms of security? It slashes port security. Everybody who comes to \nthe Capitol has to go through a security device, 100 percent. Everybody \nwho goes to the White House has to go through a security device, 100 \npercent. But when we talk about cargo coming from all over the world, \nonly 5 percent has to go through the scanning process. Yet we are going \nto cut port security by 50 percent.\n\n  Mass transit: The Congress spoke in the last session and put mass \ntransit up there, understanding we saw what happened in Madrid and \nMumbai and other places in the world. Yet the President cuts mass \ntransit security by 56 percent.\n  So to those who argue we cannot talk about the consequences of our \nengagement in Iraq in a financial context here at home, well, in the \ncontext of security here at home, at a time of a regrouping and \nrestrengthening of al-Qaida on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, with \nthe ability to ultimately commit terrorism domestically in the United \nStates, yes, there is a real causal connection and a real consequence \nand we have to include that as part of the debate and part of the \nconsequences in our continuing engagement in Iraq in an open-ended way.\n  Now, with what we heard the Secretary of Defense talk about with the \namount of money the Secretary of Defense thinks we might spend in Iraq \nnext year, in a different context we could have more than doubled our \npackage to stimulate the economy this year. When Americans get rebate \nchecks in a month or so, they should imagine them more than twice as \nbig because that is what this year in Iraq would cost.\n  If we want to imagine the total financial cost of the war in Iraq \nover almost 5 years, if we want to imagine what $608 billion means, we \ncould divide that up and send every American a check for $2,000.\n  If we want to know what the war will cost over the next decade if we \ncontinue the course we are on, that is about $2.8 trillion. Every \nAmerican should picture a check for more than $9,000. That is what the \nwar costs: more than $9,000 for every man, woman, and child living in \nthe United States of America. If there are four people in your family, \nthat is $36,000 that potentially could have been put in your family's \neconomy.\n  When so many hard-working families are struggling to keep their \nhomes, and so many are struggling to help keep up with the rising cost \nof health care and college tuition and heating oil, when so many have \nto care for aging parents, put food on the table, and struggle to make \nends meet each month, $36,000 would go a long way. So it is a different \nway of looking at it.\n  There are many different ways of looking at the costs of the war. So \nhere is how it all adds up. We cannot think about economic stimulus \nwithout thinking about how we can stimulate peace. We cannot heal our \neconomy without closing the financial hemorrhage that is the war in \nIraq. It seems to me that in addition to those financial contexts, \nthere is the whole question of security--the security I talked about in \na domestic capacity; the security challenges we have by overextending \nour troops in such a way in which all of our military leadership speaks \nabout the challenges we would have if we had to meet another security \nchallenge in the world; and basically an understanding that, God \nforbid, we had another security challenge, while we are still engaged \nin Iraq in the way in which we are engaged, while we have a resurgence \nin Afghanistan of the Taliban, with some of the latest reports talking \nabout some very fierce fighting and the lack of response by NATO and a \npumping up of our troops there; and looking at that scenario and now \nlooking at the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, where al-Qaida has \nreconstituted. And that is, God forbid, if anything else happens in the \nworld.\n  That is our challenge, in a security context, if we continue the \ncourse: a challenge that those who have the military prowess tell us we \ncannot meet if we continue in this way.\n  For 5 years, the administration has parroted the line that: ``We're \nfighting them over there so we don't have to fight them here.'' But now \nmore than ever we realize that one of the biggest impacts of the war \nhas been we are spending our money over there and, therefore, we cannot \nspend it here--money that includes billions of dollars that have been \nmisspent, including hundreds of millions of dollars in reconstruction \nprojects that are unaccounted for.\n  I came back from Iraq about a month ago. I must say, when I see \nschools going wanting here in America, when I see hospitals closing in \nmy home State, when I see roads that have deteriorated, bridges that \nhave fallen, and see reconstruction in Iraq but no construction here at \nhome, those are real consequences of the war.\n  When I see us talk about the genocide in Darfur, and we are \nuniversally committed to the proposition ``never again,'' ``never \nagain,'' what does ``never again'' mean? That we will not repeat the \nlegacies of the past, the failures of the past: in the Holocaust, in \nRwanda, in the Armenian Genocide. No, no, we will act. Yet because of \nour present security challenges, and the consequences of being engaged \nin Iraq in the way we are, we stand by and watch people in Darfur be \nslaughtered. So much for ``never again.''\n  Not long ago, about a month ago, I had the chance to make a trip to \nIraq myself. First and foremost, the trip proved something I believed \nfor a long time: We should be incredibly proud of the men and women who \nwear the uniform of the United States and who are serving there. They \ndo not ask whether this is the right or wrong mission. They just serve \nwith honor and integrity, and they risk their lives every day.\n\n  I came away extremely impressed with their commitment, and I felt \nhonored to be able to share some time with them, including many from my \nhome State of New Jersey who are serving there. So we need to give them \na mission worthy of their sacrifice. I believe that is what Senator \nFeingold's amendment does.\n  Beyond that, one other thing became very clear to me. The solutions \nto Iraq's problems lie in the hands of the Iraqis. We cannot achieve \npeace, we cannot achieve reconciliation, we cannot achieve power \nsharing, we cannot get Sunni, Shia, and Kurd to sit side by side at the \npoint of a military gun.\n  As long as we continue to, in essence, be enablers of an Iraqi \nleadership that has become so dependent on the United\n\n[[Page S1174]]\n\nStates and refuses to meet the challenges of the hard choices, \ncompromises, and negotiations necessary for their Government to \nultimately achieve, they will never, ever feel the urgency of now.\n  When the President sent 30,000 additional troops into harm's way in \nIraq last year, the purpose--his purpose, his stated purpose; not my \nview of it, his stated purpose--his stated purpose was to allow Iraqis \nto have the opportunity and the space, the environment, to strengthen \nthe Federal Government and achieve national reconciliation.\n  That, no matter how we try to paint it, has not been accomplished. \nEven our own benchmarks, that even the administration agreed to and the \nIraqis agreed to, have largely not been accomplished. So to use a \nsports analogy, we keep changing the goalposts every time, further and \nfurther away from the obligations the Iraqi leadership has.\n  Not too long ago, Iraq's Parliament finally passed three laws, after \nmonths of bitter squabbling. We certainly should applaud them for that. \nBut the Bush administration is touting this event as an end-all, be-all \npolitical breakthrough. But, as usual, they are taking a small bit of \ngood news and trying to whitewash the bigger picture.\n  The agreement the Iraqi Parliament reached is basically temporary. \nThe provincial powers arrangement is set to expire--guess what--in 1 \nyear--what they passed has an expiration in 1 year--to hold the \npoliticians over so they can have the same arguments all over again \nnext year.\n  Iraqi politicians are still a long way from permanent agreements over \nfundamental issues because they do not have the pressures of the \nnecessity to do so. The reason is, as long as we continue to insist in \nan open-ended presence in the lives of Americans and the national \ntreasure of the United States, they will not make the hard choices and \ncompromises necessary to achieve lasting stability.\n  When I went to Iraq and met with a lot of the Iraqi elected \nleadership and some of the tribal chiefs and whatnot, I was stunned \nthat they kept telling me about what America needed to do. My response \nto them was: Iraq's future is in your hands, not in America's hands. \nYou must make these decisions for your country.\n  I know we have heard a lot about the surge, and certainly it depends \non what your measurement is. If you are talking about greater security \nin Baghdad, the answer is, yes, yes; no question--although Baghdad has \nbecome far more segregated as a city, so that one of the ways in which \nsecurity has been achieved is that we segregate Sunnis and Shias into \ndifferent parts of Baghdad's neighborhood. Maybe that is the cost.\n  But when I landed, I was supposed to go to Mosul. I was not able to \ngo to Mosul because they could not guarantee my protection. We have \nmillions of displaced Iraqis who are beginning to come back. And now \nthey come back to neighborhoods and to homes where the person living \nthere is--not only has their home been taken over, but they are not \neven from their same sect. So they feel they cannot go live there.\n  I asked: How are you ready to take on the displacement of several \nmillion of your country people coming back to the country? They have no \nreal plan. We have 80,000 or so concerned local citizens, individuals \nwho at one time fought us and have decided to join us but who are on \nthe payroll--we pay them every week to be there--and their expectation \nis they are going to be integrated either into the security forces or \nget some type of employment. We do not have from the Iraqis a clear \nsense of how they are going to meet that challenge. These are 80,000 \nindividuals who have weapons on them.\n  So when we hear about the surge, let's not forget what President Bush \nsaid was the purpose. It was to create the space and environment \nnecessary for the opportunity for Iraqi leadership to make the hard \nchoices, compromises, and negotiations, to pass the benchmarks we had \npassed and the Iraqis agreed to. That has failed. That has failed.\n  About security: Yes, we have created greater security in Baghdad. We \nalso have created greater segregation in Baghdad. And we have pushed \nthe challenges elsewhere in the country.\n  At Combat Post X-Ray outside of Baghdad, I met with troops from New \nJersey serving in the Air Force. An IED had just killed one of their \ncolleagues and wounded several others.\n  The hardest thing I have had to do in 33 years of public life is to \ncall a family and give them my condolences because a loved one has been \nkilled. It is the hardest thing I have had to do in public life. It is \nhard enough for a parent or a wife or a husband or a mother or a father \nto hear that when they believe their family member was fighting for \nfreedom and for our security. It is incomprehensible when that death \nwas about Iraqi politicians fighting for resources and power.\n  When General Petraeus was here last year and came before the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, he said in his testimony that what we have \nin Iraq going on is a fight over power and resources.\n  I do not think Americans believe that sending their sons and \ndaughters into harm's way so Iraqis can fight over power and resources \nis a mission worthy of their sacrifice. There is no military solution \nin Iraq. Everyone, including General Petraeus, has admitted that.\n  The only way to pressure Iraqi politicians into making the choices \nnecessary to move their country forward is to stop signing blank checks \nand to set a timetable to transition our troops back home. That is, in \nessence, what my colleague, Senator Feingold, does. He creates a \ntransition, effective 120 days after this law is passed and signed by \nthe President. But that still permits us to meet critical missions, to \nconduct targeted operations against members of al-Qaida, the real \nthreat to the United States, and affiliated international terrorist \norganizations; to provide the security for our own personnel and the \ninfrastructure of the U.S. Government; to provide training to members \nof the Iraqi security forces who have not been involved in sectarian \nviolence or in attacks upon the U.S. Armed Forces so that we can ensure \nthat they can ultimately be able to stand up for their own country as \nour major focus; and to provide training, equipment, or other materiel \nto members of the U.S. Armed Forces to ensure, maintain, or improve \ntheir safety and security while redeploying members of the U.S. Armed \nForces.\n\n  That, in my mind, is ultimately an opportunity to transition with \nhonor; focus our mission on whom we need to--al-Qaida; strengthen the \nIraqi security forces to meet their own challenge; and send a message \nto the Iraqi leadership that you must do what you have failed to do. \nThe opportunity has been given to you. We cannot continue an open check \nin terms of national treasure or a continuing loss of American lives.\n  Finally, I felt truly blessed to step onto American soil after flying \nback from Iraq. Too many American men and women over there do not have \nthe option right now of taking that return flight, and too many \nAmericans have not returned, and others may not as well. I have seen \nfirsthand how bravely our troops have served, but let's be clear about \nthat service: American troops cannot be waiting for Iraqis forever to \nmake the choices necessary to achieve success in their country. They \ncannot be asked to serve up a functional society on a platter. They \ncannot be expected to be the only ones serving up a functional electric \ngrid, sewer systems, or revenue-sharing agreements about oil. As the \nformer Chief of Staff said, we need the Iraqis to love their children \nmore than they hate their neighbors. That is a powerful truism, but \nthat does not come at the point of a gun.\n  If Iraqi politicians think they can sit back and keep looking at the \nmenu of options and squabble over the choices no matter what, Americans \nwill keep delivering everything they order; they will keep picking up \nthe tab, they will never feel the pressing urgency to build a \nfunctional country for themselves. It is time for that type of service \nto end. It is time for every American soldier to have the most \nwonderful privilege we as Senators have had who have visited Iraq: the \nprivilege of booking a return home ticket.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I rise for just a few minutes. I know \nthe distinguished Senator from Michigan\n\n[[Page S1175]]\n\nwants to speak, and I will not be long, but I feel compelled to come to \nthe floor today to speak about S. 2634, to require a report back to the \npeople of the United States and to the Congress on our country's plan \nto address al-Qaida and its affiliates on a worldwide basis. It is very \ndisappointing to me that we would put something on the floor like that \nwhen, in fact, it is those who have objected to the plan we have who \nare causing all of the problems we are experiencing today. I wish to go \nthrough it for a moment because there is a plan.\n  Nine days after 9/11, when the United States of America was attacked \nand New York City was attacked and the world saw the evil of al-Qaida \nand the evil of terrorism, the President of the United States went to \nthe floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, and he made a speech in \nwhich he declared a change in U.S. policy--a change from one of \nreaction to one of preemption.\n  So, first of all, we don't need a 60-day report back to the people of \nthe United States on what our policy is. Our policy is one of \npreemption. Now, if you want to argue whether that is right or wrong, \nit is fine with me, but don't pretend as though we don't have a plan.\n  Secondly, in terms of preemption, it is a proposition where you don't \nwant to see what happened on 9/11 happen again, so you are proactive \nrather than reactive. We were attacked as a country in the late 1990s \nand early 2000 seven different times in which we reacted after the \nfact. In most cases, those reactions were benign. In one case, we sent \none missile into an aspirin factory, but it was too late for the \ndiplomats who had died, for the soldiers and sailors on the Cole who \nhad died, and for others who had died tragically under terrorist \nattack.\n  So, first and foremost, I would submit that we have a policy called \npreemption.\n  Thirdly, I would submit it has been a pretty good policy because \nsince the President of the United States established it in that speech \non the floor of the House in September of 2001, there has not been a \nsingle executed attack on the United States of America on our homeland. \nI think that is pretty good evidence that we have a plan, and a plan \nthat is working in the interest of the safety of the American people.\n  Fourth, recommendations regarding the distribution and deployment of \nU.S. military, intelligence, diplomatic, and other assets to meet the \nrelative regional and country-specific threats described in paragraph \n1. The people who want to pass this bill are the very people who 2 \nweeks ago would not allow us, in the House of Representatives, to \nextend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Here we are asking \nwhat our plan is going to be. Yet people are voting against the United \nStates having the intelligence to conduct the worldwide program against \nal-Qaida and its affiliates. You just can't have it both ways.\n  I respect anybody being opposed to our deployment in Iraq. I respect \nanybody's opinion in this body--or any other body, for that matter--on \nthe policy of the United States. But do not on the one hand assume we \nhave no policy and then on the other hand vote against every meaningful \ncontribution to the policy we do have, and the absolute prima facie \nevidence of that is FISA. Go look at the votes in the Senate on who \nvoted against the extension of FISA, and you will find the same people \nwho are supporting and furthering S. 2634. It is on its face patently \nunacceptable.\n\n  Lastly, it requires recommendations to ensure that the global \ndeployment of the U.S. military of personnel and equipment best meets \nthreats identified and described in paragraph 1; and, A, doesn't \nundermine the military readiness; B, requires the deployment of Reserve \nunits more than twice, once every 4 years; and C, requires further \nextension of deployments of members of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  Let me interpret what that means. In 60 days, they want us to report \nto our enemies exactly what our military deployments are going to be in \nthe future. One thing you don't do when your sons and daughters are \nengaged in harm's way around the world is tell your enemy what your \ngame plan is. Sure, you should have one, and it should be one we all \nlisten to on the fourth floor in our secured briefing rooms, but don't \nrequire it to be advertised to the world.\n  We live in the greatest, freest, most liberty-loving country in the \nworld. We fight in this body every day to protect the Bill of Rights. \nBut we have to recognize something: The terrorists don't want what we \nhave. They don't want us to have what we have. They don't want us to \nhave a first amendment to protect speech or for me to be able to stand \nup here and express myself. They don't want a law-abiding citizen to be \nable to carry a firearm or own a firearm. They don't want you to be \nable to worship on Sunday or worship on Friday or worship on Saturday \nor worship five times a day if you are a Muslim. They want to be able \nto dictate how you worship and whom you worship. We have to remember \nthat, as we talk about the individual liberties and freedom we protect, \nthose are the very liberties al-Qaida and its affiliates, as this bill \nportends, want to take away from us. The last thing we want to do is \npass legislation requiring us to give them our game plan.\n  I welcome debate on these issues anytime we want to come to the \nfloor. I take pride in the accomplishments of the young men and women \nwho stand today in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and in other places around the \nworld furthering the interests of the United States of America and \nprotecting us against al-Qaida and its operatives. We have a policy, \nand it is called preemption. We have a plan, and it is our plan, and it \ndoesn't need to be advertised to them. Most importantly of all, we have \nthe finest men and women in the world executing that plan today around \nthe world on behalf of the people of the United States of America. But \nlet's not require disclosure of our plan, and let's not pretend we \ndon't have a way to attack al-Qaida and its affiliates. We do. It is \ncalled preemption. As of yet, they haven't hit us on our territory, in \nour country since the day we established that as the policy of the \nUnited States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, will the Senator from Georgia yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Absolutely.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I wish to ask the Senator through the Chair--he \nindicated that our strategy vis-a-vis al-Qaida after 9/11 has to do \nwith the doctrine of preemption. I am intrigued by that. I know that \nwas a justification for going into Iraq, but I wonder if the Senator \ncould explain how the doctrine of preemption is going to help us \nagainst an organization that is existing in some 80 countries in the \nworld. Are we going to invade and preempt 80 different nations?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, after seeing what al-Qaida wants to do \nto us and has done to us, I don't think we should minimize what the \neffort might be that we have to take.\n  I say to the Senator from Wisconsin, it is one of preemption, and the \nNo. 1 way to preempt is to know in advance what the enemy is going to \ndo, and the No. 1 way to do that is to be able to surveil known \nenemies. That is why we have the FISA bill. You can preempt when you \nhave the knowledge. If you don't have the knowledge and you strip your \nintelligence agency of the business, yes, they are going to grow in 80 \ncountries, and yes, they are going to hit us. So we have a policy of \npreemption. The best way to preempt is to have good intelligence, and \nthe best way to get their attention is to let them realize we will go \nafter them wherever they are as long as they declare war on the United \nStates of America.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. So you are not referring here to the doctrine of \npreemption to use as a justification for invading Iraq; you are talking \nabout the need for intelligence, is that correct?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The President of the United States--I believe it was 9 \ndays after 9/11--announced the change of U.S. policy to be one of \npreemption. That is what I addressed in my remarks. The FISA reference \nI made was to say that I found it a little unusual for the people who \nwere supporting the bill of the Senator from Wisconsin--whom I \ncompletely respect--to be most of the same people who voted against us \nhaving the intelligence to be able to preempt them. And then to have a \nbill that portends we don't have a policy? I just didn't think it made \ngood sense.\n\n[[Page S1176]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, if the Senator will further yield for \na question, I understand what he is saying in terms of the need for \nintelligence, but the doctrine of preemption that was announced by the \nPresident 9 days after 9/11 and through that period was not about \nintelligence. It had to do with the notion of where we could intervene \nin various nations. So I am just a little bit confused about that and \ntrying to understand the connection.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, responding through the Chair, I \nappreciate the clarification. My point is you can't intervene if you \ndon't know where it is going to happen.\n  Let me just make a point, if I can. I live in the great State of \nGeorgia, and I live in a suburb of Atlanta. There will be a trial in \nApril of two students at Georgia Institute of Technology--Georgia Tech. \nBecause of the PATRIOT Act and the FISA law, our intelligence agencies \ntracked communications from Islamabad, Pakistan, into Atlanta, GA, to \nthe library at Georgia Tech to two students, Islamic students who were \nthen communicating to Toronto, Canada, to establish a cell in Atlanta. \nDays before they were to activate the plan of that cell, our \nauthorities moved in and put them under arrest, and they are going to \ntrial. The cell was never activated. No lives were lost. That is how \nyou preempt. You preempt through intelligence, you preempt from knowing \nwhat the enemy is going to do before they do it, and you preempt by \nhaving the strong intelligence and military forces to make it work.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator responding to \nme. I will simply say that I virtually agree with that general \nproposition that we need to be able to have the information and we need \nto stop terrorist attacks, and I am glad we were able to do it in \nGeorgia.\n  But the fact is, al-Qaida is operating in 80 countries around the \nworld, and because of putting so much focus on Iraq, including so much \nfocus of our intelligence system in Iraq, we don't have the adequate \nresources to preempt terrorist attacks throughout the world. That is \nthe very problem. There are terrorist attacks going on in places such \nas Algeria and Morocco and Afghanistan and Southeast Asia, and because \nwe are so consumed with Iraq, we can't pursue the very notion of \npreempting the terrorist attacks to which the Senator from Georgia \nproperly refers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, first let me indicate that as my \ncolleagues were speaking a moment ago, I think it is incredibly \nimportant to understand that, in fact, we are talking about a threat in \n80 countries, and we do have a FISA law that, in fact, has worked, and \nno one is suggesting we do not have the need for strong intelligence \nand support for our intelligence operations. In fact, that is what all \nof us are willing to see happen. But what we are talking about in this \nresolution is whether we are going to continue to keep our focus on a \ncountry that is now in the middle of a civil war or whether we are \ngoing to redirect our efforts to address our real threats not only \nabroad but threats at home.\n  When we talk about the threats to our families, I would suggest that \nif we are now spending somewhere around $15 billion a month, some say, \nthat when we look at what could be done here at home to address the \nvery real threats of job loss, people losing their homes, children \nwalking into schools that are crumbling, the lack of health care, those \nare also very important threats.\n  So we certainly want to make sure we are safe and address those \nthreats abroad, but, more broadly, we have many threats affecting our \nfamilies right now, and they expect us to use the very best judgment to \nkeep them safe both from threats outside our country as well as from \nthreats at home, including a huge economic cloud over many families.\n  Madam President, I rise today to lend my strong voice of support for \nthe Feingold legislation to provide the safe redeployment of U.S. \ntroops from Iraq, and to refocus us on, in fact, those things that are \nthreats to our country and to the families of this country. Tonight, \n591 members of the Michigan National Guard will bed down after a long \nday of working and fighting and facing danger at every turn in the \nharshest physical conditions imaginable. For every single one of these \nmen and women, a family will go to sleep in Michigan tonight worried \nthat their son or daughter, father or mother, sister or brother won't \nmake it home.\n  The true cost of this war cannot be measured in dollars and cents. \nThe real cost is measured in the sacrifices of our brave men and women \nand their families every day. This cost is more than just the \npossibility and the reality of physical danger. This cost includes the \nsacrifices that every single American family makes by being apart from \neach other time and time again. It isn't right what is happening; it \nisn't fair; it isn't safe. It isn't making us safer as a country, and \nwe need to change this policy.\n  That is why I am so grateful that, once again, Senator Reid has made \nit a priority for us to focus on the war in Iraq and what is happening \nto troops and families and people here at home, and the cost of the \nlost opportunity by spending upwards of $15 billion a month now in \nIraq.\n  Tonight 591 Guard members in Iraq, with 591 families at home, 591 \nwill have missed birthdays, missed Father's Days and Mother's Days, \nmissed high school graduations and children's first steps or \nanniversaries or family funerals or holidays; 591 will have missed \npaychecks, sidetracked careers, with small businesses and farms put in \neconomic danger; 591 lives that will never be the same; 591 sets of \nmissed opportunities that will never be replaced. And these members of \nthe Michigan National Guard make up only a fraction of the 160,000 men \nand women in uniform currently serving bravely and honorably in Iraq, \nor the countless others who have served.\n  In too many cases, these men and women are back in Iraq for their \nsecond, third, or fourth redeployment. In addition to the 591 who are \nalready deployed, there are about 1,000 members of the Michigan \nNational Guard who have been mobilized and who will deploy this year. \nMany of them will be doing their second, third, or fourth deployment to \na combat zone. This year alone, there will be a thousand more missed \npaychecks, a thousand more missed birthdays and holidays and special \noccasions, and a thousand more lives that will never be the same.\n  Our fighting men and women are the greatest single resource our \nmilitary has, and this Government is abusing that resource. America \nputs our trust in our military to defend us. When our sons and \ndaughters join the military, they are putting their trust in us to give \nthem the tools, the resources they need, and to treat them with the \nrespect they have earned. The current administration policies on \nredeployment have violated that trust. Those policies have let our \ntroops down. Once again, I am proud to join with my colleague from \nWisconsin in saying: Enough is enough when it comes to placing our \narmed services in harm's way by stretching them to the breaking point \nwith redeployment after redeployment. Enough is enough when it comes to \nbeing in the middle of a civil war. And enough is enough when it comes \nto this administration taking its eye off the ball on the war on \nterror.\n  We are all aware of the worsening situation in Afghanistan. However, \nthis administration continues to focus on a civil war in Iraq. Our \nArmed Forces have traveled a tough road since we invaded Iraq. They \nhave shouldered a heavy burden with pride, with confidence, and with \nhonor. We have asked extraordinary things from them at every turn, and \nat every turn they have delivered. They have done us all proud. They \nhave faced tough situations and have done their duty. Now we need to do \nwhat is right for them. It is time to face the tough situations. It is \ntime to make the hard choices, to make them proud of us, and it is time \nto remove them from the civil war in Iraq, to change course, and to \nrefocus, as this bill does, and redistribute our resources to those \nareas that truly address the threats facing our families and our \ncountry.\n  America's soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are always there \nwhen we call on them. The question is: Will we be there for them? What \nthis legislation proposes is as simple as it is right. It requires our \nforces in Iraq to target\n\n[[Page S1177]]\n\noperations against al-Qaida and other international terrorist groups.\n  Why is this important? Because al-Qaida has declared war against us. \nWe know that. The people in Iraq are in the middle of a civil war that \nis something they now have to address and come to terms with and bring \ntheir own resources to address. So while our troops are in Iraq, they \nshould be targeting those who have said they wished to do harm to us.\n  Also, our troops in Iraq would be required to focus on providing \nsecurity for U.S. personnel, of course, and that is extremely necessary \nin order to bring them home safely. I understand the Iraqi security \nforces are still developing, still learning, as I have met with them in \ntraveling to Iraq. We have heard certainly of the continual need to \ntrain, the need for them to continue to develop, and we know we have a \nrole in supporting that, and this bill recognizes that fact. It would \nallow our troops to continue to train Iraqi security forces, but only \nif our troops are training the Iraqis who have not been involved in the \nsectarian violence or attacks against our troops.\n\n  This bill will allow our troops to continue to train the Iraqi \nsecurity forces, but only if that training does not result in our \ntroops being in combat. Training, yes; but they need to step up at this \npoint, after 5 years, and be the ones at the front line.\n  This bill also brings our troops home safely. It specifically allows \nour military to train and equip itself to ensure its safety. Most \nimportantly, it requires that we begin to bring our troops home.\n  This administration said a surge was necessary; that the surge would \ngive the Government of Iraq the time to reach the political solutions \nnecessary to end their civil war and to end the violence. They said \ntime was needed. Well, the Government has had time, and during this \ntime our troops have continued to pay the price. Our troops have been \ncaught in the middle of a civil war. They have been victims of IEDs. \nThey have come home with post-traumatic stress disorder and other \nmental and physical ailments. The bottom line is, it is time for our \ntroops to be placed first and to begin to bring them home.\n  That is all this bill does, and it does that while allowing our \ntroops to continue to focus on who we all agree is the real enemy: Al-\nQaida.\n  On October 11, 2002, I was proud to be 1 of 23 Members of this body \nwho stood in this Chamber and said the war was the wrong choice. This \nadministration, I believe, since that time has in fact failed our \ntroops and the American people by committing our troops to a war \nwithout a clear reason or goal, and by squandering resources that are \ndesperately needed here at home to rebuild America and to invest in \nAmerican communities. This administration has failed our troops by not \nhaving a clear mission for our Armed Forces in Iraq, by not providing \nthe proper equipment and body armor and logistical support for the \ntroops, by poor planning on the invasion in Iraq and the lack of \nplanning for how to secure the country and what would happen after the \ninitial attack. I believe they have failed by sending our brave men and \nwomen back into harm's way over and over again without the proper rest \nbetween redeployments.\n  History will be a harsh judge of this administration, because I \nbelieve they have failed the American people. This administration \nfailed because they took their eye off the ball. This legislation is \nabout putting our eye back on the target of what we ought to be doing \ntogether.\n  In closing, let me reemphasize the fact that while the most important \nthing is to be supporting our troops, to be addressing the threats to \nthem while they are in harm's way, to address the lives lost and the \npeople who are coming home who will need help the rest of their lives, \nit is also important to look at this from the standpoint of the \nprecious resources that have been lost at a time when so many American \nfamilies are struggling. We always make decisions based on values and \npriorities, and it is shocking to me, as we have seen this war go \nforward, to see upwards of, some say $12 billion, some say now upwards \nof $15 billion a month--not part of the normal budget--going directly \non the national deficit, the national debt, to be paid by our children \nand grandchildren. But let's say it is $15 billion a month. To see that \ncontinue month after month after month, and to see us work together on \na bipartisan basis to pass a critically important piece of legislation \nto increase health care for 10 million children across this country, \nwhich costs only $7 billion a year, and yet that is vetoed--there is \nnot a willingness to invest in American children to the tune of less \nthan half of what it is costing per month in Iraq--these are the wrong \nvalues and wrong priorities.\n  We see schools being rebuilt in Iraq, and yet I can go in too many \nschools in Michigan where there is a bucket in the corner to catch the \nwater dripping from the roof, or we don't have the kind of computer \ntechnology in the classroom every single child will need to know how to \nuse in any job they get, from working at a gas station to working at a \ntechnology company. We know we have crumbling roads and bridges here in \nAmerica. We know every time we invest in and rebuild in America, those \nare jobs that aren't going to be outsourced to another country. Those \nare American jobs--rebuilding American roads and American bridges and \nwater and sewer systems in America. We are told we can't do that, that \nthere are not the resources to invest in America, but we are spending \n$15 billion a month in Iraq.\n  We now have a whole new group of industries producing what are called \ngreen collar jobs, and I am very proud to have joined in working with \nmany of my colleagues to focus on the new alternative energy \ntechnologies and other things we need to do--small investments with \nhuge results for energy independence and creating more jobs and \naddressing global warming.\n  And yet we consistently hear there are not the resources for any new \ninvestments in America. There are so many areas where we are told there \nis no money: for doing the bold research we need to solve Alzheimer's \nand Parkinson's disease and to aggressively move forward on other \nhealth research; the desire not to help those who lost their jobs \nbecause of trade, to be able to go back and get the training they need \nto be able to move on to new kinds of jobs so that we have a middle \nclass in this country; and that families can pay their mortgage and \nelectric bill and heating bill and know that they have the opportunity \nto keep their standard of living in our country.\n  There is a lot at stake. And this bill, while it focuses on what we \nneed to do to change the mission, to refocus on ways to truly keep us \nsafe, to begin to bring our troops home from Iraq, from a civil war \nwhere we need to leave and redirect our troops to those areas where, in \nfact, we will be focusing on the real threat to our country, that is, \non the surface, what this legislation does.\n  I would suggest it does more than that because this is about who we \nare as Americans, what our priorities are: No. 1, how to make sure we \nare truly smart enough to be focused on what keeps us safe; and, No. 2, \nunderstanding that we have much to do in our country.\n  Our families are feeling squeezed on all sides. Communities need \nhelp, and we have an opportunity to not only redirect our troops and \nour focus but to redirect critical dollars to be able to make sure, in \nfact, we are finally putting the interests of America's families first.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from South Carolina \nis recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Oklahoma will \nreturn in a moment. If it would be appropriate, I would suggest that he \ngo. I think he will go next, followed by myself, a Democrat, then \nSenator Sessions.\n  I will get started. Senator Coburn, I think, has been to Iraq just a \nweek or so ago. I look forward to hearing what he has to say about the \ncondition on the ground as he found it.\n  And to my friend, Senator Feingold, one thing I think all of us \nshould agree upon is that you pushed this idea of withdrawing from Iraq \nfor a very long time. There is no question in my mind that you are very \nsincere, that you believe it makes America stronger not weaker, and \nthat if the polls were 90-10\n\n[[Page S1178]]\n\nto stay, you would be doing this, simply because that is what motivated \nyou as a Senator.\n  I have nothing but the utmost respect for what makes you tick as a \nSenator. I know you take on some very difficult challenges, sometimes \nnot popular, and this particular piece of legislation, I think, is ill-\nadvised. I will speak for a while as to why it should be defeated.\n  But the author of the amendment is consistent, is as patriotic as \nanybody else who will speak, and we need more of this, not less. So \nwhat is the Senate all about? We are talking about important things. \nThere are a million things going on in this country that need to be \naddressed. But I think taking some time to talk about Iraq, where we \nare, where we are going to go, and how we are going to get there is \nprobably time well spent. I think most Americans are very interested in \nthe outcome in Iraq.\n  Having just returned from Iraq, I think Senator Coburn can give us \nhis view of what he found.\n  I yield the floor and will speak after he is through.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first of all, I, too, want to express my \nrespect for the Senator from Wisconsin. We have a lot of things on \nwhich we agree. This happens to be something on which we adamantly \ndisagree. But I appreciate, as someone who pushes the limits in this \nbody, his desire to have this debate because I think it is important.\n  We just heard the Senator from Michigan talk, and the statement would \nhave been a fairly accurate reflection 2 years ago. But it has nothing \nto do, and it is not even anywhere close, to what is ongoing in Iraq \ntoday.\n  I think the case could have been made 2 years ago that Iraq was in a \ncivil war. Nobody who has visited Iraq in the last 2 months can make \nthat claim. It is not there. Outside of the Green Zone, I met with \npeople whose daughters had been murdered by al-Qaida. I met with people \nwhose father had been murdered. I met with both Sunni and Shia in the \nsame village, in multiple villages, who had reconciled because they \nreject the terrorism of al-Qaida.\n  There is no question lots of mistakes have been made with the Iraq \npolicy. But the claims under which we try to describe Iraq today in \nlight of how it was 12 months ago are fictitious at best and damaging \nprobably in terms of what the truth is.\n  Do we find ourselves in a very difficult situation? Absolutely. Is \nthis an expensive war? Absolutely. Would we all like to not be where we \nare? I think almost everybody would agree to that. But probably the \nmore important question for me is, where are we today compared to where \nwe were 12 months ago, and have, in fact, the mistakes of the past been \nreflected in policies that have changed and bode for a greater future \nabsent additional mistakes?\n  The desire of the Senator from Wisconsin to have us out in a way that \nlimits our exposure is something that I would love to be able to see. \nBut the practical nature of what he wants to accomplish could not be \naccomplished in less than 18 to 24 months. I mean, it could not happen. \nYou go and talk to the military; it could not happen without us leaving \ntons of equipment.\n  But the point is, we should not dwell on that. The point is, did we \nmake the necessary changes that can create an outcome that gives us an \nhonorable exit from the situation, and does it leave a genocide behind? \nI firmly believe, having traveled--my trip prior to this one was 6 \nmonths before the surge. I want to tell you the difference is like \nnight and day, everywhere I went. I duplicated places I went before.\n  So with the earnestness that the Senator from Wisconsin drives his \nposition, we ought to reflect on what has been accomplished. I also \nfind it very disingenuous to talk about the cost of this war by the \nperson who sponsored more legislation and greater Government spending \nthan anybody in this body in the 109th Congress, in the first session \nof this Congress.\n  The fact is, $349 billion worth of new spending was coauthored by the \nSenator from Michigan last year, $349 billion, the same Senator who \nvoted to fund the bridge to nowhere.\n  I happen to agree we ought to be paying for the war. We ought to be \npaying for the war, and we could easily pay for the war by eliminating \nwasteful spending.\n\n  I would direct you to the Reader's Digest last month where they \nestimated $1 trillion we are missing in wasteful spending. That is an \nunderestimate. So for us to make a claim of a fiscal nature, by the \nperson who has cosponsored more spending than anybody in this body, and \nhas voted against amendments to decrease wasteful spending, is somewhat \nless than genuine, I believe.\n  I think the other thing that needs to be said is we had a debate, and \nwe actually funded the surge. It actually happened. We ought to be \ntalking about what happened with that. To me, it is phenomenal, the \ndifference. I will tell you, I am very--we lost a soldier from Ardmore, \nOK, a 19-year-old soldier killed by an IED.\n  How can it be that we can continue to do this unless we are doing it \nfor the right reasons and the right cause? I believe if we walk away, \nno matter how we got there, rightly or wrongly, if we walk away, what I \nsee happening, from my experience in Iraq in 1993 after the first gulf \nwar and before this one, as a medical missionary, here is what I see \nhappening: If we do what the Senator from Wisconsin wants us to do, and \nwe effectively carry this out, I see an unstable northern Iraq. I see a \nwar between Iran, Turkey, and Kurdistan. I see a marked civil war \nbetween Shia and Sunni, with involvement of the Sunni Triangle, Sunni \ncrescent. I see a total destabilization of the Mideast. But beyond all \nof that, what I see is tremendous additional tragedy that we will have \nimpacted onto the people of Iraq, and in the deaths of 500,000 to 1 \nmillion more people.\n  And the question ought to be: Do we have a moral obligation to fix \nwhat we started? The assessment of the Senator from Wisconsin is that \nwe cannot fix it so therefore we ought to come home, we ought to get \nout, that it was a mistake to begin with; it does not matter what has \nhappened in the past other than we learned from it.\n  The question is, what can we do about the future? I want to tell you, \nI do not buy everything the Pentagon says. I am pretty critical across \ntheir spending, across everything else. I accused them of lying to me \non the training of Iraqi troops in 2006.\n  But when you see what has been transformed in the training of troops \nin Iraq, which is comparable to our training of our own troops over the \nsame period of time, and what they have accomplished both in terms of \nsynergism with both their equipment, their military leaders, and their \ntroops, and they walk out of training as a Sunni and Shia together and \nyou see that and you say we are going to walk away from that, we are \nnot going to finish it, we are going to allow this thing to collapse--\nand it will.\n  So then the question is, have we made another mistake in not \nfulfilling an obligation in something that we started? I do not believe \nwe can do that. If we do that, I think the blood of every Iraqi that is \ndisplaced or dies after that is on us--not on the Taliban, not on al-\nQaida, not on Shia extremists, not on Sunni extremists but on us.\n  We can win. We will win. We can. There is political progress all \nacross the board, locally and at the regional and at the national \ngovernment level. I would remind the Members of this body how long it \ntook us to get a functioning government, a functioning government after \nour independence, one that was based on a constitution, one that was \nbased on the rule of law. It was not smooth sailing. We did not do it \nin a short period of time. And we did not even get it right when it \ncame to equal rights of individuals. We did not get it right. Yet we \nare frustrated with that.\n  I see a new day in Iraq. It is not over. It is dangerous, it is still \nvery dangerous. But the progress, the improvement, the reconciliation \nbetween Shia and Sunni is unbelievable.\n  In province across province, the Shia, the Sunni awaking, the sons of \nIraq phenomenon, the coordination of local governments across ethnic \nlines is in stark contrast with what was there a year and a half ago. \nDo we just abandon that? Think about the message it sends if we are not \ngoing to create a stable Iraq. What immediately do they do? They \nimmediately start going to their own intrinsic ethnic corner. We \ndivide. We send the Kurds one way, the\n\n[[Page S1179]]\n\nShia one way, and the Sunni one way. We create a holocaust.\n\n  I want to say publicly I have had a lot of misgivings about what our \ncountry has done in the Middle East. But I have no misgivings at all at \nthis time about the course we are on. The leadership of General \nPetraeus, the leadership of Ambassador Crocker, the leadership of the \npeople within Iraq, sheikhs within small communities risking their \nlives every day to stand up and say: I will join hands with a Sunni, \nwith the Shia. I am going to reject al-Qaida and we are going to get \nour lives back together--that is happening. That is a dynamic that is \nforcefully happening because people want peace.\n  This will eliminate that movement. This will create insecurity. This \nwill drive people to their corners. This will drive people to extreme \npositions. In fact, what we have accomplished in the last 12 months \nwill be denuded and neutered out to the point where we will have \ncreated a worse situation rather than a better one.\n  To the soldiers and families who have sacrificed so much in this war, \nI say thank you from my family. The real problem of the administration, \nthe mistake they made, is we should all be sacrificing for this war, \nnot just our military families. We have refused to do that as Members \nof the Senate by making sure that we pay for this war, by getting rid \nof things that are lower priorities, getting rid of things that are \nduplicative. We didn't do that. We said, we will charge it to our kids. \nWe can't ruffle any feathers and make the hard choices.\n  The Senator from Michigan said: We do things based on value and \npriorities. That is baloney. We do things based on how we get \nreelected, with the exception of the Senator from Wisconsin, who is one \nof the most honorable men in this body. He never thinks about that \nissue. He thinks about what he thinks is right. But the way we do \nthings around here is what is politically expedient, not what is right. \nFor her to claim that that is how we do things, when we can't even get \nrid of billions of dollars in duplicative programs, $8 billion worth of \nbuildings that the Pentagon wants to get rid of because it might ruffle \nsome politician's feathers somewhere--we don't do things based on \npriority or on value. We do it on political expediency.\n  Again, I thank the troops and the families who are sacrificing. I am \namazed at the progress that has been made, literally amazed. I believe \nwe ought to honestly look at that before we walk a different direction. \nWe ought to truly reassess where we are. It is a big price. I know it \nis. We have paid a big price in this endeavor. It is fair to question \nwhether we should continue it. But it is not fair to not look at what \nhas happened over the last 12 months in a realistic and open assessment \nthat says, is there light at the end of the tunnel? I will tell you, \nthere is. Individually, in talking to Shia and Sunni families while \nover there, outside of the Green Zone, walking among them without \nprotection, seeing the hope in their eyes that finally things are going \nto get back to where they can take care of their families, move ahead \nwith their goals and their personal lives, the leadership exhibited by \nour military, not just in leadership roles but all the way down to the \nprivate and what they are doing and how they are doing it and how they \nare carrying it out in Iraq, is something we can all be proud of. I \ndon't think we should jeopardize what they are doing by voting for this \nbill. It is great for us to question. Sometimes we haven't done that \nwell enough. But to ignore the reality of what is happening today in \nIraq and the trend lines and the movement lines and the economic growth \nlines and the power lines and the oil production lines and the \nagreement among Shia and Sunni at all of these regional and provincial \nlevels, to ignore that is a grave mistake on our part.\n  It is my hope that we don't carry forward with this idea. It is also \nmy hope that we will truly recognize, not be blinded, not be sold a \nbill of goods. I am not suggesting that. We should ask the tough \nquestions. But to deny the marked change, the tremendous progress, the \ntremendous freedom, the tremendous lifting of the burden on the Iraqi \npeople that has happened in the last 12 months and not say that means \nsomething and not say that that means we are going absolutely in the \nright direction--we haven't won this war, but we certainly have them on \nthe run. We certainly have the Iraqi people enamored with us to the \npoint where we are not despised. We are welcome now in the vast \nmajority of Iraq. In 95 percent of Iraq we are welcome because we are a \nliberator of them from al-Qaida, not from Saddam but from al-Qaida, the \none who cut their 8-year-old daughter's head off because she looked at \nthem wrong, the ruthlessness of radical Islam. That is what is at stake \nright now. We can differ in our approach on how we might battle that, \nbut this is the heat sink right now. Iraq is the heat sink for al-\nQaida. It is where they are, where they are coming.\n  We are winning. The Iraqi people are winning, and the Iraqi troops \nare winning. Let's not destroy that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I returned Thursday of last week from Iraq \nafter my tenth visit. A year ago this time I quite honestly thought we \nwere going to lose this thing--incredibly depressed, because you could \nsee over about a 2\\1/2\\ to 3-year period it getting worse with each \nvisit. Things have changed dramatically. But it is important for every \nSenator to put Iraq in context so their constituents and the Nation can \njudge what our proposals are and what makes us tick on Iraq.\n  I believe Iraq is the central battlefront, not the only one, in the \noverall struggle against radical Islamic terrorism. At the time Saddam \nHussein was invaded and replaced, it wasn't to drive al-Qaida out of \nIraq, absolutely not. It was a dictator who had created war and chaos \nin the region as long as he had been a dictator, who had defied 17 U.N. \nresolutions to let us inspect his weapons program. It was the Russians, \nthe French, and every other intelligence organization in the world \nbelieving that Saddam Hussein was trying to acquire weapons of mass \ndestruction. It was basically neutering the effectiveness of the U.N. \nThe Oil for Food Program designed to help the Iraqi people and control \nthe dictator was a joke. So the reason we invaded Iraq is because the \ndictator was defying the world. He made us want to believe he was \ntrying to procure weapons. Because if he wasn't, he should have opened \nhis country to inspection. He was living off the Oil for Food Program.\n  We had 70 something Senators vote to authorize force. The reason most \nof us voted that way is because all the evidence possessed by everybody \nin the world suggested that Saddam Hussein was not becoming the \nsolution to the Mideast; he was still the problem.\n  What happened? We displaced the dictator and we got it very badly \nwrong after the fall of Baghdad. We had a model that was short on \ntroops. There was a period of time when we allowed the country to \nbecome lawless. Instead of stopping looting and pillaging, we let it \ngrow. We disbanded the Iraqi Army, and they could have been helpful, at \nleast some of them. We made a lot of mistakes after the fall of \nBaghdad. For about 3 years plus, we were pursuing a strategy that was \nnot producing results. Why? Because we didn't have enough troops. The \nenemy was getting stronger, not weaker.\n  We had a great debate last year as to whether we should change \ncourse. Everybody in the body suggested we change course, because it \nwas clear the old strategy was not working and it was depressing to go \nto Iraq and hear the people in charge on the ground say things are \nfine, when you knew they weren't.\n  I am not a military commander. I am a military lawyer. But common \nsense would have told you a couple years ago that this thing was \nslipping away. So it was time to act and change course. There were two \nways to do it. You could pull the plug and start pulling people out or \nyou could add more troops to secure the Nation in a way that we should \nhave done after the fall of Baghdad.\n  I will take responsibility for my point of view of not pushing harder \nearly on to have more troops. But I can promise you this: For a couple \nyears, along with Senator McCain, we pretty much were the lone voices \nto add more into Iraq. As the polling numbers on Iraq changed, the \ndesire to add more troops dramatically got more difficult for a \npolitician. But that is what we\n\n[[Page S1180]]\n\nneeded. I am here to tell you a year after the surge began that those \nwho said the war in Iraq was lost were wrong. Those who said the surge \nhad failed last April before it even started were wrong. Senator \nFeingold passionately believes that the troop presence in Iraq should \nchange, and he was suggesting withdrawal long before it was popular. \nThere are some people who have been playing Iraq for the next election, \nnot for the next generation or the next decade. They have made bold \nstatements such as it is all lost, that we have lost in Iraq. They \nnever told us who won, because wars are about winning and losing.\n  If you believe, as I do, that this is a battle in a greater war, \ncould you afford to lose? What is the price to the United States to \nlose a battle against al-Qaida anywhere in the world? What would it \ncost us as a nation for al-Qaida to be able to stand on every street \ncorner in the Middle East and tell people: We drove the Americans out \nof Iraq? They came to Iraq after the fall of Baghdad for the very \nreason we went into Iraq, except with a different result in mind. We \nwanted to replace the dictator and allow people in Iraq who had been \noppressed for 30-something years to have a better life and ally \nthemselves with us and be a peaceful neighbor rather than an agent for \ndestruction in the region. We wanted to allow a woman to have a say \nabout her children. We wanted Sunnis and Shias to be able to live \ntogether and prosper. We wanted a peaceful Iraq.\n  Al-Qaida saw what we were doing, and they came in droves to make sure \nwe were not successful. The question has to be: Why does bin Laden care \nabout Iraq? Why is he sending everybody he can get to go into Iraq? Why \nis he disappointed with the performance of al-Qaida in Iraq? Because he \nsaid the land of the two rivers is the great battle of our time. The \nland of the two rivers is Iraq. Bin Laden, no matter what you think \nabout him, understands the consequences of us succeeding in Iraq. It is \na nightmare to his way of doing business. The thought of a woman being \nable to run for office, hold office, have a say about her children is a \nnightmare. The idea that Sunni, Shias, and Kurds can live together and \nnot be told how to worship God is an absolute affront to his way of \nthinking. The idea that the Iraqi people would align themselves with us \nfor a peaceful Mideast must drive him crazy.\n  They came, al-Qaida, with a mission in mind. That was to drive us out \nand kill this effort at moderation. Thank God the President changed \ncourse with a mission in mind. We put more troops on the ground \nbeginning last February. A year later I am here to tell my colleagues, \nit worked. All of those who said we had lost in Iraq and the surge had \nfailed were absolutely wrong. Thank God we didn't listen to them. \nBecause if we had left Iraq, al-Qaida, as sure as I am standing here, \nwould be claiming all over the world they beat America. Iran would be \nthe biggest winner, second only to al-Qaida. And Iraq would be a \nchaotic place where the Sunni-Shia fight would spill over to the \nregion. If you think there is a problem now between Turkey and the \nKurdish rebels up in the north, imagine a collapsed Iraq. What is that \nworth to prevent? Let me tell you what it is worth. It is worth \neverything we have to throw at it.\n  Let's talk about the troops for a minute. We all appreciate them. I \ndon't doubt that one bit. But answer this question: Why do they \nreenlist after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan at higher levels than \nanywhere else in the military? What do they see that we don't see? Why \ndo they keep going back the second and third and fourth time?\n  My opinion is: They get it. They understand their commitment and \ntheir sacrifice now will prevent their children from having to go to \nsuch a battle in the future. And they buy this idea that if we can \ncontain extremism and defeat it in Iraq, we are safer here at home. \nThey believe it so much they keep going and going and going.\n  Let me tell you something no one said yet: Well done. We should take \nthis 30 hours and celebrate what I think is the most successful \nmilitary counterinsurgency operation in the history of the world. We \nshould take the 30 hours and go over in detail what the commanders and \nthe troops under their command have accomplished. It is a phenomenal \nstory that will be talked about in military history for decades to \ncome. It has exceeded every expectation I had. Adding more troops into \nIraq, I thought, was essential and would matter, but I never dreamed it \nwould matter this much.\n  Let's talk about what has happened since the surge began.\n  Monthly attack levels have decreased 60 percent since June of 2007 \nand are now at the same levels as early as in 2005 and some points of \n2004. In other words, we are rolling back the clock on attacks.\n  Civilian deaths are down approximately 75 percent since a year ago, \ndropping to a level not seen since the beginning of 2006.\n  Now, what does that mean? The better security, the more likely the \nIraqi people will step up to the plate and reconcile their differences. \nI have always believed that was the key to stabilizing Iraq.\n  Now, when we try to do things such as immigration--and my good friend \nin the chair knows how hard that is--they run awful ads against you and \nsay terrible things about you on the radio and make life pretty \ndifficult for a politician to take on the hard things. Everybody likes \ndoing the easy things. Very few of us like doing the hard things. But \nwhen you do the hard things, you get a lot of push-back. But we keep \ntrying.\n  Imagine trying to sit down across the table or the aisle with someone \nof a different sect, and they kill your family. Now, what kind of world \nis that? The violence in Iraq had gotten so out of control that the \nidea of political reconciliation, to me, was impossible. To expect \npeople to go to Baghdad and solve their nation's problems--because the \nthreat of violence covered the country, I knew we would never get \nreconciliation. But here is what I hoped.\n  I hoped if we could turn this around and reduce civilian casualties \nand reduce the level of attacks and reduce sectarian deaths--which have \ndecreased by 90 percent in the Baghdad security districts; listen to \nthis: a 90-percent reduction in sectarian killings in Baghdad--I always \nbelieved if we could do that, the Iraqi people would rise to the \noccasion because they do want a new Iraq. That was my bet. That was my \nhope. And if they do not want it as much as I want it, or more than I \nwant it, then it is never going to happen.\n  But here is the evidence, after a year of sacrifice, blood, and \ntreasure--not just by us but by the Iraqi people. Their army and \nsecurity forces have increased by 100,000.\n  Let me tell you what it is like to go to the recruiting station in \nBerkeley. You get pushed back because of the city council ordinance.\n  Let me tell you what it was like to go to the recruiting station in \nparts of Iraq a year ago. They were killing people who were trying to \njoin the army and security forces. They were attacking recruiting \nstations. They were getting the names of those who wanted to join the \narmy and security forces, and they were coming after their families; \nand they still came.\n  I have been to Iraq 10 times, and I can tell you, I met people the \nfirst couple visits who are now dead because the terrorists killed \nthem. Because what the people were trying to do is create a moderate \nform of living that is an absolute nightmare for al-Qaida.\n  I have always believed, after having gone there so many times, that \nthe Iraqi people are willing to die for their own freedom, and if they \ncan pull this off, it makes me and my family and my country safer. So \nthat is why we stay, that is why we fight. And we are winning.\n  What has happened in the last 60 to 90 days? Not only have we reduced \nthe level of attacks by 60 percent--and civilian deaths are down by 75 \npercent and sectarian deaths are down by 90 percent--we have doubled \nthe amount of weapons caches found because we are getting better \ninformation from the population. They are telling us things they did \nnot tell us before.\n  Ten of the eighteen provinces have been taken over by Iraqi security \nforces. The Iraqi security forces grew by 100,000 in 2007 and stand now \nat more than half a million.\n  All I can tell you is the Iraqi people have taken the opportunity we \nprovided them with the surge to stand up\n\n[[Page S1181]]\n\nfor their own freedom. They are dying at 3 to 1 our rate. They have \npaid a heavy price. Our country has paid a heavy price. But the reason \nthe Iraqis keep coming after somebody falls is because they want a \nbetter way.\n  If I had to put in a story line the most important aspect of the \nsurge, it would be as follows: A Muslim country made up of different \nIslamic sects turned on al-Qaida. Listen to that. With better security \nand a strong commitment from the United States that we will be your \nally, we will not leave you, we will not abandon you to this vicious \nenemy, they slowly but surely turned on al-Qaida, beginning in Anbar \nand now marching throughout the whole country.\n  What does that mean for the overall war on terror? That is something \nwe should be on the floor celebrating because the way you win this war \nis not: Kill every terrorist. The way you win this war is: You stand by \nforces of moderation and you give them the ability and the tools to \nchange their own destiny.\n  Look what has happened. Anbar Province, a year ago, was determined \nlost by the Marine Corps. This year, they celebrate a 5-K run through \nthe streets of Ramadi. Why? Because the sheiks, the tribal leaders, the \naverage citizen said no to al-Qaida, aligned themselves with us, and \nal-Qaida has been diminished in great measure.\n  To those who want to defeat al-Qaida, stay with the Iraqi people and \nhelp them defeat al-Qaida. What a message to the Mideast: Muslims turn \non al-Qaida with American support. What is that worth? That is \npriceless. That is how we win the war.\n  GEN David Petraeus should have been the man or person of the year. \nWhat he has accomplished in a year absolutely is stunning, militarily. \nIt has come at a heavy price in blood and treasure. But to all those \nwho have served under his command, congratulations. You have made \nmilitary history. You have made your country safer. You have been al-\nQaida's worst nightmare. And we are not going to let the Congress \nundercut you.\n\n  Now, the surge was not just about killing al-Qaida. The surge was \nabout providing better security so the Iraqi people could build \ncapacity to defeat their own enemy, enemies within their country, and \nreconcile themselves.\n  There have been major benchmarks out there for political \nreconciliation for quite a while. I said in October of last year, if I \ndo not see progress by January or February of 2008, I am going to \nreevaluate my position vis-a-vis the Iraqi central government. One \nthing I can tell you, after a year, and going into March of 2008, the \nIraqi political reconciliation has astonished me.\n  They have passed the debaathification law, and they deserve credit \nfor it. What does it mean? It means Sunnis who held jobs in the \nGovernment during the Saddam era are going to be allowed to get some of \ntheir jobs back. What does that mean in real terms? That means the \nShias and the Kurds have looked at a former oppressive group--people \nwho ran Saddam's government--and said: Come on back. Let's build a new \nIraq.\n  My God, what a statement to make. How hard that must have been for \npeople who have lived under the thumb of Saddam Hussein and the people \nwho ran his government, to turn to that same group and say: Let's move \nforward. Come back and help us build a new Iraq.\n  A provincial powers law just passed. What does that mean? It means \nthe central government in Iraq, where the Shias dominate, has allowed \nthe opportunity for local elections to occur in October of this year, \nhopefully.\n  That means that the Sunnis in Anbar can actually elect their own \nlocal leadership. They can elect people to send to Baghdad to represent \ntheir interests.\n  That means the Shias in the south are going to have a chance to elect \ntheir equivalent of a mayor, a county councilman, a Governor.\n  It means the central government, dominated by Shias, has turned to \nevery province in Iraq--Sunni, Shia, and Kurd--and said: Instead of us \nrunning your life, you elect your local leaders.\n  That means they bought into this idea of democracy, where people vote \nfor whom they want to make local decisions.\n  Here is what I predict: that in 2008 there will be provincial \nelections, and there will be a huge turnout. In 2005, the Sunnis \nboycotted the elections in Iraq because they were not certain that \ndemocracy was for them, and they were afraid of being left out. It is \nthe Sunnis who are pushing for local elections, and they were able to \nwin in Baghdad.\n  They passed a $48 billion budget--something we cannot do. A $48 \nbillion budget has been passed, with the blessing of all groups, that \nwill allow money to flow from Baghdad to reconstruct the country in \nevery corner.\n  The hardest thing for one politician to do for another is to reach a \ndeal in allocating resources because you always want more for your \npeople and less for the others. We still do that here. I love Colorado, \nbut I like South Carolina to get its fair share; and usually that means \nI care more about South Carolina spending than I do Colorado. But \npeople, such as the Presiding Officer and myself and everybody else in \nthis body, usually were able to give and take and get a budget that \nhelps everybody.\n  Can you imagine how hard that must be for a group of people who have \nlived under a dictator who have never had that responsibility before \nand who have been suffering from violence inspired by al-Qaida, \nsectarian in nature? They were able to overcome that hatred and that \nbitterness that has been inspired by al-Qaida and say to each other: \nHere is the money of the country. You get your share.\n  That is progress. That is hope. That is al-Qaida's worst nightmare.\n  The one that means the most to me is that the general amnesty law was \nrecently passed. I have been a military lawyer for 25 years and a \nstudent of history to some extent. What happened in Baghdad is \nastonishing. The prisons are full of insurgents. People aligned \nthemselves with the insurgency during this lawless period. Blood has \nbeen taken and shed from each group, one to the other. Most of the \npeople in jail are Sunnis. There are more and more Shia militia, but \nright now it is Sunnis.\n  The central government in Baghdad passed a general amnesty law where \na committee will be formed of all groups to go through the files of \nthose in prison to allow them to come back home and be part of the new \nIraq. That is a level of forgiveness and a desire to start over that \nhad to be incredibly difficult because there is nothing sweeter than \nrevenge.\n  The people who were on the bottom in Iraq for a long time, the Shias \nand the Kurds, and those in the Sunni world who were trying to \nbasically prevent Iraq from coming together as one, have now seen it is \nbetter for them to chart a new destiny, a new course together. They \nhave a long way to go, and they are going to be fought at every turn.\n\n  If you understand nothing else from this speech, as Senator McCain \nwould say, understand this: al-Qaida is diminished, but they are not \ndefeated. Their goal tonight or tomorrow or the next day is to create a \nspectacular attack that will make headlines all over the world, and \npeople in this body will respond to those headlines and try to change \ncourse in policy. I would argue the worst thing we could do is allow \none of the most vicious movements in the history of mankind to change \nAmerican foreign policy because they have the ability and the desire to \ncommit mass murder. So beware of al-Qaida. They are diminished, but \nthey are not yet defeated, and they know they can't win in Iraq, but \nthey are still not sure they can't win in Washington. They are not \ngoing to win in Anbar. They are not going to win in Baghdad, they are \nnot going to win in Fallujah, they are not going to win in Diyala, and \nthey are not going to win in Basra. But the question is, Can they still \nwin in Washington? I hope the answer after this debate is no. If we \nwould take winning in Washington off the table, reconciliation in Iraq \nwould go at a faster pace, not a slower pace.\n  Economic progress in the last year: Oil production in Iraq has risen \nby 50 percent over what it was a year ago. Oil production is up 50 \npercent because of better security. Oil revenues are double what they \nwere a year ago, and the Iraqi central government has shared the \nresources with everybody in the country. Inflation has fallen from 66 \npercent to less than 5 percent in a year. What does better security buy\n\n[[Page S1182]]\n\nyou? It buys you a functioning economy, political reconciliation, and \nbetter military security. Electricity demand is up more than 25 percent \nsince last year. People are purchasing, they are buying, they are \nbuilding hopeful lives. There are 21 new health clinics in Baghdad, \n1,885 new schools, and 604 refurbished schools throughout Iraq.\n  People say: What about South Carolina? What about the schools in \nSouth Carolina? Lord knows we have our fair share of educational \nchallenges in South Carolina and, like every other place in the \ncountry, we could use more money. But I am here to tell my constituents \nthat the price to be paid in blood and treasure in the future losing \nIraq is far greater than the price we are paying now, in my opinion. If \nI did not believe it, I would not say it. If the men and women in \nuniform didn't believe it, they wouldn't go back time and time and time \nagain. If we can continue this model that has produced dramatic success \nbeyond my imagination, we will win in Iraq, and everybody in this body, \ntheir families, and our Nation as a whole will be safer for the \nexperience because it means al-Qaida lost.\n  Al-Qaida came to Iraq with a purpose: to undermine this effort at \nmoderation, stability. They came for a purpose: to make sure a woman \nnever had a say about her children. And they are losing. They have not \nyet lost, but they are on the road to losing, and they know it.\n  What is it worth for our country to align itself with a Muslim nation \nto turn on al-Qaida? It is worth everything to me. It is certainly \nworth my political future.\n  A year ago, when this debate was started, the polls were incredibly \nagainst the idea of sending more troops. The need for more troops \nexisted, in my opinion. A year later, the results of more troops and \nbetter security is astonishing.\n  The way to get the Iraqi people to reconcile themselves is not to \nleave them, not to set a timetable for withdrawal that will encourage \nthe enemy who is on the mat to get back up into the fight. The way to \nget them to reconcile themselves is to stand with them, to stand by \nthem, invest in the training of their army, help them get on their \nfeet. That is the way to beat al-Qaida. Winning is going to happen in \nIraq unless we change this model here at home.\n  People ask me: Senator Graham, what is winning? Winning, to me, is a \nstable, functioning government, aligned with democratic principles, at \npeace with its neighbors, that rejects Islamic extremism, will deny al-\nQaida a safe haven, and will align itself with us in the greater war on \nterror, and finally, will create a system where a mother can have a say \nabout her children. We are not there yet, but we are well on our way.\n  We have a model that will lead us to victory: a general who knows \nwhat he is doing and brave young men and women who are sacrificing \nbecause they understand the need to sacrifice. They are excited. They \nwant to come home, but more than anything else, they want to win. That \nis why they keep going, going, going, and going. They are going to win \nunless we do something here at home to make it hard for them to do so.\n  The worst thing we could do now as a nation is to ignore the results \nof the last year, worry more about the next election than we do about \nwinning this global war, and try to get an advantage over each other \nbased on the next election cycle. I hope the Members of this body will \nunderstand that the turnaround in Iraq is not only dramatic, it makes \nus safer as a nation here at home, and that we now have a model that \nwill allow us to win what I think is a war we can't afford to lose.\n  Let it be said, finally, that there are Muslims in this world of \ndifferent sects who will come together and fight al-Qaida with us. Let \nit be said that there is a nation called Iraq that has lived under an \noppressive dictatorship for over three decades, that is beginning to \ntaste freedom, that they are fighting and dying for their own freedom \nin large measure, that they are beginning to reconcile their political \ndifferences, they are beginning to build a larger army that is combat \nready, that they are beginning to create an economy that will allow \nthem to sustain themselves, and they are beginning to create a society \nthat will allow us to live in peace with them and be a force of \nmoderation for the region. That, I say to my colleagues, is an outcome \nvery beneficial to the United States.\n  I am glad we are having this debate. I am glad we have a little bit \nof time in a chaotic election year to take a breath and at least allow \none Senator to say to the troops: You are winning. You should be proud. \nGood job. We are behind you here at home. We are behind the policy you \nare trying to implement. I hope they come home sooner rather than \nlater. I believe they will. But when they come home, they are going to \ncome home in a way that will allow them to tell their grandchildren: I \ndid something that mattered for our country. That is why they keep \nreenlisting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss \nthe state of our economy, the budget cuts proposed by this \nadministration, and yes, the war in Iraq and the need to set our \npriorities straight in this country. Like my colleague from South \nCarolina, I wish to thank our troops. Like the Presiding Officer, I \nvisited Iraq and saw firsthand the bravery of these troops everywhere I \nwent. Of course, I was very focused on Minnesota troops. They would \ncome up to me in cafeteria lines and airport tarmacs and never complain \nabout a thing. They didn't complain about the heat or their equipment \nor their long tours of duties. Many of our Minnesota National Guard \nextended over and over and over again. They really only asked me to do \none thing, and that was when I got home, that I call their moms and \ndads, their husbands and their wives, and tell them they were OK.\n  When I got home, I talked to their families. I think I called over 50 \nmoms and dads, husbands and wives. I heard a little bit different \nstory. I heard stories of families waiting and waiting and waiting, \nwith anxiety over jobs that might be lost or never gotten back. One of \nthe moms I talked to when I went back in March--I left a message for \nher. A few months later, I called her again when her son had been \nkilled. I met her.\n  I have to tell my colleagues, these troops, as my friend from South \nCarolina said, have done their duty. They deposed an evil dictator. \nThey guaranteed free elections in Iraq. Now it is time for us to do our \nduty for them.\n  We all know there can be no purely military solution in Iraq. This \nhas been agreed to by so many military commanders and experts and \nMembers of this body on both sides that it is not really worth arguing \nabout anymore. We all recognize that true stability in Iraq will only \ncome through political and economic compromises between Iraq's main \nethnic groups and that only the Iraqis themselves can reach these \nagreements. Given this, I believe our strategy should be focused on \ntransitioning to Iraqi authority and bringing in other countries and \nthat we cannot keep doing this alone.\n  I was listening to my friend from South Carolina speak so eloquently, \nand one of the things that struck me that he said was that this was \npriceless, and he meant this in the best of all ways. He said it was \npriceless. I just can't say this war has been priceless. After 4 years, \n5 years, over 3,600 American soldiers have been killed. Over 25,000 \nhave been wounded. We have been in this war now longer than World War \nII. Almost $450 billion--$450 billion has been spent. We cannot wait \nuntil next year to change our strategy.\n  The President is intent on leaving the current situation for the next \nadministration to resolve. Unfortunately, our soldiers in the field \ndon't have the luxury of simply running up the clock on this \nadministration. We owe it to them to begin bringing our combat troops \nhome. I think we all know we can't do this overnight. We know we are \ngoing to have troops remaining to guard our embassies and to train \npolice and to act as special forces, but I do believe that if we want \nto push this Government to get its act together, the Iraqi Government, \nwe have to send a clear message that we are not staying there \nindefinitely. So we owe it to our troops, but we also owe it to the \npeople of this country. We can no longer continue to give the President \nthe blank checks he keeps asking for. We must\n\n[[Page S1183]]\n\nensure the safety and the well-being of our troops in the field, but \nfunding must be conditioned on a plan for responsible redeployment of \nU.S. combat forces from Iraq.\n  Now, why is this so important to our own country and to our own \nfuture and to our own children? Well, as I said, the war in Iraq has \nalready cost over $490 billion directly, and by some estimates it has \ncost the American people almost $1.5 trillion when factoring in all of \nthe costs. For each month that passes, we spend another $12 billion on \nthe war, and we cannot separate the President's spending in Iraq from \nthe economic and the budgetary problems we face.\n  One of the things that has always really bothered me on behalf of the \npeople whom I represent is that this administration never really \nadequately calculated the repercussions of this war. I think the troops \nin the field--and I will say one thing. Despite the clear disagreements \non strategy for this war, there has been bipartisan agreement that our \ntroops need to be treated with the kind of respect they deserve. When \nthey signed up for war, there wasn't a waiting line. When they come \nhome and need medical care and they need mental health care, they need \nto get their education benefits, they shouldn't be waiting. It is this \nDemocratic Congress that took on this issue and looked at the facts. \nWhy are all of these men and women coming up to me out in Minnesota and \nsaying they couldn't get health care? Look at the facts. The Pentagon \nunderestimated the number of troops coming home from Iraq and \nAfghanistan by four times the amount--four times more returning troops \nneeded health care than they estimated. We put billions of dollars into \nthat.\n  We are willing to rise to the occasion and say we are not going to \nmake the same mistake we made after Vietnam. We are going to treat our \ntroops with the respect they deserve when they come home. But again, \nwhen the administration made its plans for this war--a war I did not \nsupport from the beginning--when they made their plans, they did not \nanticipate the enormous costs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized following \nthe remarks of the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            ECONOMIC GROWTH\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, the administration did not anticipate \nthe cost for our troops. The war has already cost over $490 billion, \n$1.5 trillion when you factor in all costs, $12 billion a month. They \ndid not anticipate what was going on with this economy. They did not \nrespond the way they were supposed to to the mortgage crisis. They did \nnot anticipate. They listened to their friends in the special interest \ngroups, and look where we are now. Look where we are now.\n  Two weeks ago we passed a short-term stimulus package that will help \nchange the economic direction of this country by putting money in the \nhands of American families, including our seniors and our veterans. \nThis action was a start. But today we must begin focusing on the long-\nterm policies to spur economic growth long after the rebate checks are \nspent. We have to get this economy on the right track, and it means \nmaking a reckoning for that money that is spent in Iraq, to start \nbringing home some of our combat troops, to start being more \nresponsible about this budget.\n  Today we announced our next step, which is to look at this mortgage \ncrisis, really the crisis that I say fundamentally puts us where we are \nright now. Mr. President, 8.8 million families across the United States \nare underwater. They owe more to lenders than they have equity in their \nhome, giving them limited or no options for refinancing.\n  The Foreclosure Prevention Act, which I am going to talk about later, \nand I hope will come to the floor this week, signifies a major step in \nthe right direction, curbing the disastrous effect the foreclosure \ncrisis has had on our families and our economy. The time to act is now.\n  We also need long-term economic policies that will encourage \nsustainable economic growth in every corner of this country. From the \nimpact of the mortgage crisis and the value of homes, to the \nskyrocketing cost of oil that fuels cars, trucks, and heats homes, to \nrising prices in the grocery stores, the middle class is being squeezed \nfrom every side.\n  Back in January, I traveled around my State. I visited towns all the \nway from Worthington up to Halleck, MN. You haven't been anywhere, Mr. \nPresident, unless you visited Embarrass, MN, in the middle of January. \nIt is always one of the coldest places in our country. We were all over \nour State. People are concerned. They are Minnesotans so they try to be \noptimistic, especially when it is January. They try to look to the \nfuture. They look at the potential with this energy revolution. But \nthey would come out to cafes, come out to college campuses and talk \nabout how it is getting harder and harder for them to send their kids \nto college, to afford health care, and to fill their cars up with gas.\n  To give a sense of what we are looking at in our State--and our State \nhas always had a diverse economy; we are eighth in the country for \nFortune 500 companies--the unemployment rate for Minnesota recently \njumped to 4.9 percent, up from 4.4 percent the month before. Our State \nhas lost 23,000 jobs in the last 6 months alone. Home heating prices \nfor Minnesota families have also risen by 14.1 percent per household in \nthe past year alone.\n  On the foreclosure front, the statistics in Minnesota are equally \ndevastating. At the end of 2007, over 50,000 families in Minnesota were \ndelinquent on their home payments. It is estimated that 30,000 will \nlose their homes in the next several years if something is not done.\n  What are these families like? They are like the Gray family in \nMinnesota with whom I met. They are both teaching. They were all \nexcited to buy their new house. They got a mortgage approved, a \nstandard mortgage. It turned out the home values were much higher, and \nthey were not able to afford a home. So they went to someone they \nthought they could trust and got one of these adjustable rate \nmortgages. They were told a lower rate at the beginning, $1,500, and it \nmight go up a few hundred dollars. By 2008, it was up to $3,300 a month \nfrom $1,500 a month. We know that is not the rate of inflation. We know \nit is not the right thing to happen.\n  I use that as one example of what we are seeing across this country \nand why this administration has its priorities messed up and why people \nsuch as the Grays, good people who are just trying to have a home for \ntheir family, have found themselves in the middle of this mess. It is \nwhere Wall Street has hit Main Street. It is where the Bush \nadministration's priorities to spend $12 billion a month have hit \npeople like the Grays right in their homes.\n  The cost of foreclosures is not limited to these families. If \nsomething is not done, Minnesotans will lose an estimated $1.6 billion \nin declining home values. That is because the chickens have come home \nto roost. When it comes to this mortgage crisis, it is not just one \nfamily, one foreclosure. It affects real estate values on an entire \nstreet, an entire neighborhood, an entire community.\n  We need an economy that creates stable middle-class jobs. We need \ninfrastructure investments so we don't have bridges falling, as we did \nin our State, right in the middle of America. We need energy \ninvestments that will reduce our dependency on foreign oil and create \ngood ``green collar'' jobs in the growing clean alternative energy \nsector of our economy.\n\n  The people we serve are asking for a new direction, a government that \nspends their money wisely, that represents their values, that works for \nAmerican families. America wants a Washington that is going to offer \nnew priorities and new solutions.\n  Last year, our Congress succeeded in a downpayment on change. It was \na beginning. We were hampered by procedural rules and all these \nfilibusters, but we moved this country. There is so much more to do. We \nmoved, first of all, to a more responsible budget process. We gave \nworking Americans an increase in the minimum wage. We provided greater \nfinancial aid to help their kids go to college. And we passed a new \nenergy bill that raises fuel efficiency\n\n[[Page S1184]]\n\nstandards for the first time since I was in junior high.\n  But there is much more that needs to be done.\n  Senator Dorgan and I heard about it at an economic hearing we had in \nmy State just last week where we met with a panel of economists and \nexperts on energy policy and what was going on in our economy in \nMinnesota. One economist described our current condition as ``serious, \nunstable, and declining.'' In our State, families sense their stability \nis slipping, with 67 percent of middle-class Americans having an \nincreased sense of anxiety about their futures.\n  Tom Stinson, Minnesota's chief economist, discussed the frightening \nunemployment statistics. We haven't added any new jobs over the past \nyear, and we are not alone. States that have historically had lower \nunemployment rates are now creeping toward the national average.\n  Unfortunately, when we look at this problem we are facing, and we \nknow there are solutions, we know there is a way to get this economy \nback on track and be fiscally responsible, but President Bush's new \nbudget proposal falls far short of what America needs to address our \neconomic downturn and invest in meaningful recovery effort.\n  This new budget request does not offer new priorities or now \nsolutions. Instead, this budget continues a familiar pattern of \nmisplaced priorities. It continues a 7-year pattern of fiscal \nirresponsibility: borrowing money and leaving an ever-larger debt to \nour children and grandchildren.\n  Look at this, the wall of debt we have seen and how quickly it has \nrisen from 2001 to 2013. This administration took a $200 billion \nsurplus and turned it into a $300 billion budget deficit. Do you know \nwhat it means to middle-class families? When I talk to people in our \nStates about what all these millions and billions and trillions mean, \nit means that 1 out of 12 Federal tax dollars goes to pay interest on \nthat debt. That money is not going to the United States. Most of that \nmoney is going to companies in foreign countries. That is what is \nhappening to this country.\n  I was listening before to my colleague from Oklahoma talking about \nhow we have to be willing to make these sacrifices and pay for things. \nI find this so ironic because it is people on our side of the aisle who \nhave been willing to talk about rolling back some of the Bush tax cuts \non people making over $200,000. Think how that money can go to pay off \nthis debt, to go into infrastructure investment we have been talking \nabout, to move this economy in the right direction. It is people over \non our side of the aisle who have been talking about oil giveaways and \nputting them into renewable energies so we can start investing in \nfarmers and workers in the Midwest instead of oil cartels in the \nMideast.\n  How about the debate we had on the middle-class tax issue, on AMT tax \nrelief? We were willing to talk about how we wanted to pay for it. We \nwanted to pay for it off those hedge fund operators, but they wouldn't \ngo for it. It is this Congress that put the pay-as-you-go back.\n  When I talk to people in my State, they understand we need to have a \nshort-term stimulus package, why we need it, and why economists \nbelieved it was a good idea. But when we go forward in the long term, \nwe cannot keep going the way we are going with this wall of debt. We \nare not going to end up where we want to go. We are going to be right \nback where we were before we put the stimulus in place, and we need to \nmake bold changes in this country.\n  In just 7 years, this administration took that budget surplus, $158 \nbillion--think of that money--and made it into a $400 billion deficit. \nSo when we talk about this war in Iraq and when my esteemed colleague \nfrom South Carolina talks about it being priceless, it is not \npriceless. It is $12 billion a month.\n  Meanwhile, this new budget continues to neglect crucial investments \nthat are needed to strengthen our economy and our Nation for the long \nterm. It does not make the investments we need in our Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure. It does not make the investments we need \nin developing renewable energy sources to move us toward greater energy \nindependence and security. It does not make the investments we need to \nsupport the basic medical and scientific research that has always been \na key driver of our country's innovation and growth.\n\n  I come from Minnesota, a State where we believe in science. We \nbrought the world everything from the Post-It note to the pacemaker, \nand we believe this investment pays off not only in the health of our \ncitizens but also for jobs and looking to the future and not letting \nother countries such as India, China, and other countries go ahead of \nus because we have failed in this country to have an investment \nstrategy and put those Government policies in place that drives that \ninvestment.\n  Here are a few examples from my State of where the President's budget \ngoes wrong.\n  Americans are struggling to lower home heating costs in any way they \ncan. Nationwide, the average household is expected to pay 11 percent \nmore for heating this winter compared to last year. Families who rely \non home heating oil are facing record prices, 30 to 50 percent above \nlast winter.\n  So what does the administration do in its budget? It cuts this \nfunding. It ends the Department of Energy Weatherization Assistance \nProgram. The Weatherization Assistance Program increases the energy \nefficiency of homes occupied by low-income Americans, directly reducing \ntheir energy costs. It cut it by 100 percent.\n  The funds appropriated in fiscal year 2008 for this program will \nenable upgrades for as many as 85,000 homes. With energy costs rising \nsignificantly and an economy poised on the brink of recession, the \nweatherization program and the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram are necessities, they are not luxuries.\n  Another example: Nearly 6\\1/2\\ years after the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, Americans are well aware of the need for State and local \ngovernments to be prepared as possible against future threats. I heard \nyou talking, Mr. President, earlier this afternoon about the importance \nof putting that money into our own homeland security. So what does the \nadministration do with this budget? It slashes funding for State and \nlocal first responders' efforts, cutting firefighter assistance grants \nfrom $1.2 billion to $300 million, and the State Homeland Security \nGrant Program from over $1 billion to $200 million, and, once again, it \nproposes to eliminate the cost of the COPS Program.\n  As a former prosecutor, I take this personally because I saw how that \nCOPS Program worked, how it added police officers to our neighborhoods, \nhow it brought down crime. Look at this: What is the comparison when we \nare looking at this budget as we are talking about priorities of the \n$12 billion a month on the war in Iraq? This is the amount the \nPresident would need to add to his budget to maintain this police \nprogram which puts police out in the neighborhoods at a 2008 level, \nplus inflation.\n  Personally, I would like to do more, especially in our rural areas. I \nthink we need meth cops out there. Just to restore it to 2008 levels \nplus inflation would cost $596 million. What would you do if you just \nroll back the tax cuts for those making over $1 million in 2009? I am \nnot talking about people making over $250,000; I am talking about \npeople making over $1 million. What would you bring in with that? You \nwould bring in $51 billion. Look at the comparison. Think about how \nmany police you could buy on the streets. Think how much you could buy \nto help people afford their homes. Think of the benefits. Look at what \nyou can do for $51 billion to help our veterans.\n  We have soldiers coming home from Iraq that just this summer in \nMinnesota were told: You are the longest serving unit, you Red Bulls \nfrom Minnesota, of the National Guard in Iraq. But guess what. Your \npaper only says 729 days. So guess what. You are not going to get your \nfull education benefits, even though you served longer than 729 days.\n  Obviously, we took up this matter with General Shellito, head of our \nNational Guard, took up this matter with the Army, and it is working to \nfix it. Oh, well, it saved some money to write that down as 729 \ndays. But think about $51 billion and what we could do with that. We \nare talking about priorities here.\n\n  Fiscal responsibility is also about making sure down the line that \nthese\n\n[[Page S1185]]\n\npriorities are right. Do we want a budget that offers tax giveaways to \nthe wealthiest or a budget that provides relief to middle-class \nfamilies squeezed by rising costs for health care, housing, energy, \ncollege tuition, childcare and care for aging parents?\n  Do we want a budget that gives lucrative special favors to the giant \noil and pharmaceutical companies, or a budget that invests in our \nfuture prosperity, such as research and development on renewable \nenergy?\n  Do we want a budget that continues to spend $12 billion a month in \nIraq or a budget that provides our veterans with the help they need; \nthat makes sure we have the money we need to keep our troops there for \nthe focused purpose of guarding our embassy and training police and \nhaving them there for special forces; and money for the COPS program--\nthat $596 million it would cost to restore that? That is about homeland \nsecurity.\n  I want to see an administration that aims for fiscal responsibility \nby reversing or rolling back these tax cuts for the wealthiest \nAmericans--people making over $200,000.\n  I want to see an administration that aims for fiscal responsibility \nby eliminating offshore tax havens for multimillionaires so people \naren't hiding money in the Cayman Islands.\n  I want an administration that aims for fiscal responsibility by \nending the tax breaks and giveaways that have been handed out year \nafter year to the big oil companies.\n  I want to see an administration that aims for fiscal responsibility \nby allowing Medicare to negotiate for lower prices for prescription \ndrugs for our seniors.\n  The President's budget does not provide the new priorities and the \nnew solutions America needs. Instead, it continues to take us down the \nwrong path. This budget is only the most recent example of an \nadministration that is putting its head in the sand and ignoring the \nreality of the looming economic recession.\n  As the housing market is crumbling, and millions of families are \nexpected to lose their homes in the next couple of years, the \nadministration seems to hope this problem will go away. This is why I \nhave cosponsored the Mortgage Foreclosure Prevention Act, and I am \ncommitted to working with my Senate colleagues on a bipartisan basis to \npass this bill to help keep our families in their homes and get the \nmiddle class back on their feet. Across the country, we are seeing \nfamilies struggling to keep their homes. If something isn't done, over \n2 million families will lose that struggle in the next 2 years.\n  Through a pilot project conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank in \nMinneapolis, we have been able to track by ZIP Code all of the \noutstanding subprime mortgages in our State. This data is a startling \nreminder that we are seeing only the beginning of this crisis if we \ndon't do anything about it. By being able to track the reset dates of \nall the subprime mortgages in Minnesota, the study shows thousands of \nmortgages resetting to higher interest rates monthly, causing more and \nmore families to fall behind on their payments. Congress must act \nquickly if we are going to curb any effects of the housing crisis.\n  In my home county, where I was chief prosecutor of Hennepin County, \nwe have seen an 82-percent increase in sheriff sales of foreclosed \nhomes. The problem extends to greater Minnesota. We have seen the \nforeclosures double in some of our urban areas. We have seen 3 out of \n100 households--3 out of 100 households--that are in foreclosure.\n  Something must be done to help these families. I have met them. These \nare not just statistics and numbers; these are real families living in \nthe State of Minnesota. This is why I believe we need to pass the \nForeclosure Prevention Act and why I believe we need to reprioritize \nwhat is happening in this country--$12 billion a month in Iraq, with no \nend in sight, and some people saying we are going to stay there for 100 \nyears, while these families are losing their homes, while our veterans \nare still not getting a fair shake.\n  This bill, the Foreclosure Prevention Act, would give $200 million to \nfamilies to counsel them in ways to avoid foreclosure. I will put that \nchart up again showing an example of these priorities. This is for \npeople making over $1 million a year--people making over $1 million a \nyear. Here is our $51 billion. Think of this mortgage counseling. It is \na proven way to work here. It would be only $200 million.\n  Our State finance agencies are in a perfect position to help families \nrefinance loans, but their hands have been tied by ceilings on the \namount of State-backed mortgage bonds they can use. This bill makes it \neasier for them to help find families and rework their mortgages. That \nis what we are trying to do. It will not work for every one of these \npeople. Some we don't want to help. They are not deserving of this. \nThey maybe speculated on these mortgages to begin with. But many of \nthese families I have personally met, including the family from Ohio we \nsaw today here in the Senate. These are hard-working families who were \nmaybe not told the truth about their mortgage or misled about their \nmortgage or the whole mortgage was set up to get them in trouble down \nthe line, and the mortgage lender goes away and sells it to someone \nelse, who sells it to someone else, who sells it to someone else, and \npretty soon it doesn't just hurt that family, it hurts the entire \nstreet, and it hurts the entire neighborhood.\n  This is about getting our priorities right. Yes, it is about the war \nin Iraq and an administration that refused to account for the cost, \nrefused to have a plan to start bringing our troops home, that refuses \nto admit we are in financial straits--financial straits they got us \ninto. Because we must remember, when they came in, we had $200 billion \nsurpluses, and now we are where we are with this wall of Federal debt.\n  The American people are tired of this. They want a fair accounting of \nwhat is going on in this country. They want a fair accounting of this \nwar and a plan to bring our troops home. That is the best thing we can \ndo for our troops, and that is the best thing we can do for our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been listening to the discussion \nthis afternoon, which is a repeat of a discussion we have heard often \nin this Chamber: Who supports our troops; who waves the white flag of \nsurrender. You know, in the discussion in this Chamber and out on the \nPresidential trail, we hear all of those terms, and who is willing to \nstick with it and defeat the terrorists with respect to the war on \nterror.\n  Well, let me, if I might, suggest there is a smart way and a tough \nway to deal with terrorists, and we are not doing it very effectively, \nin my judgment. I want to review for a moment, because we have people \ncoming to the floor who forget to review where we are, and where we \nhave been, especially.\n  In 2001, on September 11, terrorists attacked our country. Following \nthe attack that killed thousands of innocent Americans--the World Trade \nCenter, the Pentagon, and a farm field in Pennsylvania--following that \nattack, Osama bin Laden and the leadership of al-Qaida boasted that \nthey engineered the attack against the American people. They boasted \nthey engineered the attack against the American people. So the \nPresident says: We are going to have an effort to bring to justice the \nterrorists.\n  Well, it is now 2008. That was 2001. In 2008, our National \nIntelligence Estimate, released about 4 months ago, said the greatest \nterrorist threat to our country, to our homeland, is the al-Qaida \norganization and its leadership, who are now plotting additional \nattacks against our country. Our National Intelligence Estimate says \nthe greatest terrorist threat to our country, 7 years after 9/11, is \nthe al-Qaida leadership, because they are planning new attacks. They \nhave reconstituted in a safe and secure hideaway in northern Pakistan. \nThose are the words of our National Intelligence Estimate, not my \nwords--safe, secure. Iraq leadership, Osama bin Laden, still alive 7 \nyears later and creating new training camps, training new terrorists.\n  So how effective has the war on terror been when the greatest \nterrorist threat to our country 7 years after the 9/11 attack, the \ngreatest terrorist threat is now building and reconstituting in \nnorthern Pakistan? It is reasonable to ask the question: Who took their \neye off the ball? Why has this country, why has our policy not been a \npolicy to bring to justice Osama bin\n\n[[Page S1186]]\n\nLaden and his al-Qaida leadership? Instead, 7 years later, we are mired \ndown in a war in Iraq, we have spent nearly two-thirds of $1 trillion \ndollars, thousands of American soldiers have died, and we have people \nasking us about who waves the white flag of surrender and who supports \nour soldiers. That is unbelievable to me.\n  Let me review a bit. Following 9/11, we had top secret briefings for \nSenators and Congressmen--top secret briefings conducted by the head of \nthe CIA. The Vice President was involved, the head of the National \nSecurity Agency, Condoleezza Rice, was involved. We went to those top \nsecret briefings. All of us did. We were told things in top secret, \nshown classified materials, about what was happening in Iraq. It turns \nout that was a foundation for the invasion of Iraq. In fact, it was \npresented at the United Nations by Secretary of State Colin Powell. It \nturns out most of it was false; wrong on its face.\n  Let me review it for a moment--the issue of mobile chemical weapons \nlaboratories in Iraq that threatens our country. Mobile chemical \nweapons laboratories in Iraq. You know where that came from? We now \nknow it came from a single source, through our intelligence \norganizations to the American people, to Congress, in top secret \nbriefings, to the world at the United Nations, a single source: A \nfellow who used to drive a taxicab in Baghdad nicknamed ``Curveball'' \nand widely considered by German authorities as a drunk and a \nfabricator.\n  A single source named Curveball gave this administration the ability \nto, in top secret briefings, tell us that Iraq had mobile chemical \nweapons laboratories and gave then-Secretary of State Colin Powell the \nopportunity to tell the world that Iraq had mobile chemical weapons \nlaboratories. Turns out it wasn't true.\n  Will Rogers once said:\n\n       It is not what he says he knows that bothers me, it's what \n     he says he knows for sure that just ain't so.\n\n  Curveball. One single source this administration used to tell us that \nmobile chemical weapons laboratories in Iraq threatened this country, \nand it turns out to have been false, and they should have known it. And \nsome may have known it, as it was described to us.\n  The aluminum tubes. The aluminum tubes for the reconstitution of a \nnuclear capability in Iraq. Now, Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice, \nthen National Security Adviser, even used the term the specter or the \nthreat of a nuclear--or I guess she said mushroom cloud on television. \nThe mushroom cloud. Well, it turns out her office had the information \nthat a substantial portion of the Government didn't believe the nuclear \ntubes that were ordered by the Iraqis were for the purpose of \nreconstituting a nuclear capability. Most of that was discredited. The \ninformation in the National Security Adviser's office existed to say \nthat there were very qualified people in this Government who didn't \nbelieve that.\n  It turns out none of that was true. The aluminum tube issue was not \ntrue. Those who were telling the world, and in top secret briefings \ntelling Members of Congress about the threat of the nuclear tubes for \nthe reconstitution of nuclear capability, had information in their \npossession and knew better.\n  Yellowcake from Niger is another big deal that made it into the \nPresident's address to the Congress in the State of the Union. It turns \nout that was based on falsified documents. It is unbelievable.\n  Maybe we should review the facts a bit. All of this information turns \nout to have been false--the information that represented the foundation \non which the administration made the case about the need to invade \nIraq. Well, this country invaded Iraq and had no plans, once the \ninvasion was complete and the military takeover was complete, on how to \ndeal with Iraq at that point, and it turned into a civil war.\n  Saddam Hussein, following that invasion, was captured and executed. \nHe was hung by his neck until dead. He doesn't exist anymore. The Iraqi \npeople then voted for a new constitution, and then the Iraqi people \nvoted to constitute a new government.\n  So Saddam Hussein was killed, executed, a brutal dictator was \nexecuted by the Iraqi people. They got a new Constitution, they got a \nnew Government, and then this country, in the context of spending \nalmost two-thirds of a trillion dollars, this country spent $16 billion \ntraining 350,000 able-bodied Iraqis to be policemen and firefighters \nand safety personnel and soldiers. We trained an array of people in \nIraq for security; $16 billion training 350,000 Iraqis, principally for \nsecurity, police, and soldier duty.\n  Now, if the able-bodied people in Iraq who have been trained by this \ncountry are not willing and cannot and will not provide security in \ntheir country, our soldiers cannot stay there forever and do it. We \ncannot.\n  It is interesting to me, and very disappointing to me, that the \nPresident decided: we are going to invade Iraq, but we are not going to \npay for it. Every single penny we are going to borrow.\n  So we are going to send soldiers to Iraq and send the bill to the \ndebt. When the soldiers come back, they can pay the debt.\n  As I said earlier, it is two-thirds of a trillion dollars now in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, all of it emergency, none of it paid for. In my \njudgment, that is exactly the wrong thing to have done. We should have \nbeen saying: Yes, we will ask soldiers to sacrifice. If that is what we \nask our soldiers to do, we will ask the American people to reach a \nsimilar sacrifice. But this President would not do that.\n  So we come now to a position where we have been in Iraq longer than \nwe were engaged in the Second World War and we have folks who come to \nthe Senate Chamber and we have folks out on the campaign trail saying: \nWho is going to wave the white flag of surrender?\n  Some say we are going to stay in Iraq forever, 100 years. Others look \nat a Taj Mahal that has been built in Iraq, nearly $800 million for an \nembassy in Iraq, the largest embassy in the world by far, and they \nthink they know, as a result of that, how long some intend for us to \nstay in Iraq.\n  But we cannot do that. Let me mention one other addition. On top of \nall the things I have described--basically the false foundation of \ninformation on which this country made a decision to go to war--on top \nof all that, with this money we have spent, there has been the greatest \namount of waste, fraud, and abuse in the history of this country and \nnobody seems to care very much.\n  Let me tell a couple stories: $85,000 trucks on the side of the road \nin Iraq, because they had a flat tire and no wrench to fix it, so they \ntorched it, burned it. It does not matter, the American taxpayer is \npaying for it because big companies got sweetheart, no-bid, cost-plus \ncontracts. Got a flat tire, torch the truck. Got a plugged fuel pump, \nit does not matter, torch the truck.\n  I mean, the stories are unbelievable. You got two builders to provide \nice. The Haliburton Company is going to select between two bidders to \nprovide ice. One is seven times more than the other bid. Well, pick the \ncontract that costs seven times more than the other because the \ntaxpayer is picking up the tab.\n  They buy little hand towels for the troops, because Haliburton has to \ndo that. Well, they do not want to buy ordinary hand towels for the \ntroops, they want their logo embroidered on the hand towels, KBR, the \nsubsidiary, Kellogg Brown and Root. Well, that is going to increase the \ncost of the hand towels triple, quadruple. It does not matter; the \ntaxpayer is going to pay the bill.\n  Do you want to know where there are 50,000 pounds of nails, 25 tons \nof nails? They are on the sands in Iraq. They ordered them. They were \ntoo short. What do you do with 50,000 pounds of nails that are too \nshort? You throw them away because the taxpayer is going to pick it up. \nYou just order the right size.\n  This is the most unbelievable story that is yet to be told about the \ngreatest waste, fraud, and abuse in the history of this country. There \nis a lot to talk about.\n  We are going to have a hearing in the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. I have held 12 hearings in the policy committee on these \nissues. We are going to hold more. I have to run to a meeting. But I \ndid want to come and talk a bit. I did not have the opportunity to \ndescribe who is it that is supporting America's soldiers and what is\n\n[[Page S1187]]\n\nit that does support our fighting men and women? We send them off to \nwar.\n  There is going to be a Medal of Honor, by the way, awarded next \nMonday at 2:30 in the White House to a man who died 26 years ago, a \nSioux Indian named Woody Keeble. I hope perhaps to come over tomorrow \nand tell the story of Woody Keeble. There are soldiers who have given \nso much for this country.\n  Woody Keeble had 85 pieces of lead in his body when he finished what \nhe did. He was still alive.\n  But these folks then go to war and do what they do and come back \nhome. And then the question is: Who stands up for our soldiers? Who \nstands up for our veterans? Who is willing to stand here and say we \nwill keep our promise for veterans health care? Who does that?\n  There is a lot to say. I regret I have a commitment that I have to be \nat in the majority leader's office, but I would like tomorrow to come \nback and speak at greater length about a remarkable American who on \nMonday will be recognized by President Bush, a North Dakotan from \nWahpeton, ND, Standing Rock, the Wahpeton-Sisseton Sioux Tribe. He will \nbe recognized as the first Sioux Indian in this country's history to \nreceive the Medal of Honor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to make a few brief \ncomments in response to my eloquent colleague from North Dakota. The \nrhetoric he utilizes has been used for a long time.\n  We have heard this rhetoric before each one of our evaluations of the \nway ahead in Iraq. And we have each time concluded that our national \ninterests call on us to remain active and strong in Iraq and active and \nstrong against terrorism around the world.\n  I would note, to remind everyone, every intelligence agency in the \nworld thought weapons of mass destruction were in Iraq when the war \nbegan. In fact, Saddam Hussein did not seriously deny that these \nweapons existed. Saddam denied the U.N. inspectors the right to look \nfor WMD, even though he had agreed to do so after suing for peace in \n1991. At that time, after he had invaded Kuwait, we agreed not to take \nBaghdad and grab him by the scruff of the neck. He agreed he would \nallow his country to be inspected by the United Nations.\n  He did not do that. He systematically violated 13 U.N. resolutions. \nAs the well-known magazine, The Economist, said: We either have to give \nup and let Saddam break the embargo or we have to fight? They said: We \nbelieve we should fight.\n  That, I suggest, is the fundamental reason we had to authorize the \nPresident to use force. A lot more can be said about it, but those were \nsome of the things we were considering at the time. I would note also \nthat an official commission report concluded that, while U.S. forces \ndid not find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, Saddam Hussein \nplanned to work his way out from under the sanctions and to \nreconstitute his weapons of mass destruction.\n  That has been clearly established. Most of us were surprised we did \nnot find nuclear or chemical weapons in Iraq. I have to tell you, I was \nsurprised. In 1991, when we had the first Gulf War to repulse Iraq, \nwhich had invaded Kuwait, we discovered that Iraq's nuclear program was \nfar more advanced than we had previously thought. That is indisputable.\n  We know that after 1991, and before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Saddam \nhad utilized weapons of mass destruction, poison gas, against the Kurds \nof Iraq, killing thousands of his own people. How could he not have \nweapons of mass destruction? It still remains baffling to me that we \ndid not find them.\n  So I wish to rebut this old rhetoric that somehow President Bush lied \nto get us into the war. We spent months discussing this and debating \nall the issues. We had private briefings. We knew basically everything \nthe President knew. And what we knew was the CIA Director George Tenet, \nwho had been appointed by President Clinton, told the President of the \nUnited States: It was a slam dunk; that weapons of mass destruction \nexisted in Iraq.\n  That is the kind of information that the President acted on. He was \nnot lying to the American people. This Senate authorized the President \nto use force in Iraq by a more than three-fourths majority vote. A \nmajority of both parties, a majority of the Democratic Senators, a \nmajority of the Republican Senators voted to authorize the President to \nuse force in Iraq. And that is how we got here.\n  So the question is: What do we do now? This is a great Nation. We are \nnot some fly-by-night bunch who can change our minds every time the \npoll numbers change. We have responsibilities to our Nation, to our \nallies. We have committed our men and women to harm's way. We have lost \na large number of American soldiers to execute a policy we sent them to \nexecute.\n  I have to tell you, we lost far fewer in the initial invasion than I \nimagined, but have lost far more than I imagined in the post-invasion \nperiod. Things are never quite certain in war, however.\n  People who fight you and desire to kill you usually do not want to be \nkilled themselves. Military action is a tough thing and always causes \nus to remember we should avoid it whenever we possibly can. It should \nbe a last resort. It is only acceptable when we have no real other \nalternative.\n  I do not believe the Lord is happy when his children fight and kill \none another. It cannot be a good thing. It is a bad thing. Sometimes, \nbecause we are so flawed and we have options that are so grim, military \naction becomes the best decision that can be made under the \ncircumstances. I think that is where we were in 2003 when it came to \nthe Iraq debate.\n  In the fall of 2006, in an election that came during one of the worst \nperiods of time in Iraq, the Republicans lost control of both Houses of \nCongress. The President's polling numbers were terrible. The following \nsummer we had a national debate about whether to allow General Petraeus \nto continue the surge. We had a commission that General Jones headed, \nwith 15 members. I asked him at the hearing: General Jones, do you and \nthe members of your commission believe we have a chance to be \nsuccessful if we execute this surge? He said: I do. He looked around. \nAny of the other members want to rebut what I have said or have a \ndifferent opinion? Not a single one did.\n  That commission unanimously reported that they thought we could be \nsuccessful. We had General Petraeus testify, and we had the GAO issue a \nreport in September after the surge had actually begun.\n  We noticed some progress. But it was premature to see that as a \nsustained trend. We knew that. And we continued again at that time to \nallow the surge to go forward. We believed things were going to get \nbetter. That was my conclusion after hearing everyone's opinion.\n  I remember asking General Petraeus: Sir, will you tell us the truth, \nthe good and bad? And he committed in private and in public to do that.\n  Will you give us your best judgment? Will you let us know if you \nthink this is not an acceptable, feasible action in Iraq; that we need \nto acknowledge that we can't be successful? He made that commitment.\n  So what has happened since? We sent five additional brigades into \nIraq as part of the surge. Three have already returned to the United \nStates. The other two are planned to be returned by summer. We will be \nat or possibly below the 15 combat brigades that we had in Iraq before \nthe surge.\n  General Casey was asked today in the Armed Services Committee about \nthat plan and whether it meant we could move from having our soldiers \non 15-month deployments to 12 month deployments. He said: When we get \nback to 15 brigades--and at this time we are projected to be there by \nJuly--he believed then that we could go back to a 1-year rotation \ninstead of the longer 15-month rotation. 15 month rotations have been \nso painful to our military personnel and their families. That is a long \ntime. We need to keep it to 12 months if we possibly can.\n  We are anticipating three reports in April. General Petraeus will \ncome, as he promised, to give us a report on the status of Iraq and \nwhat he thinks about our future military commitment and soldier \nstrength there. We will also receive a report from the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff and a report from Admiral Fallon, the CENTCOM commander who has \nIraq the rest of the Middle East\n\n[[Page S1188]]\n\nunder his command. We will have those three reports in April. That is \nthe time for us to begin to evaluate again what our next step will be.\n  General Petraeus has said that we need to be careful to consolidate \nthe gains we have made, to help the Iraqi people and government move to \na more stable footing for the long term. If we were to pass the \nFeingold legislation, it would be a slap in the face to our commander \non the ground who is absolutely one of the finest generals this Nation \nhas ever produced. It would be unthinkable that we would, in a time of \ngreat success, reject the commander's recommendations and the \nmilitary's recommendations after we took their recommendations when \nthings were not good a year ago. We were worried a year ago. There was \ncause for legitimate concern. I do not deny it. But, goodness sakes, we \nhave had some success in recent months.\n  The military estimates that attacks against coalition forces and \nIraqi forces and Iraqi civilians have collectively fallen by 60 percent \nagainst Iraq since June of last year. Iraqi Army estimates put the \nnumber as high as an 80-percent reduction. In June there were almost \n1,700 IED explosions across Iraq. That number fell to 600 in December. \nWhile one U.S. combat death is so serious that we are not able to \narticulate the gravity of it, we are seeing, I am pleased to say, a \nmajor reduction in casualties among our troops and Iraqi troops. It is \nquite remarkable. December of 2007 was the second lowest combat death \ntotal of the war for American forces behind May of 2003. January and \nFebruary of this year have shown comparably low death rates. That is \nsomething for which we can be thankful. Every single life is important. \nBut we have to understand that when we commit troops to combat, there \nare going to be casualties. Having a good movement in the right \ndirection is a cause for confidence, not a basis to cut and run.\n  From January to December of 2007, sectarian attacks and death among \nIraqis in the Baghdad area decreased by 90 percent. I want to just say, \nwe should be skeptical of these numbers when we hear them just one \ntime. Are the trends sustained? How accurate are these facts? Those are \nlegitimate questions for members of Congress to ask.\n  When I see soldiers in the Atlanta airport--most of them are on their \nR or coming home from Iraq or Afghanistan--I speak to them about \ntheir experiences. I spend a lot of time in the Atlanta airport, more \nthan I like. I ask them how things are going. And I am hearing, from \nthem, information that directly confirms the reports we are getting.\n  Just this month, a soldier I met was saying he worked at a base in \nIraq. He said they used to take incoming rounds against the base \nthroughout the day every day. Now they go days without any attacks. \nAnother soldier told me things were getting boring. Every morning they \nused to meet. There would be some emergency, some serious challenge \nthey had to address. Now when they meet, they can go weeks without \nanything serious happening. These observations are from sergeants, \nenlisted people, junior officers. It confirms, I will just say to you, \nthe information we are receiving.\n  How has this success happened? What has occurred? The ranks of Sunni \nvolunteers who have chosen in recent months to switch sides and turn \nagainst al-Qaida as members of local citizen councils have grown to \nmore than 91,000, according to statistics from the U.S. military. The \nSunnis, who are the minority group in Iraq, used to run Iraq under \nSaddam Hussein. They have been taken from power. They were strong \nBaathists. They were attracted to al-Qaida and their false promises. \nMany, though not most, were in cahoots with al-Qaida. They have now \nrejected al-Qaida. Whole tribal regions have publicly renounced them. \nThey said they don't care about their people. They try to run their \nneighborhoods. They are corrupt. They don't support them. And 91,000 \nhave joined local citizens councils part of the awakening, they call \nit, to turn against al-Qaida.\n  Sunnis are turning these guys in. Most al-Qaida are foreigners. They \ndon't live in Iraq. So the Sunnis know who they are. The Sunni folks \nknow them. Once they turned on al-Qaida, we have seen a dramatic change \nin the Sunni areas.\n  Shia groups, citizens councils are growing around the country as \nwell. More and more the people are getting tired of murderous killers \nand religiously driven extremists. They realize this is no foundation \non which to build their future. Three critical laws have been passed. \nCritics say: We have to have laws passed. Surely we do, although the \nPresident and all the masters of the universe in America, I guess, \ndetermined that we would pass an immigration law. They said we had to \ndo it. We had to have this program, this amnesty. They were going to \nram it right through here. It failed flatter than a fritter. So just \nsaying a bill needs to be passed in a democratic parliamentary \nsituation doesn't mean that is so easy to be done.\n  Three critical laws were passed by the Iraqi Parliament on February \n13 of this year. They enacted a $48 billion budget for 2008. They \ngranted amnesty to thousands of Sunni detainees and passed a provincial \npower law defining the relationship between the central government and \nprovinces. These last two were on the list of benchmarks demanded by \nCongress.\n  Last fall when General Petraeus was here, the critics of the war \nsaid: You are not meeting these benchmarks. We are not interested in \nthe military side. We are only interested in the political side. Well, \nwe are making some progress now in the political area. In one sense \nthings are even better than they appear on the political side because, \nthroughout the region, reconciliation has been undertaken, and \nBaathists have been accepted back into Government positions, even in \nthe absence of a national law. The oil money was and is being fairly \ndistributed, even though they haven't agreed on an absolute firm legal \nformula for distribution of revenues.\n  Last Friday, February 22, the Shiite cleric, Moqtada al Sadr, who \ncontrols the Mahdi army, instructed his followers to extend their \ncease-fire against the Sunnis and the Americans for another 6 months. \nThis is a big deal. The Sunnis have come around and now al Sadr, with \nthe Shia, has also recommended that his followers continue their cease-\nfire.\n  U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, with whom I have met in Iraq, \nsaid this last week:\n\n       We are indeed seeing the signs of that political surge. \n     Putting all of that together would have been just unthinkable \n     6 months ago.\n\n  Let me say this Feingold bill would be disastrous if it were passed. \nIt would cut off funding after 120 days for any missions not approved \nby Senator Feingold and politicians in Washington. It would replace the \ndeployment decisions and recommendations of General Petraeus with \npolitical decisions. Some, I guess, who are in the moveon.org camp \nthink General Petraeus is a betrayer. That is what they put in an ad in \nthe paper last year. I say he is one of the best generals we have had. \nHe has had a remarkable tenure of success in Iraq.\n  The Feingold bill would forbid us from training any members of \nneighborhood councils that have sprung up under the Sunni awakening, \nunless we could certify that they had never been involved in sectarian \nviolence or in attacks upon the U.S. Armed Forces. Well, we want them \non our side. I don't know what motivated them at one point or another \nto oppose the United States. But if they have made a decision, as a lot \nof Sunnis clearly have, to switch sides, to turn in al-Qaida, to kill \nal-Qaida, isn't that good enough? Why shouldn't we welcome them back \ninto the fold of the Iraqi Government and give them a chance?\n  We have to be careful. In fact, I think the State Department and the \nmilitary are too naive in their belief that the prisoners we now have \nin custody can be released in the interests of reconciliation. Many of \nthese, I am afraid, are just killers and murderers and thugs. Releasing \ntoo many of these people can create violence in the community. I don't \ndoubt that some have had a change of heart because many have. But we \nhave to be careful about how many of these prisoners we release.\n  This bill would prevent us from attacking terrorists or sectarian \nmilitias unless we can be sure that the targets are ``members of al \nQaeda and affiliated international terrorist organizations.''\n\n[[Page S1189]]\n\n  How is this supposed to work in practice, let me ask? Will we ask al-\nQaida to wear special hats or badges or uniforms so we can distinguish \nthem from simple local terrorists?\n  The likely consequences of this legislation would be renewed \nsectarian violence, expanded ``breathing room'' for al-Qaida and other \nterrorist groups, and decreased possibilities for political \nreconciliation. It would create major political instability in Iraq.\n  The frequently referenced final report of the Iraq Study Group \ndescribed, in grim detail, the results of an American decision to \nabandon Iraq:\n\n       Because of the importance of Iraq, the potential for \n     catastrophe, and the role and commitments of the United \n     States in initiating events that have led to the current \n     situation, we believe it would be wrong for the United States \n     to abandon the country through a precipitous withdrawal of \n     troops and support. A premature American departure from Iraq \n     would almost certainly produce greater sectarian violence and \n     further deterioration of conditions, leading to a number of \n     the adverse consequences outlined above. The near-term \n     results would be a significant power vacuum, greater human \n     suffering, regional destabilization, and a threat to the \n     global economy. Al Qaeda would depict our withdrawal as a \n     historic victory.\n       If we leave and Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range \n     consequences could eventually require the United States to \n     return.\n\n  This was a serious evaluation by serious men and women who have \nstudied this area in depth. I do not think anybody can deny that this \nis a realistic description of what would occur if we were to pass the \nFeingold bill.\n  Well, Mr. President, I see others here who want to talk, and it looks \nas though we will have more time tomorrow. I say to my fine colleague \nfrom Florida, I enjoy serving with him, as he is chairman of our \nStrategic Subcommittee in Armed Services.\n  I conclude by saying, we are a great nation. We made some tough \ndecisions. We went through a full debate last summer. We decided to \ngive General Petraeus a chance. We gave him a chance. We supported the \nsurge in a bipartisan vote. We sent the money. We sent him the \nresources to carry out the surge. It has been successful beyond \nanything we could have imagined at the time. And now, to undertake a \nprecipitous withdrawal, directly contrary to his opinion as to what \nshould be done to help continue to secure Iraq, would be unthinkable. \nNo great nation should flip-flop around like that, certainly not the \nUnited States of America.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to make sure I have in \nthe Record why I had opposed the motion to invoke cloture on the motion \nto proceed to the Feingold bill, S. 2633.\n  This Senator is certainly for a gradual withdrawal from Iraq. But the \nFeingold bill has a considerable pitfall because it starts the \nwithdrawal within a certain period of time and cuts off the funding \nwith the exception of allowing funding, for example--I am going to \nread--for ``Conducting targeted operations, limited in duration and \nscope, against members of al Qaeda and affiliated international \nterrorist organizations.''\n  In other words, the Feingold bill would allow funding to continue to \nconduct operations against al-Qaida, but only ``limited in duration and \nscope.'' I do not think we ought to limit the ability of the U.S. \nGovernment to go after al-Qaida in Iraq.\n  Furthermore, this clause in the Feingold bill would allow funding to \ngo not only against al-Qaida, ``limited in duration and scope,'' but \nalso against ``affiliated international terrorist organizations.'' The \nword ``affiliated'' means affiliated to al-Qaida.\n  There are a bunch of other terrorist organizations in the world we \nwant to go after, and this limitation of funding would be only for \nthose affiliated with al-Qaida. I do not want the Government of the \nUnited States limited in its ability to go after al-Qaida and then only \nthose other terrorist organizations affiliated with al-Qaida.\n  I have voted against the motion to invoke cloture. There seemed to be \nonly about a dozen of us who voted against that motion to invoke \ncloture. As we proceed, I will certainly, if we get to the bill, try to \namend that portion; otherwise, I will certainly be constrained to have \nto vote against this bill.\n  Mr. President, I have another matter I will bring up at another time. \nI will let the debate proceed on this Feingold bill, so I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, it is suggested we should not be \ndiscussing Iraq. Well, the last time I checked, the majority leader \nsets the agenda. The majority leader brought up Iraq, and if he wants \nto bring up Iraq, we can discuss Iraq.\n  I too am wondering why it is being brought up because we have other \nimportant issues we could be dealing with. For example, I wish to see \nthe Congress turn its attention to a pro-growth economic package, a \ndiscussion of how we can help this economy move. I think once we have \nthat opportunity to debate, we will have a good, principled exchange of \nideas here.\n  My suspicion is that from the other side of the aisle we will hear a \nnumber of expensive spending proposals, and from our side of the aisle \nwe will hear a different agenda, an agenda that says we want a bigger, \nbolder, broader pro-growth economic agenda so we can move this economy \nin a more positive direction.\n  Part of that would have to do with lower tax rates for individuals, \nsuch as to permanently reduce the dividend, capital gains, and estate \ntax rates to 15 percent. Part of it would be to lower corporate tax \nrates, reducing the capital gains tax for corporations from 35 percent \nto 25 percent so our companies in America can compete in the world. \nPart of it would be indexing the capital gains tax for inflation so \nthat double taxation of capital would at least reflect inflation. Part \nof it would be something that many Members of this Chamber have talked \nabout for a long time: a simpler, flatter tax, giving taxpayers the \noption of filing a 1-page return with a 17-percent flat tax rate.\n  I wish to see--and I plan to introduce within the next few days--\nlegislation that would make permanent the expensing provisions for \nsmall business that we passed in a bipartisan way before the recess in \nthe pro-growth package to help stimulate the economy. Those provisions \nincreased the small business expensing limits and allowed a 50 percent \nbonus depreciation.\n\n  Now it is not unusual to hear Republicans talking about lower tax \nrates. But that is only a part of--a part of--what we would propose if \nour debate were here for a pro-growth economic package. I wish to see \nus bring up Senator Isakson's proposal, which would create a $5,000-a-\nyear, 3-year tax credit for buyers of foreclosed or new homes to get \nbuyers back in the marketplace.\n  I wish to see us begin to more seriously implement the America \nCOMPETES Act. That is part of a pro-growth agenda as well. We worked \nhard in this Chamber across party lines for 2 years to advance \nlegislation to increase our nation's competitiveness in the global \neconomy. The President made a priority of it. He said we ought to have \nan 18 percent increase in funding for the physical sciences in this \nyear's budget. We should talk about that and make a commitment to make \nroom in the budget for that so we can double funding in the physical \nsciences over the next 5 years so we can keep our brainpower advantage \nso our jobs will not go overseas.\n  As one Senator, I want to see that we continue to in-source \nbrainpower for new jobs by pinning a green card on the lapel of every \nforeign student who earns a degree in science, technology, engineering, \nor mathematics from a U.S. university, and who is legally here and \npasses a background check. We could have a good debate here in the \nChamber about whether it is a good idea to do that. I think it is.\n  We have 570,000-something foreign students here. Why would we attract \nthe brightest people in the world to study here and make them promise \nto go home and create new jobs in India and in China? Let's create them \nhere.\n  We could make the research and development tax credit permanent. We \ncould have a full-day debate about how to improve our schools. I see \nthe Senator from New Hampshire is in the Chamber; he was one of the \nprincipal authors of the No Child Left Behind Act. There is a provision \nin that legislation which is called the Teacher Incentive Fund. It \ntackles one of the most difficult problems in American education. How \ndo you reward outstanding teaching? Well, you cannot do\n\n[[Page S1190]]\n\nit from Washington. But you can fund it from Washington, so in \nPhiladelphia and in Phoenix and in Memphis school leaders and teachers \nare part of plans where you pay them more for leading well and pay them \nmore for teaching well.\n  I did that in Tennessee in 1983 when I was Governor. Mr. President, \n10,000 teachers went up a career ladder. As soon as I left, its \nopponents killed it. But teacher after teacher comes back to me saying \nthey wish it were still there. Every time we have a hearing on \neducation, we hear the need to keep and attract outstanding teachers.\n  We could talk about and debate--and I am sure we would debate--Pell \nGrants for Kids. Why not give vouchers to poor kids so they can go to \nsome of the schools that people with money go to?\n  Why not go ahead and implement the provisions in the America COMPETES \nAct for adding 10,000 math and science teachers, and give a million and \na half more low-income children the opportunity to take Advanced \nPlacement tests?\n  If we want to talk about growing the economy, we can do that. We \ncould talk about stopping runaway lawsuits and enacting small business \nhealth plans. We can talk about lower energy costs. We can talk about \nlowering the cost of Government. Or we can talk about Iraq.\n  I have been one of those who, over time, has had some difference of \nopinion with the President on Iraq. I thought he should have embraced \nthe Iraq Study Group plan as soon as it came out: Put Secretary Baker, \nCongressman Hamilton, and the other members of the Iraq Study Group up \nthere in the Gallery and honor them and accept their suggestions.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will my colleague yield for a brief \nstatement?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would be glad to yield to the \nmajority leader.\n\n\n                           Order Of Business\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I just finished a conversation with the \nRepublican leader. We have decided it is to the interest of everyone we \nhave no more votes tonight, so everyone should understand that. We will \nbe out tomorrow to decide what we are going to do after Senator \nMcConnell and I have a chance to get together in the morning.\n  No more votes tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. President, I would say that last year I thought I had succeeded \nin doing something that no one else had been able to do. I unified \nPresident Bush and Senator Reid on Iraq in their opposition to our Iraq \nStudy Group legislation. But my point is that while I have been one on \nthis side of the aisle who wishes the President had taken a different \ntact, I think in all honesty we are talking about how things have \nchanged in Iraq.\n\n  If we look at the Iraq Study Group recommendations, what were they? \nFirst, transition of mission. Let's shift our military forces out of \ndirect combat and into roles of supporting, training, and equipping \nIraqi forces as security conditions on the ground permit. That is \nhappening. It is happening province by province. That wasn't foreseen \nquite as clearly by the authors of the Iraq Study Group report. I am \nnot sure any of us saw it. General Petraeus was wise enough to see it. \nHe is helping Iraq have a transition of mission of U.S. forces from \nmainly combat to mainly support, training, and equipping. But the Iraq \nStudy Group itself, while it set a goal for that shift of mission, \nexplicitly rejected the idea of a deadline. As the Senator from Alabama \nsaid earlier, it explicitly rejected the idea of a deadline.\n  The second recommendation of the Iraq Study Group was that we \nmaintain a long term, but diminishing, presence in Iraq, with an \nemphasis on diminishing. That is happening. Troops are coming out \ninstead of troops going in. Now, they are not coming out as rapidly as \nmany had hoped, but they are coming out. They are coming out in the \nspirit of the Iraq Study Group report--not as rapidly as the report \noriginally recommended, but as quickly as conditions on the ground will \nnow permit. The limited mission the Iraq Study Group envisioned, in \naddition to supporting Iraqi forces, includes protection of coalition \nforces, counterterrorism operations, border security, intelligence-\nsharing, supporting provisional reconstruction teams, and search and \nrescue.\n  Finally, the Iraq Study Group urged that we undertake a new \ndiplomatic offensive, that we step up regional and diplomatic efforts \nto press others in the region to help Iraq succeed. Well, that has been \nhappening. It may not be happening as rapidly as everyone in the \nChamber would like, but these efforts are well underway, with a more \nexpansive United Nations mission. But higher profile efforts are also \nneeded, including by the President.\n  So I would not stand here and say that the Iraq Study Group \nlegislation that Senator Salazar and I introduced--supported by eight \nDemocrats and eight Republicans, and which we unsuccessfully urged the \nPresident and this body to adopt a year ago--I would not say we should \ndo that today. But I would say as one Senator that I believe that is \nthe direction in which we are moving, and the Iraq Study Group has made \na significant contribution to that effort. I, frankly, believe the \nbipartisan approach here by those 16 Senators also helped move us in \nthat direction.\n  Now, Senator Feingold's proposal and the Iraq Study Group \nrecommendations are at odds. In the first place, the Feingold \nlegislation sets a 120-day deadline for changing the mission of our \nforces in Iraq and requiring a massive withdrawal. The bipartisan Iraq \nStudy Group specifically opposed such a deadline, saying that \ntransition should be, as I said, subject to unexpected developments in \nthe security situation on the ground.\n  The Feingold amendment and the Iraq Study Group differ in another \nway: the continuing mission for the troops. My reading of the Feingold \nbill says that it would prevent American troops from being embedded \nwith Iraqi forces, from securing Iraqi borders, from fighting \nterrorists who aren't known to be affiliated with al-Qaida, and \nperforming various intelligence operations. Those missions are all \nsupported by the Iraq Study Group. It is part of our long term, but \ndiminishing, role in Iraq.\n  As has been noted today, this is not a new subject for the Senate. We \nhave had perhaps three dozen votes on Iraq last year. Perhaps we should \nhave that many votes. What else is more important than Iraq? But at \nsome point, we have come to a conclusion, and I think on the issue of \nthe Feingold bill, this body, by a large majority, has already \nexpressed itself. There were four previous votes on similar--not \nexactly the same but similar--funding cut and withdrawal proposals \noffered by Senator Feingold. Those were on December 18, 2007, and 71 \nSenators voted against that Feingold amendment. Then, on October 3, \n2007, 68 Senators voted against that Feingold amendment. Then, on \nSeptember 20, 2007, 70 Senators voted against that Feingold amendment. \nThen, on May 16, 2007, 67 Senators voted against that Feingold \namendment.\n  We have 100 Senators, and 49 of us are Republicans. Not all of us \nagree on Iraq. So that meant that a substantial number of Democrats \nconsistently voted against those Feingold amendments.\n  So I know Senator Feingold is sincere and passionate in his beliefs, \nbut it would seem to me that four votes are enough on this subject, \nand--as important as it is--we could turn our attention to other \nissues. But if the majority leader, for whatever reason, feels a need \nto bring this issue to the floor of the Senate, then we are ready to \ntalk about it.\n  We are not all of one mind here, even on the Republican side. We have \nsome on this side of the aisle who said when the Iraq Study Group \nreport came out that it was a recipe for surrender. I disagreed with \nthat and said so publicly and said so privately to the President. He \nwas good enough to hear me out one-on-one. I find him to be a very good \nlistener.\n  I, for one, am enormously impressed with General Petraeus's \ncounterinsurgency strategy. I, like most of us, have had a chance to go \nto Iraq--in my case, two times to Iraq, and three times to Kuwait. I \nhave had a chance last year in August to visit with General Petraeus \nand General Odierno and to go into the outskirts of Baghdad and to see \nan area where our soldiers were in camp and to have dinner with a group\n\n[[Page S1191]]\n\nof sheiks. One of the sheiks' sons had been murdered in his front yard, \nand they were fed up with the al-Qaida terrorists and were convinced \nthat because the American forces were there, that the Iraqis could risk \ntheir lives by teaming with the American forces to run the terrorists \nout of town, which in many places they have done.\n\n  I still think it would have been better for our troops and it would \nsend a clear message to the enemy if we had, as an administration and \nas a Congress, embraced the Iraq Study Group Report because it said \nbasically what we are doing today. It said we need to change direction. \nWe need to, No. 1, shift our mission, which we are doing. It \nspecifically embraced the idea of a surge, if that was necessary. It \nrejected the idea of a specific deadline and said it should be subject \nto developments on the ground. It said we should identify a long-term \nbut diminishing presence in Iraq, which we have been doing as a \ncountry. The Iraq Study Group Report said also that we should step up \nour diplomatic efforts. Its goal--not its binding effect but its goal--\nwas that all of its recommendations could be accomplished more rapidly \nthan has been done. That is true. But at the same time, it recognized \nthat it was all subject to security developments on the ground.\n  So when we have a success--or it may be more accurate to say a series \nof small successes in a difficult arena such as Iraq--when we have \nmilitary leadership such as General Petraeus and his team who have \nstuck to a new counterinsurgency strategy--at least new to Iraq that \ntook our forces out of the Green Zone and placed them on the \noutskirts--when we have done that, then I think we ought to recognize \nthat for what it is.\n  I am glad to have this opportunity to talk about Iraq and the \nprogress we are making there. I hope we can make more there. I would \nlike for more of our Tennesseans to come home. In the National Guard \nalone, we have had more than 10,000 Tennesseans in Iraq, some for a \nyear, some twice, some three times. They are our uncles, and they are \nour aunts. They are our neighbors, our deputy sheriffs, the mayor of \nLexington, the postmaster from Robbinsville. They have mortgages. They \nhave kids. Ninety have died, 90 Tennesseans in this period of time. So \nit is good to have this discussion. If the majority leader wants to \nbring it up, we should. But I think at the same time we ought to \nrecognize it for what it is. We have changed direction. The troops are \ncoming out instead of going in. The mission is shifting. The role is \ndiminishing. It will be there for a long time, and the diplomatic \neffort is stepped up. If that is succeeding, then our country is \nsucceeding, and we can spend more time on other issues.\n\n\n                         Tornadoes in Tennessee\n\n  Now, if I may--I see the Senator from Florida may be wanting to \nspeak, and if he would indulge me another 3 or 4 minutes, I wish to \ndiscuss what has happened in Tennessee with tornadoes in the last \ncouple of weeks.\n  On the night of February 5, tornadoes began to hit Memphis at about 6 \no'clock. While many people were watching the Tennessee-Florida \nbasketball game safely in their homes, a tornado touched down in Macon \nCounty, TN, and stayed on the ground for 21 miles. More than two dozen \npeople were killed.\n  Prior to that, it hit in Jackson, TN, nearly wiping out Union \nUniversity. Fortunately, at Union University, president David Dockery \nhad conducted drills, and the students had enough warning to get to the \nsafest places in their dormitories, and no one was killed there. That \nwas not by accident; it was because of good leadership. It was also \nbecause of a good early-warning system.\n  The point of my remarks tonight is that we sometimes hear in \nconnection with disasters--particularly since Hurricane Katrina--that \nour disaster response system and our emergency response system isn't as \ngood as it should be. I can't speak to every case, but over the last 30 \nyears, as Governor for some years and in the Cabinet for 2 years and \nnow in the Senate, I have seen a lot of disasters and tragedies. I have \nnever seen an example where the local officials, the Governor of the \nState, and the President of the United States acted more rapidly, more \neffectively, or more humanely.\n  The Governor, Gov. Phil Bredesen of Tennessee, a Democrat, was on the \nscene immediately. He gathered all of his information--not too rapidly \nbecause he knows it needs to be accurate--and he had it to President \nBush on the night of February 7 at about 7 p.m. By 10 p.m. President \nBush had approved it--had called the Governor and approved individual \nand public assistance for five of the hardest hit counties. The \nGovernor then went on to commit that the State would pay half of the \nlocal share of the disaster aid that needs to be paid.\n  I went with the President and Congressman Gordon and Senator Corker \nto the Macon County area on the Friday after it hit. I visited Jackson \nlast week. What I found was that FEMA has already received 3,700 \napplications from 14 approved counties. FEMA has distributed $1.9 \nmillion in 14 counties. The first small business loan was approved on \nthe day I was there.\n  I visited those whose homes were blown away. It is a terrifying \nthought that in just 60 seconds everything is demolished. You don't \nknow where to hide. But I also visited with the emergency responding \nteam and a couple whose home was hit in Jackson, TN. They were told via \nthe television at 6 o'clock that the tornado was coming, and they were \ntold 10 minutes before it hit their house that if they lived on the \nnorth side of the interstate, the tornado would be there in 10 minutes, \nand it was. That was the kind of early warning system they had. And in \nMacon County, a tornado that hit at 9:30 at night has been anticipated. \nBy midnight, FEMA personnel from Atlanta were at the Tennessee border \nat Chattanooga. And by 7 a.m. the next morning, disaster recovery \ncenters were set up in Macon County.\n\n  I wish to express my admiration, first, for the local officials for \ndoing a first-rate job; second, to FEMA and TEMA, the Tennessee \nemergency management professionals who were there on the spot; third, \nto Governor Bredesen who could not have done a better, more thorough, \nmore sensitive job; and fourth, to the President and the Washington \nofficials who were on the ball.\n  It is important occasionally to find the good and praise it in \nGovernment service, and in this case, I believe--well, I know--every \nsingle person I talked with in the west Tennessee area or the Macon \nCounty area felt as if the Governor, the President, and the local \nofficials were doing everything they could to be helpful, and they were \ndeeply grateful for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I strongly oppose, as I have \nbefore, the legislation offered by the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  This bill would mandate a withdrawal of U.S. combat forces from Iraq \nand cut off funds for our troops 120 days after enactment. The one \nexception would be for a small force authorized only to carry out \nnarrowly defined missions. If this latest attempt sounds familiar, it \nshould--the majority has thus far engaged in no less than 40 \nlegislative attempts to achieve this misguided outcome. And, just like \nthe 40 votes that preceded this one, the result of this effort will \nundoubtedly be the same.\n  The reason is clear. To pass such legislation would be to court \ndisaster, and to set a date certain for the withdrawal of U.S. forces \nfrom Iraq, regardless of the conditions on the ground or the \nimplications for our national security, would be tantamount to setting \na date for surrender. Should we ignore the signs of real progress in \nIraq and legislate a premature end to our efforts there, the Congress \nwould be complicit in all the terrible and predictable consequences \nthat would ensue.\n  The Senate, in facing this choice time and again over the past year, \nhas voted against legislated surrender in Iraq. Instead, we have \ndecided to build on the clear successes of our new strategy and to give \nGEN David Petraeus and the troops under his command the time and \nsupport they have requested to carry out their mission. The interests \nof America, the future of the Iraqi people, and the stability of the \nMiddle East are the better for it.\n  But the Senate has come to this conclusion only after repeated \nattempts to do what the proponents of this bill would have us do \ntoday--bring the war in Iraq to a premature and disastrous\n\n[[Page S1192]]\n\nclose through legislative fiat. If ever there was a case for \nprecipitous withdrawal from Iraq--and I believe there never was--now is \nthe last time anyone should consider such a step. If abandoning Iraq \nwas a terrible idea when we were unsuccessful in our efforts there, it \nis a catastrophic proposal today, when we are winning.\n  The supporters of withdrawal said in 2007 that the surge could never \nwork, that extra American brigades could do nothing to bring greater \nsecurity to Iraq, that no new counterinsurgency strategy could succeed \nin protecting the population. We were losing in Iraq, they said, and \nnothing could change that. Some even declared that the war was already \nlost.\n  But they were wrong. As General Petraeus put it in his end of the \nyear letter to the troops, ``A year ago, Iraq was racked by horrific \nviolence and on the brink of civil war. Now, levels of violence and \ncivilian and military casualties are significantly reduced and hope has \nbeen rekindled in many Iraqi communities.'' In fact, the surge has \nsucceeded well beyond the projections of even most optimists. Let me \ncite a few examples.\n  In Baghdad, ethno-sectarian violence has fallen over 90 percent in a \nyear. IED attacks in Baghdad are down by 45 percent since February \n2007. The specter of civil war in Iraq's capital, a real threat when \nthe surge began, has retreated significantly. The capital's population \nhas begun to retake its streets, its schools, and its markets.\n  The remarkable progress is not confined only to Baghdad. Attacks have \ndecreased in 17 of 18 provinces in Iraq since the surge began. In the \ncountry as a whole, attacks are down by some 60 percent and stand at \nthe level experienced in early 2005 or even 2004. Car bombs across Iraq \nare down, the number of civilian deaths has fallen, and IED explosions \nare down, all by significant margins. Intelligence tips are up, \ndiscovery of weapons and explosive caches has increased, and al-Qaida \nis on the run, having been forced by U.S. and Iraqi troops out of the \nurban areas like Baghdad, Ramadi, Fallujah, and Baquba and into \nisolated rural areas. U.S. casualties, too, have fallen significantly, \neven in the midst of ongoing operations.\n  As GEN Barry McCaffrey put it in a recent report, Iraq is seeing \n``dramatically reduced levels of civilian sectarian violence, political \nassassinations, abductions, and small arms/indirect fire and IED \nattacks on U.S. and Iraqi Police and Army Forces. This is the \nunmistakable new reality . . . The national security debate must move \non to an analysis of why this new political and security situation \nexists--not whether it exists.''\n  In the face of such facts, it is beyond perplexing to see the \nproponents of this legislation seek not to consolidate our gains and \nensure that they continue but, rather, to force a troop withdrawal that \nwould reverse all of the achievements I just cited. Understanding what \nwe now know--that our military is making remarkable progress on the \nground, and that their commanders request from us the time and support \nnecessary to succeed in Iraq--it is inconceivable that we in Congress \nwould end this strategy just as it is succeeding.\n  This is not to say that all is rosy in Iraq. It is not, and neither I \nnor our military commanders make any such argument. The cumulative \nresults of nearly 4 years of mismanaged war cannot be reversed \novernight. Al-Qaida is on the run but has not disappeared, and we can \nexpect them to fight back. Fighting among Shia factions in the south \npresents a significant challenge, and violence and crime remain at \nunacceptably high levels in a number of areas. The road in Iraq \nremains, as it always has been, long and hard. But this is an argument \nfor continuing our successful strategy, not for abandoning it in favor \nof sure failure.\n  At some point last year, a few of the proponents of withdrawal from \nIraq began conceding that the surge was having tangible, positive \neffects. They went on to argue, however, that securing the population \nwas irrelevant, as the point of the surge was to see political progress \nand there had been none. Yet even while this new debate began, \npolitical progress at the local level took off across Iraq. Tens of \nthousands of Iraqis--most of them Sunnis who were, or would have been, \npart of the anticoalition insurgency--joined Concerned Local Citizens \ngroups and aligned themselves with our efforts. Moqtada al-Sadr \nannounced that the Mahdi army would observe a 6-month ceasefire, a \npledge he renewed just last week for an additional 6 months. In Anbar \nand elsewhere, local populations turned to the coalition and against \nal-Qaida, turning that province from Iraq's most dangerous into one of \nits safest.\n  In the face of these new facts, supporters of withdrawal changed \ntheir argument yet again. Maybe the surge had brought about greater \nsecurity, they said, and perhaps this had helped generate political \nprogress at the local level, as counterinsurgency doctrine would \nsuggest. But this was irrelevant, they said, so long as national level \npolitical reconciliation is lacking--and since we can never expect \nthat, the troops must leave.\n  Yet they were wrong again. In January, the Iraqi Parliament passed \nthe long-awaited debaathification law that restores the eligibility of \nthousands of former party members for government jobs lost because of \ntheir Baathist affiliation. Earlier this month, a provincial powers law \npassed that devolves a significant amount of power to the provinces and \nmandates new provincial elections by October 1 of this year. The \nParliament passed a partial amnesty for detainees that can facilitate \nreconciliation among the sects, and it completed a landmark 2008 \nbudget.\n\n  Again, these significant achievements come coupled with remaining \nchallenges. Parliament has yet to pass an oil law, though oil revenues \nare being shared in its absence; the Maliki government remains \nunwilling to function and provide services as it must, and other \ndifficulties abound. Yet it is telling that in his latest report, \nmilitary analyst Anthony Cordesman said, ``No one can spend some 10 \ndays visiting the battlefields in Iraq without seeing major progress in \nevery area . . . If the U.S. provides sustained support to the Iraqi \ngovernment--in security, governance, and development--there is now a \nvery real chance that Iraq will emerge as a secure and stable state.''\n  No one can guarantee success in Iraq or be certain about its \nprospects. We can be sure, however, that should the U.S. Congress \nsucceed in terminating the strategy by legislating an abrupt withdrawal \nand a transition to a new, less effective and more dangerous course--\nshould we do that, then we will fail for certain.\n  Let us make no mistake about the costs of such an American failure in \nIraq. Should Congress force a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq, it \nwould mark a new beginning, the start of a new, more dangerous effort \nto contain the forces unleashed by our disengagement. If we leave, we \nwill be back--in Iraq and elsewhere--in many more desperate fights to \nprotect our security and at an even greater cost in American lives and \ntreasure.\n  In his testimony before the Armed Services Committee in September, \nGeneral Petraeus referred to an August Defense Intelligence Agency \nreport that stated, ``. . . a rapid withdrawal would result in the \nfurther release of strong centrifugal forces in Iraq and produce a \nnumber of dangerous results, including a high risk of disintegration of \nthe Iraqi Security Forces; a rapid deterioration of local security \ninitiatives; al Qaeda--Iraq regaining lost ground and freedom of \nmaneuver; a marked increase in violence and further ethno-sectarian \ndisplacement and refugee flows; and exacerbation of already challenging \nregional dynamics, especially with respect to Iran.''\n  Those are the likely consequences of a precipitous withdrawal, and I \nhope that the supporters of such a move will tell us how they intend to \naddress the chaos and catastrophe that would surely follow such a \ncourse of action. Should we leave Iraq before there is a basic level of \nstability, we invite chaos, genocide, terrorist safehavens and regional \nwar. We invite further Iranian influence at a time when Iranian \noperatives are already moving weapons, training fighters, providing \nresources, and helping plan operations to kill American soldiers and \ndamage our efforts to bring stability to Iraq. If our notions of \nnational security have any meaning, they cannot include permitting the \nestablishment of an Iranian dominated Middle East that is roiled\n\n[[Page S1193]]\n\nby wider regional war and riddled with terrorist safehavens.\n  The supporters of this amendment claim that they do not by any means \nintend to cede the battlefield to al-Qaida; on the contrary, their \nlegislation would allow U.S. forces, presumably holed up in forward \noperating bases, to carry out ``targeted operations, limited in \nduration and scope, against members of al Qaeda and affiliated \ninternational terrorist organizations.'' But such a provision draws a \nfalse distinction between terrorism and sectarian violence, between \ncounterterrorism and counterinsurgency. Moving in with search and \ndestroy missions to kill and capture terrorists, only to immediately \ncede the territory to the enemy, is the failed strategy of the war's \nfirst 4 years. We should not, and must not, return to such a disastrous \ncourse.\n  Americans were divided over this war from the beginning, and we \nremain so today. All of us want our troops to come home, and to come \nhome as soon as possible. But how we leave--that is of the utmost \nimportance. We must not leave, as the supporters of this amendment \nwould have it, in a way that erodes all the security gains that our \nbrave men and women have fought so hard to achieve and in a way that \nputs us on the road to surrender. The stakes are too high, we have come \ntoo far and sacrificed too much for that. Instead of surrendering, we \nshould persevere with the pursuit of our strategic objectives: to \ndefeat al-Qaida, not be defeated by it; to implant in Iraq the forces \nof stability and tolerance, not chaos and civil war; to demonstrate \nthat America keeps its word with its friends and allies, rather than \nabandoning them to horrific consequences. The American soldiers we have \nsent to battle deserve to return to us with honor--the honor of victory \nthat is due all of those who have paid with the ultimate sacrifice.\n  Before I close, I would note that there will be another vote soon on \nthe motion to proceed to legislation requiring the administration to \ndevelop a new al-Qaida strategy within 60 days, and to report it to \nCongress. I oppose putting such a mandate in law for several reasons. \nThe National Security Act of 1947 requires the President to transmit to \nCongress each year a comprehensive report on the national security \nstrategy of the United States. Title 10 requires the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff to produce a national military strategy and to \nconduct a biennial review of that strategy, a review that was recently \ncompleted. The Chairman has indicated that a new national military \nstrategy is under development and, of course, the next President will \nbe required to issue a fresh national security strategy. In short there \nare, and will remain, a number of legislative requirements for security \nstrategies that include a counterterrorism approach.\n  Finally, this bill would attempt to limit the President's use of the \nmilitary by imposing dwell times for our forces. While I fully support \nthe goal of achieving sustainable dwell times for our Armed Forces, I \ndo not believe that we should try to force such a restriction on the \nPresident irrespective of any contravening interests.\n  Mr. President, as the debate over Iraq goes on, let us remember to \nwhom and what we owe our first allegiance--to the security of the \nAmerican people and to the ideals upon which our Nation was founded. \nThat responsibility is our dearest privilege, and to be judged by \nhistory to have discharged it honorably will, in the end, matter so \nmuch more to all of us than any fleeting glory of popular acclaim, \nelectoral advantage or office. I hope we might all have good reason to \nexpect a kinder judgment of our flaws and follies because when it \nmattered most we chose to put the interests of our great and good \nNation before our own and helped, in our own small way, preserve for \nall humanity the magnificent and inspiring example of an assured, \nsuccessful and ever advancing America and the ideals that make us still \nthe greatest Nation on Earth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns, shared \nby so many of my constituents in Pennsylvania and across the country, \nabout the war in Iraq and how our efforts there have exacted a direct \ncost on the fight against al-Qaida and its affiliates in Afghanistan.\n  The bills introduced today by Senator Feingold and Majority Leader \nReid have prompted an important debate about our national security. I \nbelieve it is our duty, as elected officials, to level with the \nAmerican people on the war in Iraq, both on the reality of the \nsituation on the ground and in the context of our Nation's broader \nstrategic priorities. We must speak truth to the anxiety of the \nAmerican people on what we are doing to make this country more secure.\n  Our Nation recently marked the 1-year anniversary of the President's \ndecision to initiate a troop escalation into Iraq. We are quickly \ncoming up on the fifth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq. As the \nPresident said in January of 2007, when announcing the goals of his \ntroop escalation, ``Iraqis will gain confidence in their leaders and \nthe government will have the breathing space it needs to make progress \nin other critical areas.'' Judged by those standards enunciated by the \nPresident himself, the surge has not worked. While we all welcome the \nreduction in violence, that metric was never the be-all and end-all in \ndetermining whether the surge worked.\n  Monday of this week, the Pentagon said it expected 140,000 U.S. \ntroops would remain in Iraq this July, 8,000 more troops than when the \nPresident's troop buildup began in January of 2007.\n  These extended troop deployments have imposed a significant toll on a \nU.S. military already stretched dangerously thin by this war. We have \nprovided Iraqis with some ``breathing space'' and violence in many \nparts of Iraq is, indeed, down. That fact is attributable to the fine \nmen and women of our armed services and to their skills as the finest \nfighting force in history. Yet Iraq is still not a secure Nation \nbecause progress on the essential tasks of political reconciliation has \nnot been achieved by the Iraqis. General Petraeus has been very clear \non this point: The war in Iraq can only be won politically, not \nmilitarily.\n  Although the Bush administration immediately praised the three reform \nmeasures recently passed by the Iraqi Parliament, the package served \nonly to postpone critical discussions on the future of the country and \nunderscore the fractured State of the Iraqi Government. The Parliament \napproved a 2008 budget, passed a provincial powers law defining a \ndivision of responsibility between the central government in Baghdad \nand regional authorities, and issued an amnesty bill that may free \nthousands of prisoners from the disaffected Sunni community. But the \npotential details and implementation of these laws, especially on the \namnesty bill, remain a critical question mark. What the Iraqi \nleadership failed to achieve and the decisions of Parliament chose to \nkick down the road, so to speak, is perhaps more notable than the \nshort-term successes. The government has yet to tackle the most \ndivisive issue in Iraq, and that is this: who controls the country's \noil and how to distribute the proceeds. To take the most egregious \nexample, the Kurdistan regional government in the north passed its own \noil law last August, signing dozens of contracts with international oil \nfirms, which the central government in Baghdad deems illegal. The \nIraqis have devised a de facto approach for splitting oil proceeds in \nthe short term, but that arrangement is vulnerable to breakdown at any \ntime.\n\n  Legislative accomplishments by the Iraqi Parliament are welcome but \ncan be very deceiving. So long as the very parliamentarians who passed \nthese recent bills cannot leave the Green Zone without fear of \nassassination attempts or suicide bombings, Iraq remains an unsecured \nnation.\n  Just as Iraqi progress on internal reconciliation is sorely lacking, \nI am also distressed by our short-term strategy of pacifying local \nactors in Iraq to improve security while ignoring the underlying \npolitical and sectarian fault line in Iraq. In short, this approach is \nnot sustainable and is undermining--undermining--our overarching \nobjective of national reconciliation.\n  At the same time we speak of bridging the sectarian divides, the U.S. \n``awakening strategy'' in western and central Iraq is arming Sunni \ntribal leaders and integrating former insurgents into the rough \nequivalent of militias--all in a process separate from and parallel to \nthe national armed forces of Iraq.\n\n[[Page S1194]]\n\n  As an article in Time magazine recently noted, a number of these \n``concerned local citizens'' militias, organized and supported by the \nU.S. military, are now turning on each other in a contest for influence \nand territory. The Shia-led central government views these armed \nmilitias as undermining its central authority and has balked at \nintegrating large numbers of Sunnis into the national Iraqi security \nforces. So at this point we must ask ourselves whether the U.S. \nGovernment, in service of a worthy but short-term objective of \nsuppressing violence in Iraq, is only paving the road for a large-scale \nfuture conflict by arming sectarian groups separate from the national \narmy and police. That is an important question we must consider.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, sometimes short and telling anecdotes tell \na story. We have read recently that the Iranian President, Mr. \nAhmadinejad, will make a visit to Baghdad next week for talks with \nPrime Minister al-Maliki and other officials. This visit has already \nbeen announced, with details of his itinerary available to the press \nand the public. By sharp contrast, when President Bush, Secretary Rice \nand/or Secretary Gates visit Iraq, they travel to Baghdad unannounced \nand rarely leave the fortified walls of the Green Zone.\n  Another example. When Senator Durbin and I visited Iraq last August, \nwe flew from the airport to the Green Zone in low-flying, fast-moving \nhelicopters practicing evasive maneuvers. Here is a question we should \nask ourselves: Why can the Iranian President drive in an open manner \ninto Baghdad while U.S. leaders must sneak into the country under the \ncloak of darkness? Five years into our occupation of Iraq, what does \nthis say about our role in Iraq and the security of that nation?\n  As Iraq continues to dominate the attention and resources of our \nGovernment, it clouds and confuses our long-term U.S. strategic \npriorities. I remain troubled, as so many others here remain troubled, \nthat a ``Declaration of Principles'' signed on November 26, 2007, by \nPresident Bush and Prime Minister al-Maliki commits our Nation to \n``providing security assurances and commitments to the Republic of Iraq \nto deter future aggression against Iraq that violates its sovereignty \nand integrity of its territories, waters, or airspace.'' That is what \nthe Declaration of Principles says in part.\n  Although Secretary Rice assured me during a recent Senate Foreign \nRelations hearing that no such commitments will be extended to Iraq, I \nremain deeply skeptical. In concert with my colleagues, I will continue \nto exercise vigorous oversight to ensure that President Bush does not \nlock the United States into a binding and long-term security commitment \nto Iraq.\n  It is time to refocus our energies and our efforts on the ``forgotten \nwar'' in Afghanistan. Our focus on Iraq has distracted from and \nundermined the central front in the war on terrorism.\n  ADM Mike Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recently \ntestified before Congress, and he said:\n\n       In Afghanistan, we do what we can. In Iraq, we do what we \n     must.\n\n  With all due respect to Admiral Mullen, he has it wrong. We should do \nwhat we must in both places.\n  We know that 6 years ago America was fighting and winning the war in \nAfghanistan, and al-Qaida and the Taliban were on the run. But instead \nof staying and accomplishing our mission in Afghanistan by hunting down \nthose who planned the 9/11 attacks, this administration diverted our \nattention to Iraq. Today, the Taliban has returned with a vengeance and \ncontrols more territory than at any time since its ouster in 2001. \nAfghanistan is on the brink of becoming yet again a failed state and \nthus a safe haven for al-Qaida to launch deadly attacks, including \nagainst the American homeland.\n  Three recent bipartisan reports on Afghanistan concluded that the \nsituation on the ground is dire. One report, coauthored by retired \ngeneral Jim Jones and Ambassador Thomas Pickering, puts it bluntly, and \nI quote in part:\n\n       The progress achieved after 6 years of international \n     engagement is under serious threat from resurgent violence, \n     weakening international resolve, mounting regional \n     challenges, and a growing lack of confidence on the part of \n     the Afghan people about the future direction of their \n     country. The United States and the international community \n     have tried to win the struggle in Afghanistan with too few \n     military forces and insufficient economic aid, and without a \n     clear and consistent comprehensive strategy.\n\n  That is the Jones and Pickering report from which I am quoting.\n  When Secretary of Defense Gates is forced to go public with \ncriticisms of the refusal of our NATO allies to deploy more forces in \nAfghanistan and his skepticism of their ability to conduct \ncounterinsurgency operations, we must admit that the situation on the \nground is getting worse in Afghanistan, not better. Military officials \nexpect the coming year to be even more deadly, as the Taliban becomes \nmore deadly and deploys greater numbers of suicide bombers and roadside \nexplosives. U.S. forces remain largely isolated in Afghanistan, with \nkey NATO allies refusing to provide ground support and imposing onerous \nrestrictions on where and how they can fight. The end result is that \nthe very future of NATO, the most successful alliance in modern \nhistory, is now in grave danger.\n\n  In a welcome display of straight-talk, Secretary Gates admitted that \nthe very reason large segments of the European public do not support \nNATO operations in Afghanistan is due to their antipathy toward U.S. \npolicy in Iraq. Secretary Gates recently asserted in Munich:\n\n       Many of them, I think, have a problem with our involvement \n     in Iraq and project that to Afghanistan, and do not \n     understand the very different--for them--the very different \n     kind of threat.\n\n  That is what Secretary Gates said recently.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude with this thought: The war in Iraq has \nindeed strained our military, limiting the number of combat divisions \nwe can provide in Afghanistan. It has undermined our global leadership, \ndepriving us of the moral authority to demand more of our allies, and \nit has diverted the attention of our senior military and civilian \nleadership, allowing the Taliban to mount a comeback under our very \neyes. We are losing a war we cannot afford to lose in a futile and \nmisguided effort to force success in another conflict that can only be \nwon politically, not militarily. Our priorities are tragically \nmistaken, and our Nation is paying a severe cost.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, S. Res. 460 concerns a civil action filed in \nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The National \nAssociation of Manufacturers is challenging the constitutionality of \nsection 207 of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, \nwhich amended the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 to strengthen the \nreporting requirements for coalitions and associations that engage in \nlobbying activities.\n  As amended, the law mandates that registrants disclose the members of \ntheir organization that contribute more than $5,000 in a quarterly \nperiod to the lobbying activities of the organization and ``actively \nparticipate in the planning, supervision, or control of such \nactivities.'' Under prior law, disclosure was required of those members \nwho contributed at least $10,000 for lobbying semiannually but only if \nthose members ``in whole or in major part'' planned, supervised, or \ncontrolled such lobbying activities.\n  The plaintiff National Association of Manufacturers alleges that its \nmembers face sustained injury to their first amendment rights, \nincluding their right to anonymous policy speech, and seeks to prevent \nthe enhanced disclosure requirements from taking effect\n\n[[Page S1195]]\n\non the initial quarterly period filing date, April 21, 2008.\n  NAM named as defendants the U.S. attorney for the District of \nColumbia, the Secretary of the Senate, and the Clerk of the House. The \nSecretary and the Clerk are responsible for providing guidance and \nassistance on lobbying disclosure requirements, receiving lobbying \nregistration and report filings, reviewing, inquiring, and verifying \nthe accuracy of the filings without investigating, notifying lobbyists \nthat appear not to be in compliance with the law, and notifying the \nU.S. attorney of lobbyist who have been so notified and have failed to \nsubmit an appropriate response. The U.S. attorney has the duty to \nenforce the disclosure requirements through civil, and, under the new \nlaw, criminal, actions.\n  This resolution authorizes the Senate legal counsel to represent the \nSecretary of the Senate to defend the constitutionality of the lobbying \ndisclosure amendment in the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act \nand to seek dismissal of the action, in conjunction with counsel for \nthe House of Representatives and the Department of Justice.\n  Senate counsel will present to the court the bases for the Congress's \njudgment, after more than a dozen years of experience under the \nLobbying Disclosure Act, that enhanced reporting requirements are \nnecessary to inform Congress and the public of the identity of those \norganizations actively participating in lobbying the Federal \nGovernment. As Justice Louis Brandeis famously wrote, ``Sunlight is \nsaid to be the best of disinfectants.''\n  The lobbying amendments enacted last year were an important part of \nthe Congress's efforts to restore public confidence through integrity \nand openness in Government and lobbying activities. Disclosure of the \nidentities of organizations that actively participate in supervising or \nplanning lobbying campaigns will yield a sizable public benefit while \nimposing a modest burden on the exercise of the right of organizations \nsuch as the National Association of Manufacturers freely to associate \nto petition the Government in furtherance of their legislative agenda.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/26/senate-section/article/S1195-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING DENISE ANN PHOENIX\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Denise Ann \nPhoenix, a role model, native Nevadan, and hero. Ms. Phoenix, known by \nher nickname ``Auntie,'' devoted her life to improving her Native \nAmerican community and promoting child safety. Following in the \nfootsteps of her father, Leroy Phoenix, Sr., she pursued a career in \nlaw enforcement and became one of few women to serve as an investigator \nwith the Bureau of Indian Affairs. She died in the line of duty on \nFebruary 14, 2008, after coming into contact with an unidentified \nsubstance and contracting a fatal lung disease. She was 42 years old.\n  Ms. Phoenix grew up on the Pyramid Lake Paiute Reservation in \nnorthern Nevada. After graduating from Sparks High School, she began \nher career as a tribal ranger on the reservation and later became BIA \nchief of police of Carson City, NV. She emphasized the importance of \ncommunity-oriented policing and her service was exemplary. She will \ncontinue to be an inspirational example to young Native American women.\n  The dedication Ms. Phoenix demonstrated as an officer was \ncomplemented by her dedication to children. In 2000, she lost her own \nchildren, Shasta and Justin, along with her brother Ronald, to a car \naccident along the Pyramid Highway in Sparks, NV. In response to this \ndevastating tragedy, she established youth outreach programs in her \nchildren's memory. She was also instrumental in getting a median \ndivider installed on the stretch of road where the accident occurred, \nonce again showing her profound commitment to the safety of others.\n  Though I am saddened by her passing, I share with this body my \ngratitude for her devotion to her community. I also extend to her \nfamily, friends, and colleagues my condolences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/26/senate-section/article/S1195-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1195-S1196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PRESERVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE GENERICS ACT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the following \nletter from the Justice Department commenting on S. 316, the Preserve \nAccess to Affordable Generics Act, printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                               Office of, legislative Affairs,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 12, 2008.\n     Senator Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: This responds to your request for the \n     Department's views regarding the competitive implications of \n     S. 316, the ``Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act.'' \n     S. 316 addresses the issue of reverse payments associated \n     with the settlement or resolution of an infringement lawsuit \n     in the context of the Hatch-Waxman Act. The bill would make \n     it a per se violation of the antitrust laws to be a party to \n     an agreement in which an Abbreviated New Drug Application \n     (ANDA) filer receives value and agrees not to research, \n     develop, manufacture, market, or sell the ANDA product for \n     any period of time. The Department believes that the bill \n     addresses a serious competition issue, but, for the reasons \n     discussed below, the Department has concerns with this bill \n     as drafted.\n       As an initial matter, there is the potential for such \n     settlements to be anticompetitive. For example, if the \n     potential losses in profits due to increased competition from \n     entry by the ANDA filer are large, the ANDA filer may be \n     persuaded to drop a strong claim of patent invalidity or non-\n     infringement in return for significant payments. As described \n     below, however, settlements between an ANDA filier and the \n     patent holder also can benefit consumer welfare. Accordingly, \n     the Department of Justice does not believe per se liability \n     under the antitrust laws is the appropriate standard. Per se \n     liability generally is reserved for only those agreements \n     that unequivocally have an anticompetitive effect, while a \n     rule of reason analysis is better suited to instances when \n     the economic impact of the agreement is less certain. In this \n     context, per se illegality could increase investment risk and \n     litigation costs to all parties. These factors run the risk \n     of deterring generic challenges to patents, delaying entry of \n     competition from generic drugs, and undermining incentives to \n     create new and better drug treatments or studying additional \n     uses for existing drugs.\n       The United States has a strong policy of encouraging \n     settlement of litigation. A settlement reduces the time and \n     expense of litigation, which can be quite substantial. \n     Further, it reduces the uncertainty associated with the \n     pending litigation. A settlement can thereby free up \n     management time and resources and reduce risk, enabling a \n     company to focus on developing new and better products.\n       The Hatch-Waxman Act context presents a distinct set of \n     circumstances, but settlements creates a structure designed \n     to encourage generic drug makers to challenge these patent \n     rights by asserting either that the relevant patents are not \n     valid or that the generic version would not infringe the \n     patents. Among other things, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides an \n     opportunity for the generic company and the patent holder to \n     litigate those issues prior to the generic's launch of a \n     potentially infringing product. Thus, unlike most patent \n     litigation in which the patent holder has a claim for \n     damages, the patent holder in the Hatch-Waxman context \n     typically has no claim for damages because the generic \n     company has not yet launched a product.\n       In any patent litigation, the principle means available to \n     the patent holder to induce the generic company to settle the \n     litigation is to offer something of value. If the patent \n     holder has a damages claim for infringement, it can offer to \n     reduce or waive its damages. However, in the Hatch-Waxman \n     context the patent holder typically has no damages claim, so \n     its only means of offering value to induce a settlement is to \n     offer to transfer something of value, such as cash or other \n     assets. Under S. 316, the only value that a patent holder \n     could offer to settle a patent infringement claim would be \n     ``the right to market the ANDA product prior to the \n     expiration of the patent'' at issue (i.e., waiving its patent \n     rights in whole or in part). The per se liability under S. \n     316 eliminates any other transfer of value if the settlement \n     also includes a provision requiring the generic company to \n     respect for any period of time the patent holder's right to \n     exclude under the patent. The net result may be to reduce the \n     likelihood of potentially beneficial settlements and to \n     increase the risk that a generic company would need to \n     litigate a case to judgment (and through an appeal in many \n     instances). Patent holders would face greater disincentives \n     to investing in research and development of new and better \n     treatments if they had to litigate every challenge to a \n     judgment and through an appeal. Further, such litigation can \n     take many years to complete and will divert the time, \n     attention and resources of both parties during that time.\n       Settlement should not serve as a vehicle to enable patent \n     holders to preserve or expand invalid or non-infringed \n     patents by dividing anticompetitive profits with settling \n     challengers. However, the public policy favoring settlements, \n     and the statutory right of patentees to exclude competition \n     within the scope of their patents, would potentially be\n\n[[Page S1196]]\n\n     frustrated by a rule that subjected patent settlements \n     involving reverse payments to automatic or near-automatic \n     invalidation. These competing considerations suggest that an \n     appropriate legal standard should take into account the \n     relative likelihood of success of the parties' claims and the \n     potential benefits of a settlement in a given situation. It \n     is important that parties maintain the ability to settle, and \n     that the law permit flexibility for settlement negotiations \n     to capture efficient agreements that are motivated by \n     legitimate business objectives rather than anticompetitive \n     goals.\n       Finally, we note that subsection 4(a) of the bill appears \n     to contain a typographical error. We believe that the \n     intended reference to the United States Code should be ``21 \n     U.S.C. 355 note'' (rather than section ``3155'').\n       Thank you for the opportunity to present our views. Please \n     do not hesitate to call upon us if we may be of additional \n     assistance. The Office of Management and Budget has advised \n     us that, from the perspective of the Administration's \n     program, there is no objection to submission of this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Brian A.

Mr. Presdient, since my last statement on the need for \nprompt congressional action to address incidents involving threatening \nconduct and, too often, deadly acts of violence at our schools and \ncollege campuses nationwide, the violent incidents have continued, with \ntragic results.\n  In the week between February 8 and February 15, there were at least \nfour incidents at schools and universities resulting in death or \nserious injury to victims of all ages.\n  On February 8, a female student killed two other students, and then \nherself, inside a classroom on the campus of Louisiana Technical \nCollege in Baton Rouge. Three days later, a student at Mitchell High \nSchool in Memphis, TN, was left in critical condition after a violent \nincident in the school's cafeteria. The day after that, a 15-year-old \nboy at E.O. Green Junior High in Oxnard, CA, was critically wounded by \na classmate. He was later declared brain dead.\n  Then, on February 14, tragedy struck at Northern Illinois University. \nA former student opened fire in a geology class, killing 5 students and \nwounding 16, before killing himself. As hundreds of mourners remembered \none of the Northern Illinois University victims at a funeral service on \nFebruary 19, more than 1,000 Virginia Tech students gathered in \nsolidarity for a candlelight vigil in Blacksburg, VA.\n  It has been over 10 months since the horrific incident at Virginia \nTech resulted in the tragic deaths of 32 students and faculty members, \nand serious injuries to many other innocent victims. During that time, \nwe have seen a barrage of new incidents at our schools and college \ncampuses nationwide.\n  The Judiciary Committee reported out the School Safety and Law \nEnforcement Improvement Act of 2007, S. 2084, more than 6 months ago to \naddress these incidents. Regrettably, the Senate has failed to take up \nand pass that bill to improve school safety. This comprehensive \nlegislation should be considered and passed without further delay.\n  In originating the bill more than 6 months ago, the Judiciary \nCommittee showed deference to Governor Tim Kaine and the task forces at \nwork in Virginia, and sought to complement their work and \nrecommendations. Working with several Senators, including Senators \nBoxer, Reed, Specter, Feingold, Schumer, and Durbin, the committee \noriginated this bill and reported it at the start of the 2007 academic \nyear. My hope was that Congress would adopt these critical school \nsafety improvements last fall.\n  The recent incidents at E.O. Green Junior High, Mitchell High School, \nLA, Technical College and Northern Illinois University are just a few \nof the tragic events that have claimed the lives or resulted in serious \ninjuries to students in the past few months. Since this bill was \nreported out of the Judiciary Committee, we have seen tragic deaths at \nDelaware State University and the University of Memphis, and grievous \ninjuries sustained by students and teachers at SuccessTech Academy in \nCleveland, OH. We have also seen numerous lockdowns nationwide as a \nresult of threatening conduct in our schools, including recent \nlockdowns at Fern Creek High School in Louisville, KY, and St. Peter's \nCollege in Jersey City, NJ.\n  The School Safety and Law Enforcement Improvement Act would address \nthe problem of violence in our schools in several ways. The bill \nauthorizes Federal assistance for programs to improve the safety and \nsecurity of our schools and institutions of higher education, provides \nequitable benefits to law enforcement serving those institutions \nincluding bulletproof vests, and funds pilot programs to develop \ncutting-edge prevention and intervention programs for our schools. The \nbill also clarifies and strengthens two existing statutes--the \nTerrorist Hoax Improvements Act and the Law Enforcement Officers Safety \nAct--which are designed to improve public safety.\n  Specifically, the bill would improve the safety and security of \nstudents both at the elementary and secondary school level and on \ncollege and university campuses. The K-12 improvements are drawn from a \nbill that Senator Boxer introduced last April, and I want to thank \nSenator Boxer for her hard work on this issue. The improvements include \nincreased funding for much-needed infrastructure changes to improve \nsecurity as well as the establishment of hotlines and tip-lines, which \nwill enable students to report potentially dangerous situations to \nschool administrators before they occur.\n  To address the new realities of campus safety in the wake of Virginia \nTech and more recent college incidents, the bill also creates a \nmatching grant program for campus safety and security to be \nadministered out of the COPS Office of the Department of Justice. The \ngrant program would allow institutions of higher education to apply, \nfor the first time, directly for Federal funds to make school safety \nand security improvements. The program is authorized to be appropriated \nat $50,000,000 for the next 2 fiscal years. While this amounts to just \nthree dollars per student each year, it will enable schools to more \neffectively respond to dangerous situations on campus.\n  The bill would also make sworn law enforcement officers who work for \nprivate institutions of higher education and rail carriers eligible for \ndeath and disability benefits, and for funds administered under the \nByrne grant program and the bulletproof vest partnership grant program. \nProviding this equitable treatment is in the best interest of our \nNation's educators and students, and will serve to place the support of \nthe Federal Government behind the dedicated law enforcement officers \nwho serve and protect private colleges and universities nationwide. I \ncommend Senator Jack Reed for his leadership in this area.\n  The bill helps law enforcement by making improvements to the Law \nEnforcement Officers Safety Act of 2003, LEOSA. These amendments to \nexisting law will streamline the system by which qualified retired and \nactive officers can be certified under LEOSA. It serves us all when we \npermit qualified officers, with a demonstrated commitment to law \nenforcement and no adverse employment history, to protect themselves, \ntheir families, and their fellow citizens wherever those officers may \nbe.\n  The bill focuses on prevention as well, by incorporating the \nPRECAUTION Act at the request of Senators Feingold and Specter. This \nprovision authorizes grants to develop prevention and intervention \nprograms for our schools.\n  Finally, the bill incorporates the Terrorist Hoax Improvements Act of \n2007, at the request of Senator Kennedy.\n  The Senate should move forward and act. The Virginia Tech Review \nPanel--a body commissioned by Governor Kaine to study the Virginia Tech \ntragedy--has already issued its findings based on a 4-month long \ninvestigation of the incident and its aftermath. This bill would adopt \na number of recommendations from the review panel aimed at improving \nschool safety. We must not miss this opportunity to implement these \ninitiatives nationwide, and to take concrete steps to ensure the safety \nof our kids. I hope the Senate will promptly move forward to invest in \nthe safety of our students and better support law enforcement officers \nacross the country by considering and passing the School Safety and Law \nEnforcement Improvement Act of 2007.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/26/senate-section/article/S1197-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1197]]\n                        THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the \nfloor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our \ncountry.\n  In the early morning hours of February 15, 2008, a young man and his \nfriend were passing through Temple University's campus in Philadelphia, \nPA, when they found themselves in a physical fight with four Temple \nstudents. According to reports, the two non-Temple students were \nstanding in front of a traditionally Jewish fraternity house when they \nwere accosted by the four attackers. One of the four allegedly asked \nthe two visitors if they were Jewish. When they replied that they were \nnot, one of the Temple students evidently began to yell, ``We hate \nJews! We hate Jews!'' According to police, one of the two victims was \nseriously injured and suffered a broken nose and fractured right eye \nsocket. Temple released a letter characterizing the incident as a hate \ncrime. The attackers have been suspended pending a University \nDisciplinary Committee hearing, while Philadelphia police are pursuing \ncriminal charges and have issued warrants for the suspects' arrest.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws \nintended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes \nmotivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would \nbetter equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by \nprotecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens \nalready covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this \nlegislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/26/senate-section/article/S1197-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INDIAN HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

It is critical to strengthen the provision \nof care, through the Indian Health Service, IHS, to American Indian and \nAlaska Native populations, who suffer from significant health \ndisparities compared to the general U.S. population, including a life \nexpectancy that is 2.4 years lower, and significantly higher death \nrates from tuberculosis, alcoholism, diabetes, suicide, and infant \nmortality.\n  The Indian Health Service derives its authorities from the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act and its mission is to improve the health \nstatus of American Indians and Alaskan Natives by constructing, \nmaintaining, and managing health care delivery and sanitation systems \nthrough a network of 49 hospitals, 6,500 IHS, tribal, and private \ncontract facilities. The IHS provides ambulatory, emergency, dental, \nand preventative health services to 58 percent of the 3.3 million \nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives; however, it is confronting these \nchallenges with significant health care workforce shortages. Anywhere \nfrom 12 to 32 percent of positions for dentists, nurses, optometrists, \nphysicians, and pharmacists, among other health professionals, are \ncurrently vacant. Thus, the passage of this legislation is critical to \nstrengthening the IHS and providing critical services to American \nIndians and Alaskan Natives.\n  Specifically, the reauthorization will improve the recruitment and \nretention of health providers in the IHS, provide support for American \nIndians and Alaska Natives to enter the health professions, provide \nfunds for the construction of health and sanitation facilities, expand \nMedicare, Medicaid, and CHIP reimbursement and enrollment to all \nAmerican Indians and Native Alaskans health programs, eliminate \nMedicare and CHIP cost-sharing and premiums for American Indians and \nNative Alaskans served by tribal health programs, improve IHS \ninformation systems, billing, and patient care and training, mandate \nthat the Departments of the Interior and Health and Human Services \ndesign a comprehensive approach to behavioral health assessment, \ntreatment, and prevention services, establish a National Bi-Partisan \nCommission on Indian Health Care to study the delivery of services to \nAmerican Indians and Native Alaskans, require an annual report to \nCongress on the enrollment and health status of American Indians and \nNative Alaskans served by Federal health programs, reauthorize the \nIndian Health Care Improvement Fund to support health promotion and \ndisease prevention programs, cancer screenings, epidemiological and \nhealth services research, and catastrophic healthcare, and modernize \nhealth care delivery for American Indian and Native Alaskan seniors \nrequiring long-term care, hospice, home/community-based care, and \nassisted living.\n  I commend the work of both the Senate Indian Affairs and Finance \nCommittees and, most importantly, Senators Dorgan and Murkowski for \ntheir leadership and commitment to this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/26/senate-section/article/S1197-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1197-S1198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       HONORING THE 4TH BRIGADE COMBAT TEAM, 1ST CAVALRY DIVISION\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the outstanding \nservice of the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, as they \ncomplete their service in Iraq and return to their loving families.\n  I am so proud of the brave servicemembers of the 4-1 Cavalry who have \nsacrificed so much to keep our Nation safe. I also appreciate the \ncommitment of their family members, who have borne a heavy burden to \nadvance the cause of liberty. All of them deserve our sincere \nappreciation and gratitude.\n  Since September 11, 2001, our Nation has been at war with terrorists \nwho are determined to kill innocent Americans and destroy freedom \naround the world. We cannot let that happen. Our country has the \ngreatest capacity and will to fight for freedom. If freedom dies in \nAmerica, it will die throughout the world. I have no doubt we will win \nthis war because our Nation is blessed to have heroes like the \ncourageous men and women of the 4-1 Cavalry.\n  The 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division command team, \nconsists of COL Stephen Twitty and CSM Stephan Frennier. The brigade \ncombat team is a relatively new unit that activated on October 18, \n2005, at Fort Bliss, TX. The subordinate units consist of the 1st \nBattalion, 9th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, \n2nd Battalion, 12th Cavalry Regiment, 5th Battalion, 82nd Field \nArtillery Regiment, 4th Brigade Special Troops Battalion, and the 27 \nBrigade Support Battalion.\n  The 4th Brigade Combat Team received orders to deploy to Iraq in \nsupport of Operation Iraqi Freedom in July of 2006. Upon completion of \nmission readiness exercises and a rotation at the national training \ncenter, the 4-1 Cavalry began to deploy in September of 2006.\n  By their first anniversary, the 4-1 Cavalry arrived in Ninewa \nProvince, the second largest province in Iraq. The 2-12 Cavalry \ndeployed to Baghdad to augment the 1st Infantry Division.\n  The brigade headquarters was based in Mosul, Ninewa's provincial \ncapital, which is the site of the biblical city of Ninewa. The \nprovince, slightly larger than the State of Maryland, is in the extreme \nnorthern part of Iraq. It borders Syria to the west and is comprised of \nSunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, Turkmen, and Christians. The mission of the 4-\n1 Cavalry was to build capable Iraqi security forces, to conduct \ncounterinsurgency operations in order to neutralize anti-Iraqi forces \nand to transition responsibility for defeating the insurgency to the \nIraqi security forces, and the provincial government. They performed \nthat mission superbly.\n  Despite being subjected to IEDs, VBIEDs, and small arms fire, the \nmembers of the 4-1 Cavalry did an outstanding job protecting the people \nof Ninewa Province. Due to their professionalism and courage, attacks \nin the province went from 15 to 18 per day in December of 2006 to 7 to \n9 attacks per day by September of 2007. In conjunction with their Iraqi \ncounterparts, they\n\n[[Page S1198]]\n\nalso found several tons of military grade weapons and IED-making \nmaterial and detained over 1,500 insurgents. Altogether, they overcame \nnumerous challenges, and through courage and dedication, they succeeded \nbeyond anyone's expectations. They have much to be proud of.\n  On February 27, 2008, the city of El Paso will hold a parade to honor \nthe brave men and women of the 4-1 Cavalry. Our Nation is a better \nplace because of their service and sacrifice on behalf of a noble \ncause. We can never forget them or their family members. We honor their \nstruggles and successes in that mission.\n  It is with sincere gratitude that I recognize them today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/26/senate-section/article/S1198-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL PEACE CORPS WEEK\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate National \nPeace Corps Week and to honor more than 190,000 Peace Corps Volunteers \nfrom both my home State of New Mexico and across the Nation. Each year \nthese courageous men and women embark on a 2 year journey to help \ndevelop the societies of 139 countries around the world.\n  Almost 47 years ago, then Senator John F. Kennedy challenged students \nat the University of Michigan to serve their country by peaceably \nliving and working to develop another country. Over the years, \nvolunteers have made significant and lasting contributions around the \nworld by educating people on basic health issues, performing youth \noutreach, developing businesses, and offering assistance to small \nfarmers to increase food production.\n  Today, over 8,000 volunteers are serving in the communities of 74 \ncountries. Many Peace Corps volunteers from New Mexico are currently \nposted in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Honduras. Volunteers range in age from \n25 to 80, with varying levels of education including individuals with \nundergraduate and graduate degrees. Additionally, the Peace Corps \noffers programs that support academic studies once a term of service \nhas concluded, which allows many volunteers to further their education \nafter their self-sacrificing service.\n  The experience volunteers take back with them from their host \ncountries helps shape the course of their lives. Lifelong connections \nand friendships span these gaps of distance, and volunteers have the \nsatisfaction of not only a job well done, but also of the positive \nimage they created for our Nation.\n  Throughout this week of celebration, I encourage Americans to ask \nthemselves, ``What can I do for my country?''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/26/senate-section/article/S1198-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n        UNITED STATES ARMY'S RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES INITIATIVE\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am proud to recognize a truly \nsuccessful program that, over the past decade, has made important \ncontributions to improving quality of life for our soldiers and their \nfamilies. Now entering its 10th year, the Residential Communities \nInitiative, or RCI, has brought together members of the private real \nestate community and the Army to build new family housing, and upgrade \nand modernize existing family housing, on flagship Army bases all \nacross the country.\n  Back in 1996, the Army faced the enormous and costly challenge of \nreplacing and renovating its aging and substandard family housing. Too \nmany soldiers and their families were living in inadequate housing. \nAccording to the Army itself, roughly 70 percent of housing needed \nreplacement or renovation at an estimated cost of $7 billion. It was \nclear that action had to be taken, and in 1996, Congress established \nthe framework for what would become the Residential Communities \nInitiative when it authorized the Military Housing Privatization \nInitiative.\n  Under the MHPI umbrella, the Residential Communities Initiative was \npresented in 1999 as one significant component of the Army's plan to \naddress this challenge of overhauling inadequate family housing. Thanks \nin large part to the visionary leadership and hard work of my friends, \nCongressman Chet Edwards of Texas and then-Assistant Secretary of the \nArmy for Installations, Logistics and Environment Mahlon Apgar, RCI \nsuccessfully navigated both the Pentagon bureaucracy and a maze of \ncongressional committees to come to fruition.\n  Congressman Edwards's advocacy of RCI was particularly important and \nis just one example of his many successful efforts to improve quality \nof life for our troops and veterans. Congressman Edwards works on these \ncritical issues as cochairman of both the House Army Caucus and the USO \nCongressional Caucus. Most recently, in 2007, as chairman of the \nMilitary Construction and Veterans' Affairs Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Congressman Edwards authored the largest VA budget \nincrease in the VA's 77-year history.\n  Indeed, both Congressman Edwards and Secretary Apgar should be proud \nof what their efforts have since spawned. RCI has made, or will be \nmaking, its way to 45 different Army installations all across the \nUnited States, from Fort Lewis in Washington State to Fort Hood in \nTexas to Fort Drum and Fort Hamilton in my home State of New York. At \neach of these bases, RCI has helped to provide our soldiers and their \nfamilies with the kind of modern, quality housing choices that they \ndeserve. In less than 10 years, more than 86,000 houses have been \ntransferred to public-private partnerships under RCI, and thousands of \nArmy families have already benefited from renovation and new \nconstruction completed under RCI.\n  This initiative has not only been good for our soldiers and their \nfamilies but also for American taxpayers. In the last decade, more than \n$10 billion of new private capital has been invested under the RCI \nprogram, compared with roughly $1 billion in government equity. In \nother words, RCI has produced a ten-fold return on our public \ninvestment.\n  With so many of our brave servicemembers serving the Nation in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and elsewhere around the world, it is our responsibility \nto ensure that they and their families have all of the support that \nthey need and deserve here at home. This not only includes the best \nhealth care available but also modern, clean, and comfortable housing \nchoices. I invite my fellow Senators from both sides of the aisle to \njoin me in applauding the Residential Communities Initiative and its \nearly champions, Chet Edwards and Mahlon Apgar, for doing so much to \nenhance quality of life for our Army families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/26/senate-section/article/S1198-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1198-S1199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING FALLEN HEROES\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK.

In addition to the U.S. Senate, \nclose to 50 national, State, and local agencies and organizations and \nmany Governors also participated in the awareness efforts this year. \nDomestic violence and legal advocates, education and child advocacy \norganizations, public officials and law enforcement have joined this \nnationwide effort to raise awareness of teen dating violence.

Anthony \nhas taken this unique day and made it a staple celebration for their \ncommunity.\n  Twenty years ago in Anthony, two neighbors who shared a common \nbirthday, February 29, decided they should find other people with the \nsame unique situation and have a giant birthday party; after all, it \nonly happens once every 4 years. Mary Ann Brown and Birdie Lewis \ncreated the Worldwide Leap Year Birthday Club which now has almost 500 \nmembers. Because of the popularity of the birthday club, they have also \ncreated the Worldwide Leap Year Anniversary Club for couples who \ncelebrate their anniversaries on this special day.\n  The Anthony Chamber of Commerce has planned several events this year \nfor those with leap year birthdays and anniversaries and also for those \nwith birthdays on the other 365 days of the year. The Worldwide Leap \nYear Festival will be kicked off with a parade, and then those \nattending will enjoy a leap year birthday dinner complete with birthday \ncake. Also in attendance will be Josephine Concho Abeita, a true New \nMexico native, born in 1908, 4 years before New Mexico was even a \nState. Ms. Abeita will celebrate her 100th birthday and her 25th actual \nleap year birthday. I want to commend the citizens of Anthony and the \ncreative way they have designed to promote their city. I wish them much \nsuccess for this year's celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/26/senate-section/article/S1199-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DIANE WOLF\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, sadly, I wish to pay tribute to \nDiane Wolf, who died January 10 at the age of 53. Diane was someone \nmany of us in the Senate knew well. She was unabashed in her interest \nin government and worked tirelessly to improve the world in which we \nlive. She was willing at all times to use her personal resources to \nmake issues clearly understood and actively supported. She considered \nit an obligation of our democracy to express herself on the importance \nof matters under consideration by the Congress.\n  Diane served on countless committees ranging from the arts to \ngovernment. In addition to her role as a benefactor of the Metropolitan \nMuseum of Art in New York, Diane Wolf was active in the cultural \natmosphere in our nation's Capital. There, she worked on the boards of \ntrustees for the U.S. Senate Preservation Board, the Foundation for the \nNational Archives, and the Washington National Opera, as well as \nholding board positions on the Library of Congress Madison Council, \nSmithsonian Council of American Art, and the Kennedy Center National \nCommittee, among others. In 1985, she was appointed by President Reagan \nto the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, and Diane had an immediate impact \nin this new role. She worked to change the design on U.S. coins and \nallow creativity and American history to serve as the basis for their \ndesign. While her effort to revolutionize our coinage did not \nmaterialize, Diane displayed the tenacity and commitment that \ncharacterized everything she undertook.\n  Diane Wolf was blessed with a loving family who took pleasure in \nevery aspect of her life and her interests. Though she was taken from \nthem far too early in her life, memories of her being will be the \ngreatest of family treasures. As we look to the future, let us pause \nand remember Diane Wolf, an outstanding, caring human being who \ndedicated her life to helping others. She will be missed by all who \nknew her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/26/senate-section/article/S1199-4", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/26/senate-section/article/S1199-5", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States sumitting sundry \nnominations and withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/26/senate-section/article/S1199-6", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2663.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to remove \ncell phones from listed property under section 280F; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today Senator Ensign and I are introducing \nthe MOBILE Cell Phone Act, Modernize Our Bookkeeping in the Law for \nEmployees' Cell Phone Act 2008. The purpose of this legislation is to \nupdate the tax treatment of cell phones and mobile communication \ndevices.\n  During the past 20 years, the use of cell phone and mobile \ncommunication devices has skyrocketed. Cell phones are no longer viewed \nas an executive perk or a luxury item. They no longer resemble \nsuitcases or are hardwired to the floor of an automobile. Cell phone \nand mobile communication devices are now part of daily business \npractices at all levels.\n  In 1989, Congress passed a law, which added cell phones to the \ndefinition of listed property under section 280F(d)(4) of the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986. Treating cell phones as listed property requires \nsubstantial documentation in order for cell phones to benefit from \naccelerated depreciation and not be treated as taxable income to the \nemployee. This documentation is required to substantiate that the cell \nphone is used for business purposes more than 50 percent of the time. \nGenerally, listed property is property that inherently lends itself to \npersonal use, such as automobiles.\n  Back in 1989, cell phone technology was an expensive technology \nworthy of detailed logsheets. At that time, it was difficult to \nenvision cell phones that could be placed in a pocket or handbag. \nCongress was skeptical about the daily business use of cell phones.\n  Technological advances have revolutionized the cell phone and mobile \ncommunication device industries. Twenty years ago, no one could have \nimagined the role BlackBerries play in our day-to-day communications. \nCell phones and mobile communication devices are now widespread \nthroughout all types of businesses. Employers provide their employees \nwith these devices to enable them to remain connected 24 hours a day, \nseven days a week. The cost of the devices has been reduced, and most \nproviders offer unlimited airtime for one monthly rate.\n  Recently, the Internal Revenue Service reminded field examiners of \nthe substantiation rules for cell phones as listed property. The \ncurrent rule requires employers to maintain expensive and detailed \nlogs, and employers caught without cell phone logs could face tax \npenalties.\n  The MOBILE Cell Phone Act of 2008 updates the tax treatment of cell \nphones and mobile communication devices by repealing the requirement \nthat employers maintain detailed logs. The tax code should keep pace \nwith technological advances. There is no longer a reason that cell \nphones and mobile communication devices should be treated differently \nfrom office phones or computers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense change.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2668\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I want to clarify why I am objecting to \nthe passage of H.R. 1254, the Presidential Library Donation Reform Act, \nin its current form.\n  In the past, I supported a bill very similar to this. I have always \nsupported transparency in these matters.\n  My concern is in the fairness of passing this legislation today. When \nthis legislation was introduced at the very beginning of this \nadministration's tenure, I supported it because it would have provided \nsufficient notice to the new administration of a change in reporting \nrequirements.\n\n[[Page S1205]]\n\n  However, this administration's final term is near an end, and I do \nnot believe it is fair to change the rules on them.\n  This administration has complied with the existing procedures. \nChanging them now would put a greater burden on them than any other \npast administration which already finished collecting the majority of \ndonations for their libraries.\n  Enacting this bill to apply only to future administrations would \nsolve this problem, and put them on notice of the new reporting \nrequirements and procedures.\n  I have an amendment to this bill so that it will be enacted only to \napply to administrations serving on or after January 21, 2009. If this \namendment is accepted, I will be happy to support the legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/26/senate-section/article/S1205-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1205-S1208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     IP-ENABLED VOICE COMMUNICATIONS AND PUBLIC SAFETY ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, I thank the Senate. This has \nbeen 2 years coming because 2 years ago, a young mother in Deltona, FL, \nwhich is north of Orlando in Volusia County, watched her baby die as \nshe tried in vain to reach emergency 911. She had a telephone that she \ndid not realize, because it was voice over the Internet, there was no \nprovision for emergency 911 services.\n  Following that tragedy of the death of that child, where a 911 \nemergency response team never arrived because they did not receive the \ncall, we introduced this bipartisan legislation that requires all VOIP \nproviders to offer the emergency 911 service, and this legislation \ngives them the tools they need in order to do that.\n  We have been working on this legislation a long time. It passed the \nCommerce Committee unanimously in 2005. It was also added to a Senate \nport security bill in 2006, and then the conference committee stripped \nit out.\n  Since the bill was first introduced, to the credit of the Federal \nCommunications Commission, they took some action to require that VOIP \ncustomers have full access to the emergency 911. We appreciate that \nvery much. But there are holes in those regulations. Those holes need \nto be filled, and this legislation we passed tonight--and is very \nsimilar to a House bill that passed a couple of months ago--will fill \nthose legislative holes.\n  This legislation will resolve any remaining questions regarding the \nFederal Communications Commission jurisdiction over VOIP services by \nrequiring full access to 911 service by the VOIP customers.\n  This bill also resolves any issues relating to the potential \nliability of the VOIP providers that offer access to 911 services. The \nlegislation also requires the national E-911 Implementation \nCoordination Office to work with industry to oversee the next \ngeneration of emergency 911 network.\n  This network is going to be resilient and redundant. It is going to \nallow 911 calls to automatically be routed to a functional 911 call \ncenter in the event of a disaster. Think about what happened down in \nNew Orleans during Katrina. We had a certain way these 911 calls had to \ngo to get to the emergency call center. Some of those lines were out of \nservice, and so those calls never got there.\n  This new system is going to send these little packets of information \nin any route it can to get to that call center. It is going to be \nredundant, it is going to be resilient so we will not have a repeat of \npeople desperately down in New Orleans making 911 calls and not getting \na response.\n  This is a chart that pretty well depicts that every day thousands of \nAmericans rely on these call centers so they can reach responders, and \nevery day we have to wait to upgrade the network and those lives are at \nrisk.\n  We have gone all the way from just the rotary service telephones to \nthe future, where we have something like these iPhones we have today \nthat have so many different services on them. We need a system that can \nget this emergency service through these new kinds of mechanisms. That \nis what we are going to do.\n  Going back to this terrible tragedy that happened a couple years ago \nin my State, this is just one newspaper headline that said trying to \nget that 911 call, it couldn't go because there was not a provision in \nVOIP.\n  Lives have been lost. Lives were at risk. They are still at risk \nuntil we can get this legislation signed into law. I am extremely \ngrateful to the Senate for having passed this legislation tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/26/senate-section/article/S1208-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--AMENDMENT NO. 3896, AS MODIFIED\n\n  Mr. CASEY.
