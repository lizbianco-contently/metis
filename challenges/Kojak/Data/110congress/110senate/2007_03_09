Mr. President, we will shortly vote on the cloture motion \nfiled by the minority.\n\n\n                           Amendments to S. 4\n\n  Mr. President, first, let me start with a letter written to me dated \nFebruary 26. There was a comparable letter written to the Republican \nleader. The letter reads:\n\n       It has been exactly 14 years since the first attack on the \n     World Trade Center; over 5 years since the terrorist attacks \n     of 9/11; and over 2 years since the 9/11 Commission released \n     a blueprint for strengthening America's security. The pace of \n     Congressional response to these wake-up calls has been \n     glacial.\n       The House of Representatives has validated its commitment \n     to improving national security by passing H.R. 1. When S. 4 \n     goes to conference, its provisions must match or surpass the \n     strength and comprehensiveness of H.R. 1. Failure to act \n     ratchets up the danger for America. The longer critical \n     security issues remain unresolved, the more time and options \n     the terrorists have.\n       S. 4 should be a clean bill, limited to implementing the \n     remaining 9/11 Commission recommendations. This legislation \n     is far too important to be politicized by the introduction of \n     non-germane, controversial amendments and debate, \n     particularly those relating to Iraq. Attention to both issues \n     is critically important. As such, each deserves separate \n     deliberation.\n       We urge you to act now to protect America by passing stand-\n     alone, comprehensive security legislation under S. 4 based on \n     the 9/11 Commission blueprint without complications regarding \n     Iraq. The legacy of those whose lives have been taken by \n     terrorists on American soil is in your hands. Prove to the \n     families of those killed in 1993 and 2001, and to all \n     Americans, that this is a new day in Washington, and that \n     safety and security will finally take precedence over special \n     interest groups and politics.\n\n  Mr. President, the two managers of the bill, Lieberman and Collins, \nhave followed the admonition of that letter. They have worked very hard \nto have a clean bill. That is basically what we have. But I am sorry to \nreport that of the 100-plus amendments filed, virtually all of them, \nexcept 7, are nongermane. To top it off, what the minority did is \nlumped a bunch of these nongermane amendments together and filed \ncloture on them.\n  Here is what the 9/11 families had to say about that. This is a \nletter to Senator McConnell, dated March 8, 2007:\n\n       As family members who lost loved ones on 9/11, we support \n     full implementation of the \n     9/11 Commission recommendations. We are writing out of grave \n     concern that your recent introduction of highly provocative, \n     irrelevant amendments will jeopardize the passage of S. 4. It \n     is inconceivable that anyone in good conscience would \n     consider hindering implementation of the 9/11 Commission \n     recommendations and we strongly disagree with these divisive \n     procedural tactics.\n       Just as the Iraq war deserves separate debate, so do each \n     of the amendments you offered. S. 4 should be a clean bill \n     and debate should conclude this week with a straight up\n\n[[Page S2956]]\n\n     or down vote. Each day that passes without implementation of \n     the remaining 9/11 Commission recommendations, the safety and \n     security of our nation is at risk.\n       Tactics such as those you are contemplating, aimed at \n     endangering the 9/11 bill, sends a signal to America that \n     partisan politics is alive and well under your leadership. \n     Both parties must work together to pass this critical \n     legislation. We, the undersigned, understand the risk of \n     failure all too well.\n\n  It is signed: ``Respectfully,'' Carol Ashley, mother of Janice, who \ndied, who is a member of Voices of September 11th; Beverly Eckert, \nwidow of Sean Rooney, who is a member of Families of September 11; Mary \nFetchet, mother of Brad, who died, who is founding director and \npresident of Voices of September 11th; Carie Lemack, daughter of Judy \nLarocque, who died, who is cofounder and president of Families of \nSeptember 11.\n  Mr. President, this is what the 9/11 families have said. The \namendments lumped into one are not germane to the pending bill. That is \nwithout any question or debate. It is a collection of far-reaching \nimmigration and criminal law provisions that have never been considered \nby the Judiciary Committee--never. Senator Leahy said he would be happy \nto do that. They have never been considered.\n  These are complex matters which should not be considered on the \nSenate floor in this manner, especially on this very sensitive \nlegislation. For example, one part of the amendment would overturn a \nrecent Supreme Court decision. Now, remember, seven of the nine members \nof the Supreme Court are Republicans. They wrote the opinion. They want \nit overturned. Another part of the amendment would say visa revocations \ncan never, ever be reviewed by any court.\n  The cloture motion was nothing more than an effort to delay passage \nof the 9/11 Commission bill. We need to move forward on this vital \nlegislation.\n  I again ask everyone to listen to the words of the family members of \nthose who perished on September 11. I have read those into the Record. \nWe have, as I speak, these women and others who are watching what we do \nhere today. I hope Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins can go forward \nand complete this legislation without this. It is just absolutely hard \nto comprehend that this is what is being attempted on this bill.\n  I respectfully suggest, as they said in this letter, ``It is \ninconceivable that anyone in good conscience would consider hindering \nimplementation of the 9/11 Commission recommendations. . . .'' That is \nwhat they said, not what I said. ``Each day that passes without \nimplementation of the . . . 9/11 Commission recommendations [risks] the \nsafety and security of our nation. . . .'' That is what they said, not \nwhat I said. ``Tactics such as [these],'' they write to Senator \nMcConnell, `` . . . are . . . aimed at endangering the 9/11 bill, [and \nit] sends a signal to America that [is inappropriate].''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/09/senate-section/article/S2956-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2956-S2967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IMPROVING AMERICA'S SECURITY ACT OF 2007\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, how much time remains under the current \norder?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Four and a half minutes is \nremaining before the vote.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the majority leader and I agree about one \nthing: Securing America ought to be about doing just that and not about \npolitics. But, unfortunately, the majority has demonstrated its \ninterest in rewarding unions by providing a provision for collective \nbargaining for the Transportation Security Administration in this bill \nwhich elevates the union rights of the Transportation Security \nAdministration over the national security and safety of the American \npeople.\n  So we should not be fooled by the rhetoric or the attempt of the \nmajority leader to stand behind the 9/11 families. Unfortunately, I \nfear these 9/11 families are being manipulated for political purposes \nin order to justify promoting the union rights of Transportation \nSecurity Administration workers, which will hinder the safety and \nsecurity of the flying public. This 9/11 bill should be about \nstrengthening security, not about unions.\n  Mr. President, I have another letter from 9/11 Families for a Secure \nAmerica to Senator McConnell, which I ask unanimous consent be printed \nin the Record after my comments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this letter says:\n\n       On behalf of 9/11 Families for a Secure America, an \n     organization representing the families of 300 victims of the \n     9/11 attacks, we would like to thank you for your recent \n     efforts to ensure and enhance America's security.\n\n  This letter goes on and will be part of the Record.\n  But I simply do not understand why the majority leader objects to our \nability to have an up-or-down vote on whether dangerous criminal aliens \nwho are currently being released into the population--because under a \n2001 Supreme Court decision, they cannot be held more than 6 months \npending deportation--why he would object to an up-or-down vote on that \namendment.\n  We started off this year with the majority leader and those in the \nnew majority saying they wanted to work with Republicans in a \nbipartisan way to try to do what was important for the American people. \nNothing is more important than the safety and security of the American \npeople. But why, 6 years after this 2001 Supreme Court decision, the \nmajority insists on allowing this condition to exist, where dangerous \ncriminal aliens are released into the American population to commit \nadditional crimes, is beyond me. That is not about safety and security.\n  Frankly, the comments I heard this morning which say that somehow \nthis is being politicized are just not correct. If anything, the \nmajority has demonstrated that their desire to promote union rights as \na reward for political support in the last election dominates their \nthinking on this bill. It is unfortunate.\n  I hope that if, indeed, that provision, which I do believe in all \nsincerity will impair the safety and security of the American people, \nis included in this bill once it is taken to conference, I hope the \nPresident follows through on his promise to veto the bill because it \nwill not elevate but, rather, it will diminish the safety and security \nof the American people.\n  So I regret, Mr. President, that the majority leader has obstructed \nthe ability of the U.S. Senate to have a full and fair debate on these \nimportant national security amendments. Frankly, the reasons for not \nallowing that just do not stand up to scrutiny.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                               9/11 Families for a\n\n\n                                               Secure America,\n\n                                                    March 8, 2007.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of \n     9/11 Families for a Secure America, an organization \n     representing the families of 300 victims of the 9/11 attacks, \n     we would like to thank you for your recent efforts to ensure \n     and enhance America's security.\n       As the parents of two men who lost their lives in the World \n     Trade Center attacks, we take the recommendations of the 9/11 \n     Commission more seriously than most. When President Bush \n     threatened to veto the 9/11 bill over a provision related to \n     airport security screeners, we were pleased by your efforts \n     to strip the provision to ensure a presidential signature.\n       We also appreciate your recent efforts to implement a \n     number of new policies aimed at closing dangerous loopholes \n     in existing security law. We represent an organization that \n     advocates strengthening our borders as a way of improving \n     national security, and your proposals would do just that. As \n     you know, current law prevents us from holding dangerous \n     illegal immigrants and from deporting anyone whose visa has \n     been revoked for terrorist-related reasons. These loopholes \n     must be closed.\n       Those who would use the 9/11 bill as a vehicle for \n     political patronage and stall its passage in the process do \n     not have America's security interests at heart. Nor do those \n     who would block a vote on measures aimed at securing our \n     borders by screening those who come here illegally. Thank you \n     for keeping faith with those of us who have made the security \n     of this country a real priority. Your efforts are greatly \n     appreciated.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                    Joan Molinaro,\n     Treasurer, 9/11 Families for a Secure America, Mother of Carl \n                                                   Molinaro, FDNY.\n                                                     Peter Gadiel,\n     President, 9/11 FSA, Father of James Gadiel, WTC North Tower \n                                                      103rd floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncloture motion on the bill be vitiated; that the bill be read a third \ntime, and a vote occur on final passage on Tuesday, March 13, \nimmediately upon the disposition of the substitute amendment; that when \nthe Senate convenes on Tuesday, March 13, and resumes consideration of \nthe bill, all time under cloture be considered expired and the Senate \nimmediately begin voting on those pending germane amendments; further, \nthat during Monday's legislative session, the provisions of rule XXII \nshall not bar a motion to proceed made by the majority leader.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I think this is a fair agreement that \nwill allow us to finish the bill on Tuesday, and I have no objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? The Chair hears \nnone, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this means that there will be no \nfurther rollcall votes today, there will be no rollcall votes on \nMonday, and we would resume voting on the germane amendments on Tuesday \nmorning next week.\n  Our staffs will continue to be available to negotiate with our \ncolleagues on a consent list of amendments that are agreed to by all \nconcerned. In fact, we have a list now approaching 20 amendments where \nthere is such agreement, but there are one or two individual Senators \nconcerned that their amendments are not on that list and they are \nobjecting to the overall consent. We hope very much that can be worked \nout and we can, in any case, move to final passage next Tuesday.\n  Mr. President, I briefly wish to thank my ranking member, Senator \nCollins, for her extraordinary contribution to this bill and her \ncooperation. As you know, we have had many ups and downs about the many \namendments, agreements, objections, et cetera, but I am very pleased to \nsay that the bill, as it came out of our committee, was nonpartisan, \nwith a 16-to-0 vote, and one abstention, thus remaining essentially \nintact. That is the good news.\n  I hope some of the amendments that have been agreed to by almost \neverybody on both sides can be added to make the bill even stronger as \nwe go to conference.\n  I thank our colleagues for their contributions and for some good \ndebate.\n\n[[Page S2959]]\n\nThis is a subject of urgent importance to the American people. It is \ncompleting the unfinished work that the \n9/11 Commission gave us, it is building on all we accomplished in the \n9/11 legislation of 2004, and it will, in a very direct way, make the \nAmerican people safer both from potential terrorist attack and from the \ninevitable natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor to my ranking member at \nthis time.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this is a very important bill. Many of \nthe recommendations of the 9/11 Commission were enacted as part of the \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut and I have worked so hard to \nauthor. But there is some unfinished business, and this bill will help \nmake our country safer and it will strengthen our protections against \nterrorist attacks.\n  As always, it has been a great pleasure to work with the Senator from \nConnecticut, whose leadership I so admire. I am optimistic we have now \nfinally put this important bill on a path to completion, and I look \nforward to working to accomplish that goal on Tuesday.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, though I \nam not sure if that motion has gone through, I wanted to ask the \nleaders, who have managed this bill so well, if they are familiar with \namendment Nos. 295 and 296, relative to very urgent requests by the \nGulf Coast States, one for loan forgiveness and one for the 10-percent \nwaiver? Are the two leaders willing to say they are both supportive of \nthese amendments and will continue to try over the weekend to get both \nthese amendments up by unanimous consent?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Louisiana, \nthe amendment on loan forgiveness is on the consent list. As the \nSenator knows, for reasons that are certainly perplexing to me, most \neverybody here seems to agree on the 10-percent forgiveness for the \ngulf coast based on Hurricane Katrina because of the extraordinary \neconomic impact the storm had on both governments and people and \nbusinesses in the gulf coast. There is very broad support, but there \ncontinue to be objections, as the Senator knows. I regret that, and I \nhope we can find a way to overcome those between now and next Tuesday.\n  The Senator from Louisiana also knows there is an amendment on levees \nthat is germane, and that will be one of the amendments that is up \neither for a vote or passage by consent on Tuesday because it remains \nrelevant and germane after cloture.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator for his support.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if the Senator from Louisiana will yield \nso I may respond to her question.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator from Louisiana has been tireless in her \nadvocacy for both of these amendments. The junior Senator from \nLouisiana has also talked to me about these amendments, as has the \nSenator from Florida, Mr. Martinez. I have been working hard with the \nchairman to try to address the concerns of the Senators from Louisiana.\n  As the chairman has indicated, there is good news on one of the \nSenator's amendments. The amendment that proposes the loan forgiveness \nauthority for the President is on the list of amendments we are \noptimistic about clearing on Tuesday. The other amendment, with the 10-\npercent match eliminated, is more problematic because there are some \noutstanding objections to it.\n  I know the Senator from Louisiana has indicated a willingness to \namend her amendment and put a 2-year sunset on that provision. That \nhelps a great deal with one of the objections we have on our side of \nthe aisle. I don't know whether we are going to be able to clear the \nother objections, but I certainly pledge to keep working with the \nSenator from Louisiana and the committee's chairman to accomplish that \ngoal.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank all our colleagues, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Trade Policy\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, last November, voters in my State of Ohio \nspoke out for change. Their call echoed across this country, as middle-\nclass, working, and low-income families claimed ownership of their \nGovernment.\n  For too long, our Government betrayed their values. The drug \ncompanies wrote the Medicare law, the oil companies dictated energy \npolicy, and large multinational corporations pushed job-killing trade \nagreements through the House and the Senate.\n  In my home State of Ohio, trade in particular was the focus for \nchange in last year's election. Years of job-killing trade agreements \nare taking their toll on workers and small businesses alike. Two years \nago, the largest ever bipartisan fair trade coalition was formed to \noppose the Central American Free Trade Agreement--the dysfunctional \ncousin of the fundamentally flawed North American Free Trade Agreement.\n  Forced through the House in the middle of the night by one vote, \nCAFTA did not pass on its merits. So flawed is CAFTA that to this day, \nnearly 2 years later, it has still not been fully implemented.\n  The question is not if we trade but how we trade and who benefits \nfrom trade. Unfettered free trade has afforded multinational \ncorporations and morally bankrupt countries windfall profits on the \nbacks of often slave, sweatshop, or even child labor. Proponents of \nunfettered free trade use words such as ``protectionism'' to hide their \nshameful practices, to mask agreements that trade in human suffering \nand economic destruction, and to simply try to push away their \nopponents' arguments.\n  I am pleased to say this Congress is not only committed to build on \nthe efforts of the fair trade coalition, we are already at work \nchanging trade policy. Earlier this year, Senator Dorgan, Senator \nGraham, and I introduced legislation that would ban sweatshop labor. We \nshed light on the injustice of allowing China to enjoy permanent normal \ntrade relations in the WTO while allowing the degradation of \nenvironmental and labor standards on massive scales.\n  In the coming months, Congress will debate fast-track negotiations \ndue to expire this summer. It is clear this administration has little \ndesire--has little desire--to change direction on trade, so it is up to \nCongress to chart a new course for the future of U.S. trade policy.\n  Fair trade is not just about doing the right thing for small \nbusiness, doing the right thing for manufacturing, doing the right \nthing for workers; it means investing in entire communities.\n  Our middle class is shrinking. Our policies in Washington have \nbetrayed the values of working families across this country--in Ohio \nand Rhode Island, all over this country--which is why we must revamp \nour economic trade policies and invest in our middle class. We must \nshrink income inequality, grow our business community, and create good-\npaying jobs. We must establish trade policy that builds on our economic \nsecurity.\n  Job loss does not just affect the worker who has lost her job or that \nworker's family. Job loss, especially job loss in the thousands, \ndevastates communities. It hurts the local business owner--the \ndrugstore, the grocery store, the neighborhood restaurant. When people \nare out of work, they cannot support their local economy, which forces \nowners to close their small businesses. That means lost revenues to the \ncommunity, which hurts schools, fire departments, and police \ndepartments.\n  The trade policies we set here and negotiated across the globe have a \ndirect impact on places such as Toledo and\n\n[[Page S2960]]\n\nSteubenville and Cleveland and Middletown. We hear the word \n``protectionist'' thrown around by those who insist on more of the same \nfailed trade models. It is considered ``protectionist'' by them when \nthey characterize those of us who are fighting for labor and \nenvironmental standards, but they call it ``free trade'' to protect \ndrug company patents and Hollywood films.\n  If we can protect intellectual property rights, as we should, with \nenforceable provisions in trade agreements, we absolutely can do the \nsame for labor, the environment, and food safety.\n  In my home State of Ohio, we have a talented and hard-working labor \nforce and an entrepreneurial spirit that needs only the investment \ndollars and commitment from Government to realize their economic \npotential.\n  Oberlin College, near Cleveland, has the largest building on any \nuniversity campus in the United States fully powered by solar energy. \nHowever, Oberlin College had to buy the solar panels for their building \nfrom Germany and Japan because we do not make enough solar panels in \nthe United States.\n  Through investment in alternative energy, and through biomedical \nresearch and development, we cannot only create jobs, we can grow small \nbusiness, we can help our environment.\n  Now is the time for our Government to do its part and redirect our \npriorities from favoring the wealthiest 1 percent in our Nation to, \ninstead, growing our Nation's middle class. It is not a matter of if we \nrevamp our trade policy but when we do it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Alexander pertaining to the introduction of S. \n835 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor his courtesy. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                                 Trade\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I believe this morning President Bush is \nin Brazil. A week ago today, I and a number of Senators met with the \nPresident at the White House. The issue of the Brazil trip came up. He \nno doubt will talk to the Brazilians about trade this morning. As he \ndiscusses the issue of trade, I wanted to make a couple of comments.\n  Today we had a new trade deficit figure released, about 3 hours ago. \nIt shows our merchandise trade deficit in the past month was $66 \nbillion--in 1 month. I wanted to come to the floor to show what is \nhappening to this country's trade. The reason I want to show the \nresults of our trade policy is we now have proposals in front of us for \nfree trade agreements. We have Colombia, Peru, negotiations with South \nKorea, Thailand, and others. We have been through a period when there \nhas been this mantra, this chant, as it is, about free trade.\n  This chart shows what is happening to trade. In 1995, 12 years ago, \nwe had a $174 billion trade deficit. Now it is $836 billion. Think of \nthat: Every single day we wake up in this country, we import over $2 \nbillion more in goods from overseas than we are able to sell abroad. It \ndoesn't matter what the good is, much, and it doesn't matter what the \ncountry is.\n  I have been here with charts that show, for example, to cite one, \nlast year we had automobiles put on ships in South Korea. Mr. \nPresident, over 700,000 automobiles were put on ships in South Korea \nand sent to America and sold in the United States--700,000 South Korean \nautomobiles. How many American automobiles do you think we sold in \nKorea, Mr. President, 700,000? No, no--about 4,000. Fair trade? Hardly. \nNinety-nine percent of the cars on the streets of South Korea are South \nKorean cars. Why? Because they don't want foreign cars sold in South \nKorea. They want to produce cars with jobs in South Korea and ship them \nto the United States.\n  Should we allow that kind of one-way trade--700,000 going one way, \n4,000 plus going the other way--to continue? I don't think so.\n  Let me talk a little about the general area of trade. I want to put \nup a picture of a young girl named Halima. This is a beautiful 11-year-\nold girl. When I showed the chart of the $836 billion trade deficit \nlast year, over $2 billion a day--well over $2 billion a day--the \nresult of that statistic is American jobs being shipped overseas, \nproducts being produced overseas, in many cases with dirt-cheap labor, \nsent to a big box retailer in this country to be sold at a lower price. \nThat is true, a lower price, so the American consumer gets a better \nprice on a 12-pack of underwear or a gallon of mustard someplace. But \nwhat is the consequence of that to our economy, to our jobs? What \nultimately is the consequence for our country? I frame all this in the \ncontext of the President saying: Let's do more, let's do more of this.\n  It seems to me if we do much more of that, we won't have much of an \neconomy left. At what point do we think a trade deficit matters? This \nisn't money we owe to ourselves. One can make that case in fiscal \npolicy with the budget deficit. This is money we owe to other \ncountries, over $1 trillion of which we now owe to the Japanese and the \nChinese. But what are the consequences?\n  I mentioned lost American jobs. Where do these jobs go? Who is \nproducing what is sent to our country?\n  This beautiful young lady is named Halima. She worked at a factory in \nBangladesh at age 11, and she made Hanes underwear. She worked long \nhours, very low pay, in sweatshop conditions.\n  One would think if this is a world market in which we care about the \ncircumstances of people working in sweatshop conditions, we would take \na look at something such as this and say: Wait a second, we don't want \nto buy Hanes underwear made with the hands of an 11-year-old working in \nsweatshop conditions.\n  Let me show my colleagues a certification of this plant in which \nHalima worked. ``Certificate of Compliance, February 21, 2007.'' It is \nhereby awarded to Harvest Rich Ltd., worldwide responsible apparel \nproduction. So they certified this company was doing just fine with \ninternational standards. An 11-year-old producing in sweatshop \nconditions, sending underwear to Americans? That is fine? I don't think \nso. So is this just an aberration? This just happens on the very \nunusual case, and I just happened to find the picture of Halima?\n\n  Let me tell you how this picture came about. This picture came from a \nwoman named Sheik Nazma. She was a former child laborer in Bangladesh. \nShe was forced to start working in the textile mills at age 12--a \nsweatshop--and she described the conditions. She organized her \ncoworkers for better conditions, saying: Let us, as a group of workers, \norganize to see if we can get better conditions. For that, she was \nbeaten and threatened to death for organizing workers.\n  Is that an aberration? No, not really. I can give you the names today \nof people sitting in prisons in China. Their transgression? Their \ncrime? They tried to organize workers for better conditions, tried to \norganize workers to insist on backpay they were owed. For that, they \nare sitting in prison cells in China because you can't organize workers \nin China.\n  What is happening with respect to these trade issues is we are \nsinking deep into this abyss of worsening trade debt. I know what the \npapers will say tomorrow--that $66 billion, the last monthly \nmerchandise trade deficit, is about a billion dollars or so less than \nthe previous month, and the newspapers will say: Nirvana. What a \nwonderful thing--our trade deficit is shrinking. These, of course, are \nthe same newspapers that beat to death this chant of free trade. There \nis not enough of this free trade for them; the more the merrier. My \nonly question about all of this is, When do you suggest that this \nrepresents failure? Is\n\n[[Page S2961]]\n\nthere never an opportunity to suggest that we need a change in trade \nstrategy, a change that stands up for what we have built in a century \nin this country?\n  Let me describe what it is we have built in this century. A man name \nJames Fyler was shot in 1914. The previous accounts of his death say he \ndied of lead poisoning actually, but he was shot 54 times. Do you know \nwhy he was shot and lost his life? Because he believed that people who \nwent underground to dig in the coal mines ought to be entitled to two \nthings: No. 1, a safe workplace, and No. 2, a fair wage. For that, he \nwas murdered.\n  In a century, from James Fyler forward, we had people who gave their \nlives and risked their lives to improve standards in this country, to \ninsist on the right to organize, to insist on safe workplaces, to \ninsist on a fair wage, and to insist on fair labor standards. It was \ntough. There were people beaten in the streets for it. There were \npeople shot for insisting that we develop and lift those standards. But \nwe did. We did. We expanded and created a middle class almost \nunparalleled in the world, which became the economic strength of this \ncountry. Working people understood they could get a good job, get some \ntraining, have a job that had a career ladder, an opportunity for a \ndecent wage, an opportunity for benefits, and an opportunity to take \ncare of their families. There is no social program in this Chamber that \nis as important as a good job that pays well for able-bodied workers. \nIt is what allows everything else to work.\n  So we did that for a century, and we expanded opportunities. Now, all \nof a sudden, we are told it is a new day because of the global economy. \nIn fact, Tom Friedman wrote a book saying that not only is it a new \nday, but the world is flat. I have yet to see the globe that represents \nthat. When you go to most offices or libraries and you see a globe of \nthe Earth, it appears round to me. Of course, I only graduated from a \nhigh school senior class of nine students, so maybe I missed a part of \nthe lesson. So now we have books that say the world is flat, which, of \ncourse, is nonsense because it is not flat.\n  It is a global economy. What does that mean? What is the definition \nof what a global economy means for us and for our future? It means, \naccording to some, that we ought to be able to understand that \ncomparative advantage means you produce products where you can produce \nthem at the least cost and then purchase them here and it is good for \nthe consumer. The result is corporate executives flying around the \nworld deciding where they can produce for the least cost.\n  How many of my colleagues remember Radio Flyer's little red wagon, \nwhich was an American product for 110 years, a Chicago company--the \nlittle red wagon we have all ridden in? It was named ``Radio Flyer'' \nbecause the inventor loved Marconi and he loved to fly, so he named his \nproduct ``Radio Flyer,'' and his company built it in Chicago for 110 \nyears. Not anymore. It is just gone. It is now built in China. Do you \nthink that is because the Chinese build better little red wagons? No, \nnot at all. It is because you can find somebody who will work for 30 \ncents an hour, and you can work them 7 days a week, 12 to 14 hours a \nday, and you can build a cheaper little red wagon.\n  Similarly, you can do the same with Huffy bicycles and then eliminate \nall their jobs. You can do the same with Pennsylvania House furniture. \nIn fact, with Pennsylvania House furniture, you can send the \nPennsylvania wood to China. You can get rid of all the workers in \nPennsylvania, send the Pennsylvania wood to China, and have them put it \ntogether and ship it back here, and that is exactly what has happened.\n  About 3\\1/2\\ to 4 million jobs have now migrated to where you can pay \npennies an hour and then ship the product back to our country. That is \nabout enhancing corporate profits, but I think it is at the expense of \nour economic future.\n  The former Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Blinder, \na mainstream economist, said this: There are 42 to 56 million American \njobs that are tradeable, meaning outsourceable. Not all of them will \nleave our country, but even those that stay are competing with others \nin the world who will work for lower wages. Therefore, there will be \ndownward pressure on American wages for working Americans.\n\n  We see it every day. Open the newspaper and see how many people are \nlosing their health care benefits, their retirement benefits, and the \ndownward pressure on income. We see it every day. It is part of a \nstrategy that says free trade, a global economy, produce where it is \ncheap, and sell to a marketplace like this.\n  My point is that it doesn't add up in the long run. I am for trade. I \nam in favor of trade, and plenty of it, but I insist and demand that it \nbe fair trade for this country that attempts to lift, not depress \nstandards. I am very interested in engaging with the rest of the world. \nI am not an isolationist, I am not a protectionist, as they define it, \nalthough I want to plead guilty quickly to wanting to protect our \ncountry's economic interests. If that is being a protectionist, then \njust sign me up. I want to protect our country's economic interests. We \nwill only do that, and we will do it well, if we understand the need to \nretain a broad middle class, a middle class that sees jobs here that \npay well, with benefits and opportunities in the future.\n  So how do we reconcile all of this? What will happen in the coming \nseveral months is--and I believe Senator Sherrod Brown spoke about this \nearlier today--what will happen in the coming months is we will be \nrequested to debate an extension of something called fast-track \nauthority. Fast-track authority. They are going to want to run through \nfast-track authority trade agreements with, yes, South Korea and \nThailand and Peru and Colombia and many others. The same people who \nhave given us this want to give us more of it, a deep canyon of red \nink, downward pressure on American incomes, and substantial pressure on \nthe movement of American jobs.\n  Interestingly enough, we not only move American jobs overseas, we \nactually decide, for those who do it, that we will give them a big fat \ntax break. One of the most pernicious, ignorant pieces of public policy \nI can conceive of is when we said: Fire your American workers, close \nyour American plants, move your jobs to China, sell your products back \nin America, run your income through the Cayman Islands, and we will \ngive you a big fat tax break for it.\n  Four times we have voted on eliminating that tax break, four times I \nhave offered amendments to shut it down, and four times I have lost. \nMark my words--we will be voting again and again on that proposition. \nThe very last thing we ought to do as a country is decide we want to \nsubsidize the flight of American jobs.\n  We just introduced a piece of legislation that would deal with the \nissue of sweatshop labor in other countries. What are the standards of \nthis so-called global trade in a flat world? Well, at least there is \none standard. The one standard is that you can't sell tube socks from a \nprison in China at a big-box retailer in America. Why is that? Because \nit is presumed that if you make tube socks or shorts or whatever you \nmake in a prison setting, then that truly is the ultimate sweatshop \nlabor, I guess. So you can't send prison labor products to our \nmarketplace.\n  Well, if we all agree with that, and we do, because we already have a \nprovision on that, what about the next step up? What about the product \nof an 11-year-old girl? What about the product of a company that hires \nan 11-year-old girl named Halima and works her in sweatshop conditions?\n  Should we decide as a country that you cannot produce products in \nsweatshop conditions that abuse workers abroad and send the products \nhere--which, by the way, then asks American workers working in plants \nin the United States to compete with that sweatshop labor. It not only \nabuses foreign workers, it also abuses domestic workers because we are \nsaying: Compete with something that is completely unsavory. If this \nhappened in our country, we would march down the street with law \nenforcement and say: Shut this down.\n  We have heard the stories. I think my colleague, Senator Harkin, had \nhearings some several years ago about this with the international labor \norganizations--young kids in carpet factories having their fingertips \nburned with sulfur. They put sulfur on the fingertips, then light them \non fire. Do you know why? They create scars on the\n\n[[Page S2962]]\n\nfingertips so that as they use needles to sew the rugs, two things \noccur: They don't hurt themselves because they have scars from having \nhad their fingertips burned and, second, they won't get blood on the \ncarpets. Is this something we should accept? No, I don't think so. Is \nit something we should care about? You are darn right we should. But \nalmost nothing--almost nothing--is acceptable to discuss in this mantra \nof free trade without being called a protectionist.\n  Here is what I think is going to happen. In the last election here in \nthis country, I think there were 6 or 8 or 10 Senate races in which the \nwinning candidate said: You know what, we are on the wrong track here. \nIt is not that we shouldn't trade. We should trade. The origin of this \ngreat country was the shrewd Yankee trader. We were the traders, good \ntraders, and so we should trade. But we shouldn't decide that this kind \nof a trade deficit can continue. It simply cannot.\n  Let me pull up the chart with China. The largest trade deficit we \nhave is with the country of China, with $232 billion last year alone. \nThat is unbelievable.\n  I have mentioned before that part of our problem is just incompetent \ntrade agreements, just fundamentally incompetent, and I will give an \nexample of one.\n  I have threatened from time to time that trade negotiators should \nwear uniforms, like the jerseys they wear in the Olympics, so they can \nlook down from time to time and, in a sober moment, they can see for \nwhom they are working. It would say ``U.S.A.''\n  China. We did a bilateral agreement with China, a country with which \nwe have a very large trade deficit--a very large deficit and growing. \nIt is a country that is also developing a new automobile export \nindustry, and they want to export automobiles aggressively to the \nUnited States. Here is what we said: If you export Chinese automobiles \nto the United States, we will impose a 2.5-percent tariff on your cars, \nbut if we export American automobiles to be sold in China, China can \nimpose a 25-percent tariff. We negotiated with China a deal that said: \nOn a bilateral automobile trade, you ship a car to us and we will \nimpose a 2.5-percent tariff, and if we ship a car to you, you can \nimpose a tariff that is 10 times higher, and that is just fine. I am \nsaying that is ignorant. That is ignorant of our economic interest.\n  One little piece of information. Most people don't know it, but you \ncan rip open the intestines of these trade agreements and find case \nafter case where we have traded away our own economic interests.\n  We are going to be confronting now, in the next 4 or 5 months, some \nvery tough choices--not so tough for me but perhaps for some--choices \nabout what do we do about fast-track trade authority. That is a \nmechanism by which the Senate decides in advance that when a trade \nagreement comes here that has been negotiated in secret, behind closed \ndoors, with no participation of any of us, it comes here under an \nexpedited procedure with no opportunity for anyone to make any change \nof any type. I don't support that.\n  What has happened with China and the world is the deepening abyss of \nred ink, and what has resulted from the strategy that comes from fast \ntrack is expedited procedures and a straightjacket for the Senate. It \nhas come from incompetent agreements. It has come from lack of \nenforcement. In fact, our trade authorities cannot even find some of \nthe agreements they have previously negotiated. They can't even find \nthem, let alone enforce them.\n\n  I haven't talked here about the number of people who are working in \nour Government to enforce our trade agreements with China. It is fewer \nthan 20. Enforcement is just the backwater of trade. Nobody wants to \nenforce anything. It doesn't matter. Yet, in my judgment, it does \nmatter to this country's economic future.\n  What are we going to do about fast track and the extension for fast \ntrack that President Bush is requesting? I did not support fast-track \ntrade authority for President Clinton, and I do not support it for \nPresident Bush, although President Bush has had it now for some while. \nBut I think there is a new group of Senators who will have to sink \ntheir teeth into this discussion. What does this mean? What does this \nexpedited procedure, fast-track straitjacket, mean? What does it mean \nwhen we do bilateral negotiations, so-called free-trade negotiations, \nwith the countries I previously described, and how do we resolve them? \nHow do we deal with them?\n  Many of my colleagues, myself included, believe when we negotiate \ntrade agreements we should do so with an eye on what we have created \nand built in this country, lifting up standards for almost a century \nnow. We should have labor provisions in the trade agreements. We should \nhave environmental provisions in the trade agreements. We should have a \nshock absorber for currency fluctuation in the trade agreements. Some \nsay that is radical. It is not radical. I will show you what is \nradical. It is the sheet that shows the combined trade deficit with the \nworld. When you talk about what is radical, this is radical: the trade \nstrategy that gives us this is radical. The trade strategy that gives \nus this morning's merchandise trade deficit of $66 billion, that is \nwhat is radical.\n  There is an old saying: If you don't care where you are, you are \nnever going to be lost. You know, we have gone on here for some long \nwhile with people apparently not caring, but it is time for our country \nto care. There is only one United States on this planet. If you spin \nthis globe and try to find another equivalent place, with democracy and \na market system that have come together to create opportunity for so \nmany--there is only one place. But we are quickly losing it with this \n``the world is flat'' approach, with free-trade agreements that tend to \nput downward pressure on wages in this country and strip away benefits \nand decide in this new market system that comparative advantage is not \njust who has the best natural resources to produce what product, but \nwho has decided to have rules in their country that prohibit workers \nfrom organizing, that allow sweatshops to operate, that allows 11-year-\nold kids in carpet factories.\n  That is not comparative advantage. Ricardo would roll over in his \ngrave. It has nothing to do with comparative advantage. We have to \nconfront these issues, the sooner the better, and there is no question \nwe will begin to confront them in this year, perhaps in the next 4 or 5 \nmonths. The way we confront them and the decisions we make will have a \nprofound impact on what kind of a country we have and what kind of \neconomy we have in the coming years. That is why it is so important.\n  I wanted to make a couple of comments today by pointing out that we \nare now confronted with choices, and those choices, I assume, will be \nimposed upon us in a very short period of time. I look forward to new \nvoices in the Senate weighing in on these important issues. Not in a \nway that suggests we are not a part of the world economy, we are a \nsignificant part of the world economy; not in a way that suggests the \nworld has not gotten smaller, it has. The world is not flat, but the \nworld certainly is smaller.\n  We are engaged in this information technology revolution. If \nsomething happens almost anywhere in the world, I will know about it 5 \nminutes later, and we will see pictures of it in a half hour or less. \nSo things have changed. But what has not changed is our need and desire \nas Americans to look after the well-being of our economy and the \nopportunities that can exist for our citizens.\n  That is not being selfish. That is our responsibility. We are \nstewards of this country's future, and that stewardship, in my \njudgment, is vastly compromised by this chart and what has happened \nwith the shipping of American jobs overseas, with the decision that \ncheaper prices at home for products produced elsewhere for pennies an \nhour represent fair competition for American workers. It is not fair \ncompetition, and we do desperately need, now, a new trade strategy, one \nthat reflects the economic interests of this country but one that still \ninsists on being a significant part of the world economy even as we try \nto lift others up without pushing our standards down.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 286\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was pleased to join Senator Specter and \nSenator Dodd in offering an amendment to restore the Great Writ of \nhabeas corpus, a cornerstone of American liberty since the founding of \nthis Nation. Senator Specter and I introduced\n\n[[Page S2963]]\n\nthis legislation late last year and reintroduced it on the first day of \nthis new Congress. This amendment continues our efforts to amend last \nyear's Military Commissions Act, to right a wrong and to restore a \nbasic protection to American law. This is an issue on which we continue \nto work together and urge Senators on both sides of the aisle to join \nwith us.\n  As Justice Scalia wrote in the Hamdi case: ``The very core of liberty \nsecured by our Anglo-Saxon system of separated powers has been freedom \nfrom indefinite imprisonment at the will of the Executive.'' The remedy \nthat secures that most basic of freedoms is habeas corpus. It provides \na check against arbitrary detentions and constitutional violations. It \nguarantees an opportunity to go to court, with the aid of a lawyer, to \nprove one's innocence. This fundamental protection was rolled back in \nan unprecedented and unnecessary way in the run up to last fall's \nelection by passage of the Military Commissions Act.\n  The Military Commissions Act eliminated that right, permanently, for \nany noncitizen determined to be an enemy combatant, or even \n``awaiting'' such a determination. That includes the approximately 12 \nmillion lawful permanent residents in the United States today, people \nwho work and pay taxes in America and are lawful residents. This new \nlaw means that any of these people can be detained, forever, without \nany ability to challenge their detention in Federal court--or anywhere \nelse--simply on the Government's say-so that they are awaiting \ndetermination whether they are enemy combatants.\n  I deeply regret that Senator Specter and I were unsuccessful in our \nefforts to stop this injustice when the President and the Republican \nleadership insisted on rushing the Military Commissions Act through \nCongress in the weeks before the recent elections. We proposed an \namendment that would have removed the habeas-stripping provision from \nthe Military Commissions Act. We fell just three votes short in those \npolitically charged days. It is my hope that the new Senate and new \nCongress will reconsider this matter, restore this fundamental \nprotection and revitalize our tradition of checks and balances.\n  This amendment to the 9/11 Commission bill provides the right time \nand the place for the Senate to make this stand. The 9/11 Commission \nbill seeks to make us stronger and to protect us from the threat of \nterrorism. Protecting our values and the safeguards that make us a \nstrong democracy is key to that effort. Restoring our place as an \nexample to the world of liberty and the rule of law will only increase \nour security and undermine those who would seek to recruit terrorists.\n  Giving the Government such raw, unfettered power as the Military \nCommissions Act did should concern every American. Last fall, I spelled \nout a nightmare scenario about a hard-working legal permanent resident \nwho makes an innocent donation to, among other charities, a Muslim \ncharity that the Government secretly suspects might be a source of \nfunding for critics of the United States Government. I suggested that, \non the basis of this donation and perhaps a report of ``suspicious \nbehavior'' from an overzealous neighbor, the permanent resident could \nbe brought in for questioning, denied a lawyer, confined, and even \ntortured. Such a person would have no recourse in the courts for years, \nfor decades, forever.\n  Many people viewed this kind of nightmare scenario as fanciful, just \nthe rhetoric of a politician. It was not. It is all spelled out clearly \nin the language of the law that this body passed. In November, the \nscenario I spelled out was confirmed by the Department of Justice \nitself in a legal brief submitted in a Federal court in Virginia. The \nJustice Department, in a brief to dismiss a detainee's habeas case, \nsaid that the Military Commissions Act allows the Government to detain \nany non-citizen designated an enemy combatant without giving that \nperson any ability to challenge his detention in court. This is true, \nthe Justice Department said, even for someone arrested and imprisoned \nin the United States. The Washington Post wrote that the brief ``raises \nthe possibility that any of the millions of immigrants living in the \nUnited States could be subject to indefinite detention if they are \naccused of ties to terrorist groups.''\n  In fact, the situation is even more stark than The Washington Post \nstory suggested. The Justice Department's brief says that the \nGovernment can detain any noncitizen declared to be an enemy combatant. \nBut the law this Congress passed says the Government need not even make \nthat declaration: They can hold people indefinitely who are awaiting \ndetermination whether or not they are enemy combatants.\n  It gets worse. Republican leaders in the Senate followed the White \nHouse's lead and greatly expanded the definition of ``enemy \ncombatants'' in the dark of night in the final days before the bill's \npassage, so that enemy combatants need not be soldiers on any \nbattlefield. They can be people who donate small amounts of money, or \npeople that any group of decision-makers selected by the President \ndecides to call enemy combatants. The possibilities are chilling.\n  We have eliminated basic legal and human rights for the 12 million \nlawful permanent residents who live and work among us, to say nothing \nof the millions of other legal immigrants and visitors who we welcome \nto our shores each year. We have removed a vital check that our legal \nsystem provides against the Government arbitrarily detaining people for \nlife without charge. We may well have also made many of our remaining \nlimits against torture and cruel and inhuman treatment obsolete because \nthey are unenforceable. We have removed the mechanism the Constitution \nprovides to check Government overreaching and lawlessness.\n  This is wrong. It is unconstitutional. It is un-American. It is \ndesigned to ensure that the Bush-Cheney administration will never again \nbe embarrassed by a United States Supreme Court decision reviewing its \nunlawful abuses of power. The conservative Supreme Court, with seven of \nits nine members appointed by Republican Presidents, has been the only \ncheck on this administration's lawlessness. Certainly the last Congress \ndid not do it. With passage of the Military Commissions Act, the \nRepublican Congress completed the job of eviscerating its role as a \ncheck and balance on the administration.\n  Some Senators uneasy about the Military Commissions Act's disastrous \nhabeas provision took solace in the thought that it would be struck \ndown by the courts. Instead, the first court to consider that \nprovision, a Federal court in the District of Columbia, upheld the \nprovision. The DC Circuit, in a sharply divided 2-1 decision, upheld \nthat ruling, holding that at least the hundreds of detainees held in \nGuantanamo Bay cannot go to court to challenge their detention. We \nshould not outsource our moral, legal and constitutional responsibility \nto the courts. We cannot count on the courts to fix our mistakes. \nCongress must be accountable for its actions, and we should act to \nright this wrong.\n  Following the DC Circuit's decision, newspapers and experts from \nacross the country and across the political spectrum have called on \nCongress to take action. Editorial boards from the Washington Post and \nthe New York Times to the Evansville Courier & Press in Indiana, and \nthe Columbia Tribune in Missouri have called for reversing the MCA's \nhabeas provision. Prominent conservatives like Bob Barr and Bruce Fein, \nalong with Aberto Mora, former Navy General Counsel in the Bush \nAdministration, have echoed this call. I ask that a selection of these \neditorials be placed in the record.\n  A group of four distinguished admirals and generals who have served \nas senior military lawyers argued passionately for fixing this problem \nin a letter they sent to me earlier this week. They wrote, ``In \ndiscarding habeas corpus, we are jettisoning one of the core principles \nof our Nation precisely when we should be showcasing to the world our \nrespect for the rule of law and basic rights. These are the \ncharacteristics that make our nation great. These are the values our \nmen and women in uniform are fighting to preserve.''\n  Abolishing habeas corpus for anyone who the Government thinks might \nhave assisted enemies of the United States is unnecessary and morally \nwrong. It is a betrayal of the most basic values of freedom for which \nAmerica stands. It makes a mockery of the administration's lofty \nrhetoric about exporting freedom across the globe.\n\n[[Page S2964]]\n\n  We should take steps to ensure that our enemies can be brought to \njustice efficiently and quickly. I introduced a bill to do that back in \n2002, as did Senator Specter, when we each proposed a set of laws to \nestablish military commissions. The Bush-Cheney administration rejected \nour efforts and designed a regime the U.S. Supreme Court determined to \nbe unlawful. Establishing appropriate military commissions is not the \nquestion. We all agree to do that. What we need to revisit is the \nsuspension of the writ of habeas corpus for millions of legal \nimmigrants and others, denying their right to challenge indefinite \ndetainment on the Government's say-so.\n  It is from strength that America should defend our values and our \nConstitution. It takes commitment to those values to demand \naccountability from the Government. We should not be legislating from \nfear. In standing up for American values and security, I will keep \nworking on this issue until we restore the checks and balances that are \nfundamental to preserving the liberties that define us as a nation. We \ncan ensure our security without giving up our liberty. That is what the \n9/11 Commission bill aims to do, and that is what this amendment will \nhelp to achieve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following editorials \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 4, 2007]\n\n                   Extend Legal Rights to Guantanamo\n\n              (By Alberto J. Mora and Thomas R. Pickering)\n\n       For more than 200 years, the courts have served as the \n     ultimate safeguard for our civil liberties. A critical part \n     of this role has been the judicial branch's ability to \n     consider writs of habeas corpus, through which people who \n     have been imprisoned can challenge the decision to hold them \n     in government custody. In this way, habeas corpus has \n     provided an important check on executive power. However, \n     because of a provision of the Military Commissions Act passed \n     last fall, this fundamental role of the courts has been \n     seriously reduced.\n       Habeas corpus--the Great Writ--has been the preeminent \n     safeguard of individual liberty for centuries by providing \n     meaningful judicial review of executive action and ensuring \n     that our government has complied with the Constitution and \n     the laws of the United States. Habeas review has always been \n     most critical in cases of executive detention without charge \n     because it provides prisoners a meaningful opportunity to \n     contest their detention before a neutral decision maker.\n       In 2004, the Supreme Court held that the protections of \n     habeas corpus extend to detainees at Guantanamo Bay, who may \n     rely on them to challenge the lawfulness of their indefinite \n     detentions. The court noted that at its historical core, \n     ``the writ of habeas corpus has served as a means of \n     reviewing the legality of Executive detention, and it is in \n     that context that its protections have been strongest.''\n       But the Military Commissions Act eliminates the federal \n     courts' ability to hear habeas petitions filed by certain \n     noncitizens detained by the United States at Guantanamo Bay \n     and elsewhere. Late last month the U.S. Court of Appeals for \n     the D.C. Circuit upheld this provision and dismissed the \n     lawsuits filed by many of the Guantanamo detainees.\n       We fully recognize that our government must have the power \n     to detain suspected foreign terrorists to protect national \n     security. But removing the federal courts' ability to hear \n     habeas corpus claims does not serve that goal. On the \n     contrary, habeas corpus is crucial to ensure that the \n     government's power to detain is exercised wisely, lawfully \n     and consistently with American values. That is why we have \n     joined with the Constitution Project's broad and bipartisan \n     group of judges, former members of Congress, executive branch \n     officials, scholars and others to urge Congress to restore \n     federal court jurisdiction to hear these habeas corpus \n     petitions.\n       The unconventional nature of the ``war on terrorism'' makes \n     habeas corpus more, not less, important. Unlike what is found \n     in traditional conflicts, there is no clearly defined enemy, \n     no identifiable battlefield and no foreseeable end to the \n     fighting. The government claims the power to imprison \n     individuals without charge indefinitely, potentially forever. \n     It is essential that there be a meaningful process to ensure \n     that the United States does not mistakenly deprive innocent \n     people of their liberty. Habeas corpus provides that process.\n       We recognize that the Military Commissions Act still \n     enables the Guantanamo detainees to have hearings before a \n     Combatant Status Review Tribunal, which is charged with \n     determining whether the detainee is in fact an ``enemy \n     combatant.'' But unlike court hearings, the tribunal hearings \n     rely on secret evidence, deny detainees the chance to obtain \n     and present their own evidence, and allow the government to \n     use evidence obtained by coercive interrogation methods. \n     While these tribunals have some utility, they cannot replace \n     the critical role of habeas corpus.\n       The government has detained some Guantanamo prisoners for \n     more than five years without giving them a meaningful \n     opportunity to be heard. The United States cannot expect \n     other nations to afford its citizens the basic guarantees \n     provided by habeas corpus unless it provides those guarantees \n     to others.\n       And in our constitutional system of checks and balances, it \n     is unwise for the legislative branch to limit an established \n     and traditional avenue of judicial review.\n       Americans should be proud of their commitment to the rule \n     of law and not diminish the protections it provides. Our \n     country's detention policy has undermined its reputation \n     around the world and has weakened support for the fight \n     against terrorism. Restoring habeas corpus rights would help \n     repair the damage and demonstrate U.S. commitment to a \n     counterterrorism policy that is tough but that also respects \n     individual rights. Congress should restore the habeas corpus \n     rights that were eliminated by the Military Commissions Act, \n     and President Bush should sign that bill into law.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Feb. 27, 2007]\n\n                          Rule of Law Crippled\n\n                            (By Bruce Fein)\n\n       The Great Writ of habeas corpus is to the rule of law what \n     oxygen is to life.\n       The U.S. Court of Appeals imprudently crippled the writ \n     last week in Lakhdar Boumediene v. Bush (Feb. 20). A divided \n     three-judge panel declared suspected alien enemy combatants \n     held indefinitely at Guantanamo Bay may not question their \n     detentions in federal courts though petitions for writs of \n     habeas corpus under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 \n     (MCA). Writing for a 2-1 majority, Judge Raymond Randolph \n     mistakenly endorsed a cramped interpretation of habeas corpus \n     as though he were addressing a tax exemption in the Internal \n     Revenue Code.\n       Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Accordingly, the Great \n     Writ prevents the president from disappearing political \n     opponents or the unpopular into dungeons based on his say-so \n     alone, a frightening power that has earmarked despots from \n     time immemorial. The writ enables detainees to require the \n     president to establish the factual and legal foundations for \n     their detentions before an independent judiciary.\n       The goal is justice, the end of civil society as James \n     Madison explained in the Federalist Papers. The president may \n     be inclined to detain bogus enemy combatants in the war \n     against global terrorism to inflate public fear and to \n     justify executive aggrandizements, for example, spying \n     without judicial or legislative oversight in contravention of \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. A former \n     commandant and deputy commandant at Guantanamo Bay have \n     averred that most of its detainees do not belong there.\n       The Great Writ does not threaten to release a single \n     genuine enemy combatant. The burden to defeat the Great Writ \n     is modest: plausible evidence (far short of proof beyond a \n     reasonable doubt) that the detainee was implicated in active \n     hostilities against the United States. In Rasul v. Bush \n     (2004), the Supreme Court held the federal habeas corpus \n     statute extended to aliens at Guantanamo. Two years later, \n     Congress overruled Rasul in the MCA by suspending the Great \n     Writ for alien enemy combatants detained anywhere. Its \n     proponents were unable to cite a single habeas case either \n     before or after Rasul that precipitated the release of an \n     authentic terrorist. Such a case might be hypothesized with a \n     fevered enough imagination. But the law would become ``a ass, \n     a idiot,'' in the words of Charles Dickens' Mr. Bumble, if \n     required to answer jumbo speculations that never happen in \n     the real world.\n       Article I, section 9, clause 2 of the Constitution \n     (Suspension Clause) declares ``The Privilege of the Writ of \n     Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless in Cases of \n     Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.'' \n     Judge Randolph tacitly acknowledged in Boumediene that \n     neither habeas exception justified the MCA, i.e., global \n     terrorists have not invaded America. He insisted, however, \n     that the Great Writ has no application to aliens detained \n     outside the sovereignty of the United States; and, that \n     Guantanamo Bay is under the sovereignty of Cuba, albeit \n     subject to a perpetual United States lease.\n       The latter observation is risible. Fidel Castro has no more \n     access or control over Guantanamo than he does over \n     Washington, D.C., or Des Moines. If Mr. Castro formally \n     abandoned sovereignty over Guantanamo tomorrow, nothing would \n     change. Judge Randolph maintained that a declaration by the \n     political branches in the MCA that Guantanamo is not part of \n     the United States is conclusive on the courts. But the \n     dimensions of the Great Writ which defines what we are as a \n     people should not be so easily contracted by semantic \n     jugglery.\n       Judge Randolph observed that historically the Great Writ in \n     Great Britain was withheld from remote islands, garrisons and \n     dominions. Compliance with a writ from overseas would have \n     been impractical because of time limitations for producing \n     the detainee. But as Chief Justice John Marshall taught in \n     McCulloch v. Maryland (1819), the Constitution was designed \n     to endure for the ages and\n\n[[Page S2965]]\n\n     to be construed accordingly to achieve its purposes. Congress \n     is empowered to create an Air Force, although the \n     Constitution speaks only of armies and navies. The Fourth \n     Amendment protects against indiscriminate government \n     interceptions of e-mails and conversations, although its \n     language speaks only of persons, houses, papers and effects. \n     Similarly, the Great Writ should apply to suspected alien \n     enemy combatants detained abroad unless compliance would be \n     impractical or unworkable.\n       No civilized Constitution risks injustice for the sake of \n     injustice, aside from the folly of creating poster children \n     to boost al Qaeda's recruitments. The Supreme Court should \n     grant review of Boumediene and reverse the appeals court.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 23, 2007]\n\n                          A Congressional Duty\n\n       ON THE FIRST day of the new Congress, two leading senators \n     announced they would join in an attempt to reverse the hasty \n     and ill-considered decision of the previous Congress to \n     deprive foreign prisoners at Guantanamo Bay of the ancient \n     right of habeas corpus, which allows the appeal of \n     imprisonment to a judge. One of the senators, Arlen Specter \n     (R-Pa.), predicted that the courts would rule that the \n     provision of the Military Commissions Act eliminating habeas \n     corpus was unconstitutional; he nevertheless joined the \n     incoming chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Patrick \n     J. Leahy (D-Vt.), in sponsoring a bill restoring the appeal \n     right.\n       Now Mr. Specter's prediction is looking less sure: The U.S. \n     Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled this week that \n     Congress's act was constitutional, and it threw the cases of \n     dozens of Guantanamo detainees out of federal court. That \n     ruling will almost certainly be reviewed by the Supreme Court \n     on appeal, but Congress should not wait for its decision. It \n     should move quickly on the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act.\n       The Supreme Court has already twice overruled decisions by \n     the D.C. Circuit denying Guantanamo detainees habeas rights, \n     but it is hard to predict whether it will do so again. The \n     court's composition has changed since those rulings, with the \n     addition of justices more likely to be sympathetic to the \n     arguments of the Bush administration. Congress has reversed \n     part of the basis for the court's previous rulings by \n     enacting a statute saying that persons found to be ``enemy \n     combatants'' by military review panels, including detainees \n     held at Guantanamo, have only a limited right of appeal.\n       The principal remaining question is whether Congress's \n     action is permitted under Article I, Section 9 of the \n     Constitution, which says, ``The Privilege of the Writ of \n     Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended'' except in cases of \n     ``Rebellion or Invasion.'' Two judges of the three-member \n     appeals court panel ruled that the provision does not apply \n     at Guantanamo because it is not on U.S. territory and the \n     detainees are foreigners. A dissent written by Judge Judith \n     Rogers pointed out that one of the earlier Supreme Court \n     rulings stated that giving appeal rights to Guantanamo \n     inmates ``is consistent with the historical reach of the writ \n     of habeas corpus.'' But the court has not ruled squarely on \n     the constitutional issue.\n       Rather than wait for the court's decision, Congress should \n     correct its own mistake. The 51 to 48 vote rejecting Mr. \n     Specter's previous attempt to restore habeas condemned \n     hundreds of foreign prisoners to indefinite detention without \n     trial at Guantanamo; only a few score are expected to be \n     prosecuted by the military commissions. Since 2002 it has \n     become clear that a number of prisoners at the facility were \n     arrested in error, are not terrorists and pose no threat to \n     the United States. Moreover, improvements in the prisoners' \n     treatment have come about largely because of their court \n     appeals. Congress has both a practical and a moral interest \n     in ensuring that this basic human right is restored.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 22, 2007]\n\n                   American Liberty at the Precipice\n\n       In another low moment for American justice, a federal \n     appeals court ruled on Tuesday that detainees held at the \n     prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, do not have the right to \n     be heard in court. The ruling relied on a shameful law that \n     President Bush stampeded through Congress last fall that \n     gives dangerously short shrift to the Constitution.\n       The right of prisoners to challenge their confinement--\n     habeas corpus--is enshrined in the Constitution and is \n     central to American liberty. Congress and the Supreme Court \n     should act quickly and forcefully to undo the grievous damage \n     that last fall's law--and this week's ruling--have done to \n     this basic freedom.\n       The Supreme Court ruled last year on the jerry-built system \n     of military tribunals that the Bush Administration \n     established to try the Guantanamo detainees, finding it \n     illegal. Mr. Bush responded by driving through Congress the \n     Military Commissions Act, which presumed to deny the right of \n     habeas corpus to any noncitizen designated as an ``enemy \n     combatant.'' This frightening law raises insurmountable \n     obstacles for prisoners to challenge their detentions. And it \n     gives the government the power to take away habeas rights \n     from any noncitizen living in the United States who is \n     unfortunate enough to be labeled an enemy combatant.\n       The United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit, which rejected the detainees' claims by a \n     vote of 2 to 1, should have permitted the detainees to be \n     heard in court--and it should have ruled that the law is \n     unconstitutional.\n       As Judge Judith Rogers argued in a strong dissent, the \n     Supreme Court has already rejected the argument that \n     detainees do not have habeas rights because Guantanamo is \n     located outside the United States. Judge Rogers also rightly \n     noted that the Constitution limits the circumstances under \n     which Congress can suspend habeas to ``cases of Rebellion or \n     invasion,'' which is hardly the situation today. Moreover, \n     she said, the act's alternative provisions for review of \n     cases are constitutionally inadequate. The Supreme Court \n     should add this case to its docket right away and reverse it \n     before this term ends.\n       Congress should not wait for the Supreme Court to act. With \n     the Democrats now in charge, it is in a good position to pass \n     a new law that fixes the dangerous mess it has made. Senators \n     Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and Arlen Specter, \n     Republican of Pennsylvania, have introduced a bill that would \n     repeal the provision in the Military Commissions Act that \n     purports to obliterate the habeas corpus rights of detainees.\n       The Bush administration's assault on civil liberties does \n     not end with habeas corpus. Congress should also move quickly \n     to pass another crucial bill, introduced by Senator \n     Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, that, among other \n     steps, would once and for all outlaw the use of evidence \n     obtained through torture.\n       When the Founding Fathers put habeas corpus in Article I of \n     the Constitution, they were underscoring the vital importance \n     to a democracy of allowing prisoners to challenge their \n     confinement in a court of law. Much has changed since Sept. \n     11, but the bedrock principles of American freedom must \n     remain.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Columbia Tribune, Feb. 22, 2007]\n\n               Enemy Combatants: A Fast Track to Justice\n\n       Under the president's shortcut plan for wartime justice, \n     anyone he labels an ``enemy combatant'' loses normal \n     constitutional rights. The government denies hundreds of \n     detainees in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the right to a hearing in \n     court.\n       Last year the U.S. Supreme Court declared this denial \n     unconstitutional. In response, the Bush administration pushed \n     through Congress the Military Commissions Act authorizing the \n     use of such commissions instead of courts for hearing these \n     cases.\n       This week the District of Columbia appeals court upheld the \n     new law, a decision certain to be appealed, sending the issue \n     back to the highest court, where I hope this latest gambit \n     will be denied.\n       I suppose President George W. Bush and his crew refuse to \n     let these prisoners have habeas corpus hearings in the U.S. \n     court system because they fear the outcome. Why else? And if \n     so, what does that say about their expectations for the \n     military commissions? That these extra-judicial bodies will \n     affirm the government's extralegal detention policies? What \n     else?\n       This dogged insistence is but one example of Bush's \n     eagerness to ignore essential constitutional guarantees, \n     ranking right up there with his programs of warrantless \n     wiretapping and other surveillance of U.S. citizens.\n       Bush simply refuses to go to court for oversight of his \n     administration's actions in denial of civil rights. Before he \n     took office, it was simple. When a person is arrested, he has \n     a right to a real court hearing to determine the legitimacy \n     of the arrest and his ultimate guilt or innocence. When \n     citizens' privacy is invaded by government, it is to be done \n     only with court permission.\n       We see signs that the American public is getting fed up \n     with these constitutional shortcuts.

That right \n     of habeas corpus is a bedrock principle of Anglo-Saxon law \n     going back eight centuries. It is a fundamental right \n     enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.\n       Carving out an exception to that right based on a sketchy \n     designation as an ``enemy combatant'' was a terrible \n     precedent, essentially justifying arbitrary imprisonment.\n       The senior members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Arlen \n     Specter, R-Pa., and\n\n[[Page S2966]]\n\n     Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., tried to rectify this departure from \n     U.S. respect for the rule of law last year and failed by \n     three votes.\n       They have reintroduced their bill in the new Congress.\n       Another bill, by Leahy and Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., would \n     restore the right of habeas corpus and clean up some other \n     unfortunate provisions in the MCA by sharpening the \n     definition of ``illegal combatant,'' excluding evidence \n     obtained by coercion and allowing military judges to exclude \n     hearsay evidence.\n       If the circuit-court ruling stands, the practical effect \n     would be to force the federal courts to dismiss more than 400 \n     habeas-corpus appeals. The ruling will certainly be appealed \n     to the Supreme Court, and one hopes that the high court would \n     stand up for this ancient and fundamental right.\n       But it would be better if Congress acted first to \n     demonstrate our faith and confidence in our own system.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of amendment No. 366, \noffered by my colleague, Senator Schumer. This important amendment \nwould restore the export restrictions on highly enriched, HEU, bomb-\ngrade uranium for use as a reactor fuel or as targets to produce \nmedical isotopes, except on an interim basis to facilities that are \nactively pursuing conversion to low-enriched uranium LEU.\n  Let's look at the history behind this amendment. From 1992 until \n2005, we had a law that worked. Under that law, we allowed the \nexportation of HEU for the production of medical isotopes as long as \nthe recipient of that highly enriched uranium cooperated with the \nUnited States to get to the point where the production of these medical \nisotopes could be done with low-enriched uranium. Low-enriched uranium \nis not of sufficient grade to make bombs. This law provided the \nincentive to work with the United States to attain conversion to LEU. \nMost important, it furthered our antiproliferation goal of reducing the \ncirculation of HEU outside the United States. It is important to note \nthat from 1992 until 2005, licenses for the shipments of HEU were never \ndenied and the medical isotopes needed for radiopharmaceuticals were \nnever in short supply.\n  Then in 2005 this effective, 13-year-old law was gutted through an \namendment to the Energy Policy Act and the export restrictions on HEU \nwere eliminated. These restrictions were lifted over the objection of a \nmajority of this body, which voted in favor of retaining existing law, \n52 to 46, after a thorough debate. You may ask why an amendment to \nallow weapons-grade uranium to leave the United States without \nrestriction would resurface in conference and end up enacted into law. \nI ask that same question. There are no good explanations. One thing is \ncertain, though; we need to fix it.\n  The major producers of medical isotopes are all foreign companies \noperating outside the United States. Under the previous law, these \ncompanies were moving toward conversion to LEU, and many have developed \nthe capability to produce medical isotopes from LEU. Australia and the \nNetherlands are two good examples. The other major producer of medical \nisotopes is in Canada. That Canadian company has resisted conversion to \nLEU and in 2005 that company had enough HEU-material stockpiled to \nbuild at least four bombs. Today, who knows how much it may have \nstockpiled. One thing we do know is, if this material is lost or \nstolen, the United States would be faced with a serious nuclear threat. \nWe must rectify this mistake.

This bipartisan Commission \nmet for over a year, had hearings all over the country, did excellent \nwork. It is important we do not delay their recommendations any longer. \nThe safety and security of our country is too important.\n  Before we adjourn today, I wish to say a few words in praise of my \nfriend and colleague, the senior Senator from Louisiana, Mary Landrieu. \nIn the face of many objections from the minority, Senator Landrieu has \nbeen tireless in working to eliminate rules that are nothing more than \nmiles of redtape and mountains of paperwork that are delaying the \nrebuilding and recovery of the gulf coast, which was devastated by a \nnatural disaster we now know as Katrina.\n  Her amendment No. 295 is very simple. It would waive the requirement \nthat local communities put up a 10-percent match for every Federal \ndollar we spend to rebuild public facilities such as schools and fire \nstations destroyed by Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. These were all \ndevastating hurricanes.\n  The President has the authority to do this with a single stroke of \nthe pen. In fact, I joined with Senators Landrieu and Lieberman urging \nhim a month ago to do just that, to use his office to lift these \nsignificant burdens to recovery. To this day, he simply has not done \nthat. He waived these rules for New York after 9/11. The first \nPresident Bush waived these rules after Hurricane Andrew, which was \ndevastating but does not compare to what Katrina did. In fact, these \nrules have been waived every time disaster recovery costs have grown to \neven a fraction of those we are now seeing. But not with Katrina and \nits pals, Rita and Wilma.\n  So that brings us to why we are here today. What the President would \nnot do we must do legislatively. I would say to all those who are from \nthe administration who are listening to us talk today, when the \nPresident gets back from Latin America, let's have him do this. It \nwould save our having to do it in the supplemental. He could call down \nhere. Even maybe he could get some of the people to back off on the \nother side so we could do it before this bill passes. The President \ndoes not need legislation. He has the authority to do that right now. I \nwould hope he would do that. The Senator from Louisiana has been \npatient and very aggressive. That is what is necessary. I would hope \nher patience would be rewarded with the President signing his name \nwaiving this 10 percent. It is something that needs to be done. If not, \nI have committed to her and the people of Louisiana, through her \nGovernor and others who have come to see me, that we are going to do \nwhat is right.\n  This is important. It has happened for every other major disaster, \nand it should happen for this one. If we cannot do it on this bill, and \nthe President will not do it, then we will have to do it on the \nsupplemental that will be here in a little over 2 weeks. The House has \nalready said they intend to do this. We also intend to do this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the majority leader for those words and for him restating \npublicly and unequivocally his commitment to getting this job done, not \njust for the people of Louisiana but for the people of the gulf coast. \nWe have spent a lot of time on the floor, as the majority leader knows, \ntalking about rebuilding other places in the world. The leader is \ncorrect, and the Democratic caucus is\n\n[[Page S2967]]\n\nleading to try to redirect some of that attention to right here at \nhome.\n  We have over 30 million people who live on the gulf coast right now, \ntoday, this Friday. The work of rebuilding is being thwarted, is being \nhampered, is being delayed by outmoded, unrealistic Federal regulations \nand bureaucratic redtape that is choking this recovery.\n  Now, normally this redtape is a nuisance. We work through it. It is \ninconvenient. It is a nuisance. But we just sort of move through the \nredtape of Government. But in this case, it is literally a noose that \nis around the necks of people, of business owners, large and small, \nfamily members--strangling their efforts to recover their communities \nthat were devastated.\n  Just to put some pieces in the picture I am trying to paint, I would \nlike to just share some details about Cameron Parish. You do not hear \nmuch about Cameron Parish because there are only 9,658 people who live \nthere. We hear a lot about New Orleans. We hear a lot about Jefferson \nParish. We hear a lot about even St. Bernard Parish. But little Cameron \nParish, down on the southwest border, that was directly hit by Rita, \nthe ``forgotten storm.'' We have not. The legislative delegation from \nLouisiana has not forgotten it, but many others fail to remember it.\n\n  Cameron Parish lost five fire stations, four community recreation \ncenters, four public libraries, three maintenance barns, two parish \nmultipurpose buildings, Courthouse Circle; Cameron Parish Police Jury \nAnnex Building--destroyed; Cameron Parish Sheriff's Department \nInvestigative Office--destroyed. The health unit was destroyed. The \nschool board office was destroyed. The mosquito control barn was \ndestroyed. And the waterworks district No. 10 office was destroyed. \nVirtually every public building was destroyed, except the courthouse, \nwhich was built in the early part of the century. It is several stories \nhigh, and it sort of shines white on the coast. If you flew over it, \nyou could actually see it. It is quite large, and many people's lives \nhave actually been saved by going to the courthouse during storms, \nwhere they have been kept from the high water. But everything else in \nthe parish is gone. This little parish can no more put up a 10-percent \nmatch to rebuild four libraries, all their schools, than the man in the \nmoon.\n  Now, normally, if the hurricane was not so bad, the State of \nLouisiana, which is a big State--not huge, but we are not small, we are \nmedium-sized--would be strong enough to step up, give Cameron Parish \nthe 10 percent of each of these very important public works for the \n10,000 people or so who live there. But the problem is, Katrina and \nRita were so devastating to the whole State that our State is not \nstrong enough.\n  That is why we have a Federal Government. When the State is not \nstrong enough, because of the storms, the Nation steps up. I am asking \nthe President of the United States to step up and use his authority to \nwaive this 10-percent match so the people of Cameron and the people \nright next door to them on the Texas line who were equally hard hit and \nthe people to the right of them on the map--the good people of \nMississippi--there are towns in Mississippi that lost every school, \nevery library. The State of Mississippi will have a difficult time as \nwell. But the State of Louisiana is having an unusually difficult time \nbecause of the devastation.\n  I want to say again--because I think numbers can paint a picture or \ntell a story better than even words can--the per capita damage to \nFlorida from Hurricane Andrew was $139. The per capita damage to the \nState of New York was $390 from the attacks on the World Trade Center. \nThese two events were unprecedented and unheard of. Most storms are \nlike $20 per capita, $50 per capita. They hardly ever go over $50 per \ncapita.\n  When Hurricane Andrew came through, it really woke us up to the poor \npeople of Florida. It wrecked Homestead, FL, and was a great weight for \nthe State of Florida. But we all pitched in and helped, and this match \nwas waived.\n  When 9/11 hit, it shook the foundations of this Nation. It also shook \nthe great city of New York. But it was waived, and we all pitched in \nand helped.\n  Here we have Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and we sit here wondering: \nWhere is the Government? Where is the President? Where is the \nminority's thinking on this subject? Our per capita damage is $6,700. \nIt defies anything we have ever seen.\n  Our State has been asking for this 10 percent reduction for 18 \nmonths. Do we have to keep asking for it? Do we have to keep supplying \ndata like this? What is it going to take to get them to understand if \nthere was ever a situation where the 10 percent should be waived, if \nthere was ever an example like Cameron Parish, this is it.\n  So this amendment is pending. It is being opposed by an undisclosed \nperson. But the minority is opposing it. I will meet the minority more \nthan halfway. I am asking the administration, please, over the weekend, \nto reconsider. Let us get this done on this bill. Every day, every week \ncounts. If we cannot, the majority leader has said--and I, of course, \nwill support the effort, and many of the members of this caucus are \nsupporting it--we will do it on the supplemental. The problem is, it \nwill take us weeks. Perhaps the supplemental will run into a veto \nthreat. Who knows? Because there are lots of issues that are going to \ncome up on that supplemental. But this issue is clear. It could be \neasily fixed on this bill. I am going to work through the weekend to \nsee if we can find any kind of compromise that could give a green light \nto the people of Cameron Parish. Let me say that even without that \nlight, we visited Cameron Parish several times. Their little girls' \nsoftball team that was in contention when the storm hit went on to win \nthe championship. Without a cafeteria, without a school, without a gym \nto practice, with most of their teachers' homes underwater and their \nown homes underwater, and most of them living in trailers or in tents, \nthis team went on to win the championship. So when people say that \npeople in Louisiana don't have resilience, we are being as resilient as \nwe possibly can be under these circumstances. All we are asking is to \nplease look at the data, please consider our case and allow us to get \nthis 10 percent waiver so that the public works can move forward on \nfire stations, police stations, libraries, and infrastructure, most \ncertainly essential to communities rebuilding. As we rebuild, we are \nrebuilding on higher ground. We are rebuilding with better building \nmaterials. We are mitigating against future storms. We are not building \nin the old-fashioned ways. But if this 10 percent doesn't get waived, \nwe are not going to be building new or old or otherwise. We won't be \nbuilding.\n\n  As I said, we may not be a fancy coast, but we are America's energy \ncoast. We are proud of the fish that we bring in right off of Cameron \nParish. We are proud of the shipping industry. We are proud of the ship \nchannel that brings liquefied natural gas to keep the lights on in this \nChamber and sends gas to New York and Philadelphia and California every \nday.\n  This is Cameron Parish. They are not sunbathing down in Cameron \nParish. Yet we can't find it out of the goodwill of our hearts--we are \nspending all of this money to rebuild Iraq, and I have 10,000 people \ndown on the coast. Does anybody remember they are Americans, taxpaying \nAmericans with no libraries, no schools, and no possible way to put up \ntheir 10 percent match because they lost everything? I would think that \nsomewhere in this trillion-dollar budget and maybe in the heart of the \nminority they could find some room for the people of Cameron Parish. \nPlease consider our request over this weekend to get this 10 percent \nwaived.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/09/senate-section/article/S2967-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2967-S2968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Madam President, the epidemic of gun violence is \nendangering many in our communities both large and small. Illegal guns \nare being used at an increasing rate to harm our children, our \nneighbors, and our police officers. We must not allow this spiral to \ncontinue.\n  One example of a community heavily affected by gun violence is in \nPennsylvania, where in 2004 the State led the Nation in homicide rates \namong African-American victims. Handguns were used in 81 percent of the \nState's murders. In Pennsylvania's largest city, Philadelphia, more \nthan 2,000 people were injured by firearms last year alone. According \nto the Philadelphia police department, this represents an increase of \n31 percent in just 3 years. Philadelphia saw 406 people murdered in \n2006, up from 380 in 2005.\n  Just a short trip south of Pennsylvania lies another example of the \nhow guns are affecting our communities. According to the nonprofit \norganization Ceasefire Maryland, a crime is committed with an assault \nrifle every 48 hours in the State of Maryland. The Maryland State \nLegislature is attempting to address this horrifying statistic by \nconsidering a bill backed by Governor Martin O'Malley that would ban 45 \ndifferent assault weapons statewide. This action could serve as an \nexcellent example of a legislature taking a commonsense approach to \nreducing gun violence. Congress and President Bush have allowed the \nFederal assault weapons ban to expire.\n  Month after month, we watch these tragedies unfold on the news and \nyet Congress has not taken the necessary steps to help control these \nacts of violence or ease the anxiety that many parents and families \nfeel each day as their loved ones go to school, church, or work. \nAccording to the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, gun crime rose \n49.4 percent nationally between 2004 and 2005. Almost 5.9 million \npeople were victims of gun violence between 1996 and 2005.\n  The American people have a right to demand that their schools, places \nof worship, and other public places be better protected from gun \nviolence. Much more can be done to break the cycle of gun violence that \nplagues our communities. I urge my colleagues to take up and pass \ncommonsense legislation that will help address this problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/09/senate-section/article/S2968-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:30 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 700.

A bill to provide for the sale of approximately 25 acres of \npublic land to the Turnabout Ranch, Escalante, Utah, at fair market \nvalue; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that would \ncorrect a property trespass question involving a 25-acre parcel of \nBureau of Land Management (BLM) land in Garfield County, UT. The parcel \nis part of the Turnabout Ranch, which hosts a successful and popular \nprogram to rehabilitate troubled youth.\n  The trespass conflict is the result of an erroneous survey in January \n1999, at the time the Congress approved a major land exchange, P.L. \n105-335, between the State of Utah and the BLM and erroneously included \na part of the Turnabout Ranch. The land is located along the border of \nthe Grand Staircase Escalante (GSE) Monument. My bill makes a slight \nboundary change to resolve the trespass question. This would grant the \nowners of the ranch the opportunity to purchase the erroneously \nsurveyed land at fair market value so that this very important program \nfor at-risk youth can continue unhindered.\n  Since 1995, Turn-About Ranch has graduated some 500 troubled and at-\nrisk teenagers through an intense program of training and \nrehabilitation. The ranch employs about 35 Garfield County residents. \nThe Turn-About Ranch program has strong support from the local \ncommunity and the Garfield Country Commission.\n  Historically used for agriculture and grazing purposes, the ranch was \npurchased by the Townsend Family who leased the land to Turn-About \nRanch, Inc., for the exclusive purpose of restoring dignity and self-\nesteem to wayward teenagers. Because government-owned land administered \nby the BLM surrounds the private land, the only way to resolve the \ntrespass is for the Congress to pass legislation.\n  This legislation offers a simple and fair solution to a fairly \ntechnical problem on our public lands. I hope Congress can use this \nlegislation to resolve this problem in the very near future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 833. A bill to make the United States competitive in a global \neconomy; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Competitiveness \nThrough Education, Technology, and Enterprise Act otherwise known as \nthe COMPETE Act. The bill I introduce today is similar to legislation I \nhave introduced in the 109th Congress. I am very pleased to be joined \nby my very good friend and colleague, Senator Mark Pryor, who shares my \ncommitment to keeping the U. S. competitive not just for today but for \ntomorrow as well.\n  Earlier this week Microsoft's Bill Gates came before the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee to talk about keeping our \ncountry competitive. He said that ``the U.S. cannot maintain its \neconomic leadership unless our workforce consists of people who have \nthe knowledge and skills needed to drive innovation.'' Moreover he said \nthat ``we simply cannot sustain an economy based on innovation unless \nour citizens are educated in math, science and engineering.''\n  My bill is inspired by the same line of thinking. The COMPETE Act is \nbased on three simple, fundamental ideas: 1. The U.S. needs to remain a \nleader when it comes to technology and innovation; 2. We must prepare \nour future workforce and ``up-skill'' our current workforce for our \nincreasingly global and information technology driven economy; and 3. \nWe must better utilize existing private-public partnerships to achieve \nthese goals.\n  The challenges we face are stark especially when it comes to the \nfuture competitiveness of our workforce. Today, China graduates four \ntimes as many engineers as the U.S. while the small nation of South \nKorea graduates just as many as we do. In three short years, Asia will \nbe home to more than 90 percent of the world's scientists and \nengineers.\n  According to a recent poll, 84 percent of middle school students \npreferred to eat their vegetables than do their math homework. As Tom \nFriedman wrote in his book the World is Flat when he was growing up as \na kid his mother used to tell him to eat all his vegetables because \nkids in China were starving. Today, his mother would say do your \nhomework because the kids in China are starving for our jobs.\n  As if this were not enough, we also need to concern ourselves with \nthe coming retirement wave of high-skilled workers in the fields of \nengineering, science, technology and math. According to the National \nScience Foundation, about a third of American scientists and engineers \nare over 50 years old.\n  To encourage and promote our students to seek out these types of \ncareers we need to improve the performance of students in science and \nmath. Several reports have indicated that U.S. students do not perform \nat the level of their international counterparts in math and science. \nOur fourth graders compare fairly well internationally, but by high \nschool American students slip to 24th place out of 29 developing \nnations in math literacy and problem solving.\n  We must make sure that our educational system is up to the task in \npreparing our future workforce. To reward elementary and secondary \nschools for a job well done, COMPETE provides bonus grants to high \nperforming elementary and secondary schools that show the greatest \nimprovement in their State assessments in math and science. COMPETE \nalso increases the alternative percentage limitation for corporate \ncharitable contributions to the mathematics and science partnership \nprogram in order to encourage greater support from the corporate world.\n\n  To help ensure that more students receive a higher education and have \nthe skills necessary to compete in today's global economy COMPETE puts \nthe Senate on record in support of raising the maximum Pell Grant to \n$5,400.\n  In addition to undergraduate education, COMPETE also establishes a \nmatching grant program where Federal and private resources will be used \nto help graduate students in science, technology, engineering and \nmathematics meet the cost of getting a graduate degree. This grant \nprogram will also support outreach and mentoring activities to increase \nthe participation of underrepresented groups in these fields at every \nlevel of education.\n  To keep today's workforce competitive and prepare our future \nworkforce, COMPETE creates a tax credit to help ``up-skill'' America's \nworkers so that\n\n[[Page S2971]]\n\nthey can compete in today's increasingly information and technology-\ndriven global economy. COMPETE also creates a workforce development \ngrant pilot program to encourage leading innovative small businesses to \nprovide short-term workforce training opportunities for college \nstudents who major in the fields of science, technology, engineering \nand math. Our employers need more than just raw materials. They need a \nhighly skilled workforce that provides extra value to their products \nand services.\n  Finally in order to ensure our leadership in innovation, COMPETE \nmakes the research and development credit permanent. We must look at \nways to ensure the ability of American companies to stay at the \nforefront of the technological revolution. Temporarily extending the \nR tax credit makes it difficult for our businesses to undertake \nresearch and development activities necessary for our continued long-\nterm competitiveness in the global economy.\n  Earlier this week, bipartisan comprehensive competitiveness \nlegislation known as the America Competes Act was introduced. I am a \nproud original cosponsor of this bill which seeks to respond to the \nrecommendations made by the National Academies' ``Rising Above the \nGathering Storm'' report and the Council on Competitiveness'' \n``Innovate America'' report.\n  In an effort to contribute to this important discussion I am \nintroducing COMPETE, which complements the America Competes Act through \nits emphasis on innovation and workforce development and public-private \neducation partnership in the areas of science, technology, engineering \nand math.\n  We must realize the fact that our competitiveness relative to the \nglobal economy is in real danger. This situation is smoldering--it's \nnot a five-alarm fire yet--I just hope we don't act too late. If you \nthrow a frog into boiling water, it jumps out. If you throw a frog into \nwarm water, it will sit there comfortably until its internal organs \noverheat and it dies. Let's not let ourselves wake up in a few years to \nsee that our global competitiveness has slipped away.\n  I am committed to working on this issue now. While the challenges to \nour leadership in the global economy are indeed significant, I am \nconfident and optimistic that we will successfully address challenges \nto our leadership in the global economy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 833\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require annual testimony before Congress by the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Accounting Standards \nBoard, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, relating to \nefforts to promote transparency in financial reporting; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would \ntake a small but significant step toward identifying and repairing some \nof the regulatory problems currently found in our country's financial \nmarkets.\n  In 2002, our financial markets were in serious trouble. In the wake \nof Enron and other prominent accounting scandals, the public's \nconfidence in the markets was low. Investors expressed their lack of \nconfidence by taking their money out of the stock market, and the \nmarket indices plummeted. In response to this crisis--and that is \nexactly what it was, a crisis--Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act \nof 2002.\n  The law did what it was designed to do--re-establish faith in our \nfinancial markets--but it came at a cost. Complying with several of the \nbill's provisions has increased significantly the costs of doing \nbusiness as a public corporation. Many large corporations continue to \nspend millions of dollars every year in order to comply with the \nSarbanes-Oxley law. This, they can afford. However, many smaller firms \nhave found the costs of compliance with the Act to be crushing, \nburdensome, and negatively affecting their ability to compete in a \nglobal marketplace.\n  The result of this problem is twofold. First, a good number of \nsmaller, publicly traded firms have been taken private by investors, \nwith others expected to meet this same fate. Second, we have seen fewer \ncompanies going public, at least in the United States. During the year \n2000, 50 percent of all new Initial Public Offerings, IPOs, were done \nin the United States. By 2006 that number had fallen below 10 percent. \nIn 2006, Hong Kong supplanted New York as the number one market for \nstock offerings world-wide.\n  A number of my colleagues have pointed out that the dearth of IPOs \nthreatens our standing as the premier financial market in the world. In \nthe short term, we worry about this costing us prestige and jobs, but \nthe real costs are much, much greater. Businesses that want to keep \ngrowing eventually need to become publicly-traded corporations in order \nto raise sufficient capital. With the costs of crossing that threshold \ngreatly higher than they were a few years ago, many companies either \ndelay or forego becoming a publicly traded corporation. Companies that \nbecome or remain privately-held firms eventually run into capital \nconstraints of some sort that limit their growth.\n  The resulting cost to our economy is a financial market where it is \nmore difficult for corporations to raise sufficient capital to expand \ncapacity or increase productivity, ultimately resulting in slower \neconomic growth. Given the truly awesome problems we face in the \nupcoming years with regard to our unfunded entitlement obligations, we \nare going to need every bit of economic growth we can muster to satisfy \nthem. Even those who are ambivalent about the benefits of economic \ngrowth on the standard of living of all Americans should appreciate its \nimportance in meeting our future obligations.\n  The bill I am introducing today would help us to identify and, I \nhope, ultimately address, many of the regulatory problems facing our \nfinancial markets. Specifically, it requires the Chairman of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, the Chairman of the Financial \nAccounting Standards Board, and the Chairman of the Public Company \nAccounting Oversight Board to annually testify to the relevant Senate \nand House committees on their efforts to reduce complexity in financial \nreporting and to provide more accurate and clear financial information \nto investors. I expect that this requirement would result in more \nawareness of these problems by policymakers in the Legislative and \nExecutive Branches, as well as in the private sector, along with \nsuggested solutions to these challenges.\n  While this bill would be a relatively small step, I believe it can \nhelp us understand exactly what must be done to address what ails our \nfinancial markets and help us achieve a consensus on how to fix these \nproblems.\n  Mr. President, a nearly identical bill was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives recently with no opposition. I urge the leadership of \nthe Senate on both sides of the aisle, along with the members of the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs to support this bill, \nand join the House in making this important step toward increasing the \nefficiency of our financial markets.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 834\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Promoting Transparency in \n     Financial Reporting Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Transparent and clear financial reporting is integral \n     to the continued growth and\n\n[[Page S2974]]\n\n     strength of our capital markets and the confidence of \n     investors.\n       (2) The increasing detail and volume of accounting, \n     auditing, and reporting guidance pose a major challenge.\n       (3) The complexity of accounting and auditing standards in \n     the United States has added to the costs and effort involved \n     in financial reporting.\n\n     SEC. 3.

That testimony \n     shall address--\n       (1) complex and outdated accounting standards;\n       (2) improving the understandability, consistency, and \n     overall usability of the existing accounting and auditing \n     literature;\n       (3) developing principles-based accounting standards;\n       (4) encouraging the use and acceptance of interactive data; \n     and\n       (5) promoting disclosures in ``plain English''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself and Mr. Corker):\n  S. 835. A bill to redesignate the Federal building located at 167 \nNorth Main Street in Memphis, Tennessee, as the ``Clifford Davis and \nOdell Horton Federal Building''; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill to \nrename the Federal building in Memphis as the Clifford Davis and Odell \nHorton Federal Building. My colleague Senator Corker is a cosponsor. It \nis the same legislation that was introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by our new Representative Steve Cohen, and it is \ncosponsored by the rest of the House delegation, both Republicans and \nDemocrats.\n  Representative Cohen's bill, H.R. 753, was approved by the House \nCommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure on March 1 and awaits \nfurther action by the full House.\n  Judge Horton has a remarkable legacy. He was the first African-\nAmerican federal district court judge appointed in Tennessee since \nReconstruction. He was recommended by former Senator Jim Sasser and \nappointed by President Carter on May 12, 1980.\n  I remember those days of transition very well. It was in that same \nyear that I was Governor of Tennessee. I appointed the first African-\nAmerican supreme court justice in Tennessee, Judge George Brown, who \nserved with distinction.\n  At that time, there had not been an African-American chancellor, \nwhich is one of our lower court's State judges. I appointed Irwin \nKilcrease to that position, and he served with a distinguished record \nand retired only within the last couple of years.\n  Judge Horton was a real pioneer who came at a time of transition in \nMemphis, where he lived, and in our State's history. He served as chief \njudge of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee \nfrom January 1, 1987, until December 31, 1993.\n  Odell Horton was born in Bolivar, TN, just outside of Memphis, on May \n13, 1929. He said he grew up in a ``typically rural Southern and \ntypically segregated [environment], with all of the attendant \nconsequences of that''.\n  At about the same time, growing up maybe 40 miles away was a young \nman named Alex Haley who would sit on the front porch of his \ngrandparents' home and listen to his great-aunt tell stories of Kunta \nKinte, which ultimately became the story of ``Roots.''\n  Odell Horton's father was a laborer. His mother took in laundry. His \nfirst job at the age of 6 was delivering laundry for his mom. He and \nhis three siblings also picked cotton, stacked lumber, and took other \nodd jobs.\n  After high school, he enlisted in the Marine Corps. He enrolled in \nMorehouse College using the GI bill. He served with the Marines during \nthe Korean war. He graduated from the U.S. Navy School of Journalism.\n  After the Marines, he earned a law degree from Howard University, and \nafter graduating from Howard Law School in 1956, he moved to Memphis \nand rented a one-room office on Beale Street--the music street of \nMemphis--and opened his own law practice.\n  He did that for 5 years. He served as an assistant U.S. attorney \nafter that.\n  In 1968, he was director of the city's hospitals, making him the only \nBlack division director at city hall at that time.\n  He served as judge on the Shelby County Criminal Court. He was a \ncommentator on a local television station. He ran for district attorney \ngeneral in 1974, narrowly losing the primary, at that time considered a \nvery strong showing by an African-American candidate in a county that \ntoday has an African-American mayor of Memphis and an African-American \nmayor of Shelby County.\n  He was a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge before being appointed as a U.S. \ndistrict judge by President Carter.\n  He was married to his wife Evie for 50 years, with two sons, Odell, \nJr., and Christopher. He died on February 22, 2006.\n  I commend Representative Cohen for his bill to rename the Clifford \nDavis Federal Building to the Clifford Davis and Odell Horton Federal \nBuilding. Representative Davis was a Congressman who served in the \nHouse of Representatives from 1940 to 1965. He was one of those five \nCongressmen in the U.S. Capitol when four Puerto Rican nationalists \nopened fire from the visitors' balcony in the Chamber. He was shot in \nthe leg at the time.\n  Keeping both names on the Federal building is symbolic of the \ntransition that took place in Memphis and across the South during \nOdell's lifetime and my lifetime and reminds us that our country is \ncommitted to equal opportunity, but it has been and is and will be for \na long time a work in progress.\n  Odell Horton is one of the finest examples of that work in progress. \nHaving his name on a Federal building will remind all of us of that.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to cosponsor a bill to \nrename the Memphis Federal Building in order to commemorate a great \nTennessean, the Honorable Odell Horton.\n  Judge Horton, born in Bolivar, TN, on May 13, 1929, was the son of a \nlaborer and a laundress. After high school he performed two tours as a \nU.S. marine, including service in the Korean war. He was a graduate of \nMorehouse College, the United States Navy School of Journalism, and \nHoward University School of Law.\n  Horton's distinguished legal career began in 1956 in a one room \noffice at 145 Beale Street, where he remained in private practice for 6 \nyears. In 1962 he began service as an assistant U.S. attorney in \nMemphis. He remained in this position until he was appointed to the \nShelby County Criminal Court, where he was later elected without \nopposition. Judge Horton also served in the capacity as the city of \nMemphis' director of Hospital and Health Services, where he ordered the \ndesegregation of the Bowld Hospital in 1968. In 1970, Judge Horton left \npublic service to serve as the President of LeMoyne-Owen College, a \nhistorically African-American liberal arts college.\n  In 1976, he began service as a U.S. bankruptcy judge until 1980 when \nhe became the first African-American since Reconstruction to be \nappointed to a Tennessee Federal judicial appointment. He was a well \nregarded and respected judge who served as the chief judge for the \nWestern District from 1987 through 1993. On May 16, 1995, Judge Horton \ntook senior status and 2 years later closed his office.\n  He and his wife Evie were married for over 50 years and had two sons, \nOdell, Jr. and Christopher. Unfortunately, Judge Horton left us on \nFebruary 22, 2006. His colleagues remember him as a thorough, patient \njudge who brought a pleasant demeanor to the bench. Judge Horton was a \nman who admirably served his country and State. He was a great \nTennessean and it is my honor today to cosponsor a bill to memorialize \nhis contribution to our country and the State of Tennessee.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON:\n  S. 837. A bill to develop a generation of school leaders who are \ncommitted to, and effective in, increasing student achievement and to \nensure that all low-income, under-performing schools are led by \neffective school leaders who are well-prepared to foster student \nsuccess; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nhelp\n\n[[Page S2975]]\n\nensure that State and local educational agencies implement an effective \ncertification process for school leaders. My legislation will address \nthe need to effectively train and retain school leaders to prepare our \nchildren to compete in the global economy.\n  The Fordham Foundation conducted a study on the effectiveness of \ncurrent state licensing procedures and noted that they have ``little \nrelevance to the task at hand [and] discourage the leaders we need from \nentering our public schools.'' As a result, school leaders, \nparticularly those in under-performing schools, are often unprepared to \nfoster student success. That is why I am sponsoring the Improving the \nLeadership and Effectiveness of Administrators for Districts (I LEAD) \nAct.\n  As the number of openings for school leaders is expected to increase \nby 20 percent in the next five years, districts will find it \nincreasingly difficult to recruit and retain effective principals. We \nneed to ensure outgoing school leaders are replaced with effective, \nwell-trained school leaders who are prepared to raise student \nachievement.\n  The I LEAD Act would allow State and local educational agencies to \nevaluate the effectiveness of their current school leadership licensure \nrequirements by examining the impact on student achievement, graduation \nrates, parental involvement, and safety within their schools. It also \nprovides grants to implement a plan to recruit and effectively train \nschool leaders by providing on-the-job experience during the licensure \nprocess, financial incentives, ongoing professional development, and \nmentors during their first two years on the job.\n  Under this bill, the Department of Education would conduct a study on \nthe effectiveness of these grants on student achievement. Upon \nsuccessful implementation of new procedures, state education agencies \nmay apply for additional grant money through the Department for \nassistance in replicating the success of this ``model leadership zone'' \nthroughout the state. Grants would also be used to reform the state \ncertification process.\n  School leaders have a significant impact on student achievement. An \neffective and capable school leader can make the difference in \nproviding the tools and instructional support staff needed to foster \nthe type of school environment conducive to student academic success. \nThis legislation would ensure that our principals are given the \ntraining and support they need to foster student success.\n  The I LEAD Act addresses the need to effectively train and retain \nschool leaders to prepare our children to compete in the global \neconomy. I am hopeful that my Senate colleagues from both sides of the \naisle will join me today to move this legislation to the floor without \ndelay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/09/senate-section/article/S2975-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 102--SUPPORTING THE GOALS OF ``INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S \n                                 DAY''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Ms. Klobuchar, Ms. Landrieu, and Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, \nand Ms. Stabenow) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 102\n\n       Whereas there are more 3,000,000,000 women in the world, \n     representing 49.7 percent of the world's population;\n       Whereas women continue to play the predominant role in \n     caring for families within the home, as well as increasingly \n     supporting their families economically by working outside the \n     home;\n       Whereas women worldwide participate in diplomacy and \n     politics, contribute to the growth of economies, and improve \n     the quality of the lives of their families, communities, and \n     countries;\n       Whereas women leaders

 diplomas and 31 percent of women between the ages of 25 of 29 \n     having earned bachelor's degrees;\n       Whereas even with the tremendous gains for women during the \n     past 20 years, women still face political and economic \n     obstacles, struggle for basic rights, face discrimination, \n     and are targets of gender-based violence all over the world;\n       Whereas women remain

\n     caring for families within the home, as well as increasingly \n     supporting their families economically by working outside the \n     home;\n       Whereas women worldwide participate in diplomacy and \n     politics, contribute to the growth of economies, and improve \n     the quality of the lives of their families, communities, and \n     countries;\n       Whereas women leaders have recently made significant \n     strides, including through the 2007 election of \n     Representative Nancy Pelosi as the first female Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, the 2006 election \n     of Michelle Bachelet as the first female President of Chile, \n     the 2006 election of Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf as President of \n     Liberia and the first

Afghanistan are \n     given to women, and 11 women are chief executive officers of \n     Fortune 500 companies in the United States;\n       Whereas, in the United States, women are graduating from \n     high school and earning bachelor's degrees and graduate \n     degrees at rates greater than men, with 88 percent of women \n     between the ages of 25 and 29 having obtained high school \n     diplomas and 31 percent of women between the ages of 25 of 29 \n     having earned bachelor's degrees;\n       Whereas even with the tremendous gains for women during the \n     past 20 years, women still face political and economic \n     obstacles, struggle for basic rights, face discrimination, \n     and are targets of gender-based violence all over the world;\n       Whereas women remain vastly underrepresented worldwide in \n     national and local legislatures, accounting on average for \n     less than 10 percent of the seats in legislatures in most \n     countries, and in no developing region do women hold more \n     than 8 percent of legislative positions;\n       Whereas women work two-thirds of the world's working hours \n     and produce half of the world's food, yet

less than their male counterparts in the 10 \n     industries that employ the vast majority of all female \n     employees;\n       Whereas, of the 1,300,000,000 people living in poverty \n     around the world, 70 percent are women;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Agency for \n     International Development, two-thirds of the 876,000,000 \n     illiterate individuals worldwide are women, two-thirds of the \n     125,000,000 school-aged children who are not attending school \n     worldwide are girls, and girls around the world are less \n     likely to complete school than boys;\n       Whereas women account for half of all cases of HIV/AIDS \n     worldwide, approximately 42,000,000 cases, and in countries \n     with a high prevalence of HIV, young women are at a higher \n     risk than young men of contracting HIV;\n       Whereas each year over 500,000 women globally die during \n     childbirth or pregnancy;\n       Whereas domestic violence causes more deaths and \n     disabilities among women between the ages of 15 and 44 than \n     cancer, malaria, traffic accidents, and war;\n       Whereas worldwide at least 1 out of every 3 women and girls \n     has been beaten in her lifetime, and usually the abuser is a \n     member of the victim's family or is someone else known to the \n     victim;\n       Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, at least 1 out of every 6 women and girls in the \n     United States has been sexually abused in her lifetime;\n       Whereas, in the United States, one-third of the women \n     murdered each year are killed by current or former husbands \n     or boyfriends;\n       Whereas 130,000,000 girls and young women worldwide have \n     been subjected to female genital mutilation and it is \n     estimated that 10,000 girls are at risk of being subjected to \n     the practice in the United States;\n       Whereas, according to the Congressional Research Service \n     and the Department of State, illegal trafficking in women and \n     children for forced labor, domestic servitude, or sexual \n     exploitation involves between 600,000 and 900,000 women and \n     children each year, of whom 17,500 are transported into the \n     United States;\n       Whereas between 75 and 80 percent of the world's 27,000,000 \n     refugees are women and children;\n       Whereas, in Iraq, women are increasingly becoming the \n     targets of violence by Islamic extremists and street gangs;\n       Whereas, in Darfur, a growing number of women and girls are \n     being raped, mainly by militia members who use sexual \n     violence as a weapon of war;\n\n[[Page S2988]]\n\n       Whereas, in Afghanistan, Safia Ama Jan, the former Director \n

LESOTHO\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate now proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 103, which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 103) commending the Kingdom of \n     Lesotho on the occasion of International Women's Day, for the \n     enactment of a law to improve the status of married women and \n     ensure the access of married women to property rights.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I rise today, International Women's Day, \nin support of this resolution celebrating some of the progress that we \nand other nations are making in fostering improvement in the status of \nwomen. The resolution commends the Kingdom of Lesotho for enacting the \nLegal Capacity of Married Persons law which elevates the status of \nmarried women and provides them with property rights. Prior to this \nlaw, married women in Lesotho were considered legal minors, denying \nthem the right to enter into binding contracts or have standing in \ncivil court.\n  International Women's Day is a day on which we reaffirm the \ncommitment to the struggle by women worldwide for peace, justice, and \nequality before the law. We also take this opportunity to recognize how \nfar we have come since the first International Women's Day was \ncelebrated in the United States in 1909 when American women were still \nfighting for the right to vote and a role in the political process.\n  Today we are able to celebrate the many accomplishments by women \nworldwide in the areas of health, science, education, and politics. In \nthe past year, we have seen the appointment of our first female Speaker \nof the House, Nancy Pelosi. President Bush's cabinet now includes a \nrecord number of women--Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Secretary \nof Education Margaret Spellings, Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao, and \nSecretary of Transportation Mary Peters. Women now comprise a record \npercentage of the 110th Congress, including 16 senators and 71 \nrepresentatives. Women are gaining seats in parliaments worldwide. For \nexample, last November Lateefa al-Qauod became the first woman to be \nelected to Bahrain's parliament and became one of the first women to \nserve in an elected parliament in the Gulf region.\n  The U.S. is rededicating itself to improving the status of women \nworldwide. For example, the Millennium Challenge Corporation announced \na new policy in December 2006 stating that countries receiving \nfinancial assistance would be responsible for extensive planning to \nensure that all programs benefit both men and women. This required \ngender analysis would factor in social, economic, and cultural barriers \nfaced by women and men when engaging in economic activity and would \nresult in better-designed international development projects.\n  The Kingdom of Lesotho is a small country surrounded by South Africa. \nLesotho faces serious challenges--50 percent of the population lives \nbelow the poverty line and 23 percent of the population is infected \nwith HIV. Given its commitment to good governance and investment in its \npeople, Lesotho has qualified for financial assistance through the \nMillennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). MCC assistance is pending the \nfinalization of Lesotho's Compact which is expected to focus on \nimproving health care and water resource management.\n  The MCC helped catalyze the passage of the Legal Capacity of Married \nPersons law in Lesotho by stressing that potential MCC financing would \nbe more effective if gender equity were addressed. Subsequently, \nLesotho passed the Legal Capacity of Married Persons legislation. Under \nthis new legislation, women are considered equal partners in marriage \nand are able to enter into binding contracts and have a standing in \ncivil court. We applaud the Kingdom of Lesotho for demonstrating such a \ncommitment to justice, equality, and fighting corruption at every \nlevel.\n  The problems faced by women today require a continuation of our \ncommitment to end them. International Women's Day is a day for us to \ndeclare our determination to advance the rights of women worldwide, but \nalso to recognize the many accomplishments made by women on a global \nscale.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 103) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 103\n\n       Whereas International Women's Day, observed on March 8 each \n     year, has become a day on which people come together to \n     recognize the accomplishments of women and to reaffirm their \n     commitment to continue the struggle for equality, justice, \n     and peace;\n       Whereas the Kingdom of Lesotho is a parliamentary \n     constitutional monarchy that has been an independent country \n     since 1966;\n       Whereas Lesotho is a low income country with a gross \n     national income per capita of $960 and 50 percent of the \n     population lives below the poverty line;\n       Whereas, in Lesotho, the HIV prevalence is estimated at 23 \n     percent for the total adult population and 56 percent for \n     pregnant women between the ages of 25 and 29, and the current \n     average life expectancy at birth is estimated to be 34.4 \n     years;\n       Whereas the Kingdom of Lesotho, referred to by some as the \n     ``Kingdom in the Sky'', was a strong public supporter of the \n     end of apartheid in South Africa and the Government of \n     Lesotho granted political asylum to a number of refugees from \n     South Africa during the apartheid era;\n       Whereas the Government of Lesotho has demonstrated a strong \n     commitment to ruling justly, investing in people, ensuring \n     economic freedom, and controlling corruption;\n       Whereas the Government of Lesotho has been named eligible \n     by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) for a Compact \n     of financial assistance that, as currently proposed, would \n     strongly focus on improving and safeguarding the health of \n     the people of Lesotho, in addition to supporting projects for \n     sustainable water resource management and private sector \n     development;\n       Whereas historically a married woman in Lesotho was \n     considered a legal minor during the lifetime of her husband, \n     was severely restricted in economic activities, was unable to \n     enter into legally binding contracts without her husband's \n     consent, and had no standing in civil court;\n       Whereas legislation elevating the legal status of married \n     women and providing property and inheritance rights to women \n     in Lesotho was introduced as early as 1992;\n       Whereas for years women's groups, nongovernmental \n     organizations, the Federation of Women Lawyers, officials of \n     the Government of Lesotho, and others in Lesotho have pushed \n     for passage of legislation strengthening rights of married \n     women;\n       Whereas in a letter to the Government of Lesotho in \n     September 2006, the chief executive officer of the MCC stated \n     that gender inequality is a constraint on economic growth and \n     poverty reduction and is related to the high prevalence of \n     HIV/AIDS, and that inattention to issues of gender inequality \n     could undermine the potential impact of the Compact proposed \n     to be entered into between the MCC and the Government of \n     Lesotho;\n       Whereas the Legal Capacity of Married Persons Act was \n     passed by the Parliament of Lesotho and enacted into law in \n     November 2006;\n       Whereas the MCC has already provided assistance to further \n     full and meaningful implementation of the new law;\n       Whereas the MCC has promulgated and is currently \n     implementing a new gender policy to integrate gender into all \n     phases of the development and implementation of the Compact \n     between the MCC and the Government of Lesotho; and\n\n[[Page S2989]]\n\n       Whereas the MCC's advocacy of gender equity played a \n     supportive role in the enactment of the Legal Capacity of \n     Married Persons Act in the Kingdom of Lesotho: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges the observance of March 8, 2007, as \n     International Women's Day;\n       (2) applauds the enactment of the Legal Capacity of Married \n     Persons Act by the Kingdom of Lesotho;\n       (3) lauds the Kingdom of Lesotho for demonstrating its \n     commitment to improve gender equity;\n       (4) encourages the Kingdom of Lesotho to continue its \n     effort to ensure gender equity; and\n       (5) commends the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) for \n     developing and implementing policies to advance gender equity \n     in the Kingdom of Lesotho and other countries eligible for \n     financial assistance from the MCC.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/09/senate-section/article/S2989-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DESIGNATING THE UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE AT SOUTH FEDERAL PLACE IN \n    SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO, AS THE ``SANTIAGO E.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed en bloc to the consideration of the following two bills \nwhich have been received from the House and are at the desk: H.R. 544 \nand H.R. 584; that the Environment and Public Works Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of H.R. 342, and that the Senate \nthen proceed to its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will state the bills by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 544) to designate the U.S. Courthouse at South \n     Federal Place in Santa Fe, New Mexico, as the ``Santiago E. \n     Campos United States Courthouse. ``\n       A bill (H.R. 584) to designate the federal building located \n     at 400 Maryland Avenue Southwest in the District of Columbia \n     as the ``Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education \n     Building.''\n       A bill (H.R. 342) to designate the U.S. Courthouse located \n     at 555 Independence Street in Cape Girardeau, MO, as the \n     ``Rush Hudson Limbaugh, Sr. United States Courthouse.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bills, \nen bloc.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to support H.R. 584, a \nbill to name the Department of Education headquarters in Washington, \nDC, as the Lyndon Baines Johnson Federal Building. I am the Senate \nsponsor of the bill, and Senator Cornyn is the cosponsor.\n  Lyndon Johnson was the first President to be elected from the State \nof Texas, and a man, who throughout his over three decades in public \nlife, contributed immensely to improving and enhancing education for \nall Americans.\n  President Johnson was born in Stonewall, TX on August 27, 1908. After \ngraduating from high school, and spending a year as an elevator \noperator, he began his career in the field of education. In 1927, he \nborrowed $75, and started attending the Southwest Texas State Teachers \nCollege in San Marcos.\n  After graduating in 1930, he devoted a year to teaching mostly \nMexican children at the Welhausen School in Cotulla, ninety miles south \nof San Antonio. Decades later, when he was in the White House, \nPresident Johnson reminisced: ``I shall never forget the faces of the \nboys and the girls in that little Welhausen Mexican School, and I \nremember even yet the pain of realizing and knowing then that college \nwas closed to practically every one of those children because they were \ntoo poor. And I think it was then that I made up my mind that this \nNation could never rest while the door to knowledge remained closed to \nany American.''\n  Lyndon Baines Johnson never did rest--and after serving as a teacher, \na principal, and as head of the Texas National Youth Administration, in \n1937, he ran for, and won, a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  He was subsequently re-elected to the U.S. House in every election up \nuntil 1948, when he was elected to the United States Senate. Later, in \n1961, he resigned from the U.S. Senate to become Vice President; and on \nNovember 22, 1963, a date that none of us will ever forget, Lyndon \nJohnson became the 36th President of the United States.\n  In 1965, President Johnson signed two landmark education bills: The \nElementary and Secondary Education Act (which authorized the first real \nFederal assistance to grade school education) and The Higher Education \nAct (which funded scholarships to undergraduate students).\n  In the same year, President Johnson launched Project Head Start as an \neight-week summer program to provide preschool children from low-income \nfamilies with a comprehensive program to meet their emotional, social, \nhealth, nutritional, and psychological needs.\n  During his six-year presidency, Lyndon B. Johnson signed a combined \ntotal of over 60 education bills. In a very real sense, he was \nAmerica's first ``Education President.''\n  After leaving office, President Johnson continued his involvement in \neducation by teaching students while he wrote his memoirs.\n  President Johnson passed away on January 22, 1973, and even though \nit's been 34 years since his passing, he still doesn't have a Federal \nbuilding in the District of Columbia named after him.\n  I believe it is time that President Johnson's distinguished service, \nand particularly, his outstanding work on behalf of education, be \nrecognized in our Nation's capital.\n  Naming the Department of Education headquarters in Washington, DC, as \nthe Lyndon Baines Johnson Federal Building is a fitting honor for this \nsmalltown Texas teacher who, after decades of service, went on to \nbecome our ``Education President.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nbills be read the third time, passed, the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, en bloc; that the consideration of these items appear \nseparately in the Record, and that any statements thereon be printed in \nthe Record as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bills (H.R. 544, H.R. 584, and H.R. 342) were ordered to be \nengrossed for a third reading, read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/09/senate-section/article/S2989-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MARCH 12, 2007\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.
