The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, first of all, I want to express appreciation to my \nfriend and\n\n[[Page S11242]]\n\ncolleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, and to thank all of the members \nof our committee for the work they have done on this legislation. This \ntruly is a bipartisan piece of legislation that is focused on improving \nopportunity and improving quality of life for millions of Americans in \nour education system.\n  We worked very closely together when Senator Enzi was chair, and we \nhave worked very closely together since I have had the opportunity to \nchair the committee. And now we have this legislation which is going to \nmake an enormous difference for so many. I will discuss it in detail \nafter the vote and explain it in greater detail in the record for both \nour colleagues and others who are interested in this legislation and \nwhat we have accomplished. But at the outset, I think all of us on this \nside of the aisle know that without strong cooperation and assistance \nfrom Senator Enzi and both sides of the aisle, we wouldn't be where we \nare today with this legislation, and we would not have successfully \npassed the reauthorization legislation in the Senate that has a number \nof very important items in it. I will describe those later on in the \nday as well.\n  We are also very grateful to the staffs of our committee, who have \ndone a really extraordinary job during this period of time.\n  Mr. President, education is the engine of hope and opportunity for \npeople of this country, and it has been recognized as such from the \nearliest days of the Republic. In my State of Massachusetts, our State \nconstitution, written by John Adams in 1780, spells out in great detail \nthe responsibilities of our State, of our commonwealth, to try to make \na commitment to educational opportunities for the people of our State. \nAnd it has been replicated, that language or something similar has been \nreplicated in all of the State constitutions.\n  Education is really the key. We have seen the progress and the \nchanges that have taken place over the period of years, and we will \nhave a chance to review that history a little later in the morning. But \nI am mindful today that establishing a benchmark is important in \nrecognizing that this assistance to students and to families is the \ngreatest assistance that will have been provided for the American \nfamily since the GI bill, the GI bill that was so successful at the end \nof World War II.\n  It has been estimated that for every dollar that was invested in the \nGI bill, $7 was returned in taxes to the General Treasury. Historians \nwill point out that it helped establish the middle class, the middle \nclass which has been the strength of our Nation over the last 60 or 70 \nyears. There is no question about it. We built the middle class on the \npillars of education, on the pillars of educational opportunity.\n  In this legislation, we invest $20 billion--$20 billion--and not a \nnickel of it comes as an additional burden on taxpayers. It comes from \nthe lenders. They will be able to continue to provide opportunities for \nstudents through their lending agencies, and this $20 billion will \nprovide direct assistance to the neediest children in this country. It \nwill provide help and relief for families that have real debt in terms \nof interest rates.\n  Most interestingly, Mr. President, is the fact that it will encourage \nyoung people in this country to involve themselves in public service \nand public life through their communities. None of us can visit schools \nand colleges across the country and not be overwhelmingly impressed by \nthe desire of young people to make a difference in helping to solve the \nproblems and the challenges we are facing today.\n  We can look as recently as this week at the cover of Time magazine \noutlining this tremendous surge of young people wanting to participate \nin solving problems in their communities in a variety of different \nways.\n  We have understood that, Mr. President, and we are saying to those \nyoung people: Yes, we know the cost of education has gone up. Yes, we \nknow we have not kept pace in providing assistance to you to keep up \nwith the cost of education. Yes, we understand your parents have been \nworking hard, and still the middle class has been holding on by its \nteeth in terms of battling the problems of inflation and no wage \nincreases. Yes, it has been more challenging for middle-class families \nto go on to college. And, yes, if they go on to school they will end up \nwith a great deal of debt, which means they will not be able to go into \nthe kinds of fields of service, service to the community, that they \nmight like to. But that is going to change, and change dramatically, \nwith this legislation.\n  There are many different provisions in the legislation, and we will \ncome to grips with those as the morning goes on, but this is saying to \nthe young people: If you finish up in school and college and you have \ndebt and you want to become a schoolteacher, you want to work in the \ncriminal justice system, you want to work with special needs children, \nyou want to work for a nonprofit, you will never pay more than 15 \npercent of your income in repayment of your debt. And after a period of \nyears, a 10-year period of time, your debt will be forgiven in full--\ncompletely.\n  This is an incentive for young people to be able to go into public \nservice and serve their community. I think it is enormously important \nand responsive to the time. I will have a chance later to go through \nthis legislation in greater detail, but this is a matter of enormous \nimportance. It is a matter of enormous consequence. It reflects the \nbest judgment of those on this Education Committee who have worked long \nand hard on this legislation.\n  We are grateful for the fact the President has indicated that he is \ngoing to support this legislation. At a time of great divisiveness on \nso many things, we have taken an issue of fundamental importance to \nfamilies in this country and we are saying: Help is on its way. That is \neffectively what this legislation will do. We will spend a good deal of \nthe morning going over the details of it and how those general concepts \nI have outlined this morning will be implemented in the form of the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself whatever time I take, and I \ndo rise to speak in support of the conference report under \nconsideration today.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts and his staff for their \nparticipation and the way they kept us informed during the conference. \nI have to say ``kept informed'' because we were not at the conference, \nexcept for the one kind of superficial meeting we had where we got to \nmake speeches, but they did a good job of keeping us informed. This \nseems to be the way that reconciliation happens. I know when the \nRepublicans were in the majority that is the way it happened, so I am \nnot surprised that when the Democrats are in the majority that is the \nway it happened. But it was very helpful to be kept informed on what \nwas happening.\n  There are quite a few things that the reconciliation bill does, but I \nhave to mention that without the reauthorization package it is very \nincomplete. We are urging the House to hurry and do the reauthorization \npart so that we truly have a higher education package. Without that, \nthere are a lot of things that are left out, and I will go into that a \nlittle bit this morning in more detail following the vote.\n  This isn't the first time we have reduced the subsidies to lenders \nand provided greater benefits to students. Two years ago, in the \nconference that I was referring to, we produced a report that found \nbillions in savings by further reducing subsidies to lenders and \napplied those savings to increased grants for low-income students, \nexpanded loan forgiveness, and reduced interest rates on undergraduate \nsubsidized loans.\n  We all agree if there is an excess subsidy in the student loan \nprogram, it should be eliminated. The key question is how much excess \nthere is and how to eliminate it. There are no clear-cut answers to \nthese questions. One approach included in this conference report is the \nreduction of the special allowance payments to the lenders.\n  I am pleased that we retained the provisions that recognize the \nunique role that our not-for-profit lenders have in providing \ninformation and services to students and their families. Not-for-profit \nlenders focus on communities and they serve students locally. For this \nreason, we maintained the 15-basis-point differential cut in the \nspecial allowance payments between for-profit and not-for-profit \nlenders. The\n\n[[Page S11243]]\n\ncut in the special allowance payments to for-profit lenders is 55 basis \npoints, and for not-for-profit lenders it is 40 basis points.\n  Now, we took a first step in this conference report toward refining \nthe way those levels are determined by including an auction pilot that \nlets the marketplace determine the appropriate level for the Parent \nPLUS Program, which is about 10 percent of the loans.\n  This conference report provides additional need-based grant aid which \nis a critical component of increasing access to and the affordability \nof college. Over 55 percent of the savings are dedicated to increasing \nthe Pell grant award. In the next 5 years, low-income undergraduate \nstudents will see the maximum Pell grant award increased by more than \n$1,000. Additionally, we increase the income protection allowance so \nthat students are not penalized for working and saving for college, and \nwe raise the income threshold for automatic eligibility for a maximum \nPell grant.\n  I am also pleased we were able to retain the guarantee rate on \nstudent loans at 97 percent for all lenders through fiscal year 2012. \nIn this way we avoid the disruption in the student loan market and \nensure that students have access to Federal student loans. However, I \nwonder if we may be going too far in cutting the support for the \nlargest Federal financial aid program, the Federal Family Education \nLoan Program. The challenge we face is that we will not know until it \nis too late whether cuts we have made have undermined the stability of \nthe program and created hardships for the students it serves.\n  Despite the emphasis on increased grant aid, the claim of increased \nsavings for borrowers has a hollow ring. Reducing student loan interest \nrates is a good sound bite. It doesn't do anything to help students pay \ntuition bills.\n  Further, in reality, cutting the interest rate in half, to 3.4 \npercent, will help only a small group of borrowers for the loans they \ntake out for 1 year of their education, 4 years from now. Then the \nbenefit disappears. That is going to be a surprise to a lot of people, \nand it has already happened once. We were chastised when we were doing \nthe last reconciliation for a raise in the interest rates. That is \nbecause the interest rate that had been lowered expired and there was \nnot the money to do the further cut. This may well happen again.\n  A quick calculation of the real benefit borrowers will receive shows \nthat at a cost of $6 billion to taxpayers, individuals, will see a \nsavings of only $6 a month. That may be one latte; it may be two \nlattes. It is kind of hard to tell in today's market in coffee. I am \nastounded. I remember the days when it was a nickel a cup. I would much \nrather see the $6 billion go to help real low-income students through a \nPell grant increase than just for a hollow sound bite.\n  Finally, as an accountant and member of the Budget Committee, I would \nbe remiss if I didn't point out that we are debating a conference \nreport on reconciliation, and that is a process designed to reduce the \nFederal deficit, not to create new mandatory programs and increase \nentitlement spending. I am disappointed to say that the net savings for \ndeficit reduction in this conference report is only $750 million.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues that a few weeks ago, we considered \nreconciliation and higher education reauthorization together. The \nSenate did it right. We voted on reconciliation one day, and the next \nvoting day we had, we covered reauthorization. Both bills passed with \nstrong bipartisan support because we not only achieved savings but we \nensured the quality and effectiveness of our Federal student aid \nprograms. Therefore, my support for this conference report is limited \nby the fact that we are not also considering the larger higher \neducation reauthorization package.\n  We have used this chart before when we were debating the \nreauthorization. This chart shows the pieces that are left out when we \ndo not do the reauthorization. I urge the House to finish up this part \nof the package so that it can accompany the reconciliation package. It \nis not complete without both.\n  I do have some comments by House Ranking Member McKeon, which is an \nexcerpt from the conference committee when it was held. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have it printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n House Ranking Member McKeon Excerpt Comments From the One Conference \n                             Committee Held\n\n       Nearly 6 months ago, the Budget Committee offered a budget \n     resolution that called for a lone, $75 million budget \n     reconciliation instruction to the Education and Labor \n     Committee. Eventually that figure climbed to $750 million in \n     required savings over 5 years--a modest improvement, but \n     still a mere fraction of the savings generally achieved \n     through budget reconciliation.\n       It was as clear 6 months ago as it is today that the reason \n     for that instruction was not to reduce the federal deficit. \n     It was to push through a series of changes to our Nation's \n     college financial aid system--changes that may or may not \n     have been able to garner the necessary votes outside the \n     confines of a budget bill.\n       Many of these changes are needed. Republicans took the lead \n     on making the student loan program more efficient two years \n     ago, producing a full $12 billion in deficit reduction while \n     increasing benefits to students. I appreciate the efforts \n     this year to build on that success by demanding additional \n     program efficiencies and redirecting those resources into the \n     Pell Grant program. A straightforward reform effort focused \n     solely on these two goals would surely have garnered broad \n     bipartisan support.\n       While I believe the intentions of the bill's sponsors are \n     good, I have found the process and the product to be \n     disappointing. When the FY 2008 budget resolution was being \n     debated, the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \n     cautioned that the budget reconciliation process was in \n     danger of being abused as a ``stalking horse'' for new \n     entitlement spending. Yet despite his warnings, that is \n     exactly what happened in the bill.\n       That bill represented one of the largest expansions of \n     higher education entitlement spending in history, with the \n     creation of nine new entitlement programs. I understand the \n     majority is considering paring back the new entitlement \n     spending and creating fewer new programs. While this is a \n     modest improvement, it still represents a diversion of \n     approximately $1 billion that could have, and dare I say \n     should have, gone to low-income students in the form of \n     Pell Grants.\n       The legislation that passed the House also included a \n     temporary phase-down of the interest rates on subsidized \n     Stafford loans. The Senate-approved bill did not include such \n     a proposal, instead focusing its resources on the Pell Grant \n     program. The conference report includes some form of the \n     House interest rate proposal. This, despite the fact that \n     temporarily reducing interest rates on some loans for some \n     college graduates is a costly diversion from Pell Grants, and \n     does nothing to assist students enrolled in school and \n     struggling with rising costs. Any proposal to slowly phase-\n     down the interest rate only to have the rate immediately jump \n     back up is nothing more than false promises to borrowers and \n     taxpayers.\n       First, under this proposal, it will be impossible for a \n     borrower to save the highly-touted $4,400. In order to save \n     that amount, a borrower would have to take out loans all 4 \n     years at the reduced rate of 3.4%--an impossibility. Second, \n     this proposal is also a false promise to taxpayers and a \n     budget gimmick. If Congress decides to maintain the 3.4% \n     interest rate, the taxpayer will be on the hook for a \n     potential long-term cost of $32 billion. Finally, this \n     proposal does nothing to help students pay for their \n     education when the tuition bill is due. While I understand \n     that this idea may test well in polls and may well make for \n     good politics, it's bad policy. And everyone here knows it.\n       I understand the conference report is to include cuts to \n     the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) similar in \n     magnitude to those proposed in both the House and Senate \n     Democratic plans. These figures are based largely on the \n     President's budget request for the upcoming fiscal year. \n     However, I remain concerned that both chambers--following the \n     lead of the President--may be going too far in cutting \n     support for the largest federal financial aid program.\n       The challenge is that we will not know if we have cut too \n     deeply until it is too late, and the program and its students \n     suffer. Moreover, such deep program cuts could undermine the \n     stability of the FFELP and upset the delicate balance between \n     it and the government-run Direct Loan program. While I do not \n     dispute that reforms to the student loan program are urgently \n     needed, I am strongly opposed to any effort to give a leg-up \n     to the bureaucratic Direct Loan program in an effort to \n     squeeze out the private sector.\n       There are elements of the expected conference agreement \n     that I strongly support. I am particularly pleased that those \n     involved in the negotiations recognized the importance of \n     focusing on Pell Grants. I understand the agreement may \n     provide up to $11 billion in increased support for this \n     critical program. This level falls short of the approximately \n     $15 billion proposed by the President in his budget, but \n     it is a great improvement over the legislation approved by \n     the House in July.\n       There was a proposal to reduce subsidies in the student \n     loan program and redirect those resources to help low-income \n     students through increased Pell Grants. Period.\n       I believe that if such an approach were embraced here \n     today, it would receive overwhelming bipartisan support in \n     both the\n\n[[Page S11244]]\n\n     House and Senate, and would be welcomed by the President. \n     This could be a missed opportunity of epic proportions.\n       Although I continue to harbor serious concerns about the \n     proposals before us, I would be remiss if I did not thank \n     Chairmen Miller and Kennedy for their efforts, and \n     acknowledge their commitment to much-needed reform. I said \n     earlier--and I truly believe this to be true--that the \n     intentions driving this process are good and worthy. While I \n     remain disappointed that key opportunities may be missed, I \n     recognize that legislation is rarely perfect and the best \n     efforts of the sponsors should be commended.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. It puts the emphasis on some things that will be left out \nif we do not do it and also some things that I mentioned.\n  I want to add some more emphasis to what is not before us today, and \nthat is the legislation that addresses the concerns about rooting out \nthe bad actors in student lending. It doesn't include protecting \nstudents and families who are borrowing money for college, and ensuring \nthat students and parents receive sound, honest advice about their \nstudent loans. Students and parents must have access to the information \nthey need to understand and manage their debt. We must ensure that the \ninvestment our students and families make in terms of time and money is \na good one, that they are confident there will be financial aid to \nassist continued access to a college education.\n  Further, it is the reauthorization bill that contains the evaluation \nof the auction pilot that will help determine whether the auction model \nshould be used in the future to establish viable special allowance \nrates. That is the way to test it.\n  Higher education is the onramp to success in the global economy, and \nit is our responsibility to make sure everyone can access that \nopportunity and reach their goals. The choice of whether to pursue a \npostsecondary education is no longer an option. We need to make sure \nindividuals have all the tools they need to understand and shape their \nfuture. This conference report provides some important tools but not \nnearly enough to complete the job.\n  We are only seeing a fraction of the higher education picture by \nconsidering the conference report separately from the larger \nreauthorization package. What is before us today focuses only on a \nnarrow slice of the Higher Education Act, one piece which is dependent \non other foundational programs that are not part of the reconciliation. \nYou can see that on this chart: Reconciliation takes care of a little \nbit; reauthorization takes care of the rest.\n  It takes important steps to increase assistance for students seeking \na college degree, but it is only a Band-Aid without the important \nbipartisan reforms included in the reauthorization bill. We are cutting \nthe bottom line without dealing with the quality and substance of these \nimportant programs.\n  The American success story of higher education is at risk of losing \nthe very qualities that made it great--competition, innovation, and \naccess for all. Our challenge is to make higher education more \naccessible, affordable, and accountable. By considering only \nreconciliation, we are not meeting this challenge head-on. We are \nleaving the job undone.\n  But we need the provisions in the reauthorization bill--better \ncollege cost information to help parents and students make sound \nchoices; year-round Pell to reduce time-to-degree; and FAFSA, which is \nthe Free Application for Federal Student Aid. It is a document that has \nbeen rather intimidating to students as they think about filling out \nthis form in order to qualify for financial aid. The form itself has \nkept people from applying. We have reduced that in the reauthorization \nbill to a one-page document.\n  I reiterate, it is the reauthorization bill that contains all the \nreforms and accountability provisions to address the problems that have \ncome to light in the loan programs--the bad actors with conflicts of \ninterest, the lack of useful, necessary information to enable borrowers \nto make informed decisions about loan provisions and repayment, and the \nneed for better controls over access to the National Student Loan Data \nSystem so borrowers' privacy is protected.\n  We know America's ability to compete in a global economy depends on \nincreasing the number of students entering and completing college. But \nof the 75 percent of high school seniors who continue their study, only \n50 percent of them receive a degree in 5 years after enrolling in \ncollege and only 25 percent of them receive a bachelor's degree or \nhigher. These numbers are even worse for students from low-income \nfamilies. It is important to ensure that more students enroll in \ncollege prepared to learn and that more students have the support they \nneed to complete college with the knowledge and skills to be \nsuccessful. Low-income students who are striving to attend college need \nto know there is financial aid available for them to access college or \ncareer and technical education. It is the reauthorization bill that has \nall the support programs for first-generation and low-income students \nand the institutional support programs for minority-serving \ninstitutions.\n  For years, institutions of higher education and employers have \nexpressed their dissatisfaction about the fact that our high school \ngraduates need remedial help in order to do college-level work or to \nparticipate in the workforce. Nearly one-third of entering college \nfreshmen take at least one remedial course. Each year, taxpayers pay an \nestimate $1 billion to $2 billion to provide remedial education to \nstudents at our public universities and community colleges.\n  What will help this situation? Not only do students need better \nguidance selecting courses in high school that will enable them to \nsucceed in the postsecondary education, they need better prepared \nteachers. It is the reauthorization bill that has the partnership \nprograms to support teacher preparation so that all children have \nqualified teachers to guide their learning experiences. Also, to be \ncompetitive in the global economy we need to be able to communicate \nwith people all over the world. It is the reauthorization bill that \nauthorizes the programs that support foreign languages and \ninternational education.\n  I began my remarks by stating that I am in support of the conference \nreport. It is clear that I am equally committed to seeing that we \nreauthorize the Higher Education Act. We need both pieces to get it \ndone right.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy for his commitment to moving the \nreauthorization forward and including several Republican priorities in \nthis conference report. While this report is not perfect, taken as a \nwhole and with its emphasis on providing additional need-based grant \naid to low-income students, I believe we have reached a reasonable \napproach to helping students pay for college.\n  I thank everyone who has been involved in the process.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy). The Senator from Ohio is yielded \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Kennedy, the Presiding \nOfficer now, and Ranking Member Enzi, William Jawando on my staff--the \ncommittee's Ohio staff and all of the HELP Committee for their \nexcellent work on this legislation. This bill, of course, as we know, \ninvests in higher education. The returns on that investment will not \nonly accrue to students and to the education system that serves them \nbut will accrue to the stability, prosperity, and security of our \nNation as a whole.\n  We know the problem. We know what has happened in the last many years \nto higher education in this country. Particularly in the last 5 or 6 \nyears in my home State of Ohio, the cost of attendance at 4-year public \ninstitutions has increased 53 percent. In 2001, if you graduated from \ncollege versus going 4 years in 2007, you are paying almost half again, \nthis year, in this 4-year period, than the 4-year period half a decade \nearlier. It has gone up almost 30 percent in the last 5 or 6 years at \n4-year private institutions. At the same time, the median household \nincome in my State has increased only 3 percent. So as college costs \nhave gone up 30 percent if you go to private schools, 50 percent if you \ngo to a public 4-year university, the average income in Ohio has gone \nup only 3 percent. You can see the gap.\n  The Federal Government has not been able to fill that gap. Pell \ngrants haven't been raised for years until this legislation. The \ninterest rates have continued to go up. Federal loans have\n\n[[Page S11245]]\n\nnot kept pace, neither FFELP nor the Direct Loan Program, so the chasm \nhas grown in terms of the kind of money working-class kids and poor \nkids and middle-class kids need to go to college.\n  In the 2004-2005 school year, 66 percent of students graduating from \n4-year institutions in my State of Ohio graduated with student loan \ndebt, and that debt was an average of $20,000. So two-thirds of Ohio \nstudents graduating are burdened with an average of $20,000 in student \nloan debt. That makes a big difference in career choice. That means \nthey sometimes cannot take the kind of job they trained for, that they \nmost want, because it doesn't pay the bills as well as another job \nmight.\n  A generation ago, it was very different. As Senator Kennedy and I \nhave talked, I told him my wife a generation ago graduated from Kent \nState University, a working-class kid, the first one in her family to \ngo to college. Her father carried a union card at Cleveland Electric \nIlluminating Company for 36 years as a utility worker, but she was able \nto graduate from Kent State, getting a bachelor's degree in journalism \nwith grants, loans, and very little debt when she graduated so she \ncould pursue the kind of opportunities she had chosen to.\n  Looking from 30 years ago to today and the difficulties that the \nmiddle-class and working-class and poor kids face going to college, \nthat is why this bill matters, the dramatic increase in Pell grants, \nthe lowering of interest rates, the loan forgiveness which Senator \nKennedy has talked about at length--what that means is assistance for \nteachers and nurses and all kinds of public servants to serve the \ncommunity.\n  This seems to be a generation of idealism, and we will see those \nstudents be able to pursue a career in public service and be able to \ntake those jobs, sometimes--often--at lower pay, but be able to relieve \nthemselves of the huge burden of debt they face. That is why this bill \nmatters so much.\n  This bill is a major step. We know we have more work to do.\n  Senator Enzi has said several times that we have got to pass the \nother legislation with the reauthorization. He is right about that. We \nall agree with that. That will help on some issues such as simplifying \nthe loan form for those prospective students filling out their \napplications for student loans and for grants.\n  We also know this growth in the cost of college, as I said earlier, \nthe cost in State universities in Ohio has gone up 50 percent, wages \nhave gone up for an average family only 3 percent in this decade. The \nFederal Government has not kept up. That means an awful lot more \nstudents have turned to the private loan system and have had to face \ninterest rates of 10, 12, 15, sometimes as high as 18 percent. They \ngraduate from college, private or public, with a huge, even larger \nburden because of those high interest rates. We need to address that in \nthe future as the private loan system has grown more and more and more.\n  I close by thanking the entire committee, Senator Kennedy, Senator \nEnzi, for taking up this extremely important legislation. All students \nshould be able to afford college in this country. This bill is a step, \na major step in that direction. I thank all the fellow Senators who \nhave been so involved in this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise in support, strong support, of \nthe higher education reconciliation conference report before us. The \nbill represents a remarkable achievement this body, and this Congress, \nshould be proud of. The billions of grant aid in this bill will make a \ntremendous difference for students across the Nation, students who are \nstruggling to stay afloat because of the cost of college, students who \nare saving every last penny in the hopes they can achieve their dreams \nof college.\n  The passage of this bill will make a change in the tide in Congress. \nIt proves to students that when we say we will work to make college \nmore affordable, we mean it. This bill shows them that when we say we \nunderstand the obstacles they face to finance a college education, we \nare not throwing words around.\n  This bill will confirm that when we say student loans should work for \nstudents, we mean it. This Democratically led Congress laid out strong \nprinciples for how we should improve access to a college education. \nWith this piece of landmark legislation, we are putting those \nprinciples into action. This bill is no small feat. Not since the \npassage of the GI bill has a piece of education legislation made this \nbig of an investment in students' aid.\n  Now, this historic moment could not have been possible without the \nleadership of Senator Kennedy, who has once again stood up for the \nNation's students by engineering and moving this bill forward. I also \nwish to thank Senator Enzi as the Republican leader on the committee \nwho worked so quickly to finalize this important bill.\n  The bill could not come at a more critical time. Nationwide, the \nlowest income students at 4-year colleges face roughly $5,800 in unmet \nneed after a standard financial aid package, after their loans, and \nafter the amount their families contribute. To put it simply, for the \nneediest students all across the country, current aid has not kept up.\n  Students of my home State of New Jersey are no stranger to the \nskyrocketing cost of a college education. In fact, within the past 5 \nschool years, the cost of attendance, including tuition, fees, room and \nboard at 4-year public colleges in New Jersey has increased by almost \n50 percent.\n  Unfortunately, family household incomes have not kept up with these \nrising costs. Even after financial aid is taken into account, nearly 40 \npercent of median family income in New Jersey is needed to pay for 1 \nyear of college at 4-year public colleges. It is simply unbearable for \nour students. The result is some of our Nation's brightest students are \nlocked out of a college education simply because they cannot afford it.\n  I am pleased this legislation will reverse that troubling trend for \nall our students and families across the country by adding billions \ninto new grant aid. Next year alone, New Jersey students will see more \nthan $40 million in new grant aid. Over the next 5 years, students in \nmy State will have access to more than 400 million Federal grant \ndollars because of this bill. Grant dollars equal access for many of \ntoday's college students.\n  The bill reduces subsidies to student lenders and gives it back to \nour students. It is about time. For far too long, students struggling \nto afford college have seen their grants shrink, their loan rates go up \nand their debt explode after graduation. More than 60 percent of New \nJersey students graduate with loan debt that averages $16,000. That is \nnot a manageable amount of debt for a 21-year-old college graduate. It \nis an unfair burden.\n  That is why I am proud of the bill, because it will help lessen the \nburden on our students. It will put money directly where it is most \nneeded, into Pell grants and other critical financial assistance that \nbenefits our Nation's students. From here on, millions of young people \nacross the Nation will have the opportunity to see their dream of a \ncollege degree come true.\n  They will have access to the key that will unlock their own economic \nempowerment, build a successful career, and succeed in a global \neconomy. Today we have an opportunity to move critical legislation \nforward to be signed into law, so the doors to college will be open for \nall students. In the global economy we live in today, we clearly cannot \nafford as a nation to have our students priced out of a college \neducation.\n  As someone who grew up poor, the son of immigrants, the first in my \nfamily to go to college, I know the power of the programs we are ready \nsoon to vote on. I would never have attended St. Peters College, I \nwould have never gone to Rutgers Law School without the power of key \nFederal grant programs such as Pell and Perkins, I certainly would not \nbe standing with you today on the floor of the Senate had it not been \nfor Federal financial aid.\n  I wish to ensure that is a birthright for all our students across the \nNation, regardless of the happenstance of where they were born in life.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n\n[[Page S11246]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the bill before us today from a policy \nstandpoint does some things which are extremely positive. It adjusts, I \nthink appropriately, the cost of the amount of subsidy that is going \ninto the system relative to higher education loans and takes savings \nfrom that subsidy, which was going to lenders, and moves it over to \nassist people who need assistance, especially under the Pell Grant \nProgram.\n  So it is, from a policy standpoint, moving in the right direction in \nmany ways. In addition, as the Senator from Wyoming has pointed out, \nthere needs to be tied to this a Higher Education Reauthorization Act, \nwhich unfortunately is not in this bill and needs to be in this bill in \norder to complete the package. That is critical to this whole \nundertaking in making sure we significantly improve our ability to \nsupport people who are going to college, making sure the loans which \nthese people get are properly disclosed and that the money does not end \nup, as we increase the Pell grants, being taken away by increasing \ntuitions which are tied to our Pell grant increases.\n  So there are good things about this bill. There is also a big part of \nthis bill that is missing, which is the Higher Education \nReauthorization Act, and certainly the Senator from Wyoming made an \neloquent statement on that.\n  What I wished to talk about, however, was the fact that this bill \ncomes to the floor in an inappropriate way, using the wrong vehicle, \nand as a result deems serious harm to the budget process we have in the \nCongress. This bill comes under what is known as reconciliation. \nReconciliation is a very unique vehicle which we have in the Senate, \nthe purpose of which is to avoid filibusters and allow legislation to \nmove, which is going to be used on the spending side of the ledger, at \nleast, to reduce entitlement spending.\n  It was created out of the 1974 Budget Act. It has been used over the \nyears for the purposes of reconciliation, of reducing entitlement \nspending. In fact, in 1990, it reduced entitlement spending--it was \nused to reduce about $480 billion in entitlement spending over a 10-\nyear period; in 1993, about $433 billion; in 1995, about $337 billion; \nin 1997, about $118 billion; and then in 2006, about $36 billion. Why \ndo we use this mechanism? Well, every year we have two different types \nof spending in the Federal Government. We have discretionary spending, \nwhich means it occurs on an annual basis and is appropriated, it goes \nthrough the Appropriations Committee. That represents about a third of \nthe Federal Government spending. Then we have entitlement spending, \nwhich is spending that occurs where the Federal Government, as a result \nof laws, has an obligation to pay money to somebody.\n  Agriculture programs are, for example, entitlement programs, where if \nyou plant a certain amount of fields or do not plant a certain amount \nof fields, you have a right to obtain payment from the Federal \nGovernment under the law. Medicare is an entitlement program. We have a \nlot of education programs which are arguably entitlement programs and a \nlot that are discretionary programs.\n  But the problem is, when you have an entitlement program, you cannot \nadjust it annually through the appropriations process. The only way you \ncan adjust it is by changing the law which affects that program and \ncreates savings or more spending. So the Budget Act recognized this and \nalso recognizes it is extremely hard to do that in the context of the \nSenate because the Senate has the filibuster, where you can basically \ntie anything up without 60 votes. It also requires 60 votes to pass \njust about anything.\n  So this very unique and very powerful instrument was given to the \nbudgeting process called reconciliation, where there is a limited \namount of time to debate a bill, in this case 10 hours as a result of a \nconference report, no filibuster can apply, and it only takes 51 votes \nto pass the bill.\n  But this whole concept of giving this very strong power to the Budget \nCommittee and to the committees of jurisdiction was to allow us to \nreduce the rate of growth of entitlement spending in order to make the \nbudget more manageable.\n  What has happened, however, has been to reverse that, to actually do \nthe exact opposite using reconciliation, with the representation that \nwe are going to save, I believe it is $750 million, which is \nminuscule--remember that over the years we have been saving billions of \ndollars through reconciliation--with the representation that we are \ngoing to save $750 million. We have a chart which reflects this. These \nare savings which we have received under reconciliation when we have \nused it in the past: $428 billion; $433 billion; up until 2006, we did \n$39 billion.\n  This year, this reconciliation bill, saves less than $1 billion net. \nSo it is not a savings vehicle at all. In fact, what it does is it uses \nthat $93 billion savings to mask an almost $21 billion spending event.\n  It takes the reconciliation--as long as you get a net savings, you \nare allowed to use reconciliation--and uses it to dramatically increase \nspending. In fact, the amount of new spending in this reconciliation \nbill exceeds the amount of savings by 2,900 percent. In other words, \nthe spending in this bill is 29 times larger than the savings in this \nbill, which totally undermines and makes a joke out of the budget \nprocess and reconciliation, and it is totally inappropriate to have \ndone this, to use reconciliation in this manner.\n  It could be effectively argued the proposals that have been brought \nforward under this bill would easily pass this Congress with 60 votes, \nwith or without reconciliation. But by using reconciliation, they \nallowed themselves to eliminate all amendments, for all intents and \npurposes of any significance, and they have this 51-vote rule, and as a \nresult of spending 2,900 times more than they save, they essentially \nmake a mockery of the budget process.\n  Not only do they make a mockery of the budget process on the issue of \nreconciliation, they make a mockery of the budget process by the manner \nin which they score the bill itself. This bill is set up so the Pell \ngrants will increase, which is what the goal of the bill is, to $5,400 \nper person, but the spending on the Pell grants will also increase \nrather dramatically over the next few years because we are taking a \nsubsidy which is now going to lenders and putting it into Pell \nspending.\n  But in the year 2013, under this bill, we are going to go back to \nzero, essentially zero dollars being spent on Pell grants. That is what \nthis bill calls for in 2013, zero dollars essentially will be spent on \nPell grants.\n  What a farce. I mean, really. In order for them to take advantage of \nreconciliation and the protection of reconciliation, they had to put in \nplace a program which goes from almost $5 billion in the year 2012, \ndown to zero in 2013. Talk about truth in budgeting or integrity in \nbudgeting. How can anybody vote for this who believes we should have an \nhonest budget and claim that they are being honest?\n  There is $9 billion of Pell grant, which one could realistically \nargue over the next 10 years is going to have to be spent, which isn't \naccounted for. It is sort of, well, it will appear from the sky, I \nguess. One would think that would be enough; that basically the \nproposal makes a mockery of the reconciliation process in the budget, \nmakes a mockery of the baseline by going back to zero spending in 2013. \nBut then we get to pay-go; pay-go, the sacred cow of fiscal discipline \nfrom the other side of the aisle that we hear so much about. We are \ngoing to stand by pay-go in order to discipline Federal Government \nspending. We heard that incessantly in the last Congress from the other \nside of the aisle. We heard it incessantly from people running for \noffice from the other side of the aisle. But it has become Swiss cheese \nas bill after bill after bill has been brought to the floor which has \nwaived pay-go when it came to spending. What a surprise. The Democratic \nmajority waives pay-go when they want to spend money.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Then they claim they are using pay-go to discipline the \nFederal Government. It has happened time and time again. The most \nrecent egregious event prior to this one was SCHIP, where they added \n$41 billion of new spending waiving pay-go. This $6 billion down here \nthat was a pay-go violation has now grown to be about\n\n[[Page S11247]]\n\n$20 billion under this bill. So the little hole in the Swiss cheese \nshould be a great big hole.\n  Anyone who comes to this floor and claims they are using pay-go to \ndiscipline the Federal budget at any time for the rest of this Congress \nwill have to have a sanity test given to them because they certainly \ncan't defend that on the basis of any facts.\n  The problem with this bill isn't the policy. In fact, quite honestly, \nI would have probably used a more aggressive policy. I would have been \nwilling to auction all these accounts to get to the real number as to \nwhat the subsidy is. We might have saved a lot more money and put more \nmoney into Pell. The problem is, this bill, in the manner in which it \nis brought to the floor, basically puts a stake through the heart of \nthe budget process. It takes reconciliation, which is the most \nsignificant tool of the budget process, and makes a joke out of it by \nusing it to increase spending 2,900 times more than it creates savings. \nIt takes the baseline and makes a joke out of it by reducing Pell \ngrants in 2013 to zero spending, when we know we are going to be \nspending $5.5 billion on Pell grants in 2013. It takes pay-go, which is \nalleged to be a disciplining mechanism, waives it, and then spends $21 \nbillion that would have been subject to it.\n  My point is obviously one of frustration, as former chairman of the \nBudget Committee. I would like to see us have a budget that means \nsomething. We didn't pass a budget. The Democratic Party passed a \nbudget; I congratulated them for that. I didn't agree with it, but at \nleast they passed it. But if they are going to pass it, they ought to \nhave a purpose for it, and they ought to live by it. The purpose should \nnot be to expand spending, to make a joke of the baseline, and to \nbasically put holes in the pay-go mechanism which they claim is the \nessence of their fiscal discipline.\n  From a public policy standpoint, the bill may have good policy in it, \nbut from the standpoint of managing the fiscal house of this country, \nit is doing fundamental harm to the budget process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts has \n17 minutes 49 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to my friend from New Hampshire, who is leaving the \nChamber, I am sorry he is leaving. This water is put on our desks by \nour loyal, dutiful pages every day. Sometimes I want to check this \nwater because I think perhaps imbibing it leads to political amnesia. \nThe longer you drink the water on the floor of the Senate, the more you \ntend to forget reality and forget what has happened.\n  I just listened to a speech by the Senator from New Hampshire talking \nabout deficits and reconciliation bills. The bill we have before us \ntoday, the most dramatic increase in student aid ever in the history of \nthe United States, does not add to the deficit. We pay for it. What the \nSenator from New Hampshire, whom I respect and like very much, fails to \nacknowledge is that when he was chairing the Budget Committee, when \nthese reconciliation bills would come to the floor, they would add \ndramatically to the deficit every year. In fact, we have totaled it up. \nOver the last several years--2001, 2003, 2005--the Republican \nreconciliation bills added $1.7 trillion to the deficit. Now they come \nand rail against the deficits.\n  This bill before us today is a bill that is paid for. It is paid for \nby taking subsidies away from student loan companies. Do you know what \nhappened the last round in reconciliation? They ended up taking about \n$12 billion in help away from students and giving it to the wealthiest \npeople in America in tax cuts. Talk about reverse Robin Hood, not only \nadding to the deficit but taking money away from students, raising the \ncost of their loans, and then giving that money in tax cuts to the \nwealthiest people. That was the politics that was rejected in the last \nelection.\n  My friends and colleagues are making speeches believing that we don't \nhave this written down somewhere about what actually happened, but we \ndo. I am afraid my colleague has forgotten some of the most important \nthings that happened under his watch and their watch, which was to add, \nin three reconciliation bills, $1.7 trillion to the deficit.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will when I have finished. This may be the single most \nimportant bill we pass. Most of us realize if there is one thing in \nAmerica that gives you a chance to succeed, it is education. We can't \nguarantee to our children that they will be successful or wealthy or \nhappy in life, but we can give them a chance. The best chance we can \ngive them is to let them go to school and progress along and go to the \nbest schools they can attend.\n  I happen to be standing here today because 50 years ago, somebody in \nthe United States House of Representatives decided that because the \nRussians had launched Sputnik and frightened us with the prospect of \nlosing the war in space, we needed to give more young kids a chance to \ngo to college. So college, which had been kind of an elite opportunity \nfor the wealthy and the sons and daughters of those who graduated from \ncolleges in the past, was now expanded and democratized.\n  In the 1960s, kids, such as myself, from east St. Louis, IL, had a \nchance to go to great universities such as the one in town that I went \nto named Georgetown. I didn't have any money. I borrowed it from the \nNational Defense Education Act. What a deal. Pay it back over 10 years \nafter you graduate, and at a 3-percent interest rate. It worked. I got \nmy college degree and my law degree. I paid back my loans, and the \nmoney was there for the next generation.\n  Now what has happened to the cost of college education? It has gone \nthrough the roof. I just sat down with a couple kids from colleges in \nChicago. I said to a junior and a senior: How much debt will you have \nwhen you graduate? The junior said: I am at $35,000 right now. The \nsenior said: I will be at $45,000 when I graduate.\n  Those figures, unfortunately, are not unique. More and more students \nare ending up with debt.\n  I say to Senator Kennedy and to my good friend and close colleague, \nGeorge Miller of California, they have done a great favor for America \nand for America's families. What they have done with this bill is to \nexpand Pell grants, which are basic grants to kids whose families don't \nhave a lot of money, for the first time in 5 years. For 5 years these \nPell grants have been frozen. Now they are going up. Then they have \ncome up with unique ways to reduce the burden of student loans so that \nyoung people who sign on the dotted line so they can go through another \nyear of school, never thinking what this means 10 or 20 years from now, \nare going to pay dramatically less in interest.\n  George Miller and I introduced a bill that cut the interest rate on \nstudent loans from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent. It is included in this \nimportant bill we are going to pass today. Think about that for a \nminute. If you think of it in terms of your home mortgage, what if you \ncould cut your interest rate in half, from 6.8 to 3.4. You are going to \npay off that loan sooner. You will pay less in interest.\n  They have another provision in here that is dramatic and ingenious. \nIf a young person coming out of college with student debt agrees to \ntake a job as a nurse or a teacher or a social worker, things we need \nmore young people to dedicate their lives to, we are going to forgive \ntheir loans more quickly. We are going to limit the amount of money \nthey have to pay back each year on the loan. Then in 10 years, the \nstudent loan is erased, if they will go into teaching. This is a \ndramatic commitment we have made to young people to go into jobs and \nprofessions that are so important for our future.\n  We give a lot of speeches here about how much we love this country \nand how much we want to see it succeed. The real test is whether we are \nprepared to invest in our children. This bill invests in our kids. This \nbill takes money that might otherwise have gone for tax cuts for the \nrichest people in America, which was the pattern that was building \naround Congress, and instead invests in working families and\n\n[[Page S11248]]\n\ntheir kids. It says to a child: If you are good enough to get in a good \nuniversity, if you will work hard and succeed and get a degree, even if \nyou have debt, at the end of the day, we are going to stand by you. We \nare going to give you a chance to pay that debt off in a reasonable way \nand to pick the career and life that you want. Don't take the job that \npays the most money because you can pay off your debt. Take the job \nthat your heart is attached to.\n  I remember running into a science teacher in the suburbs of Chicago, \na young woman fresh out of college. She was so happy to be teaching \nmath at this great high school. I said: Is this what you wanted to do? \nShe said: No. I wanted to teach in an inner-city school, but I couldn't \ndo it because they don't pay as much money. I have student loans, you \nknow. They pay me more out here in the suburbs, and I can pay off my \nloans and buy a car. So I made that choice. I wish I didn't have to, \nbut I made that choice.\n  Repeat that story a thousand times, see that teachers who could have \ngone into areas where they are desperately needed now have a chance to \nsucceed.\n  I tell my colleagues, as I look back on the things that made a \ndifference in my life, laws that were passed that really changed my \nlife, when this Congress made a commitment to loans to kids from \nfamilies such as my own, at that point in time they gave me a chance. I \nstand in this Senate today because of it. Senator Kennedy, Senator \nEnzi, Congressman Miller, and others are going to provide those \nopportunities for thousands of young American kids.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield an additional 3 minutes to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the Senator from Wyoming yielding to me. I \nknow the Senator from Illinois would have yielded for a question, but \nhis statement carried him away. Please note, I have no water on my \ndesk--not by choice but I suspect that they don't trust me with it. I \nwas glad to learn that it is the water that has caused the \ndysfunctionality of the Senate. I had been beginning to think maybe it \nwas the Democratic leadership, since the change of hands. But getting \nthis clarified is very important.\n  I do want to make this simple point: Pell grants were expanded \nthrough SMART grants when we did the last reconciliation, when I was \nchairman of the Budget Committee. We put $8 billion in the SMART \ngrants, which helped kids, especially freshman and sophomores. We \neliminated the origination fees, and we also increased the auto zero to \n$20,000, and we increased the asset protection allocation. So we did \nmake these decisions. But at the same time we reduced the funds to \nlenders and put a significant amount of it into deficit reduction, $40 \nbillion into deficit reduction.\n  The Senator from Illinois takes the position that when we cut taxes, \nwe were having the same impact on the budget as when they increased \nspending. That is the difference between the parties. It is \nfundamental. We believe when we leave people's dollars in their pockets \nand they get to spend it themselves--because it is their money to begin \nwith--that is not necessarily aggravating the Federal budget situation. \nThey believe when you take the money out of people's pockets and expand \nthe size of the Government--in this case, 2,900 times more than you \nsave in the area of spending reduction--that is good, because there is \na philosophical difference here.\n  The philosophical difference, quite simply, is the Democratic Party \nbelieves it knows better how to spend people's money than the people \nknow how to spend their money. We believe the people know how to better \nspend their money better than the Federal Government does. That is the \ndifference.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, Mr. President, first I would like to complete my \nthought on this point because I think it is critical. The budget \nreconciliation process was not set up to be a stalking-horse for \ndramatic expansion in the size of Federal Government entitlement \nprograms. That was not the purpose of the reconciliation structure. It \nwas set up for the purposes of being able to control the rate of growth \nof entitlement programs.\n  Now, we can debate whether the budget process was set up for the \npurposes of allowing us to return more tax dollars to taxpayers with \nreasonable tax rates, but certainly on the issue of spending, there is \nno question but that reconciliation was not intended to expand \nentitlement spending.\n\n\n                          independent students\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask my friend, the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts, for clarification of language in the \nconference report. On page 60, the report refers to the definition of \nan independent student for purposes of determining financial aid \neligibility. The current law was amended to allow students who are \norphans, in foster care or wards of the court or who were orphans, in \nfoster care or wards of the court any time after the age of 13 to be \nconsidered independent students. I would like to ask the Senator to \nclarify that individuals who were orphans, in foster care or wards of \nthe court when they were 13 years of age or older but no longer orphans \nin foster care or wards of the court when applying for college will \nstill be considered independent students.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, the senior Senator from Louisiana is \nabsolutely correct. The conference report does indeed make that change \nin the law. And I can assure the senior Senator from Louisiana that we \nwill further clarify this language in the upcoming conference report \nfor the Higher Education Amendments of 2007--S. 1642.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I appreciate that clarification. I believe we should \nmodify the language to be more clear on this point. I believe it should \nread ``(B) is an orphan, in foster care, or a ward of the court, or was \nan orphan, in foster care, or a ward of the court at any time when the \nindividual was 13 years of age or older;''.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I agree and I assure the senior Senator from Louisiana \nthat we will make this change in the conference report for the Higher \nEducation Amendments of 2007, S. 1642.\n\n\n                  definition of not-for-profit lender\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, especially \nSenators Kennedy and Enzi, as well as their staff, in working together \nduring discussions on the College Cost Reduction and Access Act to \nrecognize the work of nonprofit loan providers and the services they \nprovide to students and States.\n  I would like to clarify with my colleagues the committee's intent \nregarding one of the provisions that relates to these nonprofit loan \nproviders. It is my understanding that nonprofit entities that use \neligible lender trustees to provide Federal loans to students--such as \nthe one in my State, EdSouth--will benefit from the special allowance \npayment for not-for-profit holders in this bill. The language in this \nbill allows an eligible lender trustee acting on behalf of a nonprofit \nentity to be eligible to receive this payment on behalf of the \nnonprofit entity, as long as such nonprofit entity was acting as the \nbeneficial owner of Federal student loans on the date of enactment. I \nask Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi whether my understanding of the \nprovision is, in fact, what was intended by the bill.\n  Our staff has all worked carefully on the language to ensure that the \nlegitimate efforts of nonprofits can continue, without opening up \nloopholes that would allow for-profit entities to benefit from the \nspecial allowance payment differential.\n  I thank my friends for their time today and again appreciate their \nefforts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Tennessee. As I \nhave stated previously, this bill reflects the priority of several of \nour Members by recognizing that nonprofit lenders in their States make \nimportant contributions in their States. My colleague is correct, it is \nthe intent of this legislation to allow nonprofit entities that provide \nFederal student loans through an eligible lender trustee to benefit \nfrom the differential special allowance payment, as long as the \nnonprofit pays no more than reasonable\n\n[[Page S11249]]\n\nand customary fees to the trustee that holds the loans in trust for the \nbenefit of the nonprofit entity and as long as the nonprofit was the \nsole owner of the beneficial interest in the loans on the date of \nenactment. I commit to continue to work with my friend in the future to \nmake any necessary clarifications with respect to this provision.\n  Mr. ENZI. I, too, thank Senator Alexander for his commitment to \nstudents in his State and across the country, and to the public purpose \nmission of nonprofits, such as EdSouth and, in my home State of \nWyoming, the Wyoming Student Loan Corporation. I appreciate him taking \nthe time to clarify this issue. I, too, agree with my colleague \nregarding his explanation of the intent of the bill with regard to \nnonprofit entities that provide Federal student loans through eligible \nlender trustees. And I join Chairman Kennedy in his commitment to make \nany further clarifications necessary to ensure that existing nonprofit \nloan providers that use eligible lender trustees will be able to \nbenefit from the differential special allowance payment.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I would like to thank Majority \nLeader Reid, HELP Committee Chairman Kennedy and ranking member Enzi \nfor their leadership in increasing college access for millions of \nstudents and ensuring America stays competitive in the global economy. \nI am proud to join them in this effort.\n  This legislation comes at a time when the rising cost of college is \nmaking it tougher for all students who want to go to college to attend. \nThose who do attend college are borrowing twice what they would have \nborrowed 10 years ago. That is why I am pleased this legislation will \nincrease Pell grants up to $5,400 in the next 5 years, providing \nhundreds of millions in increased grant aid to New York students over \nthe next 5 years. It is no secret to anyone that the purchasing power \nof the Pell grant has declined dramatically in recent years. This \npackage not only provides a dramatic increase in the Pell grant, but \nalso raises the automatic-zero expected family contribution threshold \nto $30,000, making more students from needy families eligible to \nreceive the maximum grant award. This conference report cuts the \ninterest rate for certain student loans in half from 6.8 percent to 3.4 \npercent, saving our student borrowers hundreds each year on their \nstudent loans.\n  The mathematics of rising college costs are simple. More students are \ntaking on more debt. I am pleased to join my colleagues in taking these \ncritical steps to increase college affordability and access for all \nstudents. I am thrilled to support a conference report that will help \nlow- and middle-income students meet the cost of college. Last \nNovember, Democrats made a promise to reduce the cost of college for \nour student borrowers and today we have delivered on that promise.\n  Under the management of Chairmen Kennedy and Miller, the House and \nSenate have reached an agreement that provides $20.2 billion in student \naid, nearly $3 billion more than the original Senate Reconciliation \npackage passed in July of this year. I am very pleased the College Cost \nReduction and Access Act tackles an issue addressed in legislation I \nsponsored The Student Borrower's Bill of Rights by providing \nprotections for student borrowers while they repay their loans. It does \nso by capping monthly loan payments at 15 percent of the borrower's \ndiscretionary income and providing several important protections to \nmembers of the Armed Forces and public service employees during \nrepayment. Under this provision, for example, a starting teacher in New \nYork with the state average student loan debt can have his or her \nmonthly payments reduced by 21 percent. This savings will prove \ncritical to helping students manage their debt, especially in the first \nfew years after they graduate.\n  I hear from many young people in New York and around the country, who \nwant to be teachers, police officers, nurses, social workers and public \ndefenders, but sadly are so straddled with debt, such careers are not \nan option for them. This is the wrong policy; and today, we send the \nmessage that we want to encourage more young people to go into lower \npaying public service jobs. I am pleased this bill creates a new loan \nforgiveness plan through the direct loan program for public service \nemployees. Under the loan forgiveness program the remaining loan \nbalance on a loan is forgiven for a borrower who has been employed in a \npublic sector job and making payments on such loan for 10 years. Under \nthe loan forgiveness for public service employees provision, a public \nschool teacher in my State with $19,000 in student loan debt will not \nonly have his loan repayment capped at 15 percent, but could save \nnearly $8,000 on his loan after teaching for 10 years. I strongly \nbelieve this program will help to fill the void in public service our \nnation will soon face as our baby boomer generation sets to retire by \nproviding an incentive for college graduates to pursue lower paying, \nbut vital professions.\n  The College Cost Reduction and Access Act helps make higher education \nmore affordable, and that is good economic policy, good social policy, \nand good budgetary policy. I am proud Congress has chosen to make this \ngroundbreaking investment in our students.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2669, \nthe College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007.\n  This important legislation, which I helped craft as a member of the \nSenate Education Committee and as a conferee, will make a substantial \nFederal investment in need-based grant aid for low-income students, and \nwill significantly help middle-class students and families pay down and \nmanage their loan debt.\n  Under this bill, the maximum Pell grant for eligible students will be \nincreased by $500 next year and to $5,400 by 2012. This means that \nRhode Island students will receive $7.8 million in additional grant aid \nnext year and nearly $85 million over the next 5 years, increasing the \naverage Pell grant in Rhode Island by $360 in 2008 to $2,880.\n  H.R. 2669 also includes provisions to stem the increasing numbers of \nmiddle-class families falling further into debt to finance a college \neducation. As such, this bill phases in a lower interest rate on new \nsubsidized Stafford loans to undergraduate students, reducing the rate \nin half over 4 years on such loans from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent; \nhelps students manage their debt by capping monthly Federal student \nloan payments at 15 percent of a borrower's discretionary income; and \nprovides loan forgiveness for borrowers who continue in public service \ncareers for 10 years, including nurses, teachers, and librarians.\n  I am especially pleased that this legislation includes provisions \nfrom my FAFSA Act--S. 939--to increase the income level at which a \nstudent is automatically eligible for the maximum Pell grant, ensuring \nthat all students from families with incomes of $30,000 or less receive \nthe maximum Pell grant. This automatic-eligibility level would also be \ntied to the Consumer Price Index to ensure that the benefit keeps pace \nwith inflation and does not become diluted.\n  The College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 also includes \nprovisions I authored to double the income protection allowance for \ndependent students from $3,000 to $6,000 over 4 years and increase the \nincome protection allowance for independent students, including adult \nlearners and veterans, by 50 percent over 4 years. These increases will \nprotect students who have to work during college so they can earn more \nwithout having it count against their financial aid.\n  This is significant legislation for families in Rhode Island and \nacross the Nation, and I strongly urge its passage. I want to thank \nSenators Kennedy and Enzi, and their staffs, for their work on this \nbill. I also look forward to building on this legislation by working \nwith my colleagues in the House to craft a final Higher Education Act \nreauthorization bill in the coming weeks that would, among other key \ncomponents, include provisions I authored in the Senate version of the \nreauthorization bill to improve the Leveraging Educational Assistance \nPartnership or LEAP program; simplify the financial aid process and \nforms; and strengthen college teacher preparation programs. These two \nbills combined will tackle the twin goals of access and affordability \nfor students and families and help ensure that our Nation remains \ncompetitive in today's global economy.\n\n[[Page S11250]]\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nconference report to accompany the College Cost Reduction and Access \nAct now before the Senate. The conference report and the underlying \nbill make extraordinary progress on one of the most critical challenges \nbefore this Congress: making college affordable for all our Nation's \ndeserving students.\n  We all know that education plays a crucial role in helping people \npursue the American dream. That term was first used by James Truslow \nAdams in his book ``The Epic of America,'' which he wrote in 1931 \nduring the Great Depression. He wrote:\n\n       The American Dream is that dream of a land in which life \n     should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with \n     opportunity for each according to ability or achievement. . . \n     . It is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but \n     a dream of social order in which each man and each woman \n     shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they \n     are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what \n     they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth \n     or position.\n\n  Congress passed the Higher Education Act in 1965 to help all \nAmericans ``attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately \ncapable.'' Millions of students have gained access to higher education \ndue to the financial assistance programs, including Pell grants, this \nhistoric legislation created.\n  The problem now is that tuition costs are rising rapidly, wages are \nstagnant, and Congress hasn't kept up in terms of providing the funding \nnecessary to bridge the gap. In my home State of Maryland, for example, \nin the 5 years between the 2000-2001 and 2005-2006 school years, the \ncost of attending 4-year public colleges increased 36 percent, from \n$10,846 to $14,793. But the median household income in Maryland \nincreased just 11 percent. Even after financial aid is taken into \naccount, 32 percent of the median family income in Maryland is needed \nto pay for just 1 year at a 4-year public college.\n  The effects of this disparity between college costs and family income \nare devastating. Each year, more than 400,000 talented, qualified, \nhopeful students cannot attend a 4-year college because, they cannot \nafford it. When I was a young man, such a person might have had other \nviable options for making a decent wage and pursuing a fulfilling \ncareer. But today, 60 percent of new jobs require some postsecondary \neducation, compared to just 15 percent of new jobs when I was a \nstudent.\n  Those students who do go on to college are becoming more and more \ndependent on private loans which carry high interest rates to finance \ntheir education. In 1986-1987, the maximum Pell grant covered 39 \npercent of the average public 4-year college tuition in Maryland; in \n2005-2006 it covered only 27 percent. This decline is due, in part, to \na shift of a great portion of Federal spending on student aid from \ngrants to loans: 30 years ago, 77 percent of Federal aid to students \nwas in the form of grants, and only 20 percent was in the form of \nloans. By the 2005-2006 school year, this distribution pattern had been \nreversed, to 73 percent of aid taking the form of loans and 20 percent \ncoming in grants.\n  Just 15 years ago, fewer than half of all students took out loans to \nfinance their education. That number must seem incredible to today's \nstudents and parents struggling to finance a college education because \ntoday more than two-thirds of students borrow for college. In Maryland, \n53 percent of students graduating from 4-year institutions in 2005 \ngraduated with debt. The average student graduating from a 4-year \ncollege in Maryland that year owed $14,822 in student loan debt.\n  The growing barriers to higher education also have a profound effect \non our national economy. We do not have enough highly skilled workers \nin this country. We recruit overseas to find engineers, computer \nprogrammers, and scientists. Nor can we fill essential social service \npositions. More and more students avoid critically important career \npaths such as teaching, nursing, social work, and law enforcement. \nThese are some of the most important professions in our country but \nlower starting salaries are a distressingly powerful disincentive: \nnationally, nearly a quarter of public 4-year college graduates and \nover a third of private 4-year college graduates have too much debt to \nafford a starting teacher's salary. Over half of those graduating from \nprivate colleges have too much debt to enter the social work \nprofession. Debt levels are also causing graduates to delay buying a \nhome or a car and postpone marriage and having children. Such decisions \nhave important ramifications not just for the individuals involved, but \nfor society as a whole.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, I worked hard with my colleagues \nto make more money available for grant aid. We allocated $9.2 billion \nfor education and training over and above the President's budget \nrequest to be invested, in part, in Pell grants. We believe such an \ninvestment will make college more affordable so that all eligible \nstudents can gain the knowledge, skills, and experience they need to \nsucceed, and to ensure that employers have the workforce they need to \ncompete in a fiercely competitive, global marketplace.\n  The important legislation before us today takes essential steps to \nreverse our current course. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act \nwill make college more affordable by: Increasing access for low-income \nstudents by increasing the maximum Pell grant from $4,310 to $4,910 \nnext year and to $5,400 by 2012, and simplifying the financial aid \nprocess for low-income students by increasing the income level at which \na student is automatically eligible for the maximum Pell grant; easing \nthe burden on borrowers by cutting student loan interest rates in half, \nfrom 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent for undergraduate students with \nsubsidized student loans; protecting borrowers by capping monthly \nFederal loan payments at 15 percent of discretionary income; protecting \nworking students and ensuring they are not penalized by increasing the \namount of student income that is sheltered from the financial aid \nprocess; and encouraging public service by providing Federal loan \nforgiveness for public service employees.\n  The College Cost Reduction and Access Act would increase access to \nand preparation for college by both restoring funding for Upward Bound, \na key college access program, and creating college access challenge \ngrants to increase college outreach activities in every State.\n  The legislation strengthens minority serving institutions with an \nadditional $500 million investment. Despite tremendous challenges and \nlimited resources, minority serving institutions are responsible for \neducating many of our Nation's minority students who would not \notherwise obtain a degree. Increasing Federal investment will allow \nthese institutions to provide a better education to more students.\n  But it is not enough to offer more aid. Recent investigations have \nshown that private lenders have been exploiting the student loan \nsystem, to the detriment of the students the system is meant to serve. \nThe College Cost Reduction and Access Act will ensure that the student \nloan system works for students and saves taxpayer dollars by directing \nunnecessary lender subsidies to student aid and injecting competition \ninto the loan program.\n  In addition, this legislation will help ensure that more students are \nprepared for college by helping to provide good teachers to the schools \nwhere they are needed most. According to research, teacher quality is \nthe schooling factor with the most profound effect on student \nachievement. Good teachers can make up to a full year's difference in \nlearning growth for students and overwhelm the impact of any other \neducational investment, including smaller class sizes. Unfortunately, \nour educational system pairs the children most behind with teachers \nwho, on average, have less experience, less education, and less skill \nthan those who teach other children. We will only close student \nachievement gaps when we improve teacher quality and experience. We \nmust make obtaining advanced training and experience in teaching more \naccessible and teaching at-risk students more desirable. I have \nintroduced a bill, S. 1282, which Senators Snowe and Durbin have \ncosponsored, to encourage the establishment of a class of ``Master \nTeachers'' with extensive experience and training. If they are willing \nto teach for an extended period of time in a school that is not meeting \nadequate yearly progress goals, then they would be rewarded under my \nbill with a 25-percent Federal tax exemption on their salary.\n\n[[Page S11251]]\n\nWhile my Master Teachers bill has not been incorporated into the \nlegislation before us, I hope the Senate will pass it soon.\n  The College Cost Reduction and Access Act also creates incentives for \ngood teachers to teach in high-need schools by establishing new TEACH \ngrants. These grants will provide scholarships of $4,000 per year for \nhigh-achieving undergraduate and graduate students who commit to \nteaching a high-need subject in a high-need school.\n  This legislation contains the biggest increase in Federal student aid \nsince the original G.I. bill. This is how our country should be \ninvesting its money: helping to open the door to our children's dreams, \nnot just for their benefit, but for the benefit of our communities, our \neconomy, our Nation, and all of humanity. I am proud that this Congress \nrealizes that increasing access to postsecondary education serves both \nas a gateway to the American dream for our Nation's students and a \npathway to our economic success and security as a Nation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe conference report to H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction and \nAccess Act of 2007. As you know, the cost of college has tripled in the \nlast 20 years.\n  In my State of New Mexico, the cost of attendance at 4-year public \ncolleges has increased by 35 percent since 2000-2001. Unfortunately, \nthe median household income in New Mexico only increased by 11 percent \nin that same time frame, considerably lower than the rate of increase \nat public colleges.\n  Each year, there are hundreds of thousands of students who are \nprepared to attend a 4-year college, but do not do so because of \nfinancial barriers. Further, an increasing number of students have to \nrely on loans to finance their education. In fact, in New Mexico, more \nthan half of all students graduating from 4-year institutions graduate \nwith debt. And the average student in New Mexico now graduates from 4 \nyears of college with more than $16,000 in debt.\n  The conference report to H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction and \nAccess Act of 2007, is critical to addressing the skyrocketing costs of \ncollege, and making college more accessible to students across the \ncountry.\n  This legislation will actually increase student aid by more than $20 \nbillion over the next 5 years, without increasing the national debt. It \nis paid for by cutting excessive Federal subsidies to lenders \nparticipating in the student loan program.\n  This legislation will increase the maximum Pell grant by $500 next \nyear and to $5,400 by 2012. In addition, the bill: simplifies the \nfinancial aid process for low-income students by increasing the income \nlevel at which a student is automatically eligible for the maximum \nPell; protects working students, increasing the amount of student \nincome that is sheltered from the financial aid process; expands \neligibility for financial aid so more students will qualify for more \nassistance; eases the burden of student debt by cutting student loan \ninterest rates in half to 3.4 percent for undergraduate students with \nsubsidized student loans; caps monthly loan payments at 15 percent of \ndiscretionary income so that graduates with significant loan debt can \nbetter manage their payments, particularly those in lower paying jobs \nor those supporting children; and forgives the student debt for those \nwho commit to public service for a period of 10 years.\n  This student aid package could mean as much as $200 million over the \nnext 5 years in financial aid to help New Mexico's students and \nfamilies beat back the rising costs of college.\n  In addition, I am pleased that the conference report will restore \ncritical funding for Upward Bound, a key college access program.\n  Further, the legislation will provide scholarships of $4,000/year for \nhigh-achieving undergraduate and graduate students who commit to \nteaching a high-need subject, such as math, science, special education, \nforeign languages, or bilingual education, in a high-need school.\n  Moreover, the conference report provides critical support to minority \nserving institutions. Despite tremendous growth in racial and ethnic \nminority enrollment at the nation's colleges and universities in recent \nyears, Hispanics, African Americans, and Native Americans continue to \nlag behind their non-minority peers in college enrollment. The College \nCost Reduction and Access Act will invest an additional $500 million in \nthese institutions, including: $200 million in funding for Hispanic \nserving institutions--HSIs--to increase the number of students \nattaining degrees in science, technology, engineering, or math, and to \nfacilitate transfers for students from 2-year HSIs to 4-year HSIs; and \n$60 million in funding to strengthen tribal colleges and universities.\n  I am particularly pleased that the conference report contains \nlanguage I authored that would create and fund a program for Native \nAmerican serving institutions. The legislation will provide $10 million \nto fund and help create a program for Native American serving \ninstitutions, those nontribal colleges and universities that serve \nlarge Native American student populations.\n  This conference report is critical to helping American families meet \nthe increasing burden of sending their children to college, and also \nmeets some very important national priorities. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this conference report.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the College Cost \nReduction and Access Act of 2007, a bipartisan piece of legislation \nthat will increase student aid by billions of dollars through cutting \nFederal subsidies to private banks and lenders. This is a significant \nvictory for students around the country and in my State of Wisconsin, \nwhich is estimated to receive over $260 million in new need-based grant \naid in the next 5 years and over $115 million in additional loan \nassistance over in the next 5 years. Wisconsin has a world-class higher \neducation system and I am pleased to support this much-needed \nlegislation that will help open the doors to college for more students \nin my State.\n  Access to a higher education is increasingly important in the \ncompetitive, global environment of the 21st century and is one of the \nmost important investments our Federal Government can make to advance \nour country's economic growth. But while the importance of attending \ncollege continues to increase, the cost of attending college also \ncontinues to increase, which often causes financial strain on students \nand their families as they seek to finance the cost of higher \neducation.\n  I am concerned about the continued educational attainment gap between \nrich and poor students and the fact that access to higher education too \noften depends on access to financial resources. The ability of a \nstudent to attain a higher education should not depend on that \nstudent's financial background, but rather on a student's desire to \nobtain a higher education. Expanding need-based grant aid is one of the \nbest ways that the Federal Government can expand access to higher \neducation for low income students and I am pleased the conference \nreport we will adopt today does just that.\n  This conference report contains a significant boost in funding for \nthe Pell grant program, ensuring that the maximum Pell grant award will \nreach $5,400 by 2012. I have long supported and led efforts in Congress \nto increase funding for the Pell grant program, a program dedicated to \nexpanding access to college for low income students. I was pleased to \njoin with my colleagues in February to pass a significant increase in \nthe maximum Pell Grant award to $4,310 from $4,050, the first increase \nin 4 years. Earlier this year, I also joined with my colleagues \nSenators Kennedy, Collins, and Coleman to lead letters to both the \nBudget and Appropriations Committees that advocated for the highest \npossible increase in funding for Pell grants. This substantial increase \nin the Pell program will benefit millions of students during their \nhigher education careers.\n  My colleagues and I have long fought against the declining purchasing \npower of the Pell grant by supporting substantial increases in the \nmaximum grant award. According to data from the Department of \nEducation, the maximum Pell grant covered half the cost of tuition, \nfees, room and board at public, 4-year colleges 20 years ago, but only \ncovered a third of these same costs during the 2005-2006 period. The \ndeclining power of the Pell has impacted my State of Wisconsin as well.\n\n[[Page S11252]]\n\nIn 1986-1987, the $2,100 maximum Pell grant covered 58 percent of \ncollege costs for Wisconsin students. In 2005-2006, the $4,050 maximum \nPell grant only covered 38 percent of college costs in Wisconsin.\n  I have been a proud supporter of the Pell grant program for many \nyears and I will continue to strongly advocate for increases in Pell \nfunding in the annual appropriations process to provide the highest, \nfiscally responsible increase in the Pell program in the coming years. \nWhile this legislation is an important first step, we have more to do \nto help ensure the Pell program can adequately cover the costs of \ncollege attendance for low income students.\n  In addition to the declining purchasing power of need-based aid like \nPell, the availability of such need-based grant aid does not come close \nto meeting the demand for it. As a result, an increasing number of \nstudents turn to Federal and private loans to finance their education. \nAccording to the College Board, in the late 1970s, over three-fourths \nof the Federal aid to students were grants, while 20 percent of Federal \nstudent aid were loans. Recent data from the College Board indicates \nthat the breakdown between grant aid and loans had switched by 2006, \nwith grant aid only making up twenty percent of the Federal student \naid.\n  Students in my State of Wisconsin, like students in other parts of \nthe country, are greatly affected by the Federal Government's increased \nreliance on student loans at the expense of grant aid. The Project on \nStudent Debt reports that more than 60 percent of Wisconsin graduates \nin 2005 graduated with debt and the average student who graduated from \na 4-year college in my State in 2005 owed over $17,000. This \nlegislation seeks to help alleviate the debt burden that some students \nface upon graduation by cutting the student loan interest rates in half \nby 2011 for undergraduate students who have subsidized student loans.\n  Higher levels of debt can also influence the decisions students make \nabout whether or not to take a job in the public interest sector or in \nthe more lucrative private sector after graduation. We have all heard \nabout students who are interested in working in areas like teaching, \nlaw enforcement, legal aid, or State and local government but who \ndecide against taking these public interest jobs because of their high \ndebt loads. It is unfortunate that so many students are forced to \nconsider their debt loads when deciding which jobs to take or pursue. \nThe loan forgiveness provision of this legislation will help those \ngraduating students in Wisconsin and around the country who want to \npursue careers in public service.\n  While I applaud much of the policy included in this measure, I am \ndisappointed that we are again seeing the reconciliation process used \nto advance legislation that is not primarily a deficit reduction \npackage. While there are better arguments for using reconciliation to \nconsider this particular bill than there were for the reconciliation \nprotection proposed for past legislation to open up the Alaska National \nWildlife Refuge to drilling, I am still troubled by the use of this \nextraordinary procedure as a way to advance a significant policy change \nthat is not primarily a deficit reduction package. Thanks to the \nefforts of our Budget Committee Chairman, Senator Conrad, the days when \nthe reconciliation process could be totally subverted to advance \nlegislation that actually worsened the deficit are over. I also commend \nChairman Conrad for insisting during the conference discussions on the \nbudget resolution that this particular reconciliation instruction move \ncloser to a more reasonable qualifying threshold of deficit reduction \nthan was initially proposed. I hope that in future budget resolutions, \nwe can further tighten the use of reconciliation to ensure that it is \nused for what it was intended, namely to advance significant deficit \nreduction.\n  Passage of the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 \nrepresents a great victory for students in my State of Wisconsin and \naround the country. I believe everyone deserves fair and equal access \nto a higher education and adoption of this bill moves us closer toward \nthat vision. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming \nmonths and years to continue to expand the Pell grant program and other \nneed-based programs so that hard-working students will be able to take \nadvantage of the full opportunities that access to a higher education \noffers.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the bill that we are debating today comes \nat a critical time for our country.\n  As the connected world has brought about new competition from nations \nacross the globe, the need for more Americans to be armed with a \ncollege education has become essential to the future of our economy.\n  And as a new generation enters a work world that demands highly \nskilled, highly trained workers, a college degree is necessary to open \nthe door to a successful career.\n  But for too long the deck has been stacked against students seeking \nto build their careers and grow our economy.\n  College has become more expensive, interest rates have grown, and \nthose students who are able to attend college often graduate saddled \nwith debt and unable to buy a car or a house.\n  Today we have the opportunity to turn the tide in favor of students \nand ensure a stronger future for our country.\n  The College Cost Reduction and Access Act puts students first, makes \ncollege more affordable, cuts interest rates, helps recent graduates, \nand encourages public service.\n  It also helps to ensure that students today have the same \nopportunities that I had growing up.\n  When I was growing up, my family didn't have a lot. The only way I \nwas able to attend college was through Pell grants and student loans. \nIn fact, because of Pell grants and student loans, all seven kids in my \nfamily were able to get a college education.\n  Today those seven kids are a school teacher, a lawyer, a firefighter, \na homemaker, a computer programmer, a sports writer, and a U.S. \nSenator. In my book that was a great investment.\n  This bill helps a new generation attend college and realize their \ndreams in a variety of ways.\n  First, this bill raises the maximum Pell grant by 25 percent over 4 \nyears to $5,400 per student. That will make a real difference for \nstudents in my home State of Washington.\n  In Washington state, 20 years ago, the maximum Pell grant covered 53 \npercent of the costs at a public, 4-year college. Today it only covers \n33 percent of those costs. By raising the maximum Pell grant, this bill \nwill help students in Washington State and across the country attend \ncollege.\n  For Washington State, this bill will make another $30 million \navailable in need-based grants next year alone. Over 5 years, the bill \nwill provide an additional $333 million for low-income students.\n  This bill will also ensure that college graduates are not trapped by \nhigh loan payments after college. This bill cuts the interest rate on \nFederal loans in half to 3.4 percent for students with subsidized \nloans.\n  It also guarantees that borrowers will not have to pay more than 15 \npercent of their monthly income in student loan payments. This will \nbring immediate relief to students who are burdened with excessive \nloans.\n  Another problem with high student loan debt is that it limits the \ncareer choices of college graduates.\n  Many can't afford to take a job in public service and pay back their \nloans at the same time.\n  This bill encourages public service by providing loan forgiveness for \ngraduates who pursue careers in these areas.\n  As a former teacher, I am also extremely pleased that the TEACH grant \nprogram has been included in this bill.\n  This program will provide $4,000 grants to students who commit to \nteaching in high-need subjects at high-need schools.\n  It is past time that we reward students who are willing to embrace \nthe challenge of working with our country's students who are the most \nin-need.\n  I am also pleased that we were able to increase funding for the \nUpward Bound program which helps more low-income students prepare for \nand attend college. This program is so important for assisting students \nwho may be the first ones in their family to go to college.\n  And I am pleased that minority-serving institutions will see funding \nin the\n\n[[Page S11253]]\n\nform of a $500 million investment contained in this bill.\n  And finally I am especially proud that this bill contains two \nprovisions I worked hard to include that help groups that face other \nunique problems in the college aid process.\n  For our brave men and women in uniform, I worked to include a \nprovision that will allow them to defer their student loan payments \nduring their deployments and as they transition out of service.\n  Currently, the law limits how long servicemembers can defer their \npayments to just 3 years.\n  As we all know, those who are serving our country have enough to \nworry about these days.\n  With deployments as long as 15 months in Iraq, and young dependent \nfamilies left at home, our servicemembers are already facing real \nfinancial challenges.\n  Paying back student loans should not be something weighing on their \nminds as they serve us overseas or as they transition back into \ncivilian life.\n  So this bill lifts this 3-year limit and makes more servicemembers \neligible for student loan deferment and relief.\n  I am also pleased that this bill improves college access for homeless \nand foster care students.\n  These vulnerable students face tremendous barriers in their \neducation--especially those who don't have a parent or guardian who is \nable to guide them through the process.\n  In this bill, I joined with my colleagues to simplify the student aid \napplication process and made homeless and foster students eligible for \nhigher levels of assistance.\n  I really want to thank Senator Kennedy for his leadership in moving \nthis bill forward and making sure it does right by our students. He is \na tireless champion for our young people, and his work is allowing so \nmany more of them to achieve the American dream.\n  To me, this is simple. If we want our economy to grow, our people to \nsucceed, and our country to be strong, we have to help more students \nget a college education. This bill will do just that, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to laud the passage of the \nCollege Cost Reduction and Access Act conference report, which is a \nstrong symbol of our commitment to higher education access and \naffordability. This bill includes key tools and resources to enable \nstudents and families across our Nation to attain the American dream of \na quality education.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Kennedy, Ranking Member Enzi and their \nstaff for their hard work on this important legislation. Their tireless \nefforts have succeeded in making higher education a reality for \nmillions more young people.\n  Specifically, a key component of this legislation is the increase in \ncollege aid by roughly $20 billion over the next 5 years, including the \nmuch needed increase in the maximum Pell grant award. For many years \nnow, one of my top education priorities has been to increase the Pell \ngrant award for college students with the greatest financial need.\n  Twenty years ago, the maximum Pell Grant covered 40 percent of costs \nfor attending a 4-year college in California. Today, it covers just 30 \npercent. This bill helps our students when they start out by increasing \nthe maximum Pell grant award from $4,300 today to $5,100 in fall of \n2008 and $5,400 in fall of 2011. This provision is particularly \nimportant to California, which has over 584,580 Pell grant recipients--\nmore than any other State in the country.\n  The bill also includes a provision which I introduced with Senator \nFeinstein that would remove a barrier, known as the tuition sensitivity \nclause, in the Pell grant system that unfairly prevented students who \nattend lower-tuition colleges from receiving the maximum grant. \nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, the elimination of the \ntuition sensitivity clause will benefit approximately 96,000 students \nin the next academic year and would provide an average Pell grant \nscholarship increase of over $110 per student.\n  The bill also tackles the problem of student loan debt upon \ngraduation. Currently, 46 percent of seniors at 4-year colleges in \nCalifornia graduate with debt, owing on average $15,000 in student \nloans. This bill helps students by capping Federal student loan \npayments at 15 percent of a borrower's discretionary income. The bill \nalso encourages public service by rewarding those who choose to work in \nnursing, teaching, or law enforcement for 10 years by forgiving their \nremaining debt after that time period.\n  I also want to thank Senators Kennedy and Enzi for the consideration \nand adoption of my amendment regarding Upward Bound. Upward Bound seeks \nto capture potential, first-generation college students--many of whom \nare low-income youth--and prepare them for the rigors of college. \nUpward Bound is a fantastic tool for America's youth. These programs \nprovide mentoring, academic tutoring, summer classes, and other \nservices to youth across our Nation to provide them with the resources \nand skills they need to be successful in college.\n  In my home State of California, we have 73 Upward Bound programs that \nserve approximately 5,600 students a year. Due to funding shortfalls, \n186 programs nationwide are in jeopardy of being cut, including 11 \nprograms in California. Four of these programs are in San Bernardino, a \nlow-income area in southern California. These four programs were cut, \nnot because of performance--they actually have proved to be very \nsuccessful and have high program scores--but because of a lack of \nfunding.\n  The conference report also includes the creation of an Asian American \nand Pacific Islander (AAPI) Higher Education Serving Institution \ndesignation, a provision that I and Senator Akaka have championed in \npast. This designation would allow grants and other Federal assistance \nto be awarded to institutions that have a student enrollment of at \nleast 10 percent Asian American and Pacific Islander and has a \nsignificant enrollment of financially needy students. The additional \nfunding would help AAPI-designated institutions to fulfill their \nmissions to assist students to meet their educational goals. The AAPI \ndesignation would apply to approximately 86 colleges and universities \nnationwide, and would apply to approximately 40 schools in California \nalone.\n  I am pleased to strongly support the passage of the College Cost \nReduction and Access Act Conference Report.\n  No one should be denied the opportunity to go to college simply \nbecause of cost. This landmark legislation will help ensure that \nstudents and families across the country have the opportunity and \nfreedom to attend the college of their choice. I strongly believe an \ninvestment in college aid is an investment in our Nation's future--and \nthis bill advances this vision.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to herald the passage of \nthe College Cost Reduction and Access Act. This bill not only helps \nstudents and families better afford higher education, it will \nultimately ensure that our country stays competitive in a global \neconomy. I thank my colleagues Senators Kennedy and Enzi for their \nefforts on this important legislation and congratulate them on bringing \nadditional dollars into the student financial aid system. I also look \nforward to completing the rest of the Higher Education Reauthorization \npackage later this year.\n  The College Cost Reduction and Access Act makes significant steps to \nassist students in several important ways: by increasing student aid, \nespecially the Pell grant; by addressing college debt; by increasing \ncollege access and expanding college preparation programs; by providing \nincentives for teachers to go to the neediest schools; by reforming the \nstudent loan system to benefit students; and by strengthening minority \nserving institutions. We have accomplished all of this without \nincreasing the Federal deficit and actually providing $750 million in \ndeficit reduction. We recapture $20 billion by reforming the student \nlending system in order to invest additional resources into preparing \nour students for the global economy.\n  The annual cost of college is staggering at roughly $13,000 a year to \nattend a public university and $30,000 on average for a private \nuniversity. In Connecticut, 33 percent of family median income is \nneeded to pay for a public college. Thirty three percent even\n\n[[Page S11254]]\n\nafter financial aid is received! At a time when costs for other \nhousehold necessities are rising and incomes are not keeping up, \nfamilies and students are getting priced out of their opportunity to \nattend college.\n  This year alone, it is estimated that 400,000 high school graduates \nwho are prepared and ready to go to a 4-year college will be unable to \ngo because their families cannot afford it. If America is to remain the \nland of opportunity, then we must ensure that college is available to \nall of our citizenry.\n  Not only is paying for an education a daunting task, but the debt \nincurred to complete a higher education is astounding. In Connecticut, \n58 percent of graduating seniors are leaving school with debt, at an \naverage of $19, 440 per graduate. For low-income and moderate income \nstudents the thought of being saddled with a burden of debt prevents \nthem from pursuing higher education at all. Aside from the Federal loan \nprogram, practices in the private lending system have been demonstrated \nto dig our students deeper and deeper into debt.\n  In this bill, we have also strengthened our commitment to recruit \nAmericans to public oriented sectors--public service employees, \nchildcare workers, and many others will be offered loan forgiveness on \ntheir direct Federal loans after 10 years of payments. By capping the \nrepayments of Federal loans at 15 percent of one's discretionary \nincome, this bill will also ensure that students can choose jobs that \nbest suit them, rather than jobs that only pay the bills. Borrowers are \nalso assisted by the interest rates on subsidized student loans being \ncut in half. Over four years, this rate will be reduced from 6.8 \npercent to 3.4 percent. Students will be enabled to pay off debt sooner \nwith less interest due to this provision in the conference report.\n  Students in most need of assistance are the critical focus of this \nbill. I am pleased that minority serving institutions receive an \nadditional $510 million to ensure that their students graduate. The \nUpward Bound program also receives an additional $285 million to \nprepare low-income students for a higher education. In order to ensure \nthat all students are ready to go onto college, the new TEACH program \nprovides incentives for students who agree to teach in high-poverty \nschools or teach high-need subjects.\n  This bill will also allow additional low-income families to \nautomatically claim zero expected family contributions when filling out \nfinancial aid forms. This change will allow students of these from \nlower-income families to be eligible for increased Pell grants. \nFinancial forms themselves will become more user-friendly to provide \nadditional assistance for low-income families in accessing student aid.\n  I am very pleased with the increase in the Pell grant provided in \nthis bill. The maximum Pell grant will be raised to $5,100, in 2008 and \nup to $5,400 by the year 2012. I wish it were much higher, considering \nthe small portion of the cost of public education that a Pell grant \nprovides today. The grant used to cover 80 percent of the average \ntuition, fees, room and board at a public university. Today the Pell \ngrant covers an average of 29 percent. While I continue to advocate for \neven greater increases in the Pell grant, I commend my colleagues for \ntaking steps to get us back to the 80-percent tuition coverage we \nachieved in 1975.\n  I would be remiss if I did not take a moment to talk about the \nprivate student lending market. Until we reach the goal of 80 percent \nof students' tuition being covered by Pell grants and other forms of \nFederal financial aid, many students have been, and will continue to be \nforced to turn to private and direct consumer and student loans, which \nare not guaranteed by the Federal Government and are not subject to \nloan limits.\n  Private student loans are now the fastest growing segment of the $85 \nbillion student loan industry due to rising college cost, Federal \nfinancial aid remaining stagnant and increased demand for a college \neducation. This concerns me for several reasons.\n  The underwriting for private loans is similar to that used for other \nforms of consumer credit. This means that student borrowers, who \nusually have little or no credit history, poor credit scores, or no \nparental cosigner, or whose parents have poor credit histories, will \ntypically pay higher rates than those with good credit histories and \nthose with parental cosigners with good credit. This model runs counter \nto the longstanding Federal purpose of student aid, which is targeting \nlow-cost financial assistance to students with the greatest needs, one \nof the great success stories of our country dating back to the G.I. \nbill in 1944.\n  Earlier this year, at a hearing I convened within the Senate Banking \nCommittee, committee members listened to testimony that detailed \naggressive and questionable marketing practices and other unseemly \nindustry practices, ranging from conflicts of interest to kickback \nschemes to consumer fraud, that have been unveiled by congressional and \nState investigations into the private student loan industry. The issues \nuncovered at that hearing led to legislation, ``The Private Student \nLoan Transparency and Improvement Act of 2007,'' which was marked up \nand approved overwhelmingly by the Senate Banking Committee prior to \nCongress adjourning for the August recess.\n  The ability to pursue a higher education is a fundamental element of \nthe American dream. We must ensure that Americans have options to be \nable to pay for college, and I believe that private lending should be \none of them. But students should have full and timely access to all of \nthe information they need regarding the terms and conditions of private \nstudent loans in order to make a well-informed decision regarding the \nfinancing of their educational needs. Conflict-driven industry \npractices like revenue sharing and cobranding must be prohibited and \nstudent loan underwriting should occur in a manner that does not have a \ndisparate or discriminatory impact on minority borrowers.\n  The legislation we passed within the Banking Committee would \naccomplish many of these important objectives. It requires lenders to \nprovide more accurate and timely information to their customers about \nthe interest rates, terms, and conditions of their products, thereby \nhelping students better understand their financial options and \nobligations. It prohibits documented practices that have harmed \nstudents and families in obtaining the most competitive and affordable \nstudent loans and requires a government review into the extent to which \nprivate student loan underwriting practices may disparately impact \nstudent borrowers and colleges on the basis of factors including race \nand income levels.\n  I believe it is imperative that as we consider inclusion of the \nprivate lending legislation as a complimentary component to the Higher \nEducation Act. We should ensure that this fast-growing market is well \nregulated and remains accessible and affordable as an alternative \nsource of higher education funding for students who need them. I look \nforward to working with the managers of this bill towards that \nimportant goal.\n  The legislation before us will make college more affordable for \nstudents and their families. Reinvigorating our commitment to higher \neducation as we do in this conference report keeps our country moving \nin the right direction. I urge my colleagues to further invest in our \nfuture by completing the Higher Education Act reauthorization before \nthe end of September.\n  Again, I congratulate Senators Kennedy and Enzi and all of my \ncolleagues, including Representative Miller, for providing the most \nsignificant assistance to our students since the G.I. bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming controls 3 \nminutes 44 seconds, and the Senator from Massachusetts has 9 minutes 25 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to be notified by the Chair when I \nhave 3 minutes left.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for those who have been watching this \ndebate and discussion, we just want to underline one fundamental and \nvery important concept and principle: that the $20 billion which is \nincluded in this legislation--which is going to be used in the ways we \nhave described earlier\n\n[[Page S11255]]\n\ntoday, with the Pell grants, with the loan forgiveness for students who \nwant to go into public service careers, for some relief for the middle \nclass--not a nickel of that is taxpayers' money. That comes out of the \nlenders' pot of resources, which many of us believe is overly generous \nto the lenders. That is another issue. When we have time after the vote \nat 10:15, we will have some opportunity to develop that issue. But this \nis a transfer of $20 billion from the lenders for help and assistance \nto the students. There is no question about any of that. That is No. 1.\n  Importantly, as we are coming close now to the time where we are \ngoing to be voting on this issue, I am very mindful of those \nmagnificent words of Nelson Mandela, one of the great heroes of the \ncentury, certainly of our generation. On the occasion he was asked \nabout education, he said the most important weapon for change in the \nworld is education. That is something those of us who are strong \nsupporters of this proposal believe in. It was said, in my time, by \nPresident Kennedy, and also by President Lyndon Johnson, that no \nAmerican, no qualified student should be denied--should be denied--a \ncollege education because of cost.\n  That is a concept. That is a value. I would think all of us on this \nside of the aisle believe that very deeply, and many on the other side \nof the aisle. We would not have made the progress we have made over \nrecent years unless we had that kind of a commitment.\n  We have drifted from that kind of commitment, that ideal that was set \nby Mandela, that was understood by John Adams when he wrote of the \nimportance of educating the common citizenry in the Constitution of \nMassachusetts. No state constitution has a more detailed ideal \nestablished in its constitution about educating the public than the \nMassachusetts Constitution, written by one of the greatest of our \nFounding Fathers.\n  It was understood by Horace Mann when he established the public \nschool system--the importance of education, the importance of education \nin terms of opportunity and promise and hope. It was understood by \nAbraham Lincoln in the height of the Civil War when he established the \nland-grant colleges to help and assist the education of citizens all \nover this Nation. It was understood by Abraham Lincoln, understood by \nDwight Eisenhower, when this Nation was challenged by Sputnik in the \nlate 1950s and the development of the National Defense Education Act, \nunderstood by Franklin Roosevelt with the GI bill that has been \navailable for more than 60 years starting with a generation that fought \nin World War II.\n  If you take the total cost of that GI bill that was expended--and as \nmost economists have pointed out, there was a $7 return for every $1 \ninvested in education, $7 returned for the cost of education. Talk \nabout expending resources, talk about national priorities, this was the \nprogram that built the middle class in this country. This was the \nprogram that made America great.\n  Now we have the opportunity again to follow the wise counsel and \njudgment of some of the great philosophers--Nelson Mandela and John \nAdams--in our time and in our generation to renew that commitment. This \nbill is a downpayment for it.\n  I agree with my friend from Wyoming, we have to go ahead and do the \nreauthorization. We will do it. We are strongly committed to doing it. \nWe have passed a bill here in the Senate, and the chairman of the House \ncommittee has committed that the House committee will do it, and then \nwe will finish it together.\n  But this is an opportunity. This is the downpayment. This is not \ngoing to be the only action that is going to be taken by us in our \ncontinued march toward progress in terms of the education and hope for \nyoung people. Not all the problems are going to be resolved. Not all \nthe problems are going to be solved. This is a downpayment.\n  When we look at the priorities of education at other times, we have \nto wonder why we are even having a debate on this issue--and why we are \njust talking about $20 billion. If you take what was expended on \neducation, on investing in the GI bill over the period of the GI bill, \nit was a third of the total budget. If we spent now on education what \nwe spent then, we would be spending 130 billion dollars--not $20 \nbillion. Imagine that. $130 billion it would be, and we are only \ntalking about $20 billion. We were spending at that time all of that--\nfor what?--for educating the young people. Is there anyone in here who \nwould say that was a mistake? Find the Members of the Congress or the \nSenate who said we have spent too much in terms of investing in the \neducation of the children in our country.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Find me that person. I remember being on the floor of \nthe Senate when we had strong voices in opposition to the Pell grants, \nto Stafford loans back in the early 1960s. I do not hear those voices \ntoday. I do not hear those voices today. Why? Because we know when it \nis done well, and it is done right--and it has not always been, but in \nthis case it is, in terms of the Pell grants, in terms of the loan \nforgiveness, in terms of some help and assistance and relief for \nmiddle-class families--it will make an important difference.\n\n  When we hear the eloquence of some of our colleagues and about the \ndifference it has made for their education--whether it is Dick Durbin, \nwhether it is Maria Cantwell, who talks about the difference it has \nmade in her family, whether it is Patty Murray, who said all seven \nmembers of her family had help and assistance in terms of student \nloans, and all of those people are professional people today, paying \ntaxes, repaying whatever those kinds of loans are.\n  Let's think about what this issue is about. This is about hope. This \nis about our future. This is about progress in America.\n  Finally, this is the kind of investment we need if we are going to \ndeal with the challenges and problems of global competition. We will \nhave a chance to go into this in greater detail after the vote this \nmorning, but we need these kinds of investments, and the kind of \ninvestments we have in the reauthorization bill in terms of teachers \nand the kinds of investments we had in the COMPETE Act that was passed \nin a bipartisan way earlier this year. We need this in order to stay \ncompetitive in the global economy, to make sure America's economy is \nthe strongest. We need this investment in terms of our national \nsecurity to make sure we are going to have the men and women who are \ngoing to be able to defend this Nation and use the various kinds of \ntechnologies that are developed.\n  Finally, we need this investment in order to have a well-trained and \neducated citizenry who are going to be able to breathe life into the \ninstitutions our Framers established. That is what we are talking \nabout. We are not going to achieve all of that with this legislation, \nbut it is going to be a meaningful and ongoing and continuing \ncommitment, and one that all of us who are supporting this proposal \nrecognize as something that must be followed up on and strengthened and \nshaped as we move forward.\n  Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The senior Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I am always a little disconcerted that what the \nAmerican public gets to watch is the debate on the Senate floor. This \nis not where we get most of the work done. This is not where there is \nagreement. This is where there is the disagreement and the branding of \nthe different parties. It is important, but it is not what gets things \ndone.\n  We have a bill before us today, and the Senate-passed reconciliation \nbill had a vote of 78 to 18. And we had some of these same discussions. \nThose discussions are important. As the only accountant in the Senate, \nI am appalled by the way we score bills around here, the way we come up \nwith the different provisions, the different arguments that get made on \nthe floor. But I would say the provisions of this conference report \nclosely parallel many of the provisions in the Senate-passed bill.\n  There were clearly compromises made in reaching agreement on the \nconference report. We can point to things in the conference report that \nare there because of Republican and Democratic sponsors. In the end, it \nis a\n\n[[Page S11256]]\n\nproduct where the benefits to students outweigh the reservations that \nsome of us may have.\n  Over 55 percent of the savings are dedicated to increasing the Pell \ngrant award. In the next 5 years, low-income undergraduate students \nwill see the maximum Pell grant award increase by more than $1,000. We \nwill see who all takes credit for that, but that is what the bill does, \nand it will take people from both parties to get it passed. We increase \nthe income protection allowance so students are not penalized for \nworking and saving for college. The unique role that our not-for-profit \nlenders have in providing information and services to students has been \nrecognized.\n  But at the end of the day, we must still reauthorize the Higher \nEducation Act. Reconciliation is such a small part, and we cannot leave \nout the other part or we will close the door on our students. We have \nto reauthorize the Higher Education Act that provides the FAFSA \nsimplification, year-round Pell, financial and economic literacy, \nbetter college cost information, and improvements in outreach and \nstudent support service programs such as GEAR UP and TRIO, in which all \nof us have an interest.\n  We have passed eight extensions of the Higher Education Act, starting \nin 2004. The current extension expires on October 31. How much longer \ndo we have to wait? My goal is to not have a ninth extension on the \nHigher Education Act. My goal is to debate and pass a higher education \nreauthorization conference report. I look forward to working with \nSenator Kennedy and the House to get this accomplished, or else no \nmatter how you slice it, the biggest piece of higher education is left \nundone.\n  I will have more comments to make on the accounting on these \ndifferent things as we get into further debate after the vote. We did \nagree to a 10:15 vote, and I want to stick to that. I have a lot of \npeople I would like to thank. I will also save that for later. I \nbelieve my time has expired.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired. All \ntime has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nis a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the Senator \nfrom Arkansas (Mrs. Lincoln), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) \nare necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nDelaware (Mr. Biden) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nwould each vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Idaho (Mr. Craig), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), and the \nSenator from Kansas (Mr. Roberts).\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Monday, \nSeptember 10, at 10 a.m., the Senate proceed to executive session to \ndebate en bloc Executive Calendar Nos. 238, 239, and 241; that there be \n60 minutes for debate on the nominations equally divided between \nSenators Leahy and Specter or their designees; that at 11 a.m., the \nSenate proceed to vote on Calendar No. 238, followed by a vote on \nCalendar No. 239, followed by a vote on Calendar No. 241; that the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table, the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then return \nto legislative session; that Senator Barrasso be recognized to speak in \nmorning business--as a side note, this is his maiden speech in the \nSenate--for up to 30 minutes, following which the Senate begin \nconsideration of H.R. 3074, the Transportation appropriations bill.\n  I will also say, while the distinguished Republican leader is \npresent, we are going to complete the Transportation bill next week. \nThe last vote next week will be at about 1 o'clock, no later than 1 \no'clock because of the beginning of the Jewish holiday at sundown.\n  I have talked with the distinguished Republican leader, and we have \nsome items we are going to look to on September 17 and 18. On September \n17, there will be no votes. On September 18, there will be votes. We \nare going to try to develop--we have not done it yet; I have had a \nnumber of conversations with the Republican leader--as to how we \nproceed on the Iraq matters. We need to finish the Defense \nauthorization bill. We want to make sure there is time to adequately \ndebate that measure. But we also want to again address the Iraq \nsituation. We have people, as I speak, trying to work out something \nthat will be different from what we have done in the past. I hope that \ncan be done, something on a bipartisan basis. We still may have to do \nthe partisan matters. But, hopefully, Senators working together can \ncome up with some way we can proceed on that issue. We are not there \nyet.\n  I want to alert everyone that during the week of September 17, we are \ngoing to have to do a lot of work on Defense authorization and also the \nIraq matters. We hope we can complete the bill that week. Again, we are \nnot at a point where we are near able to work out a unanimous consent \nagreement on that measure, but I have kept the minority advised about \nevery step we have taken in this regard.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, and I will not be \nobjecting, I want to underscore that the speech to which the majority \nleader referred will be the maiden speech of our new Senator from \nWyoming, Mr. Barrasso. That will be Monday. I look forward to hearing \nwhat he has to say.\n  Also, the majority leader indicated we will be discussing the way \nforward on our next Iraq debate, how to structure it in a way that is \nfair to all interested parties. The majority leader and I will be \ncontinuing to discuss that matter in the coming days.\n\n[[Page S11257]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Who yields time? The senior Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments, first, to \nthank all of our colleagues for the overwhelming, bipartisan support \nfor the conference report. This exceeded the vote we had earlier on our \neducation measures, and we also had a number of absentees today who \nindicated favorable support for the legislation. This is a very \nimportant statement about where we are as a country in terms of the \neducation issue. This ought to be reassuring for the students, parents, \nand families of our country.\n  Again, I am immensely grateful to my colleague and friend, Senator \nEnzi. Without his strong support in the shaping of both the \nreauthorization legislation and this legislation, we certainly would \nnot be here. He spoke very eloquently and well about the importance of \nthe reauthorization. It is a viewpoint which I share for the reasons he \nhas outlined. The simplicity of the financial aid application is key. \nWe have 400,000 young people who are qualified for college but who do \nnot go to college. Many do not go to college because they cannot work \ntheir way through those ten pages of an extremely complex, difficult \nquestionnaire, and they do not have the support systems to assist them. \nThis reauthorization will assist not only in the simplification of the \nFAFSA that Senator Enzi personally took a great deal of time with, as \nwell as Senator Reed, but also with regard to teachers in underserved \nareas and the transparency provisions that will help parents understand \nthe costs of various universities.\n  The legislation has a number of noteworthy features that the Senator \noutlined in his statement. With this strong vote, we want to give \nassurance that we look forward to working eagerly with the House to \nmake sure we have a successful passage; doing so will maximize the \nimpact of this legislation we just passed.\n  We will certainly work on the issue of college cost reduction and \nhigher education access. And we have a number of other education issues \nwe are working on as well. We understand the importance of the \nreauthorization of the Head Start Act and the provisions dealing with \nearly education. We understand the importance of reforms of K-12, the \nimportance of tying in kindergarten into the early grades. We \nunderstand the importance of getting well-trained teachers in \nunderserved areas, the importance of parental involvement, the \nchallenges out there with regard to disabled students, the challenges \nso many students are facing in terms of limited English-speaking \ncapabilities, and the issues around accountability and growth models. \nThere are a lot of complex issues, but we certainly want to wrestle \nwith those and eventually have, as a result of working together in our \ncommittee, a seamless web of progress in the education systems in our \ncountry. That is certainly our intention. We are well down the road \nwith the actions that have been taken today.\n\n  I wish to mention a few of these items we have in the legislation. \nBefore I do, I wish to personally mention the individuals who worked \nlong and hard on this measure. I failed to do it during the earlier \npresentation when we were under more limited time, but, as I think \nSenator Enzi knows very well, we have been blessed with an \nextraordinary group of individuals who work long and hard. Much of the \nlegislation--the authorization and also the general format of a good \ndeal of what we have done today--has been in the works for a number of \nyears. It did not just happen this year. The authorization legislation \nwe passed basically had the name of Senator Enzi on it before the \nchanges that took place in the elections. We have been working very \nhard. We have been enormously blessed by an extraordinary group of men \nand women who have worked with us. These are complex, difficult issues \nwith incredible implications.\n  We have on our Education Committee a membership that is very involved \nand engaged on education issues. All of them have ideas. One of the \nthings that makes that committee so interesting is that we have an \nenormous number of ideas and suggestions, and it has taken a good deal \nof time to try to work with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nand then with the House. That was achieved.\n  I will certainly mention some of those who have done such an \nextraordinary job, and we are very much in their debt. Obviously, we \nare all honored to serve as Members of this institution, but those who \nhave worked on this legislation should take a great deal of \nsatisfaction in the difference they have made though shaping this \nlegislation, because they have played an indispensable role, and we \nvalue very much their continued contribution.\n  On my staff I would like to thank Michael Myers, who has been the \nchief of staff of our HELP Committee, Carey Parker, a longtime friend \nand legislative assistant, Carmel Martin, Missy Rohrbach, Erin Renner, \nand J.D. LaRock. We have Emma Vadehra, Nick Bath, David Johns, Raquel \nAlvarenga, Liz Maher, Lily Clark, Jennifer Fay, Ches Garrison, Scott \nFay, Melissa Wagoner, Dave Ryan, and Jay McCarthy.\n  This has been a bipartisan process all the way. I would also like to \nthank Senator Enzi's wonderful staff, specifically Katherine McGuire, \nIlyse Schuman, Greg Dean, Beth Buehlmann, Ann Clough, Adam Briddell, \nAmy Shank, and Kelly Hastings.\n  I also thank MaryEllen McGuire, Taneisha Woods, and Jeremy Sharp of \nSenator Dodd's staff; Rob Barron, Ellen Murray, and Mark Laisch of \nSenator Harkin's staff; Robin Juliano and Chris Fick of Senator \nMikulski's staff; Michael Yudin of Senator Bingaman's staff; Kathryn \nYoung of Senator Murray's staff; Seth Gerson of Senator Reed's staff; \nMildred Otero and LaToya Johnson of Senator Clinton's staff; Steve \nRobinson of Senator Obama's staff; Huck Gutman of Senator Sander's \nstaff; and Will Jawando of Senator Brown's staff.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Reid's staff, Randy DeValk, Gary \nMyrick, and Jason Unger, and his outstanding floor staff without whom \nnone of us could do our jobs, Marty Paone, Lula Davis, Tim Mitchell, \nand Trisha Engle.\n  I thank especially Senator Conrad and his staff. Without them, there \nis no way we could have completed this bill. So thank you, Mary Naylor, \nJoan Huffer, Lisa Konwinski, and Robin Hiestand.\n  And I would like to thank Liz Engel of the Democratic Policy \nCommittee.\n  I would also like to thank David Cleary of Senator Alexander's staff; \nAllison Dembeck of Senator Gregg's staff; Celia Sims of Senator Burr's \nstaff; Glee Smith of Senator Isakson's staff; Karen McCarthy of Senator \nMurkowski's staff; Juliann Andreen of Senator Hatch's staff; Suzanne \nSingleterry of Senator Allard's staff; Alison Anway of Senator Roberts' \nstaff; and Matt Blackburn of Senator Coburn's staff, all of whom put in \nmany hours to make this bill a reality.\n  As always, we worked closely with Chairman Miller's staff, and I \nwould like to thank them as well. Mark Zuckerman, Alex Nock, Gaby \nGomez, Julie Radocchia, Jeff Appel, and Stephanie Moore all worked \ntremendously hard, and Chairman Miller is lucky to have them.\n  I would also like to thank the Parliamentarian, Alan Frumin, and \nAssistant Parliamentarians Elizabeth MacDonough, Peter Robinson, and \nLeigh Hildebrand for their assistance throughout the process.\n  More than most, this bill has required significant help and \nassistance from the Congressional Budget Office, and I would like to \ngive them a special thanks. Paul Cullinan, Deborah Kalcevic, and Justin \nHumphrey have put in tremendous work--nights and weekends and \neverything in between--to model and estimate the budgetary effects of \nthe complex provisions in this bill, and all the many iterations and \nchanges that the committee considered. I don't know what we would do \nwithout them. We certainly wouldn't have been able to move this \nlegislation as expeditiously as we did.\n  I would also like to thank Mark Koster, Kristin Romero, and Amy \nGaynor in the Senate Legislative Counsel's Office, as well as Steve \nCope and Molly Lothamer in the House Legislative Counsel's Office, who \nalso worked nights and weekends to assist in drafting the language and \nworking out technical issues in the bill.\n\n[[Page S11258]]\n\n  Finally, I would like to thank members of the education team at the \nCongressional Research Service--Adam Stoll, Charmaine Mercer, Jeff \nKuenzi, and Dave Smole, whose expertise was invaluable throughout this \nprocess.\n  I wish to take a few moments to highlight briefly, once again, in \ngreater detail, what the conference report will do. I outlined in the \nearlier presentation the highlights and the reasons for the \nlegislation, but for a few minutes I wish to once again remind those \nwho are interested in the benefits the legislation provides for all the \nborrowers.\n  It is a historic increase in the need-based grant aid--the greatest \nincrease since the GI bill. That helps the neediest students. We talked \nearlier about how we should set as a goal not to let a single qualified \nstudent lose the opportunity to get a college education because of \ncost. We still have a long way to go. We recognized earlier in the \ndebate that the cost of college has gone up extraordinarily. But at the \nsame time, grant assistance has basically stabilized or gone down in \nreal terms, and the earning power of the middle class has been level or \nhas fallen slightly over the period of recent years.\n  So in this legislation we have tried to provide real assistance on \nthe issue of burden in the percentage of repayment. We have done, I \nthink, a first-rate job in setting better repayment options that cap a \nborrower's monthly payment at 15 percent of their monthly discretionary \nincome. We have included loan forgiveness for borrowers in public \nservice jobs, and protection for working students by not penalizing \ntheir earnings. So many of these students go out and work, and work \nhard, to earn a little money, and yet then they are outside the \neligibility to benefit from some of important grants in terms of \nassistance. So we have addressed that issue. And we have provided \nmatching grants to States to improve college access.\n  We cut interest rates--I was referring to that earlier--on new \nundergraduate subsidized loans from 6.8 to 3.4 percent by 2011.\n  We provide for scholarships of $4,000 per year for high-achieving \nstudents who commit to teaching high-need subjects in high-need \nschools. We didn't emphasize or stress that during the early \npresentation. This is one of the great and important provisions in this \nlegislation. I think we all understand we need a well-trained teacher \nin every classroom in America, and we need well-trained teachers in \nparticular in inner-city schools and also in rural and underserved \ncommunities. We need them to have the skills to serve, so we provide \nsome important assistance to that end.\n  Senator Enzi mentioned in the reauthorization that we provide other \nkinds of incentives for schools and colleges to also move in that \ndirection.\n  We support the Historic Black Colleges and other minority-serving \ninstitutions, such as Hispanic serving institutions and tribal colleges \nand universities. We increase funding for the Upward Bound Program to \nprovide tutoring and other support to help disadvantaged students \nprepare for, apply to, and succeed in college. I will show why that \nmeasure is so important in a moment.\n  And we provide these benefits--all of these benefits--at no cost to \nthe taxpayer by reforming the student loan industry so that it works \nfor students and not the banks. That is the basic concept.\n  As we mentioned during the course of the earlier discussion, we \nprovide loan forgiveness to graduates in public service. This chart \nmentions the various professions in which individuals can be involved \nto gain that kind of opportunity. They can be in public safety, law \nenforcement, public education, early childhood education, child care, \npublic health--with all the Public Health Service agencies; or they can \nbe working with special needs children and the disabled community, \nwhich is enormously important; the elderly, and the frail elderly--\nincreasingly a challenge for our country; public interest law--these \nare all the public defenders and legal services attorneys, as well as \nprosecutors; public libraries; nonprofit organizations; or teaching \nfull time at a tribal college or university.\n\n  I mentioned earlier the article in Time magazine this week that talks \nabout the attitudes of students in colleges all over this country, and \nthat it is the desire of so many of these young people to be involved \nin public service and to help respond to the needs in their \ncommunities. They want to be part of the solution, not part of the \nproblem. So often, because of their indebtedness, they have to choose \ncareers in order to deal with the indebtedness. So this legislation \nwill open up or help us take advantage of that idealism that is out \nthere. We are giving them a pathway to making a difference in terms of \nthe future of our country, and I think that is enormously important. \nThat is one of the most important parts of this legislation. We have \ntried to work on it, and I think it will be very important.\n  I might give a quick example of how the loan forgiveness works. A \nstarting teacher in my State, making a salary of $35,400, has an \naverage debt of about $18,100. Under the loan forgiveness plan, where \nhe or she would not pay more than 15 percent of their disposable \nincome, they will save $730. If they continue to work as a public \neducator, more than half of their indebtedness will be forgiven after \nthe required period of their service.\n  If you take a similar situation, this is a police sergeant with a \nchild in Arkansas, making an annual salary of $28,200, with a debt of \n$17,000. This will help save him or her $1,100 a year in terms of \nrepayment. At the end, if he or she stays in law enforcement for ten \nyears, $14,800 of the $17,000 debt will be forgiven. $14,800 of the \n$17,000 debt if they stay working in law enforcement.\n  So this gives you a good illustration about the loan forgiveness.\n  As was mentioned earlier, the higher education reauthorization bill, \nwhich Senator Enzi referred to, addresses rising costs by requiring \ncolleges to publicize college cost information. This is a real problem. \nParents have a difficult time understanding what the real costs are. \nThere are fees and more fees--tuition, room and board. I was absolutely \nstartled when the daughter of a very good friend of mine, attending one \nof our finest colleges, indicated to me the cost of the schoolbooks for \ngoing on to college--over $100 for a freshman schoolbook in a rather \ngeneral subject matter. These are surprises that you are faced with; \nthe several hundred dollars additionally that people are unaware of.\n  I know some of our colleagues have talked about this and we are \ncertainly aware of this challenge and so we are going to try to see \nwhat we can do to help provide some assistance there.\n  Reforms to the student loan system will ensure that colleges are \nrecommending lenders based on the best interest of their students. \nThose are the ethical provisions we have added as a result of the \ninvestigations received broad support in this from the colleges and \nuniversities. Many of them were stunned by what has been happening, and \nthey have been enormously cooperative and helpful.\n  And I want to talk about simplifying the financial aid form. I give \ngreat credit to Senator Enzi and Senator Reed on this. They have \nsimplified this form from an enormously complicated ten pages of \nquestions to just two pages of essential questions. That will make a \nbig difference.\n  This strengthens GEAR-UP and TRIO to improve preparation for higher \neducation. The record of these programs has been extraordinary in terms \nof providing the bridge for many of those who come from disadvantaged \nbackgrounds to get them started into college, and in terms of giving \nthem the assistance and the followup so they will need complete their \nhigher education.\n  Then, also, the reauthorization reforms and improves our teacher \npreparation programs. Teachers are the backbones of our schools, and \nthe bill will promote high-quality teacher preparation programs, and \nrecruit good teachers to teach in high-need schools--where they are \nneeded most.\n  So those are some of the essential elements in the reauthorization.\n  As we said earlier, we are investing more here in the Pell grant. \nHere, I have the chart of what has happened in terms of the failure to \nincrease the Pell grant to keep up with the cost of college. This \ndemonstrates where we are going with one very important aspect, and \nthat is the assistance in the Pell program. It has remained flat in the \npast. You can look from 2002 all the\n\n[[Page S11259]]\n\nway to 2006, and now we will go to $5,400 by 2012.\n  There has been talk that there had been some increase in Pell, all of \nwhich is true, but that was because there was an increasing number of \npoor students who were eligible for the Pell grant. We have nearly 5 \nmillion more people living in poverty today than in 2000. So we put \nmore money into Pell to cover more students, but that did not keep up \nwith the growth needs for the grant amount. The point being, this is a \nvery important increase in terms of the cost. As the Chair, Senator \nBrown, pointed out, an increase in the cost of universities, a failure \nto provide an increase in grants, and the leveling of salaries of \npeople have made it very difficult for many to pay for college.\n  In my full statement, I point out in a more dramatic form, what is \nhappening in terms of the need for many of these students and that what \nwe are seeing currently in our education system is the increasing \ndivide of America. I think all of us believe, or should believe, that \nif we are going to be one country, with one history and one destiny, we \ndon't want education adding to the separation of a divided nation. It \nought to be bringing the country together--based upon ability, based \nupon hard work and enterprise and a willingness to work and to achieve \nand accomplish. What we have found in our education system now, for a \nnumber of reasons, though unintended, it is working to divide the \ncountry. It should not be. That is a very important issue that we have \ntried to address in a number of different ways in this legislation. I \nbelieve it is very important to do so. We have not emphasized it, \nstressed it that much in our earlier comments, but it is an underlying \ncommitment we have.\n  In my more complete statement, I have reviewed the different ways we \ntried to do this. We are going to continue to work at it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       As I said when we began our debate this morning, our Nation \n     has always looked to education as the pathway to progress and \n     prosperity. After John Adams recognized education as a \n     fundamental right in the Massachusetts constitution, we \n     embraced this view in my home state by creating the first \n     college and first public school in the nation. A few decades \n     later, legendary reformers such as Horace Mann, first \n     recognized that public schools would be the ``great \n     equalizer'' that delivers opportunity for all to fulfill \n     their potential.\n       At the height of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln signed the \n     legislation creating the land-grant colleges and made a \n     commitment on behalf of the nation to the education of the \n     children of our country. During the Industrial Revolution, we \n     rose to the challenge once again. We established free public \n     schools. At the turn of the last century, we founded public \n     high schools to enable the nation to move forward. And after \n     the Second World War, we passed the GI Bill to enable those \n     who served in war to rebuild their lives at home. For every \n     dollar we invested, the Greatest Generation returned $7 for \n     our economic growth.\n       The landmark success of the GI Bill shows us what a \n     difference higher education makes. The bill granted World War \n     II veterans up to $500 each term--the equivalent of $5,600 \n     today. It swung the gates to college wide open--and half of \n     all veterans went through those gates determined to create a \n     new life for themselves and their families. More than five \n     million veterans received vocational education or job \n     training, and more than two million attended college.\n       In 1940, the average GI was just 26 years old and had \n     attended only one year of high school. The bill even enabled \n     many of these GIs, who had served the country so \n     magnificently, to become professionals. In 1957, we were \n     called to action once again. The Soviet Union began a new \n     Space Age with the launch of Sputnik. We rose to the \n     challenge by passing the National Defense Education Act, and \n     by inspiring the nation to land on the moon. We doubled the \n     Federal investment in education.\n       Today, we need a similar bold new commitment to enable the \n     current generation of Americans to rise to the global \n     challenges we face. The Higher Education Conference Report we \n     consider today makes that commitment. Today, we'll help \n     millions of students achieve the American dream by providing \n     $20 billion in new college aid--the biggest increase in \n     student aid since the GI Bill.\n       Just a few weeks ago, the Senate overwhelmingly voted to \n     approve this bill. Let's look at what the Senate bill did:\n       It provided a historic increase in need-based grant aid, by \n     raising the maximum Pell Grant by almost $1,100 over the next \n     5 years, to $5,400 from $4,310 today.\n       It provided new student loan repayment options that allow \n     borrowers to cap their loan payments at 15 percent of their \n     monthly discretionary income.\n       It offered loan forgiveness to borrowers who work for 10 \n     years in a variety of public service jobs. This includes \n     public school teachers, law enforcement and emergency \n     management professionals, social workers, librarians, \n     prosecutors and public defenders, public health doctors and \n     nurses, and child care workers.\n       It protected working students by not penalizing their \n     earnings, by raising the ``income protection allowance'' from \n     $3,000 to $6,000 for dependent students, and increasing it by \n     50 percent for independent students.\n       It initiated a new program that provides matching grants to \n     states so they can provide more college access activities to \n     students.\n       Our Senate bill provided all these benefits at no cost to \n     the taxpayer--by cutting the outrageous subsidies the \n     government gives to lenders. We gave that money to the \n     students, where it belongs. The Conference Report we consider \n     today maintains all these benefits to students. But it does \n     even more for students. In addition to the benefits I've just \n     described, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act:\n       Cuts interest rates on new subsidized Stafford loans for \n     undergraduates from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent by 2011--a \n     step which will help millions of students manage their \n     student loan debt more effectively.\n       It provides scholarships of $4,000 per year to high-\n     achieving college students who commit to teaching high-need \n     subjects like math and science in high-need schools.\n       It provides more than $500 million to support Historically \n     Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving \n     Institutions, and other colleges that serve minority \n     students.\n       It increases funding for the Upward Bound program by more \n     than $200 million, which will help provide tutoring and other \n     support services to help disadvantaged high school students \n     prepare for, apply to, and succeed in college.\n       This is the bold commitment that our students and families \n     deserve, and it couldn't come at a better time. We all know \n     that a college education is more important than ever, but \n     it's never been more expensive. The cost of college has \n     tripled in the last 20 years. Yet, family incomes are not \n     keeping up with rapidly-rising college prices. Last week, the \n     Census Bureau released new data showing that median household \n     income in America increased just seven-tenths of one percent \n     last year. Meanwhile, the cost of college increased 6 \n     percent.\n       In fact, over the last twenty years, the cost of college \n     has increased more than twice as fast as median household \n     income. Since 1986, costs have increased by 216 percent at \n     public colleges, and 208 percent at private colleges. But \n     median household income has gone up just 93 percent over that \n     same time. During the same period, grant aid has not kept up \n     pace with increasing costs.\n       Twenty years ago, the maximum Pell Grant covered 55 percent \n     of costs at a public 4-year college. Today, it covers only a \n     third of those costs. The gap between the maximum Pell grant \n     and the cost of attendance at 4-year public colleges has \n     increased almost $3,500 since 2001-2002. Today the gap is \n     $8,746. For years, under Republican control of Congress, the \n     maximum Pell Grant was stuck near $4,000. Earlier this year, \n     Democrats increased the maximum grant to $4,310. But that's \n     far from enough.\n       Increasing costs and stagnant grant aid are closing the \n     doors to college for many middle-income and low-income \n     students and families.\n       The lowest income students on average have an unmet need of \n     $5,800. Each year, 400,000 students don't attend a 4-year \n     college because they can't afford to do so. It's shameful \n     that low-income students--even those who have worked hard and \n     done well in high school--are less likely to attend and \n     complete college than high-income students. Just one fifth of \n     low-income eighth graders will graduate from college. But 68 \n     percent of high-income students will do so.\n       That's unacceptable.\n       By providing the biggest increase in student aid since the \n     passage of the G.I. Bill, our bill will help close these \n     gaps. Of the $20 billion in college aid that our bill \n     provides overall, $11.4 billion is allocated for additional \n     grant aid. Our bill immediately increases the maximum Pell \n     grant by $500 next year, to $4,800 from $4,310. By 2012, the \n     maximum Pell Grant will increase to $5,400.\n       Who will be helped by this bill? It will help students like \n     Sara, who was a first-generation college student. She \n     graduated from Norfolk State University and earned her \n     Master's degree with the help of the Pell Grant and other aid \n     programs. Sara says that the Pell program helped her family \n     know that a better day was coming for them. This bill will \n     help students like Natalie, from Massachusetts, who's a \n     single mother enrolled in college for the first time. She \n     says that without Pell grants, she ``would be stuck in this \n     way of life, with no `light' to look forward to . . . \n     knowledge is power and education is key.'' More than 5 \n     million students rely on the Pell grant--5 million.\n       This bill provides the help and assistance that millions of \n     Americans need in order to access and afford a college \n     education. This increase in aid is long overdue. But we \n     cannot stop there. Students and families also need our help \n     to manage the crushing burden of student loan debt. As the \n     cost of college continues to rise, the crisis of student loan \n     debt is growing worse. In 1993, fewer than half of all \n     students took out loans to finance their education. But \n     today, more than two-thirds of students borrow for college. \n     Today, the average student leaves college with more than \n     $19,000 in student debt.\n\n[[Page S11260]]\n\n       This mountain of debt is distorting the basic life choices \n     of countless Americans. It's forcing them to delay getting \n     married, delay buying a home, and delay starting a family. \n     It's discouraging many young people from choosing careers in \n     fields such as teaching, social work and law enforcement--the \n     low-paying but vital jobs that bring large benefits to our \n     society. No student should have to mortgage their future in \n     order to pay for higher education. That is why our bill also \n     cuts interest rates in half--to 3.4 percent from 6.8 \n     percent--on new subsidized Stafford Loans for undergraduates, \n     which goes to the neediest students.\n       By cutting the rates in half, we reduce the interest rate \n     on these loans to some of the lowest levels ever in the \n     history of the federal student loan program. These reductions \n     will provide much-needed help to the 5.5 million students who \n     take out subsidized student loans each year. Reducing \n     interest rates will clearly help students. Under a standard \n     10-year repayment plan, a borrower with $18,000 in subsidized \n     loans will have their interest payments reduced by 35 \n     percent, from almost $6,900 to less than $4,500. That student \n     will save almost $2,400 in interest payments. Borrowers who \n     consolidate their subsidized loans will save even more. For \n     example, a borrower with $13,800 in subsidized student loan \n     debt--the average amount--will save $4,400 over the life of \n     their loan.\n       Our income-based repayment plan--which gives borrowers the \n     option of capping their loan payments at 15 percent of their \n     monthly discretionary income--will help save borrowers even \n     more. And when it's combined with our public service loan \n     forgiveness plan, the help we'll provide to students will be \n     truly remarkable. Teachers, emergency management technicians, \n     law enforcement professionals, public health doctors, nurses, \n     social workers, librarians, public interest lawyers, early \n     childhood teachers--and many others--will be eligible for \n     loan forgiveness. Take, for example a starting teacher in \n     Massachusetts who makes a salary of $35,421:\n       If that teacher graduated with the average loan debt for \n     the State--$18,169--he or she will have a monthly payment of \n     $209.\n       Under the income-based repayment plan, that monthly payment \n     would be reduced to $148 instead--$61 less.\n       Over the course of the year, that teacher would pay $732 \n     less than under the standard repayment plan.\n       If the teacher stays in the job for 10 years, the remaining \n     debt would be cancelled altogether--in this case, a benefit \n     of over $10,000. Or let's consider a starting legal services \n     attorney, who makes $36,000 a year:\n       If that student graduated with the average loan debt for \n     lawyers for the State--$51,056--he or she will have a monthly \n     loan payment of $588.\n       Under the income-based repayment plan, those monthly \n     payments would be $259--that's $329 less.\n       Over the course of the year, that legal aid attorney would \n     pay $3,948 less than he or she would have paid under the \n     standard repayment plan.\n       And if the legal aid lawyer stayed in the job for 10 years, \n     the remaining debt would be cancelled--in this case, a \n     benefit of over $50,000. Or let's consider the example of a \n     police sergeant with a child in Arkansas, who makes $28,289 a \n     year:\n       If that sergeant graduated with the average loan debt for \n     students for the Arkansas--$17,000--he or she will have a \n     monthly loan payment of $196.\n       Under the income-based repayment plan, because the sergeant \n     is supporting a child, those monthly payments would be \n     reduced to $97.\n       Over the course of the year, the sergeant would pay $1,185 \n     less than he or she would have paid under the standard \n     repayment plan. And if he or she stayed in law enforcement \n     for 10 years, the remaining debt would be cancelled--in this \n     case, a benefit of over $14,800.\n       Our bill pays for these valuable measures, not by \n     increasing the burden on taxpayers, but by reducing \n     unnecessary subsidies for lenders who take part in the \n     federal student loan programs.\n       Today, thousands of lenders offer college loans. The \n     largest, Sallie Mae, is so profitable that a group of \n     investors recently offered to buy it for $25 billion--more \n     than 40 percent above the value of its stock.\n       The lenders claim that if Congress reduces their subsidies, \n     it won't be profitable for them to make student loans \n     anymore, and they'll leave the business. But when Congress \n     has reduced subsidies in the past, the lenders' profits have \n     still gone up, not down. Here's a chart that Sallie Mae \n     itself produced. It shows that even though Congress has \n     reduced subsidies several times in the past, the company's \n     profits have continued to go up and up. In 2006, Sallie Mae \n     made $1.1 billion in overall profits. Obviously, there's \n     still plenty of room to reduce lender subsidies further.\n       Lenders also claim that if we reduce their subsidies, \n     they'll be forced to reduce the benefits they offer to \n     borrowers on student loans. But what they don't tell you is \n     that many of the benefits they offer are phantom benefits \n     that few borrowers ever receive. According to an independent \n     analysis by Finaid.org, the average borrower saves only $118 \n     through borrower benefits offered by private lenders.\n       By contrast, the Pell grant increase in our bill will \n     provide an additional $2,360 in grant aid over the next four \n     years, which translates to $3,260 in lower loan payments. \n     When fully phased in, the increase will provide an additional \n     $4,360 per student, which means over $6,000 less in loan \n     payments over the life of the loan. If lenders wanted to \n     offer a comparable benefit, they would have to provide over \n     40 times the level of benefits they now provide.\n       Finally, lenders claim that if we cut their subsidies, \n     small lenders will be forced out of the FFEL program, \n     restricting borrower choice and leaving only the big banks in \n     business. Smaller lenders have made this argument before. But \n     when Congress has made sensible cuts in the past, the number \n     of lenders has risen, not fallen. Right now, more than 3,500 \n     lenders make federal student loans--the highest number ever \n     in the history of the student loan program. Let's be clear \n     about what smaller lenders typically do. Most of them simply \n     sell the loans to the larger lenders, soon after the loans \n     are made. That's why the biggest lenders hold so many loans.\n       Lenders will no doubt continue to complain that the cuts in \n     this bill are too deep, but the reality is that our bill \n     restores the balance to this grossly unfair student loan \n     system by directing funds to the students, not to the banks. \n     It will also encourage long-term reform of the student loan \n     system by creating a pilot program in which an auction will \n     be used to see what subsidies are necessary to keep banks \n     involved in the student loan program.\n       For years, the federal government has used auctions to \n     determine prices on everything from broadcast spectrum \n     rights, timber-cutting rights, oil and gas drilling rights--\n     even the price of infant formula delivered through the WIC \n     program. There's no doubt we can use auctions to operate the \n     student loan programs more efficiently. The money we save \n     through this pilot program will be sent back to where it is \n     needed most--to increase access to college for students \n     through a state matching grant program.\n       I also want to reiterate my commitment to the Higher \n     Education Reauthorization bill. Just a few weeks ago the \n     Senate voted unanimously for this bill. It's critical that we \n     complete work on it this year.\n       The reauthorization bill takes steps to ensure that the \n     student loan system is working in the best interest of \n     students, by pursuing needed ethics reforms in the student \n     loan industry.\n       It simplifies the federal financial aid application and \n     delivery process, to ensure that this complex system does not \n     work as a barrier to access for low-income students.\n       It demands that colleges do their part to keep college \n     costs down. If we do our part to provide needed student aid, \n     they must do their part to keep their tuition and fees \n     reasonable.\n       And it reforms and improves our teacher preparation system. \n     Teachers are the backbone of our schools. The reauthorization \n     bill promotes high-quality teacher preparation programs, and \n     helps recruit and retain high-quality teachers in high-need \n     schools.\n       The Higher Education Reauthorization bill goes hand in hand \n     with the legislation before us today. Senator Enzi and I look \n     forward to working with our colleagues in the House to ensure \n     that it is also enacted before the end of this session. For \n     many years, Congress was guided by one clear principle with \n     respect to higher education--that no qualified student should \n     be denied the opportunity to attend college because of the \n     cost. I know how important that principle was for President \n     Kennedy. My brother believed very strongly that if you work \n     hard, study hard, and are accepted to college, you should be \n     able to attend the college of your choice--without regard to \n     cost. That view resonated powerfully with students and \n     families, and it helped create the groundswell that led to \n     the creation of the Higher Education Act of 1965.\n       We've lost sight of that principle in recent years, but \n     with this bill, we will renew it once again. I'm grateful to \n     my colleague Senator Enzi, and to all the Members of our \n     Committee who helped shape this important legislation. \n     Because of their able work, the Senate approved the \n     legislation earlier this summer with a resounding bipartisan \n     vote, and I look forward to final passage of this bill by a \n     similar strong bipartisan majority.\n\n  I again thank all of our colleagues and staff and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, for \nhis great explanation of what is in the bill we just passed. As the \ndebate on this conference report comes to a close, it is necessary to \nthank those who worked long and hard to get us to this point. It has \nbeen a lot of people. I appreciate the extensive list that Senator \nKennedy had.\n  Chairman Kennedy has done a marvelous job of pulling everybody \ntogether, covering very diverse topics, some of them very \ncontroversial, and working through them. What I always like to point \nout to people is that is not always a compromise. Sometimes it is a \nthird way. What we are trying to do is get to a goal. This bill goes a \nlong way toward getting to that goal. I thank him for his commitment to \nnot only moving forward with this bill but to joining me in pressing \nfor the comprehensive higher education reform bill.\n\n[[Page S11261]]\n\n  I would also like to thank everyone on my staff who has worked to get \nus to this point. In particular, I would like to thank Katherine \nMcGuire, who directs the whole operation, all of the different bills we \nare working on. There are actually about 55 in the process, covering \nhealth, education, labor, and pensions.\n  I would like to thank Beth Buehlmann, who has been the education guru \non our side, who has led the team that I have that has helped put \ntogether these different packages in the education area. I have to say, \nour committee covers everything from birth to death because we start \nwith preschool and then we have elementary and secondary education, \nthen we have higher education, then we have continuing education. In \nthis day and age, it is important for people not just to graduate from \ncollege, it is important for them to continue to learn. Of course, \nthere is a direct relationship between how long you continue to learn \nand how long you live. But it is going to be even more important as the \nbaby boomers are retiring that we encourage a lot of them to continue \nin the workforce--perhaps in different jobs than they have ever done \nbefore. So we have a lot of things we need to get done yet that we have \nbeen working on.\n  Head Start is one of those preschool programs we have. We actually \nhandle 69 preschool programs. We need to do some condensing on that so \nwe eliminate some duplication, some excess, and some spending. But Head \nStart has already passed the Senate, it has already passed the House. \nWe are working very carefully to get that finished up now with a \nconference report, and I think we are making good progress on that.\n  On No Child Left Behind, the House has informed us they now have \ntheir draft proposal ready to discuss. We have been working on that in \na very bipartisan way for a long period of time now, going back into \nthe last session of Congress and now into this one. Again, I \ncongratulate Senator Kennedy for the way he has held coffees to bring \nin experts who can clear up, in a more casual atmosphere, some of the \ndifficulties, give us a better understanding and share with us some of \ntheir ideas on how that can be achieved. It has been extremely helpful. \nWe have had meetings with Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon \nfrom the House along with the President and First Lady and the \nSecretary of Education on numerous occasions. Those have been very \nbipartisan.\n  I would be very remiss if I failed to mention the commission that has \nbeen working on No Child Left Behind that provided us with a number of \nproposals, suggestions, advice on what needs to be done to make that \neven more effective. Those have been, again, worked on in a very \nbipartisan way to see which fit with all the other ideas we have. I \nthink we will come up with a plan for that which will improve the \nsystem. It will eliminate some of the feeling that it is just about \nevaluating teachers and will give them more tools to know what their \nstudents are lacking so we do not leave whole groups of children, or \nindividual children, without an education. That is the whole purpose of \nthe program.\n  We are also trying to work in the high school area, where we can \neliminate dropouts and eliminate some of that remedial work which is \nneeded when they get to college. That remedial education costs billions \nof dollars to parents and to taxpayers.\n  Another important piece to this puzzle that we need to do is \ncontinuing education. We have passed unanimously through the Senate, \ntwice over the last 3\\1/2\\ years, the Workforce Investment Act. This is \nan act which would train 900,000 people for higher skilled jobs or \ndifferent jobs than they have held before, so they can retire and do \nsomething different and still be a contributing part of the workforce \nand continue to have revenue coming in. But we have never been able to \nconference that bill. I think that is a crime. We need to get it \nthrough once again, through the Senate, and get it conferenced.\n  I know some of the concerns were what might happen in conference. Now \nit is our side that should have the concerns about what could happen in \nconference because, as we have seen in conference, actually the \nminority can be left out of the process. I hope that would not be the \ncase. But there is a lot of devilment that could be done, and that is \nwhy we didn't get to conference the Workforce Investment Act. I kept \nassuring that would not happen in conference, but now the other side \nshould know for sure that anything they were worried about the \nRepublicans doing in conference will not happen. I will try to convince \nthe Republicans that the Democrats will show equal courtesy and we will \nnot have to worry about what they might do in that bill and we will \nwind up with something that will actually train people to higher \nskilled jobs so we don't have to outsource those jobs to other \ncountries. That is what is happening now. We don't have this training \nprocess to the level of flexibility where it really serves the people \nin the new occupations that are coming up.\n  The kids in school now will undoubtedly have more than a dozen \ndifferent careers. Not different employers; that is real easy--you just \nquit one, move to an another, work essentially the same kind of job. \nThat is not what I am talking about. I am talking about moving to a new \ncareer. Why is that essential? Because a lot of the jobs that are \navailable today will not be available in the future. Out of those 14 \ndifferent occupations that a person will probably have, 9 of them \nhaven't even been invented yet. That is how the world is changing. We \nhave to be sure that the whole education process, from preschool to \ndeath, conforms to the new economy so people in the United States, \ncitizens of the United States are the ones getting the good jobs; that \nwe are not sending them, with the new technology, to other parts of the \nworld. We can do it. We are a very innovative country.\n  This bill we have done today will go a long way to helping in higher \neducation, but what we focused mostly on was just the financing. There \nare a lot of pieces of higher education which go beyond that and which \nthe chairman and I have been emphasizing to the House that they need to \nget done, and we are hoping to have some very firm dates on when they \nwill get that done. This could get into a Presidential election \nsituation if it goes much longer. That probably would not be productive \nfor higher education or our kids, so we need to get it done right away.\n  I have mentioned numerous times the things that have been left out of \nthe reconciliation bill. I will not go back through all of those again, \nalthough I have some great charts, but I would emphasize again that \nneeds to be done.\n  I will mention one area again because this goes back to a story from \nmy earlier days. My first child was applying for college. I had to face \nthis formidable form as an accountant. As an accountant, I have trouble \nunderstanding not only parts of the form but parts of the worksheet. \nThis is a typical Government thing. They give you a worksheet to be \nable to fill in a blank of the final form, and the worksheet is almost \nas difficult as the form. As an accountant, it is a little tough \nsometimes to know what is even supposed to go into the blanks, but that \nis OK because the Government always provides extensive instructions on \nhow you can interpret the blanks you are supposed to fill in. Hopefully \non the new one-page form we have they will not have to refer to \nextensive explanations.\n\n  I think it is pretty clear what we have on the new ones. It is \nsupplemented. Instead of taking pieces off of your income tax form to \nreport on, you already have the form done, so the form can be submitted \nwith it, and that has greater explanation than trying to do all of the \nmath Worksheet B calls for. So we have simplified that greatly. But \nthat is besides the fact that now it is very formidable, and that keeps \na lot of people from ever applying for financial aid.\n  I had the opportunity to fill out one of these when my first child \nwas getting ready to go to college and was picking a fairly expensive \ncollege, and I thought maybe we can qualify for help, and the financial \nofficer said: Yes, I think you probably can; you just have to fill out \nthis little form.\n  We filled it out. We were in the shoe business. We had a single shoe \nstore. It was a family shoe store. My wife and I both worked there, and \nthe kids worked there some of the time, and we had other people who \nworked for us,\n\n[[Page S11262]]\n\ntoo. We were going through all the crises that small businesses today \nhave to deal with, like, how do you afford the insurance for your \npeople? It is not fair to buy insurance for yourself unless you buy \ninsurance for the people who work for you. We were going through a \nnumber of those crises. Anybody in small business knows there are those \ntimes when you wake up in the middle of the night with an ``O my word, \nhow am I going to pay the bills today?''\n  Aside from that, I filled out the form and got the results back and \nthey said: You really don't qualify. There are two essential reasons. \nOne is, if you sold off a fourth of your inventory each year, you \nwouldn't need the help. If you sell off a fourth of your inventory and \nyour child makes it through school in 4 years--which is not standard, \nbut I do want to say all three of my kids did graduate in 4 years--but \nif you sell off one-fourth of your inventory each year, you can afford \nto send your child to college without any financial help.\n  I had to point out to them that if I sold off one-fourth of my \ninventory each 4 years, I would be out of business by the time my child \ngraduated.\n  That is not quite fair, and hopefully we have made some corrections \nso that we won't be putting people out of business in order to get \ntheir kids through college, but we will be expecting them to make \ncontributions to the expense of their education.\n  The other surprise was we had made our kids work. We made them save a \nsubstantial piece of what they earned when they worked so they could \npay part of their way to college. This same financial officer said to \nme: You know, she would have been better off if she had bought a car \nbecause that wouldn't count against her.\n  What kind of incentive is that for the kids in this country? They \nreally will appreciate their education more if they participate in \ntheir education. So I think if we can get that reauthorization part \nthrough, we will protect and incentivize kids to actually work toward \ntheir college education, so it will mean more to them as they go \nthrough, and that will probably cut down a little bit on how long it \ntakes them to get through school because part of that money is theirs. \nI would like to see every kid be able to get an education and have some \nmoney left over when they get their education, not a whole bunch of \nloans. We will be able to help with that by passing this reconciliation \nconference report.\n  I do have some concerns, as everybody does when they pass a bill. I \nam the only accountant in the Senate, so when we look at some of this \nstuff and the way we score things, I do have some difficulties with it. \nWe need to be aware of them because these are going to come back to \nbite us later.\n  One is the chart the Senator from New Hampshire used earlier, which \nshows how scoring works around here, and that is that you can provide \nbenefits, and then if you can end the scoring at a particular point, \nyou can drop off to a zero and show that you fully funded it.\n  It is not going to work that way in reality. I do not know who is \ngoing to be in the majority when we get to 2012. Nobody does. But \nwhoever is in the majority at 2012 has to figure out how to fill the \ngap of the dip in the chart, as well as take care of the inflation that \nhas happened in the meantime, and, hopefully, greater Pell grants as a \nwhole, in reality, at that point in time.\n  Why am I concerned about this? Well, we have done some things with \ninterest rates over a period of time that have had some of these same \neffects on students. We always try to figure out how we can get the \nlowest interest rate for kids who are going to college. And that is \nimportant. And a number of Senators, including the Presiding Officer, \nhave pointed out the importance of that.\n  Well, we got involved in interest rates actually when President \nCarter was in office, and interest rates rose to 18 percent and were \ngoing higher, and did go higher. We had no idea how much higher. We had \nno idea whether they would ever come down again.\n  So Congress got involved with student loans and said: 6.8 percent is \nthe highest that anybody is going to pay while they go to college, and \nwe did kind of put some ends on that. In the meantime, of course, \ninterest rates came back down. We went to variable rates, which allowed \nthe Government to fluctuate more on interest rates. But each time, it \nbecomes a problem for whoever is in the majority because you can pin \nthe difficulty on them and say: `You have got to solve it. And no \nmatter what solution you come up with, we are not going to like it, and \nwe are going to make it into a campaign issue.'\n  Well, I hope we do not do that all of the time. But it is important \nfor people to realize that we are cutting the interest rates in this \nreconciliation bill we just did, and we are going to get them down to \n3.4 percent. But that is over a period of time. So students who are in \ncollege and just heard the discussion should not expect to go get a \nloan--or as soon as the President signs the bill--at 3.4 percent. That \ngets phased in. It will get down to 3.4 percent. But then it ends, and \nwe run into the same situation that I pointed out a minute ago; that \none party or the other is going to be in the majority at that time, and \nthey are going to have to solve that problem of how we keep the \ninterest rate at 3.4 percent or lower, or match up to higher rates, \nbecause they all have a cost.\n  Now, how does that cost get handled? Well, it does not make a whole \nlot of difference to the banks because we subsidize them up to a level, \nand we change that from time to time too. The subsidy is what we have \nbeen talking about in this reconciliation bill. You can offer this \nlower rate to the students, and then we will provide a subsidy so that \nyou make a reasonable rate of return. Now, we always have a little \ntrouble deciding what that reasonable rate of return is, and that is \nwhat we are talking about.\n  Two years ago, we cut that subsidy, and we cut it pretty severely and \nmade billions in savings off of cutting that corporate subsidy.\n  Now, at that time what we did is put half of the savings in the \nsubsidy, which actually comes from the taxpayers,--You have got to \nunderstand that it is from the taxpayers that we are doing this--but we \ntook half of that and we put it to deficit reduction, which is kind of \na return to the taxpayers.\n  We took the other half and did a number of things for students. We \ndecreased loan origination fees to 0 percent. We put $8 billion into \nspecialized kinds of Pell grants, which were the SMART and American \nCompetitiveness Grants for science, technology, engineering, math, and \nsome critical foreign languages. That is a real need for this country.\n  If we do not address that need, we are going to have some difficult \neconomic times in this country. So we said we have to get more young \npeople involved in science, technology, engineering, and math. And we \ntook care of the college portion of that, encouraging them with a \nsmaller amount their freshman year, and then a little bit bigger in \nsophomore year, and a lot bigger in their junior and senior years if \nthey would do science, technology, engineering, and math. That came to \n$8 billion.\n  We also increased loan limits for freshmen and sophomores. We \nincreased asset protection, and we increased auto zero to $20,000. That \nis the income level up to which you automatically get a full Pell \ngrant. So we did a number things with the money for students. At that \npoint in time we were criticized for a lot of things we did not do for \nstudents that could have been done, just as there will be criticism \nwith this bill for things that could or could not be done.\n  I do think we arrived at a good solution, one that will work, one \nthat I am hopeful and pretty sure the President is going to sign, that \nwill make a difference for young people. But I do want to emphasize \nthat we do need to finish that reauthorization package. Without that, a \nlot of this does not work. It sounds good, but it does not work. So \nlet's get the whole job done.\n  Since 2004, we have extended the Higher Education Act eight different \ntimes. We have said: `What we have now is good enough, so we cannot \nreach any other kind of a decision. So let's just extend it again.' I \ndo not want to have a ninth extension. I want to get the job done.\n  There are some great things. We have hundreds of pages. The bill is \nthat thick, for reauthorization, that does good things for students. \nThis is the part we are talking about we have not done yet. This has \nstuff in it that needs to be done, and we can do it.\n\n[[Page S11263]]\n\n  The agreement in the Senate on this was 95 to 0. You don't get more \nbipartisan than 95 to 0. I am pretty sure if the other five people \nwould have been here, it would been 100 to 0. That is agreement. That \nis because this desperately needs to be done. I am glad the House is \ngoing to take a look at it. In fact, the chairman told me that they \nwould be using this bill as a blueprint.\n  I assured him if he used that as a blueprint and took the wording \nthat goes with it, it can be done reasonably. Around here we usually do \nnot do that sort of thing, though, because each of us has to get a \nfingerprint on everything, and that slows down the process sometimes. \nBut I suspect it will be fairly close to what we have done here. It \nneeds to be done as soon as possible.\n  Now, I began my thank-yous earlier. I want to finish my thank-yous \nand my speech. Besides Katherine McGuire and Beth Buehlmann on my \nstaff, I wanted to thank Ann Clough, Adam Briddell, Amy Shank, Ilyse \nSchuman, Greg Dean, and Kelly Hastings.\n  I would be very remiss if I did not thank the members of Senator \nKennedy's staff for their hard work and cooperation: Michael Myers, \nCarmel Martin, JD LaRock, Missy Rohrbach, and Erin Renner.\n  Finally, I would like to thank all of the members of the HELP \nCommittee and their staffs for their hard work throughout this process. \nThis has been one of the most contentious committees in years past. \nWhen we are working on education and health, this is one of the most \ncooperative committees in the Senate.\n  We do intend to make progress in all four of the areas that we work \nin. We got the pensions area pretty well wrapped up last year. There \nhas been a little technical correction portion that we have to get done \nyet.\n  There are always different things in the pension area. But we made \nsome significant changes in the labor area last year, too, that have \ncome to light in recent weeks with the first change, the biggest change \nin mine safety in 28 years. We will be reviewing the tragedy that \nhappened in Utah to see how that fits in with what we did or did not \nget accomplished and will look at future changes.\n  But it took us 28 years to make the first major change. It will not \nhurt if it gets to 24 or 28 months before we get the reports in that \nhelp us to analyze any other changes that we need to make.\n  Once again, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, \nfor his tremendous effort, his tremendous knowledge, his capabilities \nto explain and come through with the ideas, sometimes compromises, but \nquite often a third way of doing things. It makes a huge difference in \nthe result.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/07/senate-section/article/S11263-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO PAUL CAHILL AND WARREN PAYNE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I pause for a moment today, with \nthousands from across the country who have gathered in Boston, to \nremember the lives of two of our Massachusetts firefighters, Paul \nCahill and Warren Payne, who were laid to rest yesterday and today in \nWest Roxbury and Dorchester. A week ago, Warren and Paul, lost their \nlives in heroically combating a 4-alarm fire in West Roxbury. We \nproudly honor the memory of these two heroes who gave their lives so \ncourageously and unselfishly in the line of duty. We are deeply \ngrateful for their service, and we mourn their loss.\n  Paul Cahill was 55 and a father of three children. He had previously \nserved in the U.S. Navy and he joined the Boston Fire Department in \n1993.\n  Warren Payne was 53, and a father of two children. He had been a \nfirefighter for 19 years, and was not scheduled to be on call that \nnight, but he had agreed to help a friend.\n  Both Paul and Warren were men of immense bravery and dedication, and \nwere committed to the lives and the well-being of their community. Each \nday they served our city, they were ready to place themselves on the \nfront lines, and the people of Boston will never forget their \noutstanding service and the difference they made.\n  My heart is in Boston today with the firefighters from across the \ncountry, and especially those from Engine 30, Ladder 25 in West \nRoxbury. They did the job they loved to do. May God bless Paul and \nWarren, and all of their family and friends who have gathered in Boston \nto grieve for them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/07/senate-section/article/S11263-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOHN WARNER\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is with a touch of sadness that I \nspeak about my friend, the senior Senator from Virginia, John Warner, \nwho announced last week that he will not seek a sixth term and will \nreturn to the Commonwealth he loves so well following the conclusion of \nthe 110th Congress. We will miss our friend, our colleague, and one of \nour finest and most respected members.\n  John Warner is a true American patriot, who has spent his life \nserving the public good. From volunteering to serve in World War II at \nthe age of 17, to his service as Secretary of the Navy and his years \namong us in the Senate, his life has been defined by a commitment of \nservice to others.\n  First and foremost a Virginia gentleman, John Warner is also one of \nthe greatest advocates our fighting men and women have ever had in the \nU.S. Senate, consistently supporting their interests regardless of the \nprevailing winds.\n  He was an extraordinary chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nwhere he helped transform the Committee from a Cold War posture to a \nnew focus on emerging threats, rapid technological changes, and \nasymmetric warfare. The changes he made helped usher the committee into \nthe 21st Century. As his colleague on the committee for a quarter \ncentury, I can attest to the unrivalled depth of his understanding of \nour Nation's military, and was grateful to have the opportunity to call \nupon him innumerable times over the years for his wise counsel.\n  In addition to his commitment and dedication to our military and to a \nstrong national defense, John Warner is also the embodiment of the \nfinest traditions of the Senate. Deliberate, thoughtful, and \nprincipled, over the past 28 years he has shown us all that we can \ndisagree without being disagreeable, and that the demands of party must \nyield to the demands of the American people that we do our very best to \nsupport our armed forces in their all-important missions for our \ncountry and our future.\n  Time after time, he has demonstrated his courage, decency and high \nprinciples in the Senate, whatever the partisan passions of the moment. \nThat is who John Warner is--someone who thinks long and hard about \nimportant decisions, and then does what he feels is right.\n  I am sure he and Jeanne thought long and hard about the decision to \nretire from the Senate, and I know it wasn't an easy call. He will \nleave enormous shoes to fill for the next person elected to serve the \npeople of Virginia in this body.\n  I will miss serving side by side with John Warner in the next \nCongress, but I am grateful we will have him here in the Senate for the \ncoming year, especially, as we work to find answers to the \nextraordinarily complex and dangerous situation we confront in the \nMiddle East. I am sure that all of us admire him for his statesmanship \nand leadership.\n  And we are especially grateful for his friendship, which extended to \nmy brothers Jack and Bobby as well.\n  We will miss him very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/07/senate-section/article/S11263-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, Senator Bennett of Utah and I have brought \nto the Senate the first bipartisan universal health care coverage \nlegislation in more than 13 years. I thought today I would open my \nremarks on health care in something of a light fashion. There is a \nbrand new study that has recently found Americans are no longer the \ntallest people in the world. Over the past 50 or so years, the U.S. \npopulation has lost that status and now ranks among the shortest among \nindustrialized countries. The Netherlands now holds the honor for the \ntallest nation. The authors of this new study speculate this change may \nstem from the fact that most other affluent countries have health care \nsystems that cover their entire population and that particularly \nhealthy lifestyles and healthy diets are also significant factors.\n  Senator Bennett is 6 foot 6. I am 6 foot 4. We would like our country \nto get its rightful position back as the leader among nations in the \nheight department. We think part of what is going to be necessary to do \nthat, in all seriousness, to make our health policies more health \nfocused rather than just spending on health care, is to adopt some \nfresh policies. We have been particularly interested this week because \nthe Wall Street Journal, which colleagues know displays a preference \nfor private health care sector solutions, has written a fascinating \nfront page article this week on the special accomplishments in Holland \nwith respect to health care. I have long been of the view that as we \nlook finally to accomplishing what this country has not been able to do \nfor 70 years, which is to get all Americans good quality, affordable \nhealth care, we are going to have to devise our own system. It is not \ngoing to be possible to import some other country's system of health \ncare to our Nation and pretty much plop it down on the United States \nand say: This is the way to go.\n  But as the Wall Street Journal said in their article this week, there \nare some important lessons to learn as it relates to the experience of \nother countries.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record this front page \narticle from the Wall Street Journal with respect to health care.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         In Holland, Some See Model for U.S. Health-Care System\n\n                            (By Gautam Naik)\n\n       The Hague.--The Netherlands is using competition and a \n     small dose of regulation to pursue what many in the U.S. \n     hunger to achieve: health insurance for everyone, coupled \n     with a tighter lid on costs.\n       Since a new system took effect here last year, cost growth \n     is projected to fall this year to about 3% after inflation \n     from 4.5% in 2006. Waiting lists are shrinking, and private \n     health insurers are coming up with innovative ways to care \n     for the sick.\n       The Dutch system features two key rules: All adults must \n     buy insurance, and all insurers must offer a policy to anyone \n     who applies, no matter how old or how sick. Those who can't \n     afford to pay the premiums get help from the state, financed \n     by taxes on the well-off.\n       The system hinges on competition among insurers. They are \n     expected to cut premiums, persuade consumers to live \n     healthier lives, and push hospitals to provide better and \n     lower-cost care.\n       Some are already taking unusual steps. The insurance \n     company Menzis has opened three of its own primary-care \n     centers to serve the patients it insures, and plans to open \n     dozens more in a move to lower costs. Rival UVIT offers \n     discount vouchers to customers who buy low-cholesterol \n     versions of yogurt, butter and milk.\n       To prevent insurers from seeking only young, healthy \n     customers, the government compensates insurers for taking on \n     higher-risk patients. Insurers get a ``risk-equalization'' \n     payment for covering the elderly and those with certain \n     conditions such as diabetes. to pay her back about $676 for \n     gym membership--provided Ms. Boel lost 7.5% of her weight \n     in 15 months.\n       The 45-year-old, who lives in the town of Tilburg, says she \n     stopped eating french fries and pizza and took up an \n     intensive regimen of walking, cycling and rowing. She met her \n     weightloss target and used the gym-membership rebate to buy \n     some new clothes.\n       Ms. Boel now hopes to manage her diabetes more efficiently \n     and lose more weight. ``I don't like exercising,'' she says, \n     ``but at least I can now walk without a stick.'' That's \n     welcome news to UVIT. Says spokesman Bert Rensen, ``Once she \n     stops using insulin, which we pay for, it will save us K900 \n     [about $1,200] a year.''\n\n\n                           Likely Opposition\n\n       What works in the Netherlands, a small country of 16.6 \n     million people, may not readily apply to America. A Dutch-\n     style scheme would likely raise opposition among U.S. doctors \n     and Republicans who are cautious about higher taxes. But many \n     U.S. states are similar in size, and one, Massachusetts, is \n     already experimenting with a universal-coverage scheme.\n       ``The lesson for America is that this is what we ought to \n     do,'' says Alain Enthoven, a professor at Stanford \n     University.\n       Three decades ago, Prof. Enthoven published a pioneering \n     proposal for what he called ``managed competition,'' a \n     version of which the Dutch have now adopted.\n       The Enthoven plan partly inspired the Clinton \n     administration's failed health-care overhaul effort in the \n     1990s. It has now come full circle. Last October, an \n     economist from the Dutch health ministry was invited to \n     describe his country's new approach to about 50 Massachusetts \n     politicians and policy makers in Boston, as the state was \n     developing its own plan for mandatory health insurance.\n       After being sidelined for more than a decade, health care \n     is once again a hot issue on the U.S. political agenda. Two \n     leading Democratic presidential candidates, Sen. Barack Obama \n     of Illinois and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, \n     have backed the idea of universal coverage and suggested ways \n     to achieve it. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a \n     Republican, has pushed a proposal to require all state \n     residents to obtain health insurance, but he hasn't been able \n     to strike a deal with state legislators to enact a plan.\n       The notion of competition among insurers is nothing new to \n     Americans. Most Americans under 65 get insurance via their \n     employer, which can compare plans and pick the one that it \n     thinks offers the best coverage for the money. To cut costs, \n     U.S. insurers bargain with doctors for discounted rates and \n     try to weed out overbilling and frivolous treatments.\n       The system has failed to stop U.S. health costs from \n     shooting up, and it has left many doctors complaining that \n     their medical judgment is being second-guessed by bean \n     counters. It isn't clear that a Dutch-style system, also \n     centered on insurer competition, could do any better. Dutch \n     doctors were among the most vociferous opponents of an \n     overhaul and many remain skeptical.\n       Still, there are some differences in the Dutch way that may \n     work to its advantage. One is the emphasis on individuals \n     buying coverage. In the U.S., employers tend to be poor \n     buyers of health care. They're unfamiliar with the needs of \n     the people actually using the health care--their employees--\n     and it is difficult for a large company to switch insurers.\n       By putting the onus on consumers, Dutch officials hope that \n     more people will get the coverage they need. The ``risk \n     equalization'' that helps Dutch insurers cover sicker people \n     is also critical. In the U.S., competition among insurers \n     often means competition to find the healthiest customers, \n     especially in the individual market.\n       The Netherlands began to overhaul its health system in 1987 \n     after a government committee concluded that the best approach \n     was ``managed competition,'' the idea first proposed by Prof. \n     Enthoven of Stanford.\n       The task was enormous. The country had four different \n     coverage schemes. The wealthiest third of the population was \n     required to get health insurance without government \n     assistance. Some in this group received help from employers \n     in paying premiums, while others paid the whole bill \n     themselves. The bulk of the Dutch population was covered \n     under a compulsory state-run health-insurance scheme financed \n     by deductions from wages. Civil servants and older people \n     were insured under two separate plans within this state-run \n     scheme.\n       The government closely regulated hospital budgets and \n     doctors' fees, but provided few incentives to cut costs. When \n     hospitals lost money on a particular kind of care, they \n     rationed it. Many patients ended up on waiting lists.\n       People in line for heart transplants were particularly \n     affected. In the mid-1990s, fewer than three Dutch people per \n     million received such transplants. By comparison, a study of \n     12 European countries showed that only Greece had a lower \n     rate of such operations. ln the U.S., there were about nine \n     heart transplants per million people.\n       In 1999, waiting lists increased by 2%, despite a $54 \n     million initiative to reduce them. ``Dead on the waiting \n     list,'' read one cover story of Vrij Nederland, a weekly \n     magazine that, like other Dutch media, relentlessly \n     criticized the country's health system.\n\n[[Page S11265]]\n\n       ``We felt frustrated,'' recalls Hans Hoogervorst, who was \n     the health minister from 2003 to early 2007 and a major force \n     in pushing through the overhaul.\n       Though the Dutch still enjoyed better health than the \n     residents of many developed countries, standards were \n     slipping. Between 1960 and 2000, the increase in Dutch life \n     expectancy was 4.5 years, while its neighbors, Germany and \n     Belgium, showed far better increases of 8.1 and 7.1 years, \n     respectively, according to the Organization for Economic \n     Cooperation and Development. In the U.S., the increase was \n     nearly seven years.\n       As in the U.S., medical costs began to increase, driven by \n     an aging population and the increased use of expensive new \n     technology. Between 2000 and 2004, Dutch health spending as a \n     share of gross domestic product shot up to 10% from 8%.\n       In late 2004, the Dutch House of Representatives passed a \n     law to usher in mandatory health insurance and switch people \n     on state-run insurance to private carriers. But family \n     doctors fretted that it would allow insurers to interfere in \n     medical decisions, for example by pushing cheaper drugs.\n       The following May, thousands of Dutch general practitioners \n     went on a three-day strike. Some tied their hands together \n     with rope to symbolize their helplessness. In response, Mr. \n     Hoogervorst promised to provide some protections for doctors \n     in the new legislation. One of them was that patients \n     wouldn't bear a big financial cost if they chose to go to a \n     doctor not under contract with their insurer. Soon after, the \n     senate approved the new plan.\n       It took effect on Jan. 1, 2006. Despite predictions of \n     chaos, the changeover was surprisingly smooth. The government \n     set up a Web site where consumers could analyze insurers' \n     offerings. Consumers were allowed to switch insurers once a \n     year. As 2006 approached, the health ministry predicted that \n     only 5% would bother. Instead, nearly 20% of people switched, \n     either to get a better price or because they were \n     dissatisfied with their insurer.\n\n\n                              Premium War\n\n       Consumers also benefited from a premium war as insurers \n     made a grab for market share. The Dutch health ministry had \n     predicted that insurers in 2006 would price the annual \n     mandatory premium at an average of K1,106, or about $1,500. \n     Instead, market forces set it at K1,028, 7.6% lower. This \n     year, it has risen to K1,103, partly because of an easing in \n     the price war. That's still less than the K1,134 the \n     government predicted for 2007.\n       Included in the overhaul was a deal the government \n     negotiated with generic-drug makers to cut prices by about \n     40%. The generic-drug makers made up for some of their lost \n     revenue by reducing the rebates and bonuses they provided to \n     pharmacists to recommend their drugs to customers. From 2004 \n     through 2006, annual drug spending grew at an average annual \n     rate of 2.8%, down from 9% annual growth earlier in the \n     decade.\n       Insurers have taken a hit, though. UVIT, which has more \n     than four million customers, was forced to open a 200-person \n     call center to help consumers switch between plans. In 2005, \n     UVIT had total revenue of about $7.6 billion and made a \n     profit of about $202 million from health insurance, which is \n     its main business. Last year, the company's health business \n     posted a loss of $30 million. UVIT expects to return to \n     profitability this year, partly by negotiating lower prices \n     with hospitals.\n       In most European countries, consumers have no idea what \n     their health insurance costs because they are covered by \n     national health-insurance schemes financed by payroll taxes, \n     as used to be the case in the Netherlands. On a visit to \n     Germany last year, Mr. Hoogervorst boasted that thanks to his \n     country's switch to private insurance paid by individuals, \n     ``no other European country has a population so keenly aware \n     of the costs of their health-care insurance.''\n       Now that they see the bills more clearly, some consumers \n     feel their payments have gone up. In one survey mainly of \n     labor-union members, about 70% said they were financially \n     worse off in some ways.\n       Insurers get risk-equalization payments for patients with \n     about 30 major diseases. They can use these to offer \n     discounted premiums and programs tailored to those with heart \n     disease, diabetes and other ailments.\n       One shortcoming is that many diseases aren't subject to \n     risk equalization. The excluded diseases--such as migraine \n     headaches--are harder to diagnose and their treatment costs \n     are harder to predict. ``Seen from the side of migraine \n     patients, this is highly unfair,'' says Peter Vriezen, \n     president of the Dutch Headache Patients Association.\n       The real test of the Dutch approach is yet to come: Can \n     insurers push hospitals to lower their costs and improve \n     their quality? Insurers have clout because they can direct \n     large numbers of patients toward particular hospitals. But, \n     in a holdover from the old system, insurers can currently \n     negotiate prices * * *. The figure will rise to 20% by the \n     end of this year, and continue to go up.\n       Because Dutch hospitals used to receive fixed prices for \n     their services, and got more money for more service \n     regardless of quality, they had little incentive to improve \n     their care. Under the new system, insurers should be \n     providing that incentive, but Mr. Hoogervorst acknowledges, \n     ``Thee's still a long way to go to increase competition among \n     hospitals.''\n\n\n                           Market Incentives\n\n       One concern is the potential for overconcentration among \n     insurers. UVIT, for example, is the result of a merger \n     between four insurers. ``If eventually you have only three or \n     five insurers, you might wonder how many market incentives \n     will remain,'' says Niek Klazinga, professor of social \n     medicine at the University of Amsterdam.\n       Last fall, Prof. Enthoven delivered a speech to health \n     economists in Rotterdam. He congratulated the Dutch for being \n     ``in the lead'' in health-care change. However, he cautioned, \n     ``you still have considerable work ahead of you to transform \n     your present success with insurance'' into a system that \n     delivers improving care.\n       Some insurers are taking unusual steps to get there. Menzis \n     rewards doctors with bonuses if they prescribe generics \n     instead of more expensive branded drugs. UVIT ranks hospitals \n     based on the quality of care.\n       To put pressure on Dutch hospitals, some insurers let \n     patients go to other countries where high-level care for \n     certain ailments costs less. Thea Gerits, 71, went to Germany \n     for a hip replacement and spent four weeks in a \n     rehabilitation center there, receiving physical therapy and \n     enjoying yoga, massages and mud baths.\n       UVIT paid the $19,000 bill. It says the same amount in the \n     Netherlands would buy only the surgery and basic therapy. Ms. \n     Gerits came home happy, and soon was riding her bicycle \n     again. ``I got lots of attention,'' she says. * * *.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am going to read one paragraph at the outset of the \narticle:\n\n       Since a new system took effect here last year, cost growth \n     is projected to fall this year to about 3 [percent] after \n     inflation from 4.5 [percent] in 2006. Waiting lists are \n     shrinking, and private health insurers are coming up with \n     innovative ways to care for the sick.\n\n  What struck Senator Bennett and I is, there is an awful lot of \ncomparison between our bipartisan legislation and the experience of the \nDutch. For example, both in Holland and in the United States under our \nproposal, there would be a requirement that individuals would have to \npurchase their own health insurance. Insurers under our proposal, as in \nHolland, would not be able to discriminate against individuals who have \nhad illnesses. We saw in the movie ``Sicko'' that wonderful scene with \nthe ``Star Wars'' music describing all the various conditions that \nindividuals might have that would exclude them from insurance coverage. \nThat would be illegal under what Senator Bennett and I are advocating. \nIt is illegal, according to the Wall Street Journal, in the \nNetherlands.\n  Finally, in the Netherlands and under our legislation, there is a \nsharp and specific focus on prevention and wellness. The tragedy in our \ncountry is, we don't have health care at all. What we largely have is \nsick care. Medicare shows this probably more clearly than anything \nelse. Medicare Part A will pay huge expenses for senior citizens' \nhospital bills. The check goes from the Government to the hospital. But \nMedicare Part B, on the other hand, will pay for virtually nothing for \nprevention and keeping people well. Senator Bennett and I seek to \nchange that. For the first time under our legislation, Medicare would \nbe authorized to discount the premiums for seniors who lower their \nblood pressure, lower their cholesterol, practice good health in their \nindividual lives. I am struck by this Wall Street Journal article, \nwhere insurers in Holland are adopting much the same kind of approach. \nThe article states on the front page that insurers now are offering \ndiscounts to customers who buy low cholesterol versions of yogurt, \nbutter, and milk.\n  The point is, worldwide the message is getting out. Prevention works. \nWellness, a new focus on personal responsibility, and keeping our \ncitizens healthy makes sense. They are doing it in Holland. The Wall \nStreet Journal describes the positive benefits there. I and Senator \nBennett, along with our cosponsors, Senators Bill Nelson, Lamar \nAlexander, and Judd Gregg, are trying to build a bipartisan coalition \nin the Senate to do exactly the same.\n  Our legislation, the Healthy Americans Act, would require that \neveryone not on Medicare or in the military would have to purchase \nprivate health insurance. But to make sure that is doable, we fix the \nbroken marketplace. Under our legislation, private insurance companies \nwouldn't be able to cherry-pick. They wouldn't be able to take just \nhealthy people and send sick people over to Government programs more \nfragile than they are. They couldn't discriminate against those with \nillnesses. They would have to spread risks through large groups of \npeople. Right now essentially much of the private insurance business is \nabout\n\n[[Page S11266]]\n\nfiltering out those people who have illnesses and finding a way to \ncover just those who are healthy. Our legislation would change that.\n  We also take critical steps to make sure that if you are going to \nrequire that people purchase coverage, you have generous subsidies for \nfolks with modest incomes. What Senator Bennett and I propose--and \napparently they are doing something along these lines in Holland--is to \nsubsidize those up to 100 percent of poverty completely and for those \nbetween 100 percent of poverty and 400 percent of poverty, there would \nbe a partial subsidy. The most generous subsidies of any program \nanywhere in our country would be offered under this legislation that we \nare offering, with Senators Alexander, Gregg, and Nelson of Florida.\n  How do we pay for it? The Lewin Group, which is kind of the gold \nstandard for looking at health policies, scored the administration's \napproaches, many of the States and ours and said we can find a lot of \nthe savings under our legislation through an administrative process \nthat establishes that once you sign up in Ohio, once you sign up in \nOregon or anywhere else in the country, you are in for life. You don't \nhave to sign up again and again and again. In my State, my guess is it \nis very similar to the situation in Ohio, if you are on Medicaid, there \nis something like 31 or 32 categories of coverage. A poor person has to \ntry to squeeze themselves into one of those boxes in order to get \ncoverage. It is degrading to the poor and a big waste of money.\n  What Senator Bennett and I have offered is a one-stop process so you \nsign up once, and everything else from that point on is essentially \naccomplished through the magical world of electronic transfers. An \nindividual's contribution would be taken out of their paycheck while \nthey are working. Ours is fully funded.\n  There is an opportunity for bipartisan cooperation, particularly \nshould the Bush administration want to assist in this effort. For \nexample, every single economist who has come before the Finance \nCommittee, before the Budget Committee, has talked about the Tax Code \nas it relates to health care disproportionately favoring the most \naffluent and rewarding inefficiency at the same time. To put it another \nway, if you are a high-flying CEO in the United States, if you want to \ngo out and get a designer smile put on your face, you can write off the \ncost of that service on your taxes. But if you are a hard-working woman \nwithout any health plan and a local furniture store, you get nothing. \nSo I and Senator Bennett redirect the current tax expenditures. They \nare the biggest part of private health care spending.\n  The Lewin Group establishes in their analysis of our report that \nwould ensure we could expand coverage over the next few years without \nany additional cost to taxpayers. The Lewin Group has said the proposal \nnow being sponsored by five Members of the Senate would slow the rate \nof growth in health care spending by $1.5 trillion.\n  I know the distinguished Presiding Officer has a great interest in \nhealth. We are so pleased he is here because we have worked together on \nthese issues often. It is clear this is the premier domestic issue of \nour time. A combination of today's demographics with a rapidly aging \npopulation, escalating costs, the huge increase in chronic illness, our \ncurrent health care system is not sustainable. It is not one we can put \non automatic pilot and say: Let us run it this way for years and years \nin the future.\n  The tragedy is with all the wonderful doctors and hospitals and \nnurses in Ohio and Oregon, all across the country, we are spending \nenough money on health care to do this job. We are simply not spending \nit in the right places.\n  To give an idea of how out of whack American health care spending is, \nfor the amount of money we are spending today, $2.3 trillion, 300 \nmillion of us in the country, you divide 300 million into $2.3 \ntrillion, and you could go out and hire a doctor for every seven \nfamilies in the United States and say: Doctor, your job will be for \nthis year to take care of seven families, and we will pay you $200,000 \na year.\n  My experience, I say to the Acting President pro tempore, is that \nwhen I bring this up to physicians at home in Oregon, they say: Ron, \nwhere do I go to get my seven families? It sounds pretty good to be \nable to get back into the business of practicing medicine again and \nadvocating for my patients rather than going through all this paperwork \nand bureaucracy and redtape.\n  So we are spending enough on health care today. We are not spending \nit in the right places. That is what they have begun to change in \nHolland, according to the Wall Street Journal this week. That is what I \nand Senator Bennett and our colleagues on both sides of the aisle are \nseeking to do in the Senate.\n  One last comment, Mr. President. I know there is a hectic schedule \nfor all Senators, and certainly the Senator from Ohio.\n  The question is whether there should be action now or the Congress \nshould simply wait for another Presidential election. Here are the \nconsequences of waiting for several more years. The Census Bureau \nreported last week that 2.2 million additional Americans were without \nhealth insurance between 2005 and 2006. If this Congress waits a couple \nof years more, we can expect that number to increase and the number \nwithout coverage in this country to hemorrhage further.\n  That is a moral abomination, No. 1; and it is going to be costly to \ntaxpayers, No. 2, because those people very often will have to go to \nhospital emergency rooms to get their coverage. Of course, those bills \nwill be passed on to businesses in Ohio and Oregon and across the \ncountry and to our taxpayers. So the costs of delay are very direct and \nimmediate.\n  Second, with respect to employer-based coverage, the new numbers \nindicate the number of employers offering coverage has now fallen below \n60 percent. It is pretty easy to see why, with these double-digit \npremium hikes, Price Waterhouse says health costs are going to average, \nthis year, a little over 11 percent. A lot of our employers want to do \nthe right thing by their workers and simply cannot offer coverage.\n  If this Congress decides to stand down on the question of overhauling \nhealth care and say, ``Let's just wait until 2009,'' you are going to \nsee more businesses in Ohio, in Oregon, and across this country lose \ncoverage. I do not think we ought to sit by and just let our coverage \ncontinue to melt away along the lines of these statistics that I \nmentioned.\n  Finally, on the question of prevention and what Holland is doing, and \nwhat we are seeking to do in the Healthy Americans Act, there is a very \nsignificant cost with respect to chronic illness as it relates to doing \nnothing to change our policies. The new numbers with respect to chronic \nillness indicate that in 31 States over the last year obesity has risen \nonce again; of course, there is a direct link here between heart and \nstroke and diabetes and so many illnesses. Not one State--not one--\nexperienced a decline.\n  So if the Congress says: Well, we will pass on overhauling American \nhealth care until 2009, we can expect to have missed another \nopportunity--yet another opportunity--for doing something about \nenacting health care policies that put a new focus on prevention and \nwellness.\n  So this question of waiting for 2 more years and saying: Let's just \nspend our time looking at what the various candidates for President \nfrom both political parties are saying about health care--certainly it \nis getting a lot of attention in terms of debates on TV and all of us \ntrying to look at the various merits of the candidates' proposals; and \nthey are good people; and they have good suggestions--but I want to \nmake it clear to the Senate there are very real costs of waiting to fix \nhealth care.\n  I think the question of fixing health care is so urgent we ought to \nget on with it, and we ought to get on with it in a bipartisan way, \nwhich is what I and Senator Bennett are trying to do. We are very proud \nto have been able to get the support of business and labor leaders.\n  When we offered the initial proposal, Andy Stern, the president of \nthe Service Employees International Union, stood on one side of me, and \nSteve Burd, the CEO of the Safeway company, a very large Fortune 500 \ncompany, stood on the other side. We had individuals such as Ron \nPollack, of\n\n[[Page S11267]]\n\nFamilies USA, and advocates for compassionate end-of-life health care \nwith us as well.\n  The last time Congress looked at this--and the Acting President pro \ntempore, I think, remembers this--during a period in the early 1990s, \nthe people who stood with me for the kickoff of the Healthy Americans \nAct were spending millions to pretty much beat each other's brains out. \nThat was the last time the Congress and the President, during the \nClinton years, debated health care.\n  So this is a different climate, certainly a different climate for \nbusinesses in Ohio and Oregon. What I hear from businesses at home--\nunlike in 1993, the Clinton years, when they said: We cannot afford \nfixing health care--they are now saying: We cannot afford the status \nquo. That is why they are joining Senator Bennett and I and others on \nthese proposals.\n  My hope is as Congress looks at the evidence, whether it is the Wall \nStreet Journal reporting on promising developments--very often people \nthink of Europe and socialized countries--the Wall Street Journal is \nputting on the front page of the paper--a publication that clearly \nfavors private health care coverage--an example of a country in Europe \nwhere they seem to be making great progress.\n  So as we devise our own system, one that is uniquely American, I and \nSenator Bennett want to work with every Member of the Senate--I think I \ncan speak for Senators Bill Nelson, Lamar Alexander, Judd Gregg, and \nthe others we have been talking to--that we think this is the premier \ndomestic issue of our time. Certainly, the conflict in Iraq is the \npremier national security issue. But the premier domestic issue at home \nis fixing American health care.\n  I think based on the evidence that comes in every day, we know what \nneeds to be done. Now the question is making sure there is the \npolitical will to go forward. I look forward to working with the Acting \nPresident pro tempore, who has a great interest in these matters, and \nall our colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/07/senate-section/article/S11267-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              TUBERCULOSIS\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, every day an estimated 4,400 lives are lost \naround the world to tuberculosis--day in, day out, yesterday, today, \nand tomorrow. Fifteen lives will be lost, roughly, in the few minutes \nof my remarks.\n  Tuberculosis is an urgent global crisis that demands our attention \nand our response. Two billion people--two billion people--one-third of \nthe world's population, carry around with them the tuberculosis \nbacterium. As many as 10 million to 15 million in the United States \nalone are infected with the TB bacterium. Most will not get sick, but \nmany of them are in some jeopardy.\n  Nine million people, practically the population of my State of Ohio, \nbecome sick with active tuberculosis every year, and 1.6 million people \nwill die.\n  We struggle with many diseases that are beyond our scientific \nunderstanding, but tuberculosis is not one of them. These deaths are \npreventable. TB is the greatest curable infectious killer worldwide.\n  Much of the good work of the legislation this Senate passed last \nnight will be undermined if we do not do a better job of controlling \ntuberculosis. Our investments in development will do little to improve \neconomic conditions if entire populations--as are so many in Africa, \nespecially, and India, especially--are reeling from this disease.\n  Combating TB is fundamental to sustaining economic development in \npoor countries. My colleagues know this.\n  Congress--following the leadership of the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee Chairman, Pat Leahy, and ranking member, Judd Gregg--has \nmade great strides in investing greater resources in global health. \nDiseases such as HIV and malaria have received tremendous increases \nover the past several years, and I hope this trend will continue.\n  Last night, the Senate did something about this. The amendment I \noffered last night, with Senators Brownback, Durbin, Boxer, and Smith, \nadded $90 million in funding for our international efforts against \ntuberculosis, bringing total spending to $200 million. Undoubtedly, \nthat will save lives.\n  Combating TB must go hand in hand with the fight against HIV. Up to \n50 percent of people who are HIV positive develop tuberculosis. As many \nas half the deaths from HIV in Africa actually are deaths from \ntuberculosis. It is the leading cause of death among people who are HIV \npositive all over the world.\n  HIV infection weakens a person's immune system, making it 50 times \nmore likely that person will develop active tuberculosis. So if someone \nis carrying the TB bacterium in their body--as is a third of the \nworld's people--if they get infected with HIV or have some other \ndisease or weakness--from malnutrition or something else--they are much \nmore likely to develop active tuberculosis.\n  To compound that, unchecked, drug-resistant tuberculosis, including \ndeadly XDR-TB, threatens to reverse progress made against AIDS and TB \nworldwide. In today's world, extensively drug-resistant TB--so-called \nXDR-TB--poses a grave public health threat never more than a plane ride \naway.\n  This past June, we got a wakeup call when an American boarded a plane \nto Europe while infected with drug-resistant tuberculosis. Luckily, his \nwas not the most virulent strain. But his example shows us clearly that \nthis disease does affect America and that more resources for TB are \nneeded to prevent, identify, treat, and control extensively drug-\nresistant tuberculosis.\n  We need to heed that wakeup call and act before it is too late. It is \nwithin our power. There is no mystery here. We know what to do. We know \nhow to treat and cure regular so-called garden-variety tuberculosis. We \nknow how to treat and cure multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in an \noverwhelming majority of cases. And we know how to treat, generally, \nextensively drug-resistant--XDR-TB--tuberculosis and cure people of \nthat. It is within our means. Treating regular, garden-variety TB costs \nonly $20 per person. It is a small price to pay to save our lives.\n\n  I thank my colleagues, including the junior Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor his support of this issue. Last night was a victory for people in \nthe developing world who are so often victims of tuberculosis, who so \noften suffer from that. It is also a victory for people in our country, \na few of whom have TB, but most--but the many more people who are a \nplane ride away or are potentially exposed to this tuberculosis \nbacteria.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/07/senate-section/article/S11267-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11267-S11268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I strongly oppose coercive abortion or \ninvoluntary sterilization, and was pleased that the fiscal year 2008 \nForeign Operations Appropriations bill included a provision prohibiting \nU.S. funds from going to any organization or program that directly \nsupports such horrific practices. Unfortunately, the amendment offered \nby Senator Brownback undermined this provision by allowing the \nPresident to deny funds to any organization or program that he claims \nsupports such practices. This administration has misused similar \nlanguage to deny resources to the United Nations Population Fund simply \nbecause this agency has programs in China, where the government \npractices coercive abortions to enforce its one child policy. In fact, \nhowever, the UNFPA's program in China is specifically designed to \npressure the Chinese to end the use of coercive tactics, and this \namendment would undermine the good work that the UNFPA does.\n  (At the request of Mr. REID, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, as we consider legislation to \nprovide funding for our important international development and \nassistance programs, I would like to take the opportunity to highlight \nthe issue of quality basic education and the ways in which increasing \naccess to basic education can improve social, economic, and health\n\n[[Page S11268]]\n\noutcomes in countries around the world.\n  We cannot underestimate the importance of efforts by our Government \nand its partners around the globe to provide access to education for \ngirls and boys around the world. Basic education is the cornerstone for \nsuccess in sustainable development. It has a profound impact on the \nfuture of individual children, their families, communities, and \nnations.\n  A population that can read, write, and think critically is far more \nlikely to achieve democracy, economic growth, and improved health. A \n2004 report by Barbara Herz and Gene Sperling from the Center on \nUniversal Education at the Council on Foreign Relations detailed the \nbenefits that result from investments in education, particular for \ngirls and women. A single year of primary education correlates with a \n10 to 20 percent increase in women's wages later in life, and a study \nof South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa found that from 1960 to 1992, \nequality in education between men and women could have led to nearly 1 \npercent higher annual per capita GDP growth.\n  Nor is there any doubt that education saves lives. Educated children \nare less likely to contract HIV/AIDS and other deadly diseases. Oxfam \nestimates that if all children completed primary education, 700,000 new \ncases of HIV/AIDS in young people could be prevented each year, \ntotaling 7 million cases in a decade.\n  I would like to commend the Senate for its efforts to significantly \nincrease U.S. investments in basic education in the developing world. \nOver the last 15 to 20 years, there has been dramatic progress, \nparticularly for girls, in school enrollment around the world.\n  In 2000, our Nation made a commitment to the goal of achieving \nuniversal basic education by 2015. Through some of the initiatives and \npartnership in which our Government is participating with its \ninternational partners, such as the Education for All Fast Track \nInitiative, we have made progress. Since the Fast Track Initiative was \nlaunched in 2002, approximately 4 million children each year--both boys \nand girls--have gained access to school.\n  But much more needs to be done. We are not on track to meet our 2015 \ngoal. In order to do so, we would need to help millions more children \nenter school each year requiring a global financial commitment of more \nthan $7 billion every year. Of the 77 million children who are not in \nschool, three-fifths are girls. Forty-three percent of all out-of-\nschool children are in countries affected by conflict and are often the \nhardest to reach. Approximately half of the school-age children who \nstart primary school do not complete it. And there are hundreds of \nmillions more children who are denied the opportunity to complete a \nsecondary school education to become the next generation of doctors, \nnurses, lawyers, scientists, and teachers. These statistics represent \nan unconscionable misuse of human potential--a misuse that we can and \nmust remedy.\n  I have introduced legislation--the Education for All Act--that would \nenable the U.S. Government to make a significant commitment to reach \nthe 2015 goal and help children in developing countries, particularly \nareas experiencing conflict or humanitarian emergencies, have access to \na quality basic education. But I would also encourage my colleagues to \nsupport increased appropriations for basic education programs, and as \nthis legislation moves forward, I will work with my colleagues to \nensure that the United States is in the strongest position to meet its \n2015 goal and make education for all a reality. This is not only the \nright thing to do for the world's children; it is right thing and the \nsmart thing to do for this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/07/senate-section/article/S11268-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11268-S11269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, VETERANS AFFAIRS AND RELATED AGENCIES \n                           APPROPRIATION ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the fiscal year \n2008 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies \nAppropriation Act. The bill includes funding for critical renovations \nand repairs to military facilities and military family housing. The \nbrave men and women of our Armed Forces are serving honorably under \nintense strains in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. We must take care \nof them and their families while they serve and when they return. This \nbill reverses a disturbing trend in recent years by finally providing \nsufficient funds to care for our Nation's veterans. I hope that we will \nhave the chance soon to vote for a conference report reflecting the \npriorities in this bill so that there will be no delay--as there has \nbeen in recent years--in getting the Department of Veterans Affairs \nurgently needed funds. And I will continue working to make sure that \nthis bill is only the beginning of a lasting commitment to providing \nveterans the best health care and benefits available.\n  I was particularly pleased that the Senate adopted my amendment \nrequiring that the Government Accountability Office, GAO, study how the \nVA can best care for the mental health needs of female veterans. I \ndecided to introduce this amendment after hearing concerns directly \nfrom Wisconsin veterans about insufficient mental health services for \nwomen. The number of women in the Armed Forces has grown rapidly, as \nhas their exposure to combat. While the VA has taken important steps to \nestablish services for women, there is little data on how VA mental \nhealth care funds are being used to address the needs of women. Indeed, \nmental health experts recently testified before the Congress that the \nVA does not have the capacity to address the needs of women veterans. \nThis study will help ensure that the Veterans Administration dedicates \nthe funds needed to care for women veterans.\n  I was pleased to support Senator Brown's amendment to ensure that the \nVeterans Administration abides by existing law which prohibits \nunnecessary studies on the privatization of VA functions and requires \npublic-private competitions before outsourcing government jobs. This \nbill also includes additional funds for the Beneficiary Travel Program, \nan important VA program that benefits numerous Wisconsin veterans who \nlive far from VA medical facilities.\n  The bill includes $15 million for funding for gulf war illnesses \nresearch. I strongly support research into treatments for these \ndebilitating illnesses. Nearly 200,000 gulf war veterans--one in four \nof those who served--suffer from chronic multisymptom illness as a \nresult of serving in the gulf, according to the Department of Veterans \nAffairs most recent study. These illnesses combine debilitating \nheadaches, widespread muscle and joint pain, severe fatigue, cognitive \nproblems, and other abnormalities. Current and future American military \nforces, as well as civilians, are also at risk of similar exposure.\n  Yet according to members of the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf \nWar Veterans Illnesses, of all the money spent on research in this \narea--over $300 million over the past 12 years--only two studies have \nbeen done on treatments. It is time to accept that these are serious \nneurological illnesses and shift research to the identification of \ntreatments. A promising pilot program to identify treatments and \ndiagnostic tests was initiated last year by the Department of Defense \nCongressionally Directed Medical Research Program. I call on the \nDepartment to dedicate the funds appropriated in this act to the \nidentification of treatments for these illnesses.\n  I understand that concerns have been expressed about the Veterans \nAdministration leasing property at the West Los Angeles VA Medical \nFacility to private enterprises that are inappropriate for the hallowed \ngrounds of a soldier's home. I supported Senator DeMint's unsuccessful \namendment to delete language from the bill prohibiting the VA from \nleasing excess property at the West Los Angeles medical facility under \nany circumstances because I do not believe that this language is in the \nbest interests of veterans.\n  The GAO has reported that, historically, the VA has spent as many as \n1 in 4 of its health care dollars on maintaining its facilities and \nland, including properties that are no longer fit for the provision of \nmedical services and are no longer in use. In order to better \ncapitalize on its assets, the VA has conducted a nationwide review and \nprepared a plan to make the best use of its property. This plan is \nsupported by a\n\n[[Page S11269]]\n\nbroad coalition of veterans service organizations, and Congress should \ntake care before carving out exceptions to this policy. This does not \nmean, however, that just any lease will do. The VA must incorporate the \nviews of local veterans groups whenever it makes decisions about how to \nutilize its property and any lease must preserve the integrity of the \nVA grounds.\n  This bill includes over $1 billion for National Guard and Reserve \nconstruction. For too long, the needs of the National Guard and Reserve \nhave not been adequately funded even while their responsibilities at \nhome and abroad have grown exponentially. This bill increases funds for \nthe National Guard and Reserve commensurate with their growing \nresponsibilities.\n  I am concerned that the Department of Defense, according to the \nreport of the Senate Appropriations Committee, has ``yet to provide a \ncomprehensive plan detailing the scope and cost of the total military \nconstruction requirement'' associated with the increase in end strength \nof the Army and Marine Corps. Nor has the Defense Department properly \naccounted for the tremendous increase in the cost of realigning its \nforce structure. And I am concerned that the Defense Department is \nproceeding with major new construction at Camp Lemonier in Djibouti \neven before the new AFRICOM commander has been confirmed, thereby \nundermining the stated goal of creating a more cohesive and coordinated \napproach to security in Africa.

LUM\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to recognize a great American \nand a remarkable man, who has an exceptional record of public service. \nHe has honorably served our country with distinction for over 43 years \nof active duty and National Guard Service, as well as 16 years of \nservice as my executive assistant.\n  GEN Alexis Lum retired in February 1991 as the adjutant general for \nthe State of Hawaii Army National Guard. His military service began in \n1945, when he was drafted shortly after graduating from Roosevelt High \nSchool in Honolulu. He served as an enlisted man in the Pacific, \nattaining the rank of staff sergeant. When discharged in 1947, he \nbecame a student at the University of Hawaii where he received his \nbachelor of science degree in civil engineering and a ROTC commission \nas a second lieutenant.\n  He was recalled to active duty in April 1951 for the Korean conflict \nand served as an infantry platoon leader. Released from active duty in \n1954, he then joined the Hawaii Army National Guard as a first \nlieutenant. As a major, he was part of the National Guard call-up in \n1968 and served in the Republic of Vietnam, initially as the executive \noffice of an engineer battalion. Promoted to lieutenant colonel while \non this tour, he served his last 4 months in Vietnam as commander of \nthe same battalion.\n  His National Guard service included varied command and staff \npositions. He was promoted to brigadier general in 1980 and was \nassigned as the assistant adjutant general, Army. In 1982 he was \nappointed as the adjutant general, Hawaii by Governor George Ariyoshi \nand was promoted to the rank of major general. He attended many \nmilitary service schools including the Army's Command, General Staff \nCollege, and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. His military \ndecorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of \nMerit, the Bronze Star Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal with \ncluster, the Army Commendation Medal, and numerous service medals.\n  In his civilian life, between tours of active duty, he was an \nengineer with the Navy Civil Service at the Naval Ammunition Depot, \nLualualei, Oahu. He started as a junior engineer in 1954 when he was \nreleased from active duty. He progressed to the director of the \nengineering division and deputy public works officer for the Naval \nAmmunition Depot. He retired from Federal civil service in 1982, when \nhe was appointed the adjutant general.\n  His wife is Leimomi--Momi--Mookini Lum. She served for 32 years with \nthe Honolulu Police Department, as a police investigator, and retired \nin 1982. Her last 20 years of police service involved working in the \njuvenile crime prevention division of the Police Department. Together \nthey have three children, Mrs. Angela Thomas, Mrs. Alexia Carvalho, and \nMr. Oliver Lum, and four granddaughters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/07/senate-section/article/S11269-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/07/senate-section/article/S11269-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/07/senate-section/article/S11269-4", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LEAHY, from the Committee on the Judiciary, without \n     amendment:\n       S. 1692.

Res. 311\n\n       Whereas ovarian cancer is the deadliest of all \n     gynecological cancers, and the reported incidence of ovarian \n     cancer is increasing over time;\n       Whereas ovarian cancer is the 5th leading cause of cancer \n     deaths among women in the United States;\n       Whereas all women are at risk for ovarian cancer, and 90 \n     percent of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer do not have a \n     family history that puts them at higher risk;\n       Whereas the Pap smear is sensitive and specific to the \n     early detection of cervical cancer, but not to ovarian \n     cancer;\n       Whereas there is currently no reliable and easy-to-\n     administer screening test used for the early detection of \n     ovarian cancer;\n       Whereas many people are unaware that the symptoms of \n     ovarian cancer often include bloating, pelvic or abdominal \n     pain, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, and urinary \n     symptoms, among several other symptoms that are easily \n     confused with other diseases;\n       Whereas due to the lack of a reliable early screening test, \n     75 percent of cases of ovarian cancer are detected at an \n     advanced stage, when the 5-year survival rate is only 50 \n     percent, a much lower rate than for many other cancers;\n       Whereas if ovarian cancer is diagnosed and treated at an \n     early stage before the cancer spreads outside of the ovary, \n     the treatment is potentially less costly, and the survival \n     rate is as high as 90 percent;\n       Whereas there are factors that are known to reduce the risk \n     for ovarian cancer and play an important role in the \n     prevention of the disease;\n       Whereas awareness and early recognition of ovarian cancer \n     symptoms are currently the best way to save women's lives;\n       Whereas the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance, during the \n     month of September, holds a number of events to increase \n     public awareness of ovarian cancer; and\n       Whereas a National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month should be \n     designated to increase the awareness of the public regarding \n     the cancer: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports the goals and ideals of \n     National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/07/senate-section/article/S11271-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      Committee on Armed Services\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Res. 282\n\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease (known as ``PKD'') is 1 \n     of the most prevalent life-threatening genetic diseases in \n     the United States, is a severe, dominantly inherited disease \n     that has a devastating impact, in both human and economic \n     terms, on people of all ages, and affects equally people of \n     all races, sexes, nationalities, geographic locations, and \n     income levels;\n       Whereas, based on prevalence estimates by the National \n     Institutes of Health, it is estimated that about 600,000 \n     patients in the United States have a genetic inheritance from \n     1 or both parents for polycystic kidney disease, and that \n     countless additional friends, loved ones, spouses, and \n     caregivers must shoulder the physical, emotional, and \n     financial burdens that polycystic kidney disease causes;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease, for which there is no \n     treatment or cure, is the leading genetic cause of kidney \n     failure in the United States and the 4th leading cause \n     overall;\n       Whereas the vast majority of polycystic kidney disease \n     patients reach kidney failure at an average age of 53, \n     causing a severe strain on dialysis and kidney \n     transplantation resources and on the delivery of health care \n     in the United States, as the largest segment of the \n     population of the United States, the ``baby boomers'', \n     continues to age;\n       Whereas end stage renal disease is one of the fastest \n     growing components of the Medicare budget, and polycystic \n     kidney disease contributes to that cost by an estimated \n     $2,000,000,000 annually for dialysis, kidney transplantation, \n     and related therapies;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a systemic disease \n     that causes damage to the kidney and the cardiovascular, \n     endocrine, hepatic, and gastrointestinal organ systems and \n     instills in patients a fear of an unknown future with a life-\n     threatening genetic disease and apprehension over possible \n     genetic discrimination;\n       Whereas the severity of the symptoms of polycystic kidney \n     disease and the limited public awareness of the disease cause \n     many patients to live in denial and forego regular visits to \n     their physicians or to avoid following good health management \n     which would help avoid more severe complications when kidney \n     failure occurs;\n       Whereas people who have chronic, life-threatening diseases \n     like polycystic kidney disease have a predisposition to \n     depression and its resultant consequences due to their \n     anxiety over pain, suffering, and premature death;\n       Whereas the Senate and taxpayers of the United States \n     desire to see treatments and cures for disease and would like \n     to see results from investments in research conducted by the \n     National Institutes of Health (NIH) and from such initiatives \n     as the NIH Roadmap to the Future;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a verifiable example \n     of how collaboration, technological innovation, scientific \n     momentum, and public-private partnerships can generate \n     therapeutic interventions that directly benefit polycystic \n     kidney disease sufferers, save billions of Federal dollars \n     under Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs for dialysis, \n     kidney transplants, immunosuppressant drugs, and related \n     therapies, and make available several thousand openings on \n     the kidney transplant waiting list;\n       Whereas improvements in diagnostic technology and the \n     expansion of scientific knowledge about polycystic kidney \n     disease have led to the discovery of the 3 primary genes that \n     cause polycystic kidney disease and the 3 primary protein \n     products of the genes and to the understanding of cell \n     structures and signaling pathways that cause cyst growth that \n     has produced multiple polycystic kidney disease clinical drug \n     trials;\n       Whereas there are thousands of volunteers nationwide who \n     are dedicated to expanding essential research, fostering \n     public awareness and understanding of polycystic kidney \n     disease, educating polycystic kidney disease patients and \n     their families about the disease to improve their treatment \n     and care, providing appropriate moral support, and \n     encouraging people to become organ donors;

and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to support National Polycystic Kidney \n     Disease Awareness Week through appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities, to promote public awareness of polycystic kidney \n     disease and to foster understanding of the impact of the \n     disease on patients and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/07/senate-section/article/S11279-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL PROSTATE CANCER AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  The resolution (S.

Board of Education of Topeka established that racial \n     segregation in public schools violated the Constitution of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas, in September 1957, 9 African-American students \n     (Minnijean Brown, Elizabeth Eckford, Ernest Green, Thelma \n     Mothershed, Melba Pattillo, Gloria Ray, Terrence Roberts, \n     Jefferson Thomas, and Carlotta Walls), known as the ``Little \n     Rock Nine'', became the first African-American students at \n     Little Rock Central High School;\n       Whereas the Little Rock Nine displayed tremendous strength, \n     determination, and courage despite enduring verbal and \n     physical abuse;\n       Whereas Little Rock Central High School was listed in the \n     National Register of Historic Places on August 19, 1977, and \n     was designated a National Historic Landmark on May 20, 1982;\n       Whereas, on November 6, 1998, Congress established the \n     Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site in the \n     State of Arkansas (Public Law 105-356), which is administered \n     in partnership with the National Park Service, the Little \n     Rock Public School System, the City of Little Rock, and other \n     entities;\n       Whereas, in 2007, Little Rock Central High School and the \n     Little Rock Central High School Integration 50th Anniversary \n     Commission will host events to commemorate the 50th \n     anniversary of the Little Rock Nine entering Little Rock \n     Central High School;\n       Whereas these events will include the opening of a new \n     visitors' center and museum, which will feature exhibits on \n     the Little Rock Nine and the road to desegregation; and\n       Whereas Little Rock Central High School continues to be \n     regarded as one of the best public high schools in the United \n     States, with students scoring above the national average on \n     the ACT, PSAT, and PLAN tests and receiving an average of \n     $3,000,000 in academic scholarships each year: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the extraordinary bravery and courage of the \n     Little Rock Nine, who helped expand opportunity and equality \n     in public education in Arkansas and throughout the United \n     States by becoming the first African-American students at \n     Little Rock Central High School;\n       (2) commemorates the 50th anniversary of the desegregation \n     of Little Rock Central High School, one of the most \n     significant events in the American civil rights movement;\n       (3) encourages all people of the United States to reflect \n     on the importance of this event; and\n       (4) acknowledges that continued efforts and resources \n     should be directed to enable all children to achieve equal \n     opportunity in education in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/07/senate-section/article/S11279-4", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11279-S11280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     ESTABLISHMENT OF A MUSEUM OF THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN DIPLOMACY\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

Res. 311) supporting the goals and ideals \n     of National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this resolution designates September as \n``National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.'' I am pleased to be joined \nby my colleagues, Senators Dole and Clinton, to shed some light on this \ndisease.\n  This year alone, ovarian cancer will be diagnosed in an estimated \n20,000 women, and approximately 15,000 more women will die of this \ndisease. Unfortunately, ovarian cancer is usually caught in an advanced \nstage, meaning there is only a 29 percent survival rate over five \nyears. We must acknowledge these statistics and overcome the challenges \nof diagnosing this deadly disease.\n  Earlier this year, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to meet \nwith nine-year survivor Carolyn Benivegna of Novi, Michigan. After \nbeing misdiagnosed by a number of doctors, Carolyn finally learned that \nshe had ovarian cancer. However, Carolyn is not letting the cancer run \nher life. Instead, she has become an advocate for the Survivors \nTeaching Students program, which aims to enhance medical students' \nunderstanding of the symptoms and risk factors of ovarian cancer to \nfacilitate early diagnosis and detection when they begin practicing \nmedicine. I am proud that both Michigan\n\n[[Page S11281]]\n\nState University and Wayne State University are starting Survivors \nTraining Students programs for their medical students.\n  While there is no definitive screening test, recent studies have \nshown common symptoms of ovarian cancer such as bloating, abdominal \npain, and difficulty eating. However, we must take active steps to \neducate the community and medical providers of the newest discoveries \nin prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of this disease.\n  Mr. President, by recognizing September as National Ovarian Cancer \nAwareness Month, we can show our support for ovarian cancer survivors \nand their families and join the fight to conquer this disease.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 311) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 311\n\n       Whereas ovarian cancer is the deadliest of all \n     gynecological cancers, and the reported incidence of ovarian \n     cancer is increasing over time;\n       Whereas ovarian cancer is the 5th leading cause of cancer \n     deaths among women in the United States;\n       Whereas all women are at risk for ovarian cancer, and 90 \n     percent of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer do not have a \n     family history that puts them at higher risk;\n       Whereas the Pap smear is sensitive and specific to the \n     early detection of cervical cancer, but not to ovarian \n     cancer;\n       Whereas there is currently no reliable and easy-to-\n     administer screening test used for the early detection of \n     ovarian cancer;\n       Whereas many people are unaware that the symptoms of \n     ovarian cancer often include bloating, pelvic or abdominal \n     pain, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, and urinary \n     symptoms, among several other symptoms that are easily \n     confused with other diseases;\n       Whereas due to the lack of a reliable early screening test, \n     75 percent of cases of ovarian cancer are detected at an \n     advanced stage, when the 5-year survival rate is only 50 \n     percent, a much lower rate than for many other cancers;\n       Whereas if ovarian cancer is diagnosed and treated at an \n     early stage before the cancer spreads outside of the ovary, \n     the treatment is potentially less costly, and the survival \n     rate is as high as 90 percent;\n       Whereas there are factors that are known to reduce the risk \n     for ovarian cancer and play an important role in the \n     prevention of the disease;\n       Whereas awareness and early recognition of ovarian cancer \n     symptoms are currently the best way to save women's lives;\n       Whereas the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance, during the \n     month of September, holds a number of events to increase \n     public awareness of ovarian cancer; and\n       Whereas a National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month should be \n     designated to increase the awareness of the public regarding \n     the cancer: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports the goals and ideals of \n     National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/07/senate-section/article/S11281-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 2007\n\n  Mr. BROWN.
