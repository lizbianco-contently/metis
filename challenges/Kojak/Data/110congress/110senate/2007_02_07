Mr. President, the Senate will begin morning business in \njust a few minutes, with the time until 2 p.m. equally divided and \ncontrolled between the two leaders or their designees. The first 30 \nminutes this morning will be controlled by the minority, and then the \nmajority will control, of course, the next 30 minutes. We are going to \ndo the best we can to alternate back and forth.\n  Yesterday, we had a nice debate. When a Democrat wasn't here, a \nRepublican moved in and vice versa. It worked out well with the time.\n  I announced last night that I intended to have the Senate proceed \nthis afternoon to executive session to consider a number of Executive \nCalendar nominations. I had spoken to the Republican leader prior to \nmaking that announcement and told him I wanted to consider GEN George \nCasey and ADM William Fallon to be voted on today or tomorrow. I expect \nthere will be debate with respect to the Casey nomination. We have had \nword that on the minority side there are a number of statements they \nwish to have made, and I am confident there will be some over here, \nalso. We will make a decision at a later time whether we should have \ntime agreements or just move forward with these.\n  Let me just say a few words about what is going on in the Senate and \nhas been going on over the last few days. As we all know, the \nPresident, in giving a speech, said he wanted to move a significant \nnumber more of American troops to Iraq. As a result of that, there have \nbeen efforts made to have the Senate vote on whether that is \nappropriate. We have been unable to arrive at that point, which is \nsomewhat surprising because the people who helped write the amendment \nvoted against proceeding to debate on that amendment. People whose \nnames are associated with that amendment decided not to proceed to vote \non that amendment.\n  I think it speaks volumes that there has been almost nothing said by \nthe minority about supporting the surge. There have been no speeches \nover here supporting the surge. In fact, late yesterday there was a \nproposal to not even have a vote on supporting the surge.\n  That is where we are. The House is going to take up this matter next \nweek. They will send this over to us, and in due time we will try to \nget to this matter. But it is pretty clear that one reason for the \nslowdown here is to allow the President to move troops over there. The \nmore troops moved over there prior to this vote, the more difficult it \nis to say don't send the troops--when he has already sent them. But \nthere are other ways to approach this issue in Iraq.\n  Just a matter of hours ago, a Sea Knight helicopter was shot down \nover Baghdad, the fifth helicopter shot down in the last 2 weeks. We \ndon't know how many Americans are dead in this latest incident. We do \nnot know because the military has not announced it. We do know these \nSea Knight helicopters--they are called CH-46s--are used by the Marines \nprimarily as a cargo and troop transport, and they carry as many as 25 \ncombat-loaded troops.\n  We also know that the administration submitted its budget, requesting \nanother $245 billion in the war in Iraq and other matters relating to \nthe military, bringing the total to well over\n\n[[Page S1656]]\n\n$500 billion. In fact, we learned yesterday that the United States had \nshipped money to Mr. Bremer, Ambassador Bremer, to disburse money to \nIraqi ministries. How much money? It was 363 tons of money in hundred-\ndollar bills--363 tons. There is some dispute as to how many hundred-\ndollar bills it takes to make 363 tons, and they really don't know \nexactly how much money that is, but it is around $12 billion, most of \nwhich is not accounted for. I guess $12 billion, when you compare it to \n$500 billion, is not very much, but I think the American people \nunderstand that 363 tons of cash, hundred-dollar bills, is a lot of \nmoney.\n\n  We also know from reading the morning paper that the Associated Press \nreports:\n\n       More Americans have been killed in combat in Iraq over the \n     last 4 months than in any comparable stretch since the war \n     began.\n\n  To say the war isn't going well is an understatement. To say there is \na civil war going on in Iraq is an understatement. I really think it is \nunfortunate that we have been unable to vote on whether the surge \nshould take place. Senators have not been allowed to cast their vote on \nthis issue, and because of that, we are going to move on to the \ncontinuing resolution this afternoon--late this evening, I should say, \nafter we finish these two important Executive Calendar matters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/07/senate-section/article/S1656-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Listening to my good friend, the majority leader, \nshould remind us all that the debate we had anticipated having this \nweek--and I might say Members on our side were certainly prepared to \nhave the debate--would not have had any impact on the surge. These were \nnonbinding resolutions. I would not argue that they were not \nsignificant, because Senators would have been put on record. But we \nwere certainly prepared for the debate. What we were not prepared to do \nis to have a process that denied our side other options in addition to \nthe Levin proposal.\n  As we were frequently reminded last year by Democratic Senators, the \nSenate is different from the House. In the Senate, a minority of at \nleast 41 can insist on a process that is fair.\n  Senate Republicans were united, including members of our conference \nwho support the Levin proposal, in insisting on a fair process. We \nstarted out with five different options, gradually pared them down to \ntwo--the McCain-Lieberman-Graham proposal and the Gregg proposal \nrelating to supporting the troops. My good friend, the majority leader, \nobjected to allowing us to have two proposals. He only wanted us to \nhave one proposal. So we narrowed it down to one and picked the Gregg \n``support the troops'' proposal as our one, and the majority leader \nobjected to that unanimous consent request as well, leading us to \nbelieve that not only did he want us to limit ourselves to one, he \nwanted to pick which one. Of course, in the Senate, that is just not \npossible. This is a deliberative body. It insists on having votes on a \nwide variety of proposals. Certainly, when we were in the majority last \nyear, we had to vote on a lot of things we might not have liked to have \nvoted on in order to advance a particular proposal. That is the way the \nSenate works.\n  At whatever point the majority would like to begin the debate again \non Iraq, we will certainly be happy to have it. I particularly wish to \nthank Senator Gregg for his very important contribution to this debate. \nThat is a vote we will have at some point, on some measure, when we \nreturn to the subject of Iraq.\n  With regard to the continuing resolution, let me just say to the \nmajority leader, he has suggested that I survey our members and see \nwhat amendments we might like to offer, since he has indicated \namendments may or may not be allowed on that proposal. I would say to \nhim we are paring that down and hope to be able to get him--we have \nabout seven; we are going to try to pare that down to three, submit \nthose amendments to the majority leader, and hope they might be allowed \nwhen we do move to the continuing resolution.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, we would also see what \namendments, if any, we want to offer on this side--maybe three and \nthree or whatever we can come up with that appears to move the ball \nalong.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I was pleased to hear just a moment ago the \nsuggestion that maybe we go to the Omnibus appropriations bill in such \na way that would allow some amendments to be offered on both sides. \nThat is good. That is the way it ought to be. That is why I have been \nsurprised and, frankly, disappointed that we have not been able to come \nto some sort of agreement about how to proceed to these resolutions \ndealing with the President's plan to take action in Iraq and have a \nfull debate on the substance.\n\n  Of the plan and the resolutions, I don't think there is any excuse \nfor the fact that we have come to the point where we are throwing up \nour hands and saying: I can't have it my way, you can't have it your \nway, therefore, we will have it no way.\n  If this were the Super Bowl, whether you were Grossman or Manning, \nyou would call a time out and say, wait a minute here, there has got to \nbe a way we can get a plan to go forward. I know how difficult it is to \ndo this because our leaders on both sides of the aisle get pressured \nfrom all sides. They are pulled. Don't agree to that, you have to agree \nto that.\n  In the end, the leaders have to decide how we go forward in a fair \nand an open way, and the rest of us have to support that decision. The \nmajority has strong power in the House of Representatives, and a good \nbit in the Senate. But I think the most difficult job in the city is \nthe job of being majority leader, the job that Senator Reid has right \nnow because he doesn't have a Rules Committee. He is not the President. \nHe can't give an order and have the bureaucracy move, not that the \nbureaucracy ever moves. He has to work with the minority. He has to \nfind a way to move things forward.\n  Some people say: Oh, that is the process. Look, the process is \nsubstance because if you can't figure out how to get it done, you never \nget to the substance. This is not an autocracy. No one person possesses \nunlimited power. You have got to give to get a little. You can't have a \ndeal where you say: No, no, you can't offer but one amendment; and, by \nthe way, it has to be this.\n  If we were going to do anything, we should have gone with more, not \nless. So I don't get it. If this is the big, important, serious issue \nwe all say it is, surely we could have worked out a way to proceed. \nWell, I guess the one thing we could say is, we will get back to this. \nWe are going to get back to it in many different ways. But at least in \nthe future, when we get to the debate, it is going to be a serious \ndebate about something that is real.\n  We were talking about taking up resolutions that had no binding \neffect. It was a feel-good deal. Yeah, we are going to take a pop at \nthe President. Yeah, we support the troops, but no, we don't support \nthe troops.\n  Oh, yes, thank you very much, General Petraeus, 81 to nothing, you \nare confirmed. Go over to Iraq. Oh, and by the way, we don't agree with \nwhat you are going to try to do. We don't support the plan. How did we \nget into that?\n  At least at some point, men and women of strong principle and beliefs \nare going to offer up amendments that are going to say: Support the \ntroops, stick with the plan or pull out. High tail it out. Get out of \nthere now. And then we will have a real debate and we will have real \nvotes. That is what, under our Constitution, we should be doing, \nactually.\n  I think the proposal that Senator Gregg had, made eminent good sense. \nLet's show we support the troops. Gee whiz, why is that a bad idea? The \nAmerican people don't want to send our troops into harm's way around \nthe world or even in Baghdad without knowing we are behind them.\n  So what is the problem? The problem is that it was able to get 80, I \ndon't\n\n[[Page S1657]]\n\nknow, or 90 votes. We can't have that vote because later on we may want \nto actually cut off the funds to the troops. There are some little, \nbitty twists of language, too, such as we support funding for the \ntroops in the field. What does that mean, ``in the field''? What if you \nare on the way? What if you are in a brigade that is pulling out of \nTexas now or pulling out of Kentucky or that has landed in Kuwait? We \ndon't support them. There are too many nuances.\n  Let me get away from process and talk about substance. We have a \nproblem in Iraq. A lot of people now have shifted their position and \nare saying: Well, I voted for it earlier, but I am against it now. \nYeah, it has gotten tough, so I don't like it.\n  Everybody says change the status quo. I had a chance to talk to some \nworld leaders recently in Switzerland and they were saying: My \ngoodness, you can't do that, can't do this, can't do something else.\n  I said: Here is the choice: Stay, leave or do what?\n  They said: No, you can't leave. You have to stay. Well, what do you \npropose? Deafening silence. The President understood we had to change \nthe status quo. Action had to be taken. A plan had to be developed. He \nproposed a plan. He met with us. He came to the Congress. He spoke at \nthe State of the Union: Here is what I propose to do. Give this plan a \nchance. Give the plan a chance.\n  And General Petraeus, maybe the General Grant of this war, or the \nGeneral Washington of a previous war--this is the man of the hour, and \nI hope and pray the good Lord will guide him in the right way because \nhe has a serious challenge before him.\n  But this is not just about a surge, although that is a part of the \nplan. This is a plan with at least three other key components. But ask \nyourself, we say to the Iraqis: You have to get a political solution. \nEverybody is saying: No, we will never get a military solution without \na political and economic solution.\n  Well, yeah. But how do you get a political solution in chaos? How can \nyou get a political solution when your capital is being blown up every \nday by insurgents of all stripes? You have got to get a grip on \nsecurity. It is similar to here in our Nation's Capital. We couldn't \nhave orderly Government if we didn't have order. So we are going to try \nto send in the best we have, under the best general we have, and get \nsome control of the violence and the chaos in Baghdad and then give the \nIraqis a chance to deal with the politics.\n\n  Am I convinced all of this is going to work? I don't know. I am not \nthe best expert in the world. I have been on the Armed Services \nCommittee, I have been on Intelligence. I have been around awhile. But \nI am not going to impose my military judgment on a man such as General \nPetraeus. But let's see if the politics will not work. There is a lot \nof pressure. They know, they know.\n  I met with the Vice President of Iraq recently and he was talking \nabout: Well, what is your strategic plan? I said: No, sir. Excuse me. \nWith all due respect, it is not about what is our plan. What is your \nplan? It is your country, your Government. When are you going to ante \nup and kick in, in a way that brings leadership and order out of all of \nthis?\n  So the second part of the President's plan is for different rules of \nengagement. It is for a requirement that some political achievements be \nreached. That is why I like the McCain-Lieberman-Graham proposal. I \nlike benchmarks. So the question is: It is one thing to lay down \nbenchmarks, but what if they don't meet them? Then, you decide. If we \nconclude it would not work, that they can't govern themselves, then we \nhave to go with the next plan. Somebody said: Well, this is the last \nplan. It is never the last plan. There is always another plan.\n  But the politics, I think, we can be successful. We certainly have to \ntry. I do think that regional solutions--getting particular provinces \nunder control or particular sectors under control, getting generals in \nfor different sectors--makes good sense. But also the economy. Look at \nAmerica where you have people who are not working. Their life is \ninsecure. They get into trouble. I understand that 40 percent of the \nyoung men in Baghdad don't have a job. There has to be a better job \ndone of getting the money--the oil money--fairly distributed and done \nin an economic way that will create jobs so that these young men and \nwomen will not be bored and looking for ways to kill themselves.\n  Mr. President, we should have found a way to go forward with this \ndebate. I don't quite understand what is going on. Maybe we are all \nhaving to learn a little different roles of who is in the majority and \nwho is in the minority and how it works. I know for sure that in some \nrespects it is easier to be in the minority than to in the majority.\n  The majority leader has to be--he has to be tough. He has to eat a \nlittle crow every now and then. He has to be prepared to say to the \nRepublicans: We will find a way to work this out. You have to keep \npoking at it. Somehow or another, we didn't want to do it this time. I \ndon't know. Maybe everybody is going to leave the field and say we won. \nThis is not about winning or losing. This shouldn't be about the \npolitical winner or who won the PR battle.\n  We are playing with lives. America's finest. I think we should \nsupport them, as Senator Gregg proposes. We need to give the plan the \nPresident has developed a chance because nobody else has come up with a \nbetter plan, other than pull back at the borders. What good is that? \nWhich way are we going to shoot? To me, that is the worst of all \nworlds.\n  We can make this work, but the President, General Petraeus, our \ntroops, the American people need our support and our confidence in what \nwe are attempting.\n  We can go on and have the debate today about these nominees--two good \nmen. We can turn to the omnibus appropriations and find a way to get it \ndone with order.\n  Nobody wants to play games. Nobody should be trying to say: Oh, if \nyou don't do it this way, or my way, you are trying to shut down the \nGovernment. Nobody should be saying we are going to filibuster if we \ndon't get everything we want.\n  This is the Senate. You have got to give everybody their chances. You \nhave to have some order out of the chaos. This is sort of similar to \nBaghdad. Sometimes we get divided up into provinces. I appreciate the \nefforts that have been made, but the important thing is not the process \nin the Senate. The important thing is what our men and women are going \nto be trying to do in Iraq. Let's give this plan a chance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the advice and counsel of my \nfriend from Mississippi. He certainly has the experience to offer \nsuggestions, having served in various capacities in leadership. I have \nbeen with him. He is a pleasant man to work with, and I like him very \nmuch. But I would suggest, this morning, that we not use Super Bowl \nterminology and Manning and Grossman because I think, if we do that, we \nwould find we would have a lot of objection if suddenly we looked \naround and Grossman was using a baseball or basketball rather than a \nfootball. I think what they have tried to do is change the rules in the \nmiddle of the game, and they are playing around with this procedural \nargument.\n  I have to acknowledge to my friend from Mississippi that the people \nover there who are trying to make the President not look bad had a \nlittle victory because they have been able to stall and stall. As a \nresult of that, soldiers are being shipped, as we speak, without the \nSenate having to take a vote on whether that surge should take place. \nSo in that respect, their stalling has probably benefited the \nPresident.\n  As far as process, we have worked through the ethics bill, the \nminimum wage bill, and even though there were cloture motions filed and \ncloture not invoked, finally, we were able to get those things passed. \nBut I think debate on the surge would have been very important. We have \nbeen denied that. I understand the rules of the Senate.\n  My friend from Mississippi also says we should be doing something \nthat is real. I tried to talk about something real this morning. More \nAmerican troops were killed in combat in Iraq over the past 4 months \nthan in any comparable stretch since the war began--334 dead American \nsoldiers,\n\n[[Page S1658]]\n\nmen and women, with mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters and \nhusbands and wives.\n\n  I think over the last few days, though, there has been a deafening \nsilence, and people standing here and saying what the President is \ndoing is the right thing to do, because it hasn't been the right thing \nto do, what the President has been doing, and he wants to continue more \nof the same.\n  I understand we are now at a point where we are going to talk about a \ncouple of important nominations. We are going to try to get our fiscal \nhouse in order, which is not in order, because unless we do something \nby February 15, basically the Government closes. This is very unusual. \nI have spoken with the distinguished Republican leader, and one thing \nwe are going to work on together this year, once we get out of this \nsituation with the continuing resolution, is to work together to try to \npass appropriations bills. That is good for the institution and good \nfor the country. We are going to try to do that. It may require some \nlate nights and long weeks, but we are going to do that. We have 13 \nappropriations bills, and we are going to work very hard to get them \npassed.\n  So I am terribly disappointed we haven't had the opportunity to vote \non Senator Warner's and Senator Levin's resolution, and on the McCain \nresolution, but we have heard enough about that. We are not going to be \nable to do that, and we will move on to other things.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Briefly, it is hard for me to remember how many times \nwe were told by the other side last year that you come to the Senate to \ncast tough votes, but I don't think Senator Gregg's vote was a tough \nvote. Why would it be a tough vote to vote on supporting the troops? To \nme, that is an easy vote. We all will be forced, because of the process \nin the Senate, to cast votes we don't like. If you are in the majority, \nyou get more of those than when you are in the minority. I can't \nimagine being, in effect, afraid of voting on the Gregg amendment to \nsupport the troops. That would be one of the easiest votes we ever cast \naround here.\n\n  Let me conclude by saying I am disappointed, as other members of my \nparty in the Senate are disappointed, we are not having the Iraq debate \nthis week. The distinguished minority whip, in his remarks, summed it \nup quite well. We will continue to talk about this important subject. \nThere is no more important subject in the country right now. I know we \nwill be debating other proposals in the coming months.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. I was just wondering if the Republican leader, and I ask \nthis question through the Chair, believes that the Democratic leader is \ncorrect in his characterization that we have stopped this in a \nprocedural manner. Is it not true that the Democratic leader controls \nthe procedure as to whether there would be a vote? And is it not true, \nalso, that we agreed to the Democratic leader's request that we offer \nonly one amendment but that we just ask we be able to choose our \namendment, and they be able to choose their amendment?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator is entirely correct. We kept paring down \nthe options that we wanted to offer in the course of this debate on the \nmost important issue in the country. And at the end, as the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire just suggested, we were down to two: one that the \nmajority leader and most of his party favor--and some of ours--and the \namendment of the Senator from New Hampshire in support of the troops.\n  Apparently, the majority wanted to tell us which amendment we would \noffer.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/07/senate-section/article/S1658-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to, once again, state the situation. \nIt has been very well stated by the Republican leader. The simple fact \nis, we, as members of the minority, requested the right to offer an \nalternative to the proposal of the majority. That is not an unusual \nevent in the Senate. In fact, it is the purpose of the Senate to debate \ndifferent approaches.\n  What we asked as an alternative was very simple, straight forward \nlanguage. Let me read it again. It simply stated:\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that Congress should not \n     take any action that will endanger the United States military \n     forces in the field, including the elimination or reduction \n     of funds for troops in the field, as such action with respect \n     to funding would undermine the safety or harm their \n     effectiveness in pursuing their assigned missions.\n\n  All this language says is that whether you agree with the President \nor whether you disagree with the President, whether you support a \ncommitment of more troops or you don't support a commitment of more \ntroops, once the troops are on the ground in the fight, we are going to \ngive them the financial support, the logistical support, the equipment \nthat they need in order to protect themselves and pursue their mission \neffectively.\n  Members do not have to support the President to support this \nlanguage. It is not designed to state the President is right or the \nPresident is wrong. It is simply language designed to say that an \nAmerican soldier deserves the support of the Congress of the United \nStates. That is an elementary responsibility of this Senate.\n  The fact that the Democratic leadership will not allow Members to \nvote on this simple statement of support for American troops is a \ntransgression on the purposes of the Senate, which is to express itself \nrelative to the actions of our soldiers in the field and how we will \nsupport them.\n  It is literally impossible to address the debate on Iraq without \naddressing the most fundamental issue, which is whether our troops are \ngoing to be supported when they are asked to defend us in the field. \nThe idea that we can decouple the support for the troops from the issue \nof policy is absurd on its face, and the position of the Democratic \nleadership that we should not address the issue of supporting the \ntroops when we address the issue of whether the tactics being pursued \nby the military commanders in the field are correct--which doesn't \nhappen to be the responsibility of Congress; that is the responsibility \nof the commanders--is by nature inconceivable, inconsistent, and simply \nnot defensive.\n  In fact, it is so absurd on its face that I would simply quote the \nnational commander of the American Legion, Mr. Paul Morin, who says:\n\n       We will not separate the war from the warrior.\n\n  That is what this is about: whether the Democratic leadership takes \nthe truly indefensible position that in a debate on the issue of Iraq, \nwe do not discuss the support for the person we are asking to go out \nand defend this Nation.\n  What this really comes down to is very simple. This resolution would \nhave received broad bipartisan support in this Senate. That is because \nthere are very few Members in this Senate--I would guess virtually \nnone--who don't believe that our obligation as a Senate, as a \nlegislative body which funds the military, that our obligation is to \ngive the soldiers in the field what they need in order to defend \nthemselves and carry out their mission.\n\n  So rather than have a vote on our amendment which would have received \na large majority in this Senate--much\n\n[[Page S1659]]\n\nlarger than the proposal put forward as their proposal--they decided \nnot to have a vote at all. Then they claimed that we were responsible \nfor slowing the process.\n  How inconsistent and indefensible is that statement: I don't have the \nvotes; therefore, I will not allow a vote to happen. But it is your \nfault that I am not allowing the vote to happen. Really? That only \nmakes sense if you happen to be a true partisan and believe this debate \nshould be a partisan debate.\n  Somehow my language has been described as ``partisan,'' and the other \nlanguage has been described as ``bipartisan,'' but the other language \nhas fewer votes than my language. No, this is not true. It is simply a \nfact that the other side of the aisle does not wish to put their \nmembership in a position of voting for a simple resolution that calls \nfor the support of our troops.\n  That is an unfortunate statement on where the Democratic Party is \ntoday relative to support for the efforts of soldiers in the field. It \nis hard for me to conceive that there are folks within the community of \ninterest in Washington who feel so strongly about their dislike for the \nPresident or his policies that they are unwilling to go on record in \nsupport of the soldier who is fighting for us on the streets of \nBaghdad. But that is the essence of the problem. That is why we are not \ngoing to have a vote in the Senate. It is not that the Republican \nmembership has in some way stalled this process. The Republican leader \nhas gone out of his way, he has gone well beyond what many in our party \nbelieve maybe we should have done in trying to be accommodating to the \ninsistence of the Democratic leadership that there be no opposition to \nthe one item that they want to bring to the Senate floor.\n  In my experience in the Senate, when something is brought to the \nfloor of the Senate as controversial as the discussion of how we pursue \na war and a war policy, there are going to be a lot of amendments. But \nthe Senate leadership, under the Democratic leader, has said, no, not \nonly will there not be a lot of amendments, there will only be one \namendment from our side, and we on the Democratic side will pick the \namendment on the Republican side that they can offer, and we will let \nthem offer that but nothing else.\n  The Republican leader, in an attempt to be responsive, said, OK, if \nthere are only going to be two amendments, we will pick the amendment. \nAnd the amendment will simply say that whether you support the \nPresident, whether you support his policies, at least you can say you \nsupport the troops, the soldiers who are asked to go out and protect \nAmerica and walk the streets of Baghdad.\n  But that was a bridge too far for the Democratic leader, a bridge too \nfar for the Democratic membership because they did not want to take \nthat vote even though that would have been a bipartisan vote and would \nhave received significantly more votes than the Democratic proposal.\n  I don't think there should be any confusion about why we aren't \nhaving a vote. We are not having a vote because more people would vote \nfor my amendment than would vote for their amendment, and they don't \nwant to embarrass their membership by having to have them vote for my \namendment even though there is nothing controversial about it, unless \nyou consider supporting troops in the field, giving them what they need \nto fight and defend themselves, to be controversial.\n  It is an ironic situation. I thank the Republican leader for having \noffered me the opportunity to bring this amendment forward and for \nmaking it fairly clear that we as a membership are willing to be \nreasonable; that we only ask for a vote on something that we think is \nimportant while they ask for a vote on something they think is \nimportant.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. How much time does the minority have remaining in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, would you advise me when I have used 6 \nminutes, and I will defer to my other colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the majority leader this morning said \nwithin my hearing that there is no support for the surge. I don't know \nwhy he would say that because, in fact, not only have Members of this \nSenate unanimously supported, through the confirmation hearing of GEN \nDavid Petreaus, one of the people who certainly will be instrumental in \nexecuting that surge, but that is what we have been debating for these \nlast weeks, indeed, months: what the new plan should be in Iraq, to \ndeal with what is, obviously, an unacceptable status quo.\n  I am tempted to wonder out loud if, rather than talking about issues \nthat really matter--such as the issue that the Senator from New \nHampshire has asked for a vote on but been denied, whether we will \nsupport our troops and refuse to cut off funding while we send them in \nharm's way--we are seeing a bunch of spin doctoring going on.\n  But when the majority leader says there is no support for the surge, \nI would simply disagree because, in fact, at least one of the \namendments that has been offered that we have been denied an \nopportunity to vote on, as the majority leader has done what he is \nentitled to do, which is to move on to other subjects and to set the \nSenate agenda, one of those amendments would, in fact, support General \nPetreaus and the plan he has taken upon himself to execute in Iraq that \nwe are sending, over a period of time, additional reinforcements to \nsecure Baghdad.\n  So there is substantial support for this plan. The problem is, I am \ntempted to believe there are some who have simply given up, who don't \nbelieve there is any chance of success in Iraq. The problem is, those \nwho have expressed such defeatism, who in this contest of wills say we \nsimply lost ours, have not talked one bit about the consequences of \ngiving up, the huge humanitarian crisis that would occur, the ethnic \ncleansing that would occur, the fact that another failed state in the \nMiddle East, as in Afghanistan before it, could serve as a launching \npad for recruiting and training and exporting of terrorist attacks.\n  Standing here and suggesting that defeat is something we will accept \nis, to my view, not a responsible position to take.\n  So I disagree with those who simply say we have no chance to turn \nthings around. There are those who say ad nauseam that there is ``no \nmilitary solution in Iraq.'' I would commend to them an article that \nwas written by Victor Davis Hanson that is entitled ``Give Petraeus a \nChance.'' Mr. Hanson says:\n\n     . . . in fact, only a military blow to the insurgency will \n     allow the necessary window for the government to gain time, \n     trust, and confidence to press ahead with reform and \n     services.\n\n  So, as General Petraeus said, we are engaged in a test of wills. How \ncould it possibly be that we have lost our own will to protect \nAmerica's national security, to prevent a regional conflict that will \ninevitably, if it occurs, cost us more in treasure and blood? How is it \nthat America could possibly have lost its will?\n  I think the Senator from New Hampshire made a good point a moment ago \nwhen he said the reason why the majority leader has now taken us off of \nthis issue--which, again, is his sole prerogative as majority leader; \nthat is the power a majority leader has--that the reason we have not \nbeen given a chance to vote on the Gregg amendment that says we will \nnot cut off funds, we will not fail to support our troops on the \nmission they have volunteered to undertake, and which we have sent them \non--the real reason, as the Washington Post reported, Senator Gregg's \namendment was not allowed to be voted on is because his amendment is \nlikely the ``only measure that could attract 60 votes.''\n  The USA Today said the majority leader opposed allowing a vote on the \namendment because it could have resulted in a situation where the \nSenate would have been on record opposing cuts in funding for the \ntroops but not the President's policy.\n  I think it is absolutely imperative--whether it is today or tomorrow \nor next week or next month, or all of the above--we make it very clear \nwe will not ever cut off our support for the men and women who have \nundertaken this dangerous mission.\n\n[[Page S1660]]\n\n  When I went out to Walter Reed on Monday to visit some of the injured \nveterans of the Iraq conflict, I could not help but be struck by the \nsort of surreality of that. Here are young men and women who have lost \nlimbs, and many, unfortunately, have lost their lives volunteering to \nprotect us and to bring stability to the Middle East and to allow the \nIraqis a better life. They have risked it all, and some have paid that \nultimate sacrifice. Yet here in the Senate----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 6 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I would ask for 1 remaining minute by \nunanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. And here we are in the Senate this week debating about \nnonbinding resolutions and avoiding the tough votes on whether we will \ncut off funds to support this mission. Instead, we engage in the \ncontinued surreal environment of this Senate by saying: OK, now we have \nconfirmed General Petraeus, one of the people who is going to execute \nthis plan in Iraq. But now, today, we are going to also vote on Admiral \nFallon, the head of Central Command, General Petraeus's commander, who \nwill also be in charge of this mission, and GEN George Casey, who has \nbeen in charge of coalition forces. Do you know what I predict? We will \nconfirm, as we did General Petraeus, Admiral Fallon and General Casey, \nand yet there are some who stand up here in the Senate and elsewhere \nand have the temerity to say: We support you, but we do not support the \nmission we have asked you to execute.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask that the Chair inform me when I \nhave used 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, clearly, without doubt, without question, the war in \nIraq is the leading concern of the American people, as well it should \nbe. It is a very difficult situation, and a situation that will define \nour future and our security for years to come. Because it is the \ndominant, the leading concern of the American people, without any close \nsecond, I think it is imperative we have a debate and votes on this \ncrucial question.\n  I would urge the majority leader to come back to the floor and engage \nin this debate and move forward with this discussion and accept the \nvery reasonable compromise of the minority leader in narrowing down all \nof the universe of ideas and resolutions to simply two.\n  I will freely admit that is not my first preference in terms of this \ndebate. I had always heard before coming here 2 years ago that the \nSenate was about open debate, unlimited debate, the ability to get your \nideas and your amendments and your resolutions to the floor with very \nfew limits. So I thought, particularly in the context of this very \nserious situation in Iraq, we needed an open debate, we needed more \nideas, not fewer, we needed every significant vote that should be \ntaken.\n  So that was my preference: unlimited debate. But the majority leader \nrejected that, only would allow very limited votes, very limited \ndebate. At the end of the day--again, it was not my first choice, but \nat the end of the day, the minority leader said: OK, you want two \nvotes--only two votes--OK. Let's focus on two proposals. Let's have \njust two votes. But our choice for our one proposal will be the Gregg \namendment because we feel so strongly about supporting our troops in \nthe field. And then the majority leader said no, I can't accept that. I \nneed to choose your proposal. I need to choose what you want to put up \nfor a vote.\n\n  That is not the tradition of the Senate. And, more importantly, that \nis not treating this very serious issue, the dominant concern among all \nAmericans, bar none, properly. We need to debate this issue now. We \nneed to vote on this issue now. Again, I urge the majority leader to \ncome back to the floor and engage in this debate this week--now--\nbecause the country is concerned now about Iraq. The country has \nquestions, understandably, now about the President's plan. And our \ntroops in the field have questions and uncertainty now about whether we \nwill be standing shoulder to shoulder with them no matter what policy \nis adopted.\n  Again, I think the minority leader's proposal yesterday bent over \nbackwards--compromise and compromise and compromise--to reach an \nability to have this debate we must have on the floor of the Senate. We \nwanted far more than two proposals debated. We wanted far more than two \nvotes. But we accepted the majority leader's number. We accepted the \nmajority leader's parameters of just two proposals, just two votes. But \nsurely the minority gets to choose one of those two proposals to \ndiscuss, particularly given that this Gregg proposal has broad \nbipartisan support.\n  So let's have this Iraq debate that we must have. Let's have key \nvotes that we must have. And let's do it now. I urge the majority \nleader, again, not to give up, not to reject this very reasonable \ncompromise, bending over backwards by the minority leader to agree to \nhis number of two. Let's take that up. Let's have this debate. Let's \nhave crucial votes. The American people deserve that, given the very \ntough situation in Iraq. And our men and women in uniform sure as heck \ndeserve that. They sure as heck deserve to hear from us: OK, we know \nsome of you are for the President's surge plan; we know some of you are \nagainst it. But what about supporting whatever troops are put in the \nfield? They sure as heck deserve an answer to that question. And they \ncertainly deserve that reassurance.\n  Let's have that fair debate, and let's have it now.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, it is interesting that we would be \npreparing today to have a debate that will not be taking place, and it \nwill not be taking place because it is the prerogative of the \nleadership to set the agenda of what we do discuss and debate.\n  I agree with my colleagues who have requested an opportunity to have \na full airing of the views, to have a full debate, to have an \nopportunity to express our support for the men and women in the field, \nin addition to whatever else we might want to debate on this topic of \nthe most important issue facing our country today.\n  But getting beyond the procedural and the tit for tat that so often \nsignifies what Washington is about, what fundamentally is this debate \nabout? It is about the global war on terror. It is about the events \nthat unfolded in our country on the morning of September 11, 2001, and \nthe aftermath of all of that, the things that have occurred as our \nNation has responded to the attacks that were brought upon our shores, \nas we have sought to carry out this difficult mission, but one in which \nwe must not waiver, which is this war on terror.\n  As a result of this war on terror, our troops are in Iraq today, \nwhere they have removed a dictator from power and where they have \nconfronted the enemy, which regardless of how someone might have felt \nabout the original decision to go into Iraq, today we are there and we \nare engaging an enemy that is the very enemy that attacked us here on \n9/11.\n  It is known that in Al Anbar Province it is fundamentally an al-Qaida \noperation. So to send additional reinforcements to Al Anbar Province to \ndefeat al-Qaida in Iraq is in the best interests of this Nation. It is \nin our national interest to pacify, to bring some peace to Baghdad, \nwhich is the capital city of Iraq, which is essential to the peace and \nsecurity of that nation, of that budding democracy that is attempting \nto put itself on its feet, and to bring some stability to that capital \ncity by additional reinforcements of American troops in a new plan I \nthink is reasonable.\n  We cannot get so focused on whether some in this body cannot work \nwith this President, do not want to support any of his policies. But \nlet's look at the people who are going to carry out this policy, the \ngenerals who are going to be in the field.\n  In the past few days, as has been stated, we have approved by a \nnear--well, I guess it was unanimous; it was 81 to 0, I believe--the \nsending of General Petraeus as our new commander of\n\n[[Page S1661]]\n\nallied forces in Iraq. I recall his testimony in the Armed Services \nCommittee where he clearly said he believed in this plan and thought it \nhad a reasonable chance of success. Why would we not give a reasonable \nchance of success a chance to succeed? Why would we not stand behind \nour men and women who are willing to go into harm's way to carry out \nthis plan and see if they have an opportunity to succeed?\n  The goal of this new plan is threefold. First, we have to have some \nstability in Baghdad. We have to continue to defeat al-Qaida in Al \nAnbar Province. But then beyond that there are other elements to the \nplan. There obviously needs to be a political reconciliation. There \nneeds to be a political settlement. But that will never take place if \nthere is not some modicum of stability, if we do not bring down the \nsectarian violence and other violence in Iraq to a manageable level.\n  We then have an opportunity for the political settlement to take \nplace between the Shias and Sunnis, and the Kurds in the north, so they \ncan all come together and begin to bind as a new nation, as a new \ncountry, as a new government--a government, by the way, that has only \nbeen in place about 9 months.\n  In addition to that, we then have a third angle to this, which I \nthink is so vitally important, which is the economic reconstruction, \nthe economic development, the opportunity for there to be jobs, for \nthere to be opportunities for folks to find a way to make a better life \nfor themselves and their children, so they can reach their aspirations, \nand do it in an atmosphere of freedom, do it in an atmosphere of \ndemocracy and respect for one another. That is the goal.\n  What would happen if we do not give this plan a chance, if we do not \nsee if it has an opportunity to carry out and have an opportunity for \nsuccess? What is the alternative? Well, we would then have failed in \nthis test of wills. Our enemies have clearly stated they believe if \nthey kill enough Americans, if they cause enough grief to our mothers, \nif they cause enough harm to our troops, we will not stand up, we will \nmove on, we will find an easier way, and we will not resist those who \nwould bring the destruction of our country upon us.\n  Their stated aims are very clear. They want us out of the Middle \nEast. They want to be able to get America out of the Middle East. They \ndo not want us there because they know we are what stands between them \nand the opportunity of creating a radical Islamic new caliphate in that \nregion of the world, and the danger that would all bring about.\n  The new intelligence estimate on Iraq we have seen gives a window \ninto what would happen if we had a precipitous withdrawal over the next \n12 to 18 months. It would not be a pretty picture. Sectarian violence \nwould ensue. Unquestionably, we would have a Shia-dominated Middle \nEast. Already they are, through their proxies, in Lebanon, in Syria. \nThey have a strong alliance with them. They are trying to take over the \nPalestinian movement.\n  Over the next 12 to 18 months, the assessments would be very dire of \nwhat would take place if we were to be out of the region: an escalation \nof violence, a diminished chance for stability, no chance for positive \nchange.\n  The estimates suggest that a key aim in Iraq is to stabilize the \nsituation from the standpoint of violence, enough to let the political \nchanges that have to happen take place. I am going to quote from the \nestimate. It says from the public version:\n\n       If strengthened, Iraqi security forces more loyal to the \n     government, supported by coalition forces, are able to reduce \n     levels of violence and establish more effective security for \n     Iraq's population, and Iraqi leaders can have an opportunity \n     to begin the process of political compromise necessary for \n     longer-term stability, political progress, and economic \n     recovery.\n\n  Isn't that a better way? Isn't that what we all want, what the Senate \nshould be on record as supporting--this opportunity for our troops to \nbe successful, and not only to be in harm's way fighting for our \ncountry, but also to know that the Senate stands behind them, will not \ncut off their funds, will stand with them as they go into battle, and \nwill stand with them as they do the hard work of freedom--work done by \nmany other generations of America any time they have been called upon \nto stand for freedom, stand for the rule of law, and to give this \nbudding new democracy an opportunity to take hold and take root.\n  Madam President, I am disappointed that today we will not have an \nopportunity to have a fuller debate, that I won't have the opportunity \nto be on record with a vote reflecting where I stand, which all of us \nshould be willing to do--take a stand, take a position supporting our \ntroops.\n  I personally would also be in support of this plan which I believe \ngives us the best opportunity for success, which is the only plan out \nthere. Those who would not give this plan a chance owe the American \npeople an alterative but one that would have a reasonable chance for \nsuccess. Success is what we are after. A victory in this part of the \nworld would send a strong message to our enemies. So I am disappointed \nwe will not vote today.\n  I hope the majority leader will reconsider and come back to have an \nearnest debate and take the votes that are necessary to be taken.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, we have heard a debate over the last \nhour about where we stand on the resolutions and debating the \nescalation of the war in Iraq. Here is where we are at the end of the \nday. We can dot all the i's, cross all the t's, and do all of the \nlegalistic parsing that we want. The minority is blocking a vote on the \nissue that the American people wish to hear us on: Do you support or \noppose the escalation? It is that simple.\n  The minority's action ratifies the President's escalation. And any \nSenator who voted to prevent the Warner resolution from coming to the \nfloor is saying to his or her constituents: I support that escalation.\n  We know what is going on. The minority is torn between loyalty to \ntheir President and following the will of their voters. I have not seen \na single State where, at least from the polling data, the public \nsupports the escalation. There should be a simple vote, and not as an \nend to this debate but as a beginning to this debate. The minority is \ntying itself in a pretzel so that there will not be a vote.\n  Now, the Gregg resolution is missing two words. Look at it. Read it. \nIt doesn't have the word ``surge,'' and it doesn't have the word \n``escalation.'' It is ambiguously worded so that it tries to tie \nsupport for the troops with the escalation, but without saying so. It \nis a resolution that is intended to befuddle, perplex, obfuscate, and \nto hide.\n  The good news is that the American people don't follow the details of \nall of this debate. They don't have the time. They are busy with their \nlives, their families, their jobs, the joys and sorrows of life. But \nthey follow the big picture. The big picture is simple: Senator Reid \nhas labored mightily to have a clear, unobstructed, unobliterated vote \non whether you support or oppose the escalation.\n  The minority leader, backed by all but two of his membership, has \nsaid we do not want to vote; we want to let the President go forward \nwith the escalation, without taking responsibility for it. The public \nis seeing that. The public understands.\n  My good friend from Mississippi was talking in the hallway. He said \nthe job of the Senate is to take the tough votes. You bet it is. It is \nnot whether we are saying we support the troops--which everybody agrees \nthat we do--in an ambiguously designed amendment to support escalation \nand get their way, and those against it get their way. The bottom line \nis simple: the tough vote is ``yes'' or ``no'' on the escalation.\n  Again, I salute our majority leader. He has done everything to try to \nbring that vote to the floor. The minority leader has done everything \nto obstruct that vote. The good news is that we will have plenty of \nfurther opportunity to get that vote and, make no mistake about it, \nthis majority, in the belief that the escalation is wrong, in the \nbelief that there is no strategy in Iraq\n\n[[Page S1662]]\n\nother than to police a civil war, which no one bargained for, will be \nresolute and we will find ample opportunities to not only get a sense-\nof-the-Senate vote on whether you support or oppose the escalation, but \nto move further and ratchet up the pressure on the President so that he \nchanges his strategy.\n\n  The number of people in America who believe that our strategy in Iraq \nis succeeding gets smaller every day. I think it is below 1 in 4 right \nnow, which means that close to a majority of Republicans don't agree \nwith the strategy. Obviously, if the President came here 3 years ago \nand said we are going to have our troops on Haifa Street patrolling a \ncivil war between the Sunnis and Shiites--how many people would have \nvoted for that? How many Americans would have supported it? But that is \nexactly what we are doing. The vast majority of the troops that the \nPresident is asking for will continue to do just that and only that.\n  So this debate is coming only to a temporary close. One thing stands \nout clearly: the Republican minority is allowing the President to go \nforward with the escalation. It is supporting the escalation but \ndoesn't want to vote to say so. My colleagues, that will not wash. The \nAmerican people are too smart. They are too concerned. They are too \nworried about the brave men and women over there risking their lives as \nSunnis shoot at Shiites and Shiites shoot at Sunnis. To hold the \nminority's feet to the fire, we will be resolute in making sure that \nhappens.\n  The Gregg resolution is obfuscatory. It is designed to give people \ncover who don't want to say yes or no. But make no mistake about it, \nthe people want a yes or a no. They want us to act on that yes or no as \nwe come forward with the supplementary budget request next month. And \nthis majority, limited as it may be, will endeavor to do just that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield to my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. First of all, I commend the Senator from New York for an \nexcellent presentation. As I understand it from his comments, the \nprincipal question before the country now is the whole issue of a surge \nand the certain timeliness of it. We know that the President was able \nto extend, for example, marines in place over there and get a certain \nnumber of troops over there, but we know this is something that is \ngoing to happen in the future. A chunk of the troops are going over in \nFebruary, another group in March, and another group in April.\n  In the Armed Services Committee yesterday, we learned it is not just \nthe 20,000 the President talked about, but that number is going to be \nexceeded. We heard from General Pace.\n  As I understand what the good Senator has said, we have had four \nsurges previously over there. This concept, this idea, has been \nutilized previously and none were successful. Secondly, as I understand \nwhat the Senator has said, the leading generals, General Abizaid and \nGeneral Casey, previously suggested that this concept did not make \nsense; it only inflamed the insurgency. Is that the Senator's \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes, indeed.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The third part of the Senator's speech, which I hope our \ncolleagues will listen to, is the reference to the independent study by \nBaker and Hamilton, where a bipartisan recommendation said that such an \nactivity would not make sense.\n  So does it make sense when we have that kind of lineup, so to speak, \nwhere we have the military, the background of surges, the independent \nstudy made by Republicans and Democrats alike--we are faced now with a \nsurge, so we have to take action and express ourselves. Doesn't it make \nsense for this body to express itself on that particular policy issue? \nIsn't that the responsible thing to do?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Indeed. I thank my colleague for asking the question. \nAgain, the minority says it is our job to take some tough votes. Here, \nhere. We want to take what is a tough vote for some: Are you for the \nsurge? Are you for the escalation or are you against it? They are doing \neverything they can to avoid it. But as my good friend from \nMassachusetts has so aptly pointed out, the bottom line is that now is \nthe time to go on record--now, before most of the troops are there; \nnow, when we can ratchet up pressure on the President to change his \npolicy, as the independent study group said, and so many generals have \nsaid. I might add, from the press reports, the Prime Minister of Iraq \ndoesn't want them. We are almost in Alice in Wonderland here.\n  I will say one other thing. The good news is simple: the American \npeople get it. They know that the war in Iraq doesn't have a strategy. \nThey know it is headed toward a dead end. They know that policing a \ncivil war makes no sense, and they know what we are trying to do, which \nis forcing a ``yes'' or ``no'' vote--get a ``yes'' or ``no'' vote and \nmove forward to change that strategy. No amount of wordsmithing on the \nother side is going to change that fact.\n  Today, the Republican minority said: We are for the surge, and we \nwill let the President go forward and do it.\n  I yield to my colleague for another question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just a final point. Madam President, the Senator has \nstated it well. Basically, the recommendations of those generals I \nmentioned--and General Abizaid said he had inquired of all the combat \ncommanders--all of the combat commanders--whether there should be an \nenhanced presence in Baghdad, and he testified before the Armed \nServices Committee that we should not.\n  But isn't the point the Senator is making is to underline what all of \nthe generals have said and Maliki has said; that is, it is a political \nresolution, it is a political decision? What we are seeing now is \nresorting to a military solution when the independent study commission, \nthe generals on the ground, and the political leaders in that country \nhave said what is necessary now is a political resolution, a political \ndecision, and we find an administration that has effectively discarded \nthat as an option and is going to the military option.\n  As I understand, the Senator believes we ought to have a political \nresolution, political courage by the parties in power there; that we \nhere and the U.S. troops can't care more about the freedom of the \nIraqis than the Iraqi people and they have to stand up, step up, and be \nwilling to make their judgments.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, the Senator is exactly right. And I \nwill add one other point to his very prescient comments. Let us say we \nhave this surge and then troops leave after a certain amount of time--\nsome say the end of the summer, some say it will go on 3, 4, 5 years. \nWhat is going to happen then if we don't have a political solution the \ngood Senator asks about? The Sunni and Shia will resume fighting, and \nwe will have accomplished nothing. We will have seen the lives of some \nof our brave men and women be taken from them, American soldiers. We \nwill have created more havoc in Iraq. And we will have, again, delayed \nthe very political solution my friend from Massachusetts talks about, \nwhich is essential.\n  If there had been a change in Government, if there had been a change \nin strategy, perhaps--I can't say because I don't know what it would \nbe, given this administration hasn't changed anything--maybe the \nAmerican people, maybe some on this side of the aisle would say: Give \nit a chance. But to send more of our brave troops over there when there \nis no change in strategy, when it is just increasing policing of a \ncivil war, and when, at the end of this so-called surge, this \nescalation, nothing will have changed, the American people have every \nright to ask: To what end?\n  That is what we are asking. That is why we want a simple vote. And \nthat is why today is going to go down in history as a day when this \nRepublican minority in this House said to the President: We are \nsupporting your surge. We don't want to vote on it, but we are allowing \nit to happen. We are encouraging it to happen. And the very rubberstamp \nnature, when the minority was in the majority, that brought them to \nsuch trouble in November of 2006 is simply continuing.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a final \npoint?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield to my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I had the opportunity to read the \nnational intelligence report on Monday. There has been both an \nintelligence report and a declassified report. Even in\n\n[[Page S1663]]\n\nthe declassified report, would the Senator say, in his evaluation of \nthe best of the intelligence community that has been reviewing this \nsituation that every aspect of that intelligence report is basically in \nsupport of the conclusions the Senator has outlined here? This is not \nsomething just the Senators from New York or Massachusetts are making \nup. This is a conclusion which has been made by the intelligence \nagencies about what the nature of the battle is in Baghdad today.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator. Once again, he is right on the \nmoney. He is right on the money.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed his 15 minutes under \nthe order.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given \n1 more minute to finish my point, and then I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The Senator is right on the money, and it is, again, a \npattern. The experts--intelligence, military, diplomatic--tell the \nadministration what they are doing is wrong, tell the administration \nthat all the signs on the ground point to a policy that is failing, and \nthey keep their head in the sand and just go forward. It is a tragedy. \nIt is a tragedy when truth is not exalted and when there is a desire to \nstifle debate, as has happened in the administration and is happening \non the floor of the Senate today.\n  We all love this country, everyone in this Chamber, regardless of \npolitics, but at least for me--and I dearly love America--every day we \ndelay hurts us a little more and a little more and a little more. We \ndig ourselves deeper in a hole from which it will be harder and harder \nto extricate ourselves.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, to pick up where the good Senator from New York \nstopped, we had yesterday at Saint Francis Xavier in Hyannis, MA--I was \nunable to attend because I was here in the Senate--the funeral of a \nyoung serviceman who was lost. At the end of last week, a young \nserviceman named Callahan from Woburn, MA--his fourth time in Iraq, a \nfather of four--was lost.\n  Woburn, MA, is a very interesting blue-collar community. They had the \nhighest percentage of casualties in the Vietnam war of any community in \nmy State. They had high school class after high school class that \njoined the Marines and suffered devastating casualties in Vietnam. It \nis also a storybook community on civic action--water contamination in \nthat community resulted in the deaths of a number of children there. \nBut the community is made up of extraordinary men and women and \nfamilies. They are weathering through this extreme, extraordinary \ntragedy.\n  Sixty-four brave soldiers from Massachusetts have been lost, killed, \nand this is the overriding, overarching issue in question: What can we \ndo after 4 years where our service men and women have done everything \nwe have asked them to do? They have served in Iraq longer than it took \nto end World War II, to sweep through Africa, to cross Western Europe, \ncross through the Pacific, and they are still out there. Many of us \nbelieve, as we mentioned a few moments ago, that the solution lies not \nin the increasing surge but in a political resolution and determination \nand decisions made by the Iraqis for their own future. It is, after \nall, their country.\n  Let me talk for a few minutes about the other costs of this war, the \n$200 billion which is in the President's budget for the war in Iraq and \nwhat the implications of that will be, so that Americans can understand \nmore completely the costs.\n  It comes from children's health, as the President's budget underfunds \nthe CHIP program by $8 billion. That program has been extremely \nsuccessful in providing health care to low-income children.\n  Will the Chair let me know when I have 2 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yet there are still more than 8 million children in \nAmerica with no health coverage, and there is a health care crisis for \nour Nation's children. But what does the President propose to do about \nit? His budget will make the crisis even worse by cutting 400,000 \nchildren from the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  It comes from our seniors and our disabled citizens. The President's \nbudget cuts $66 billion from Medicare, which is a lifeline to millions \nof retirees and disabled Americans. If the President has his way, more \nthan 700,000 people in Massachusetts who rely on Medicare could see the \nquality of their care go down.\n  It comes from those battling mental illnesses. Each year, 25 percent \nof Americans suffer from some sort of mental illness. We owe it to them \nand their families to do all we can to ensure they are able to lead \nfull and productive lives. Yet the President's budget cuts mental \nhealth assistance by $159 million.\n  It comes from Hurricane Katrina victims. Despite massive ongoing \nneeds on the gulf coast, the President's budget offers no additional \nassistance to help people rebuild their lives.\n  It comes from the Nation's defense against epidemics, such as the \nflu, as the President proposes to slash funding for the Centers for \nDisease Control by $165 million.\n  It comes from Medicaid, our health care lifeline for the poor, which \nthe President intends to cut by $50 billion over the next 10 years. In \nMassachusetts, 880,000 citizens depend on Medicaid, and this budget \nplaces them at risk.\n  It comes from our children's education. The President's budget \nunderfunds the No Child Left Behind reforms by almost $15 billion. In \nmy State of Massachusetts, these cuts would leave behind more than \n51,000 children. Nationwide, we have 3.5 million children who are not \nparticipating in the program whatsoever. Yet they will have a \nrequirement to meet sufficiency in the year 2012.\n  It comes from our youngest children. By cutting $107 million from the \nHead Start Program, the President fails to give the youngest children a \nstrong start in life. This is a program which is tried, tested, and \ntrue.\n  It comes from our students with special needs. When we passed the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, we made a promise to \ndisabled children and their families that they were to receive the \neducation they deserve. President Bush's budget breaks that promise by \ncutting funding to IDEA by $290 million. We made the commitment we were \ngoing to provide 40 percent of all the funding. We are now at about 18 \npercent of funding, and we are reducing that. It is shifting the burden \nonto the families and the local communities.\n  It comes from school safety. Our children ought to be able to go to \nschool without fearing violence, but this budget cuts funding for Safe \nand Drug-Free Schools. With all the challenges of schools and violence \nin schools, it cuts back the funding for Safe and Drug-Free Schools.\n  It comes at the expense of our teachers. Over the next decade, this \nNation will need to hire 2 million more teachers, but this budget cuts \nfunding for teacher quality grants.\n  It comes at the expense of students. At a time when college costs are \nskyrocketing, the President's budget completely eliminates the Perkins \nLoan Program, which over 500,000 students depend on to help them afford \na college education. We know that a college degree is a ticket to a \nbright and better future, but this budget closes the college door \ninstead of opening it wider. There are already 400,000 young people who \nare qualified to get into our fine community colleges, public colleges, \nand private colleges and don't do so because of a lack of funding.\n  It comes from our workers who are looking for good jobs to support \ntheir families because the President's budget slashes $1 billion from \nprograms that train Americans for jobs. Madam President, listen to \nthis: In Massachusetts alone, there are 25,000 people waiting to be \nenrolled in job training programs.\n  In Boston, there are 25 applicants for each job training slot. There \nare 78,000 jobs that are out there today that are looking for trained \npeople, 25 people for every training slot, 275,000 people who are \nunemployed. What is wrong with\n\n[[Page S1664]]\n\nthis picture? We are cutting back on the training opportunities for \nthose individuals to be able to pay more in taxes and provide more \nhopeful futures for their children.\n  This budget can find $200 billion more for the war in Iraq but not a \ndime for people at home trying to better their lives. They come from \nfamilies who need help putting food on the table. The President wants \nto cut the Food Stamp Program by $600 million, leaving nearly 300,000 \nfamilies wondering where they are going to find the next meal for \nthemselves and their children.\n  I have had the chance to visit our absolutely spectacular food bank \nin Boston, and they talk about the increased numbers that they already \nhave. This is going to even put more pressure on those food banks and \nmore pressure on those families. It comes from the poor struggling \nagainst the bitter cold, as the budget cuts 17 percent of the funding \nfor the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps low-\nincome families afford to heat their homes.\n  In my State, if you use home heating oil you need to fill your tank \ngenerally three times a winter--three times a winter. Families are down \nnow where they are only able to fill--the needy who qualify for this--\nless than half a tank for the whole winter. We know what is happening. \nPeople make the choices between the prescription drugs they need, the \nfood they need, and the heat they need for their homes. We are cutting \nthat program by 17 percent.\n  Perhaps most tragically of all, the money for the war in Iraq comes \nfrom our veterans themselves. Nearly half the troops returning from \nIraq will require health care services to cope with the physical or \nmental toll of the war. Yet the President's budget underfunds veterans' \nhealth. It provides only half the increase in funding required for the \nVA to keep pace with the needs of our veterans.\n  In Massachusetts alone, there are 453,000 veterans who have served \nour country when they were called to duty, and we have a moral \nobligation to do all we can for them.\n  This is the cost of this war. This is all for a war that never should \nhave happened, for a war that should be brought to an end. Yet this \nadministration is allowing it to go on and on, with mistake after \nmistake after mistake. This terrible war is having an effect not only \non our troops, who are paying the highest price, but on our children, \nour elderly, our schools, our workers, and the poor here at home.\n  While the President forges ahead with a surge in Iraq, the American \npeople need a surge here at home. Americans see the cost of health care \nand the cost of college going up. What about a surge in our health and \neducation policies to meet those needs? Americans here at home worry \nabout their economic security, about their jobs and stagnant wages, how \nthey can support themselves on their wages. How about a surge here at \nhome to help meet their needs?\n  Last week, we met with our Nation's mayors. They described the \nproblem of school dropouts, how these young people are turning to crime \nin our communities, the proliferation of murders and youth homicides \nand suicides. Where is the surge to address that problem? No wonder the \nAmerican people are growing angrier and angrier as the war wages on. \nThey expect Congress to be an effective restraint on the President and \nhis abuse of the War Powers Act.\n  Opposition to the escalation is clear already. How much clearer does \nit have to be before Republicans in Congress and the President finally \nrespond to the voice of the American people? When will this war be \nbrought to an end? An escalation now would be an immense mistake, \ncompounding the original misguided decision to invade Iraq. Public \nsupport for the war does not exist. There is no support for this \nescalation. We have surged our forces four times in the past, and each \ntime the situation hasn't changed.\n  The President cannot continue to unilaterally impose his failing \npolicy on Americans who have already rejected it. Congress has the \nresponsibility to stop the President from sending more of our sons and \ndaughters to die in this civil war. The legislation on which the \nDemocrats seek a vote is our first effort to meet that responsibility. \nIt is our chance to go on record in opposition to the surge. It is a \nclarion call for change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Last week, the new National Intelligence Estimate confirmed the \nnightmare scenario unfolding for our troops in Iraq. The country is \nsliding deeper into an abyss of civil war, with our brave men and women \ncaught in the middle of it. The prospects for halting the escalating \nsectarian violence is bleak, with greater chaos and anarchy looming and \nmany additional U.S. casualties inevitable.\n  It is abundantly clear that what we need is not a troop surge but a \ndiplomatic surge, working with other countries in the region. Sending \nmore troops into the Iraq civil war is not the solution to Iraq's \npolitical problems. Not only does President Bush fail to see that \nreality, but he is also going out of his way to deny and defy it.\n  Congress needs to express its opposition to this strategy. If the \nPresident refuses to change course, we must act to change it ourselves \nto protect our troops and end this misguided war. The war today is not \nthe war Congress authorized 4 years ago. It is now a civil war. The war \ntoday is not about Saddam's weapons of mass destruction or alleged \nrelationship with al-Qaeda, it is Iraqi against Iraqi. Iraq is at war \nwith itself, and American soldiers are caught in the middle.\n  Madam President, it is time for the Members of this body to stand up \nand take a position on the issue of the surge.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I rise for a few moments to address the \nsubjects that have been discussed for the last 30 minutes. First of \nall, I rise in particular to lend my support to Senator McConnell who \nhas seen to it that the Senate is able to fully express itself on the \nissues before us in Iraq. No one should be confused about this debate. \nThere are many opinions here, and every one of them deserves the right \nto be expressed.\n  Secondly, I rise in support of the President's plan, and I am going \nto explain why in just a second. First, however, the Senator from New \nYork made a statement a minute ago that I want to open my remarks with.\n  The Senator from New York said not many people are paying attention \nto what we debate on the floor of the Senate, that they are too busy \nworking in their daily lives. That may very well be right, but I want \nto tell you who is listening to every word. First, it is the men and \nwomen in our Armed Forces, their families, and their loved ones. All \nyou have to do is go to Iraq, where I have been many times, go to any \nmess hall or almost any command post, and CNN and Fox are streaming \nconstantly. Our men and women watch what we say, so what we say on this \nfloor is important. The resolutions we send, binding or not, should not \nsend mixed signals.\n  There is another audience that listens to what we say, and they are \nour enemies. They listen as well. Those networks are their intelligence \nagencies. The messages we send should not be a message which relays a \nlack of confidence to our troops or to our Commander in Chief.\n  I am on the Foreign Relations Committee. I have spent 20 of the last \n28 hours of committee meetings listening to experts from a variety of \nresources, and two things became quite clear. There were varying \nopinions on whether a surge would work. Some thought it would \nconclusively; many thought it would not. Most gave it varying degrees \nof potential success. Without exception, however, everyone I heard \ntestify, when asked the question: What would be the ramifications of \nwithdrawal or redeployment, everyone, in one degree or another, said \nthere would be tens of thousands of lives lost, and possibly millions, \nand the sectarian violence that we are trying to quell now could spread \nthrough the region.\n  The way I see it, we have two choices right now at this stage of the \ngame. Choice one is an opportunity for success. Choice two is a recipe \nfor disaster. I choose the opportunity for success. I think the message \nwe ought to send to our troops is that we support them, we wish them \nGodspeed, and we pray for their success.\n\n[[Page S1665]]\n\n  A second message we need to send, which this debate has very \nhelpfully done, is a message to al-Malaki and the assembly in Iraq and \nthe people of Iraq that we came to their country with three objectives, \ntwo of which we have secured. One objective was to seek out the weapons \nof mass destruction the entire world believed were there. Second was to \nallow a constitution to be written and a free election to be held. Both \nof those things have been accomplished.\n  The last most elusive goal that we had was to secure the nation and \ntrain the Iraqi military so it could carry on that security and let \nthat fledgling democracy go forward. That third goal, which has been \nelusive, has gotten closer. The President's strategy to send additional \ntroops to Anbar and to Baghdad requires the absolute cooperation of the \nIraqis and the commitment of their military to assist side by side. If \nthey blink and look the other way, they will have failed themselves. If \nwe blink and we look the other way, we will have failed not only them \nbut we will have failed the people of our country.\n  Make no mistake about it, the war in Iraq that we are now in is not \nthe war we entered, but it is the war we are in, and those are the \nwords of our President. Regardless of where mistakes may have been \nmade, those of us, and I am one of those, who voted to support this \nwhen we went into Iraq did not vote for failure. I hope and I pray that \nour soldiers will be successful, that al-Malaki and the Iraqi military \nwill come through and perform, and I am going to do everything I can to \ngive them that support because I choose an opportunity for success over \na recipe for failure.\n  With regard to the mistakes that have been made, I want to be crystal \nclear because there are some awfully selective memories on the floor of \nthe Senate. I remember what I believed when I voted to go into Iraq. I \nremember what the National Intelligence Estimate said. And I remember \nthe horror of 9/11 and the fear of weapons of mass destruction. We \nvoted to do what every other member of the United Nations voted on in \nResolution 1441, and that was to seek out what the world thought was \nthere. While we didn't find the smoking gun, we found a lot of the \ncomponents and a lot of the evidence. We found the 400,000 bodies in \nmass graves and the tyranny of a horrible dictator in Saddam Hussein. \nWe accomplished our goal of deposing him and allowing the Iraqis to \ndetermine a free democratic society.\n  In the critical days of this battle, it is time for us to stand \nforward and stand strong and give this opportunity for success that the \nPresident has proposed a chance to succeed, rather than subscribe to a \nrecipe of failure. These are trying times, and I respect the opinions \nof every Member of this body expressed on this floor, but remember who \nour audiences are and how important it is that the message that we send \nnot be mixed, not be one of a political message but be a message of \ncommitment and resolve.\n  I will support the President not out of partisanship, not out of \nblind loyalty, but I will support the President because the evidence \nsubmitted in all of the hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee \ntold me we have two choices: We can choose an opportunity to succeed or \nwe can subscribe to a recipe for failure. I choose success, and I pray \nGod's blessings on our men and women in the Armed Forces of the United \nStates.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, as a new Member of this body, I must tell you that I \nam frustrated and disappointed. I am disappointed that the Republicans \nare blocking a vote on whether we support or oppose the President's \nplan to add additional troops to Iraq. I can tell you that is the issue \nof the day. That is what my constituents are asking of us, and I think \nthey have a right to expect that the Members of this body are willing \nto go on record either for or against the President's plan to add \nadditional troops to Iraq.\n  I have listened to my colleagues. I have listened to my colleagues in \ncommittee, and I have listened to my colleagues on this floor, and I \nthink the majority of us want to go on record opposing the surge. Both \nDemocrats and Republicans oppose it. I think there is a bipartisan \ngroup that can provide the consensus in this body to go on record \nagainst the surge.\n  Several months ago, the President said we were going to have a new \nplan in Iraq. Shortly after that, the Iraq Study Group came out with \nits report. To me, this has been the best analysis of the situation \nthat we have before us. The study group is composed of distinguished \nmembers, and it was a creation of the Congress. Secretary Baker, who \ncochaired the group, served in three administrations and has broad \nexperience in government. Mr. Hamilton, who served in the other body on \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, the Committee on International \nRelations it is called over there, has served with great distinction \nboth as chairman and ranking member. The other members of the \ncommittee--they said we cannot win in Iraq through our military \nefforts. That is not going to bring success in Iraq. The Iraqis must \nstep forward and defend their own country and we must move forward with \nnew diplomatic efforts. We need ``a new diplomatic offensive'' is what \nthey called it, and they said: We need to start that before December \n31, 2006. The ability of the United States to influence events within \nIraq is diminishing. We still have not seen that new offensive \ndiplomatic effort.\n\n  GEN George Casey said, ``It has always been my view that heavy and \nsustained American military presence was not going to solve the \nproblems in Iraq over the long term.''\n  We got the President's plan and the President's plan was more of the \nsame, stay the course but with more U.S. military presence. We had 3 \nweeks of hearings before the Foreign Relations Committee. Military \nexpert after military expert, foreign policy expert after foreign \npolicy expert, told us that there is a deterioration in Iraq and our \npolicies are not working and we need to move in a new direction. We \nneed to come to grips with the fact that the Iraqis must stand up and \ndefend their own country and we must engage the international community \nmuch more aggressively.\n  I congratulate Senator Warner and Senator Levin for coming forward \nwith a compromise resolution that allows us to go on record opposed to \nthe increased American military presence in Iraq. I do not agree with \neverything that is in that resolution, but I do think it clearly puts \nthe Senate on record against the increased surge of American troops in \nIraq, and that is our responsibility. That is what we should be doing. \nWe should not hide behind procedural roadblocks to avoid voting on that \nissue. That is the most important issue facing this Nation today, and \nwe should be willing to vote on that issue. It is not about the \nPresident of the United States. It is about this body carrying out its \nresponsibility. That is what each of us has a responsibility to do.\n  Why am I so much against the increase in the U.S. military presence \nin Iraq? Let me first start with the numbers. The President said the \nsurge would involve 21,500 additional American troops in Iraq. That is \nnot the case. Michael Gilmore, the Assistant Director for National \nSecurity at the Congressional Budget Office, testified yesterday before \nour Budget Committee, and he said it is not going to be 21,500, it is \ngoing to be closer to 48,000 additional American troops because the \n21,500 are the frontline combat troops. You need the support staff in \norder to support the 21,500.\n  The budget the President submitted to us said that is going to cost \nabout $5.6 billion, but CBO now says it is going to be closer to $20 to \n$27 billion of additional cost, just with the surge, in addition to \nwhat we are already spending. The President claims his budget is to \nbalance in 5 years, but he has no cost for the Iraq war beyond 2008.\n  The numbers speak for themselves. The President is asking us to go \nalong with stay the course but at a higher cost, both in American \nmilitary presence and the costs to American taxpayers in this country.\n  The situation in Iraq is deteriorating. Every person who has come \nbefore us who is an expert in this area has acknowledged that. There is \na civil war in Iraq, and Americans have paid a very heavy price for our \ncommitment\n\n[[Page S1666]]\n\nin Iraq--over 3,000 dead and many more with life-changing injuries. \nThere have been hundreds of billions of dollars spent. That represents \nmissed opportunities in America--money we need to strengthen our \nmilitary and national defense. We have used our National Guard and \nreservists. We should be supporting them, improving the quality of life \nfor our soldiers and for our veterans. Our soldiers have served with \ngreat distinction and valor. We owe it to them to get it right. We owe \nit to them to do everything we can for a successful outcome in Iraq. \nThat is why it is our responsibility, on behalf of our soldiers, to \ntake up this issue.\n  We have lost our focus in the war against terror, we have weakened \nU.S. influence internationally, and, yes, we have lost other \nopportunities beyond defense because those hundreds of billions of \ndollars we spent could have been spent to balance our budget, could \nhave been spent to increase our commitment to national priorities such \nas education and health care and the environment. But we have lost \nthose issues.\n  The first order of business for us should be to go on record against \nincreasing the American military presence in Iraq. That should be our \nfirst order of business. But then we need to do more. I opposed the war \nfrom the beginning. I voted against it in the other body. I have been a \ncritic of the President in the management of the war, in his failure to \nproperly engage the international community both before and after going \ninto Iraq, and the decision made by someone in the White House to take \nout the Iraqi security forces when we went in, that was a mistake. I \nhave been pretty consistent against the President, but we need to do \nmore than pass this resolution. I think we should take up this \nresolution first. This is the first order of business. But then we need \nto do more.\n  The Iraqis have a responsibility to take care of their own security \nneeds in the midst of a civil war. We need to engage the international \ncommunity with a diplomatic and political initiative so the Government \nof Iraq has the confidence of the ethnic communities. This is sectarian \nviolence. We need to change the way the Iraqis are doing business and \nhelp them through diplomatic efforts. We need to engage the \ninternational community. We need more assistance in training Iraqi \nsecurity forces. You can't do it all by Americans; we need the \ninternational community. We need the international community to help us \nwith the humanitarian crisis that is in Iraq. The number of refugees, \ndisplaced individuals, is in the millions. We need the help of the \ninternational community to deal with the humanitarian crisis. You are \nnot going to have peace in Iraq until you deal with that.\n  We need the help of the international community on the infrastructure \nimprovements, the economy of Iraq. The American taxpayers cannot do it \nalone, and we have wasted a lot of our taxpayer dollars in Iraq. We \nneed the international community to help us. In short, we need a new \ndirection, a plan that includes bringing some of our combat troops \nhome, to make it clear to the Iraqis we are not going to be there \nindefinitely, to make it clear to the international community we expect \nthe Iraqis to take care of their own security needs. That is what we \nneed.\n  But first things first. Let's take a vote on the President's plan. \nLet's get that done. Let's stop using procedural roadblocks to prevent \na vote in this body but to vote for or against the President's plan to \nbring more troops to Iraq.\n\n  Then we should consider additional options to make it clear it is our \nresponsibility to help bring about a new direction for American \ninvolvement in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I have been on the floor of the Senate \nfor the last half hour, listening to my colleague in what is, in fact, \na very important debate for this country. I say that, even though the \nwringing of hands would suggest that somehow the debate is being \nblocked and the will of the Senate has been thwarted. I suggest quite \nthe opposite. It has become a finger-pointing in a procedural way.\n  I believe the Republican leader came to the floor yesterday and said \nlet's have a couple of votes, several votes; you can vote up or down on \nthe Levin-Warner resolution; you can vote up or down on the Gregg \nresolution. It was then the leadership on the majority side, the \nDemocratic side, blocked it. I think the American people are wise to \nthe tactics at hand. They are not unaware, and they are frustrated by \nwhat is going on in Iraq today. Clearly, we are focused. Whether it is \nthe Congress of the United States or a vast majority of the American \npeople, we are becoming increasingly critical of a war that has \nfrustrated many of us.\n  The Senator from Maryland voted against it. He said so a few moments \nago. I voted for it. At the same time, I grow increasingly critical, as \ndo many of the citizens of my State, as to what will be the future, \nwhat will be our success and/or failure and at a cost of how many more \nAmerican lives.\n  I am critically concerned that this Government in Iraq now stand up. \nWe have allowed them to form and to shape and to vote. They now have a \nConstitution. They now must lead. In leading, I hope it could be to \nstability to the region and that it will not offset and throw out of \nbalance what the free world looks at and says is very important and \nthat is, of course, the war on terror and the general stability of the \nMiddle East.\n  Indeed, I think much has been lost in the debate around this country \nas to the significance of the Middle East itself. I was extremely \npleased last week when that kind of an elder statesman of our country, \nHenry Kissinger, came before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and \nin a very real and important way, and in a bipartisan way, said: Let's \nnot forget our perspective. While for the short term and for the moment \nwe are focused on Iraq, as we should be, let's not fail to recognize \nthat since World War II, we have been in the Middle East to bring \nstability to the region for a safer, more stable Western World.\n  I don't think there is any question about that. He was frank about it \nwhen he stressed diplomacy as an important tool. I have long advocated \nfrank, open talks amongst our friends and neighbors around the world, \nnot only about the region but about the role of Iraq within the region \nand what we must do. However, Dr. Kissinger also stressed that, under \nthe present conditions in Iraq, withdrawal or the signs of withdrawal \nis simply not an option for America's forces. So anyone who comes to \nthe floor today and says: Oh, but it is an option and we ought to start \nnow, or we ought to send all the signals to our friends and neighbors \naround the world that we are beginning to pull back, is going against a \ntrend that I think is critically important. They could set in motion \nthe kind of activity in Iraq that could bring about a phenomenal \ngenocide and the possibility of neighbors tumbling in on top of \nneighbors to create conflict in the Middle East that could bring down \nthe whole of the region. If that were to happen, then I am quite \nconfident that those who want to withdraw would find themselves in a \nvery precarious situation. What do we do? Do we go back in with greater \nforce to stabilize the region, when friendly, moderate Arab nations are \nnow tumbling into war because we would no longer stand or we would no \nlonger force, through a diplomatic process, those countries of the \nworld to come together to work with us, to cooperate?\n  While most agree that the current situation in Iraq must be dealt \nwith politically--and we have heard that time and again--and \neconomically, our military involvement is critical to provide the \nIraqis the stability they need in this new democratic process. I don't \nmind pegging timelines a little bit and I don't mind thresholds and \nmeasurements and I think it is important we not only send that message \nbut that we get it done, we get it done for the sake of our position in \nIraq and certainly forcing the Iraqi Government to move--those are all \nphenomenally important issues.\n  Let me stress two last facts. It is quite simple. The 116th from \nIdaho, the largest deployment of Idaho's troops in this war, was there \nand served and served honorably and proudly and the work they did was \nphenomenally important and we are proud of them. Let me also suggest \nthat while many will say the general we now send to Iraq is the best \nmilitary mind we have available at the moment, the author of the\n\n[[Page S1667]]\n\nArmy's war handbook on terror, we are saying to General Petraeus: You \nare the best there is, go forth and be successful, but, oh, by the way, \nwe don't agree with the mission--what kind of a mixed message is that \nwe now send to our military?\n  The Senator from Georgia was right. The world is listening to this \ndebate. Our men and women in uniform are listening to this debate. The \nenemies of the cause are listening and saying: Oh, the Senate of the \nUnited States is getting cold feet. Our opportunities are at hand. All \nwe have to do is wait them out. All we have to do is accelerate the \nviolence, and they will turn out the lights in the green zone and go \nhome.\n  Then the world, at least the Iraqi world, will erupt in a civil \nconflict, a civil war of phenomenal proportion.\n  Those are the realities we deal with today. I hope this Senate stays \non point. This is an issue that is critical to the future of our \ncountry, to the future of the free world, to the region of the Middle \nEast, to any kind of stability we hope could be brought there. I hope \nwe have the votes--and they ought to be up or down--and I don't mind \nbeing on the record at all. They need to be substantive, they need to \nhave the force and effect of law, just not the ring of the politics of \nthe Chamber, because that is what we are getting today--a heavy dose of \npolitics and very little substance.\n  We hide behind procedure? I don't think so. Let us bring these issues \nforward. The Craig resolution? Up or down. Levin-Warner? Up or down. \nWhat is wrong with those votes? That is what we were sent here to do. I \nwould hope our leadership could bring us to that.\n  So, to reiterate:\n  Many people around the country, including myself, have taken a much \nmore critical look at the way the war in Iraq has been handled. \nHowever, through all the hardships our soldiers face day-to-day on the \nstreets of Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq, it still remains evident to \nme that our success in Iraq and the success of the current Iraq \ngovernment, is critical to the security of our Nation, the stability of \nthe Middle East, and the fight against terrorism worldwide.\n  Indeed, much has been lost in the debates around this country as to \nthe significance of the greater Middle East stability when looking at \nthe situation in Iraq. Our country has maintained a presence in that \nregion of the world since World War II, and it should not be a surprise \nto anyone that many countries there depend and rely on our presence \nthere, both economically and for their own national security. After \nreviewing the recent transcript of Dr. Henry Kissinger before the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, I agreed with many of Dr. \nKissinger's views on the current situation in Iraq as it relates to the \nMiddle East as a whole, and the severe consequences the international \ncommunity will face should we fail in Iraq.\n  Dr. Kissinger stressed diplomacy, something I have long advocated in \nthis conflict and frankly for any conflict. I don't believe there is \none Member of Congress who takes the decision lightly to send out \ntroops into combat unless we all firmly believe it is a last option. I \nknow I certainly didn't, and I know that an overwhelming majority of \nboth Senators and Congressmen believed that as well when we authorized \nthe use of force in Iraq back in 2002.\n  However, Dr. Kissinger also stressed that under the present \nconditions in Iraq, withdrawal is not an option for American forces. \nSuch a withdrawal would have long reaching consequences on the war on \nterror worldwide, could lead to widespread genocide in Iraq and \npossible neighboring countries, as well as severe economic consequences \nfor all Middle Eastern countries. It is clear that such a circumstance \nwould mandate international forces be sent back into Iraq, but the \ncosts at that point would be grave.\n  While most agree that the current situation in Iraq must be dealt \nwith politically and economically, our military involvement is critical \nto providing the Iraqis the stability they need to let their new \ndemocracy take root. If we pull our troops out of Iraq now, or deny \nthem much needed reinforcements as some would like to do, we risk \nlosing Baghdad and possibly the entire country to full blown civil war. \nUnder those circumstances, the government of Iraq would fall, and Iran \nand Syria would strengthen their grip on the Middle East, endangering \nthe national security of America and our allies worldwide.\n  It is my hope that diplomatic efforts will continue in a more \naggressive fashion to bring the international community to the \nrealization of a failed State in Iraq, and the real consequences that \nwe all face should our efforts fall short of stabilizing Baghdad and \nthe country as a whole. Because the consequences are so high, I do not \nbelieve that our soldiers' withdrawal from Iraq should be placed on any \ntimetable, and we need to reassure our soldiers and commanders in Iraq \nthat we will continue to support their efforts. After all, they are \noperating in Iraq, but the work they are doing will have a far reaching \neffect to stabilize the Middle East.\n  Over the past few weeks, there have been many who have been outspoken \nabout their disapproval of the President's new plan for Iraq. Not being \nan expert in military tactics, I do not believe it is my role as a U.S. \nSenator to play general for our soldiers as some are. Instead, I \nbelieve it is my duty in Congress to provide our soldiers with the \nresources and funding they require to do their job with the best \nequipment possible, while also pledging my unending moral support for \nthe work they do each and every day to keep Americans safe both at home \nand abroad.\n\n  Every 4 years the citizens of America go to the polls to elect a \ncommander in chief, who is responsible to the American people to lead \nour military in times of peace and times of war. It is no mistake that \nthe founding fathers gave the power to declare war to the Congress, but \nthe power to lead the military to the President. Our soldiers should \nnot have to follow 535 Congressional ``generals'' who hold up critical \nfunding while they second-guess tactical decisions of the commander in \nchief and military leaders.\n  Over the last few weeks a lot has been made of the troop \nreinforcement President Bush outlined to the American people. Prior to \nhis speech, I and several other Members of Congress met with the \nPresident to discuss the current situation in Iraq. I made it very \nclear that Idahoans and I cannot continue to support the status quo; \nand he agreed. President Bush has spent the last many months working \nwith his national security advisers, commanding officers in Iraq, \nMembers of Congress and experts in the field of military issues in \norder to revise our national strategy with regards to Iraq and come up \nwith a new strategy for victory.\n  Make no mistake, the onus is now on the Iraqi people and the Iraqi \ngovernment to act, and I was extremely pleased to hear President Bush \nreiterate that fact. The efforts of our soldiers have given the Iraqi \npeople a great opportunity to live in a free and stable country, but \nthey must stand up and accept that responsibility.\n  My home State of Idaho has shared some of the burden of this war in \nIraq. The 116th Brigade Combat Team served courageously for twelve \nmonths in Kirkuk and surrounding areas, and they have since returned \nhome to their families. I had the opportunity to visit them in Iraq and \nwas extremely proud of the feedback on these soldiers I received from \nIraqi government officials, civilians, and U.S. military leaders. I \nwould also like to spotlight all Idahoans who are serving in the Armed \nForces in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. I am eternally grateful for \ntheir service and I will continue to provide them with all the support \nI can give.\n  It is my hope that Members of Congress will not pursue antiwar \npolitics to the detriment of our soldiers in the field. Our soldiers \nhave been fighting courageously in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere \naround the world to protect each and every American life, and I believe \nit is incumbent for the Congress to stand behind them. Numerous bills \nand resolutions have been proposed in the Senate to disapprove of their \nmission, cap troop levels, withhold funding for the reinforcements, or \neven completely de-fund the troops serving in Iraq. I cannot and will \nnot support any legislation that I see as unproductive to our current \nefforts in Iraq, because I believe it places our forces in greater \ndanger and could embolden our enemies to continue their attacks against \ninnocent Iraqis, Americans and our allies.\n  In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee in January of \nthis\n\n[[Page S1668]]\n\nyear, General Hayden, the Director of the CIA, responded to a question \nregarding what would happen if we pulled out now from Iraq. Director \nHayden responded, Three very quick areas:\n\n       No. 1, more Iraqis die from the disorder inside Iraq. No. \n     2, Iraq becomes a safe haven, perhaps more dangerous than the \n     one Al Qaeda had in Afghanistan. And finally, No. 3, the \n     conflict in Iraq bleeds over into the neighborhood and \n     threatens serious regional instability.\n\n  He went on to state that this directly and immediately threatens the \nUnited States homeland because it:\n\n     provides Al Qaida that which they are attempting to seek in \n     several locations right now, be it Somalia, the tribal area \n     of Pakistan or Anbar province--a safe haven to rival that \n     which they had in Afghanistan.\n\n  During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, GEN David Petraeus supported President Bush's plan to \nincrease troop levels in Baghdad and Anbar province. In response to \nquestioning before that committee, General Petraeus made it clear he \nbelieves that the reinforcement of soldiers into Baghdad and Anbar in \nIraq will bolster the Iraqis' ability to stabilize their government and \ndefeat the insurgency, instead of allowing them to continue to buck \nthat responsibility, as some have asserted.\n  Many in Congress have stated publicly that this is the last chance \nthe United States has to get it right in Iraq. If that is the case, I \nfeel there is no general better qualified to be in charge of our ground \nforces and get things turned around on the ground than General \nPetraeus. I recognize that the American people have grown weary over \nthe last months since the violence has escalated in Iraq, but I remain \noptimistic that the Iraqi government, with the aid of our soldiers, can \nturn things around.\n  I had the pleasure of meeting General Petraeus during one of my two \ntrips to Iraq and was very impressed by his knowledge of the situation \nand his expertise in counterinsurgency. I have no doubt that General \nPetraeus is the right man to lead our forces in Iraq and I believe that \nhe will overcome the new challenges he now faces. Let us not send the \nright man and then tell him it is the wrong job.\n  In closing, while I share the concerns of many of my colleagues \nregarding the situation in Iraq, I will support the President's plan to \nprovide the reinforcements necessary to provide stability in Baghdad \nand Anbar province. I am hopeful that this plan will give the Iraqi \ngovernment the best chance to stand on their own two feet and make the \npositive strides necessary to take control of the security situation \nand function as a stable government. It is this Senator's personal \nopinion that resolutions condemning the President's new way forward \nsend the wrong message to our soldiers, the Iraqi people, and \nespecially our enemies.\n  I certainly appreciate and support the role of Congress to provide \noversight with respect to U.S. military engagements. However, I do not \nbelieve we should cripple the Commander in Chief's ability to work with \nour military leadership to defeat our enemies, and passing a resolution \ncondemning the President's new plan for Iraq would do precisely that. \nInstead, I support resolutions that call for the support of the \nAmerican people and Congress to give the President's plan a chance to \nwork. Mistakes have been made, unquestionably, and the violence in \nBaghdad and Anbar province has grown to a level that few predicted, but \nI am not yet ready to throw in the towel on this President's new plan \nand our soldiers' ability to assist in stabilizing Iraq before they \neven get a chance to try.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/07/senate-section/article/S1668-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1668-S1678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PROCEDURAL TACTICS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, thank you for the recognition. I have \nsought recognition to discuss the procedural situation which confronts \nthe Senate at the present time and to discuss a proposed rule change \nwhich would deal with this kind of a problem.\n  We have pending a motion to proceed on S. 470, which proposes a \ndisagreement with the President's plan to send 21,500 additional troops \nto Iraq. Under the Senate rules, a motion to proceed is debatable, and \nwhen we deal with an issue of the magnitude of what is happening in \nIraq today and the President's proposal to send additional troops, it \nis obviously a matter of great moment. The eyes and ears of the country \nare focused on the Senate. The eyes and ears of the world are focused \non the Senate.\n  So far, what is happening is largely misunderstood, but the starting \npoint is that a motion to proceed is debatable. But before debate even \nbegan, the majority leader filed a motion for cloture, which means to \ncut off debate. Now, a cloture motion would be in order, but why before \nthe debate has even started? The cloture motion is designed to cut off \ndebate after debate has gone on too long. But what lies behind the \ncurrent procedural status is an effort by the majority leader to do \nwhat is called filling the tree, which is a largely misunderstood \nconcept, not understood at all by the public generally and even not \nunderstood fully by many Members of this body. But the Senate is unique \nfrom the House, and the Senate has been billed as the world's greatest \ndeliberative body, because Senators have the right to offer amendments.\n  In the House of Representatives they established what is called a \nrule, and they preclude Members from offering amendments unless it \nsatisfies the Rules Committee. In the Senate, generally a Senator \ndoesn't have to satisfy anybody except his or her own conscience in \noffering an amendment. But if the majority leader, who has the right of \nrecognition--and that, of course, is not understood either--but if the \nmajority leader is on the floor and seeks recognition, he gets it ahead \nof everybody else. And if the majority leader offers what is called a \nfirst-degree amendment to the bill, which is substantively identical to \nthe bill but only a technical change, and then again seeks recognition \nand gets it and offers a second-degree amendment to the bill, which is \nsubstantively the same but only a technical change, then no other \nSenator may offer any additional amendment. That is a practice which \nhas been engaged in consistently by both parties for decades, \nundercutting the basic approach of the Senate, which enables Senators \nto offer amendments and get votes.\n  The Congressional Research Service has tabulated the statistics going \nback to the 99th Congress in 1985 and 1986 when Senator Dole used this \nprocedure on five occasions. In the 100th Congress, Senator Byrd, then \nthe majority leader, used this procedure on three occasions. In the \n103d Congress, the next majority leader, Senator Mitchell, used this \nprocedure on nine occasions. When Senator Dole became leader again in \nthe 104th Congress, he used this procedure on five occasions. In the \n106th Congress, Senator Lott, then the majority leader, used it nine \ntimes. In the 107th Congress, Senator Daschle, then the majority \nleader, used it once. He was only majority leader for about 18 months. \nIn the 108th Congress, Senator Frist used it three times, and in the \n109th Congress five times.\n  Now, my suggestion is that the parties ought to declare a truce on \nthis procedural war of filling the tree which undercuts the basic \nthrust of Senate procedure to allow Senators to offer amendments. But \nthe majority leaders continue to use it, which they have a right to \nunder the current rules, which is why I am suggesting a change in the \nrules. But it will take a little time to change the rules. We can't do \nit immediately for the Iraq debate. But it would be my hope that there \nwould be a public understanding of what we are doing, because the most \neffective process in our governmental operations is public \nunderstanding and public pressure. We call it a political question. We \ncall it public understanding to have transparency or an understanding \nof what we do, and then the public can say yea or nay with what is \nhappening, and that is a tremendous force to lead Senators and Members \nof the House of Representatives to take action, to call it the right \nthing, or to take action consistent with sound public policy.\n  Now, what is happening today is that charges are being leveled on all \nsides. There has been a lot of finger-pointing with most of the \nDemocrats saying the Republicans are obstructing a vote--a debate and a \nvote on the Iraqi resolutions. And Republicans are saying: Well, we are \ninsisting on our right to debate the motion to proceed. We don't think \nyou should file cloture before the\n\n[[Page S1669]]\n\ndebate even starts, to cut off debate before you have debate, but the \nreason we are doing it is so this procedural device may not be used on \nwhat is called in common parlance to ``fill the tree.'' But if you ask \nvirtually anybody what is filling the tree, they are going to think \nabout an orchard; they are not going to think about Senate procedure. \nBut it is called filling the tree. I have described it succinctly and \nbriefly to outline exactly what the procedure is to stop Senators from \noffering amendments.\n  There is a clue here that Senator Warner--who is the principal \nproponent of the Warner resolution, the Warner-Levin resolution, which \npicks up the substance of the bill which is currently pending, S. 470--\nSenator Warner votes against cloture, and he is the principal proponent \nof disagreeing with the President's plan. Well, that ought to tell us \nsomething: that Senator Warner is not trying to stifle debate on a vote \non his own initiative, on his own resolution. Senator Hagel also--who \nhas been characterized as the most outspoken critic of President Bush's \nplan to have a surge--voted against cloture. That ought to tell us \nsomething: that Senator Hagel is not trying to defeat debate on a vote \non what he seeks to accomplish.\n\n  So it would be my hope there would be a truce. Let me say candidly \nthat I think there is very little chance there is going to be a truce \nin the Senate on using this procedural rule. It has been used on both \nsides. It has been used by Democrats and Republicans when it suits the \npartisan advantage of one party or another, and suiting the partisan \nparty advantage of one party or another is not consistent with sound \npublic policy and the public interest.\n  Right now this debate is being waged in the newspapers, it is being \nwaged on the talk shows, it is being waged on the Sunday shows, even \nsome of it is being waged on the floor of the Senate, but by and large \nnot understood.\n  I spoke on the subject on Monday, outlining the rules morass, and \nlargely misunderstood, even by senior members of my own staff not \nunderstood. You have the Democrats--and I think we ought to rise above \nthe partisanship, Democrats and Republicans--saying they have the high \nground and they intend to keep it. Well, I think they are winning the \npublic relations battle. Let's be candid about it. Democrats are \nwinning the public relations battle. Most people think what is going \non, because we are opposing ending debate, Republicans are opposing \nending debate, is that we do not want to have the debate and we do not \nwant to have the vote.\n  That is not factually correct. Senator Warner, who is proposing it, \nand Senator Hagel, who is one of the sharpest critics of the \nPresident's plan, and other Senators who are critics of the President's \nplan, have voted against cutting off debate because it is a big issue \nwhich ought to be debated, and because what is going on behind the \nscenes, under the surface, is an effort to have agreement on how many \nvotes there will be to have a fair airing of the subject matter, and to \nhave an opportunity for Senators to vote on a variety of resolutions or \namendments. Ordinarily, we come to agreement on those matters. Right \nnow we are up against the continuing resolution, which is about to \nexpire.\n  I would suggest we have plenty of time to do it all if we start to \nwork a little earlier. We are on morning business until 2 o'clock, \nwhich means we can express ourselves and it is not wasted time, but it \nis not the most productive time. We don't come to work until late on \nMonday. We don't work on Friday. Most Americans work a 5-day week. Some \nAmericans work 6 and 7 days. So we have time. And we could work in the \nevenings, too, when we are facing a time limit, or we could have a \ncontinuing resolution which was extended, so that debate could be put \noff. But now it is in doubt what is going to happen. It is controlled \nby the majority, and by the majority leader, and that is the right of \nthe majority and the right of the majority leader.\n  There have been pronouncements that we are not going to come back to \nthis debate and that it is politically advantageous for the Democrats \nto blame the Republicans for blocking debate on the vote, and that will \nbe the public posture. But it is my hope there will yet be a \nrecognition of what is going on. I would be glad to debate anybody who \ncares to discuss the issue as to whether my representations are \naccurate or inaccurate; that the majority leader has the right \nexercised by majority leaders of both parties for at least the last two \ndecades to preclude amendments being offered and to preclude any \nconsideration by what Republicans have to say on this issue.\n\n  We have a Member of the opposite party on the Senate floor. I would \nbe glad to debate that subject with him now.\n  Before the week is up, I will offer a resolution to change the Senate \nrules to preclude this procedure in the future, but in the public \ninterest, there ought to be a truce declared on it that won't be used \nby either side to the disadvantage of the other. The real party being \ndisadvantaged is the party of the American people. That is where the \nimpact is.\n  In conclusion--the two most popular words of any presentation--I hope \nwe can explain, as a starting point, discussions we have in the Senate \nand follow up with explanations in the media, which really carries the \nmessage to the American people. Some people are watching on C-SPAN. I \nhave a family very interested in the speeches I make from time to \ntime--two sisters and a brother-in-law. I talked to them Monday night, \nand they had no idea what I was saying. My staff does not understand \nwhat I am saying.\n  The essence is, the rules being exercised by the majority, by the \nDemocrats today, will preclude Republican amendments if they fill the \ntree by the procedure I have described. I do not want to stop debate. \nSenator Warner, who is the principal proponent of the amendment to \ndebate and vote, Senator Hagel, an outspoken critic of the President--\ndoesn't that say something?\n  I hope we can bring sufficient public clarity to the issue that the \nmajority leader and the Democrats will rethink their position. As long \nas the Republicans are being blamed for not having debate and a vote, \nwe are not going to have debate and a vote. If the public understands \nboth parties are at fault, equal blame on both sides, then there may be \nsome movement and some accommodation.\n  It does not take long for the American people to see the morass and \nprocedural shenanigans going on and say: We don't care whether you are \na Democrat or Republican, the American people are sick and tired of the \nbickering that goes on in this Chamber and in the House of \nRepresentatives. They expressed themselves in the last election. If we \ncannot do a better job in explaining ourselves and finding a way to \nwork through and address the substantive problems, the enormous \nproblems facing this country--and the No. 1 today is Iraq--we may all \nfind ourselves seeking new employment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, we just heard a debate about \ndebates. It strikes me that this word war we are conducting here \ndoesn't get to the fact that we are losing people every day in Iraq--27 \nAmericans died in a weekend--and our friends on the other side want to \ndiscuss the rules and the process instead of being able to agree that \nthere was a nonbinding resolution being proposed about whether you want \nto see this surge--a la escalation--of the war in Iraq. Our friends \nwere so conscience-stricken that they wanted to resort to more words \nand amendments. Why couldn't we have just passed or discussed that \nnonbinding resolution, let it go, and let the debate then continue? \nBring on the debates. But, no, this is the press relations battle which \nwas just discussed by our colleague.\n  That is not what we are looking for. We are looking to save lives, \nAmerican lives, but we can't get to the subject because there is a \nquestion about what the rules ought to be. The rules ought to be the \ndecency of our consciences--let us make decisions that will save lives \nand ease the pain on American families.\n  This was an unfortunate dynamic we saw this week: Republican \ncolleagues determined to block the opportunity for the Senate to vote \non the President's war escalation policy for Iraq. Just when the \nAmerican people want this Congress to stop the President's misguided \nplan, our colleagues on the other side are hard at work to shut\n\n[[Page S1670]]\n\ndown that opportunity. What they are afraid of is that we will confirm \nour support for the troops who are there now, and any insinuation that \nisn't the truth is a foul lie. We are just as anxious to support the \ntroops. We are more anxious, in many ways, because we called for \nequipment to be available to protect our troops. We called for vehicles \nto be properly armored. We called for the body armor to be developed. \nBut we didn't hear any complaints about the misdeeds of the contractors \nwho weren't doing what they were supposed to be doing. They were not \neven monitored. We are going to talk about that.\n  Our friends in the minority can delay this debate, and I hope the \nAmerican public understands what is going on--delay the debates, don't \nlet us come to the conclusion, don't let the President see that a \nmajority of this Senate does not want this escalation to take place. \nThey will delay this debate and vote for now, but it is going to happen \neventually. It will happen because the American people are \nunderstandably frustrated with the President's conduct and mishandling \nof this war.\n  Our children are taught a lesson in school: If you do things wrong \nand you don't pass your courses, don't change your ways, don't listen \nto advice, you get an F on your report card. In the view of many of the \nAmerican people--most of the American people--President Bush has gotten \nan F on his report card on the handling of the situation in Iraq. But \nhe and the Vice President refuse to be held accountable, and his allies \nin the Senate are blocking us from holding him accountable. It is not a \ngood lesson for our Nation's young people. They see that if they don't \ndo their work, they fail the course, and the President has not done his \nwork, and he ought not to get a positive grade for his job thus far.\n  The American people don't want Congress to grant unlimited power to \nthe President and his incompetent crew. Our troops have done a \nmagnificent job, but it is the President and failed leadership at the \nPentagon that have let them down.\n  Who can forget Secretary Rumsfeld's quote:\n\n       You go to war with the Army you have, not the Army you \n     might want or wish to have at a later time.\n\n  Frankly, it is a slur, in my view, against the troops we have, those \ncourageous people over there fighting right now or at that time. It is \na terrible message to send to our soldiers.\n  Who can forget when the insurgency first started and our troops were \ngetting attacked with roadside bombs, when President Bush said ``bring \n'em on''? I wore our Nation's uniform in World War II, in Europe, and I \ncan say none of us wanted our Commander in Chief taunting the enemy, \ninviting them to come on out and fight and maybe kill us. No. To be in \nharm's way and have your commander make such a statement from the \nsafety and security of the White House is appalling.\n  Now the President wants a so-called surge. Does he want to surge our \nway to more problems? Does he want to surge our national debt by \nspending billions more every week in Iraq? Anybody who understands \nEnglish knows that the real definition of ``surge'' as used here means \n``enlarge'' or ``escalate.''\n  From this war, we have more than 700 Americans who have lost limbs, \nmore than 29,000 suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, and over \n3,000 have perished in Iraq, 74 of whom have ties to my home State of \nNew Jersey. Yet President Bush dismisses the incredible cost of this \nwar in lives, injuries, and resources essential for the health and \nwell-being of our people at home, domestic programs.\n  After all the previous failures and incompetence by this \nadministration, why should the American people allow the President to \ndo whatever he chooses in this war, this war which has destroyed \nthousands of families' lives? Look at the President's record on Iraq: \nfalse intelligence on weapons of mass destruction; no posted invasion \nplan because the administration was convinced that we would be greeted \nwith sweets and flowers in a Utopian celebration. The President's team \ndecided to fire the entire Iraqi Army, dismissing 500,000 trained \ntroops who might have been helpful to us in fighting this insurgency. \nThen the Bush administration helped create further sectarian division \nby simply banning members from serving in the new Iraqi Government. The \nadministration has allied itself with an Iraqi Prime Minister who \nsupports a militia leader named Sadr who controlled a terrorist militia \nwhich disagrees with the formation of a stable government.\n  We all saw the waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer funds by \ncontractors such as Halliburton. The Iraqi reconstruction inspector \ngeneral said that nearly $3 billion in U.S. taxpayer dollars for Iraqi \nreconstruction has been lost--lost, vanished, $3 billion. That is not \nsloppy, that is incompetence. So it is understandable that a giant \nmajority of the American people are against this escalation. The other \nside of the aisle obviously does not want to vote consistent with the \nAmerican people's wishes or their prayers. Taxpayers are footing a \nmassive bill for these mistakes.\n  The administration gave Halliburton a no-bid contract thought to be \nworth $50 million--well, it surged to $2.5 billion--to operate Iraqi's \noil infrastructure. And what has that contract yielded in oil? Less oil \n4 years after the invasion than Iraq was producing before the war. \nHalliburton was forced to pay back $50 million after a fine was leveled \nagainst them by the Department of Defense. That is why the American \npeople say no surge for Halliburton.\n  I was a member of the Department of Homeland Security committee in \nthe previous Congress. I wrote five letters to the chairman asking we \nhave hearings, oversight hearings, on the Halliburton behavior in the \nwar. I was told that it would be duplicable, and we couldn't get a \nreview of Halliburton's behavior.\n  When the Republicans were in the majority, they said a vote against \nthe President's policy was cut-and-run, but now the American people are \nasking the question, What is the alternative? Stay and die?\n  In November, the American people spoke with the most effective means \nthey have; that is, the ballot box. They said no. They said they want a \nchange. They voted for a voice against the President. Now the \nRepublican minority is blocking Congress from speaking.\n\n  The President and the minority in the Senate cannot continue to \nignore the will of the American people. We already saw the President \nignore his own chosen Iraqi Study Group. First he appoints them; then \nhe challenges them or ignores them. He ignored the advice of GEN John \nAbizaid, who thinks this escalation is a bad idea. He ignored former \nSecretary of State Colin Powell, who said more troops are not the \nanswer.\n  When do we say enough is enough? Well, I think that time is past due.\n  Outside my office, to remind us all--I am very sensitive to veterans \nmatters, to our military, not just because I served but because they \nare there to protect us. And they do a splendid job, even when they are \nasked to do more than the numbers they should have are not in place, \nand the equipment has not been quite what it ought to be, delays in \nproducing that. We display a memorial outside my office showing the \n``Faces of the Fallen,'' which says: ``Let Us Never Forget.'' There are \nalmost 3,000 faces outside the door to my office. We have them on \neasels. It was our construction. The name, age, rank, battalion \naffiliation, and the cause of death of each of these Nation's fallen \nservicemembers is inscribed with their photo on the memorial. If you \nlook, you see the ages and how young they were and what they must have \nmeant to the families they left behind.\n  Friends and visitors search these photos daily for knowledge of \npeople they might know and miss. As they search, as they review these \npictures, some write notes in a book of reflections that we have out \nthere. A woman from Englewood, NJ, wrote:\n\n       How do we measure their sacrifice? We are so fortunate to \n     have these brave men and women.\n\n  A woman from Minnesota says:\n\n       This display brings tears to my eyes, to see how many lives \n     have been lost. Please stop more boards from being added and \n     bring those who would find themselves memorialized here home \n     safely.\n\n  A Californian simply wrote:\n\n       Bring them home!\n\n  These are what the American people want, and we ignore them at our \nown peril. We prevent a vote on this momentous issue at our own peril \nas well.\n\n[[Page S1671]]\n\n  I close, saying to my colleagues on the other side, please stop the \ninsinuations that we on this side of the aisle do not want to support \nour troops. Nothing could be further from the truth. Many of us, myself \nincluded, have been there to meet with our troops and see what they \nneed and see what they want and listen to their tales of the days they \nspend in harm's way. We want to support them. We salute them. They \nhonor their obligation to their country, even though we, in many cases, \ndisagree with the mission.\n  And when we fool ourselves into believing that all we have to do is \nto put more people in harm's way and we will get a stabilized \ngovernment there, we find, in many instances, the recruits they have in \nthe army there are just not capably trained, don't have the will, in \nmany instances, to take up the fight. And we want to put more of our \npeople in there?\n  I think what ought to be done--as many others here do--is to start to \nwhittle down our presence, leave enough of a resource there to help \ntrain those people, maybe instill some courage in their view of what \ntheir responsibilities are, get enough people in the flow--the Iraqi \npeople--and plan to get them home as soon as we practically can.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to share some thoughts about the \nsituation we find ourselves in. I do feel some obligation to comment on \nthe nature of the debate we are having, although I do not want to \ndescend into partisanship.\n  I would say that Senator Specter, I believe, is absolutely correct \nwhen he says the Republican Members of this body are not afraid to \nvote. They are prepared to vote on the Warner resolution. They are \nprepared to vote on the McCain resolution. They will vote on the Judd \nGregg resolution. But the problem is the Democratic leadership only \nwants one vote, and that is a vote on their resolution. So we have had \na vote. Less than 50 voted to go forward. So I do not see how we are at \na point where it can be suggested the members of this side are afraid \nto have a vote.\n  Why are they afraid to have two more votes, I would ask? I am not \nafraid to vote. I know how I would vote on those amendments. I am going \nto vote against the amendment that disapproves of the policies we are \nsending our troops to execute. And I am going to vote for the other \namendments of McCain and Gregg--if I had the chance. That is a minimum. \nThere may be others. Senator Specter indicated he would like to vote on \nsomething else.\n  But in truth, as I have said before, I am not happy about this whole \nresolution process. We are not in the business of resolutions here. We \nare in the business of funding or not funding the policies of the \nUnited States of America. We have committed to funding the policy that \nis now being executed. We have confirmed the general who will execute \nthat policy. Therefore, that is what we are about. That is the action \nwe have taken.\n  But, in general, let me say this one more thing because it touched my \nheart. Less than 30 minutes ago, right out here, I met an Alabamian \nwhose son is at Fort Benning, a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army, an \ninfantry officer. He thanked me for not going along with this negative \nresolution idea, and said: Senator, these soldiers are ``watching \nwhat you do like a hawk.''\n\n  Don't think what we do is just a gambit to embarrass the President. \nWe face many difficult decisions, pressures. We wrestle with competing \ninterests and emotions in this Senate. We have high hopes and dreams \nfor America. We do not all agree, and we should not. Ours is, at its \nbest, a democracy where robust and intelligent debate informs our \ndecisions. It makes us better. And we should respect one another even \nwhile we disagree. But this is a big deal. Lives are at stake. But this \nis what democracy is about. I want to be sure that when I say I believe \nsomeone is making a mistake, I am not attacking their character.\n  In the end, if a democracy cannot reach a decision on important \nissues, act decisively and execute those decisions, it will be weak and \nit will fall prey to the cruel, the despotic, and the strong. In order \nto avoid indecisiveness and weakness, there are some important common \nprinciples we must share. They are built, I believe, on love of country \nand a sincere belief in and admiration for this great Republic we \nserve. That is the unifying principle.\n  An extended, dangerous, and costly war in Iraq is not what we had \nhoped would occur when over three-fourths of the Members of this body--\nand I was here--voted to authorize the use of force against Saddam \nHussein. Certainly, I had hoped and have always favored bringing troop \nlevels down as soon as we can. The difficulties we face have caused, \nunderstandably, much unease and frustration in our country. Things have \nnot been going well. That is a true fact. The circumstances are grave, \nand our efforts in Iraq could fail, as General Casey and his \nreplacement, General Petraeus, have made clear, although, in truth, \nthese professionals have also made it clear they believe we can and \nwill succeed if we carry out the new policy that is now being projected \nin Iraq.\n  A congress of a nation, constructed like ours, that aspires to be a \ngreat nation and a great congress must consider how it should respond \nto such difficult circumstances in this winter of our discontent. How, \nnow, should we think about the tough challenges we face?\n  First, I believe the results of a failure and a precipitous \nwithdrawal from Iraq are grave and ominous. No one disputes that. Chaos \nand ethnic cleansing, death to those who put their lives on the line \nfor freedom and democracy would likely result, and more. Bad things \nwould occur. We have had testimony on that.\n  So to even those few now here in this Senate who voted against the \nuse of force, and to our newer Members of the Senate who are on record \nas being opposed to the policy, I say let's get together. Let's see how \nwe can deal with the problems we now face so our Nation and its \npolicies can be successful.\n  Few decisions are totally right or totally wrong. Sometimes things go \nbetter than expected. Sometimes they do not go as well. The test of a \nhealthy and strong nation is how it handles adversity.\n  To those who oppose our efforts in Iraq, I would say that it would be \na defensible position, I have to say, if you feel that strongly about \nit, to vote to cut off funds that would in effect force an immediate \nwithdrawal. But, in truth, even when Senators truly believe our efforts \nin Iraq were a mistake, a mature patriotic assessment of the short and \nlong-term consequences of such a withdrawal must be considered.\n  Immediate withdrawal is not a good option. It is not a good option. \nThat is obviously why so many of our Democratic colleagues who are not \nhappy with this war have not proposed such a step.\n  The one thing that is not acceptable is to take action--to take any \naction or concrete steps--to further the President's policy and then to \nvote for a resolution that makes it less likely to succeed. This is \nespecially true when this Congress has committed our military personnel \nto this task, placing them in harm's way to execute the mission this \nRepublic has given them.\n  Our military personnel have placed their very lives, their every \nwaking moment, on the line to achieve the mission that is assigned to \nthem. They are doing that every day. I have been there five times. We \nhave a moral responsibility to them that must not be lightly broken.\n  That commitment also goes to those many allies who have supported us, \nour friends in the region, and the good and decent Iraqis who voted for \nand stood up for democracy and freedom.\n  If this is a true concept--and I believe it is--then I urge, with \nrespect and with deep sincerity, that my colleagues do not give their \nsupport to any resolution that is likely to make our praiseworthy goal \nof a free and stable Iraq more difficult to achieve.\n  A resolution that is not binding but adversely impacts our efforts, \nwith all due respect, is a vote that cannot be justified. Other than \nperceived personal political benefits, or ``making a statement,'' what \nbenefit does such a vote provide our Nation's efforts? It has no \nimpact. Negative resolutions, therefore, can only place our soldiers, \nwhom we sent to execute this policy, at greater risk. It can only place \nthem at\n\n[[Page S1672]]\n\ngreater risk and make their task harder. Those in harm's way deserve \nour total support, and the policies we have asked them to execute \nshould also have our total support, until such time as we withdraw it.\n  I urge my colleagues to think this through. Let's pull back from this \nprecipice--not just from this vote but from votes in Congress that may \ncome in the future. Let's reassert our time-honored tradition that \n``politics stops at the water's edge,'' that politics must never place \nsoldiers at unnecessary risk. Let us not go down the road of passing \nresolutions whose only purpose is to emote, to express doubt about our \nNation's decided policy during a time of great challenge and risk.\n  A Senate of a great nation doesn't use a toothless resolution to \nvent. What good does such a thing do? Surely, we all understand, as did \nour Founders, that there can only be one policy, one Commander in \nChief, and one Congress. The Congress can cut off funds and stop it, if \nthey are so strongly committed to do so. But we are not doing that.\n  How have we slid into such a muddle? The answer is that politics \nseems to have taken over everything around here; it infects our very \nbeing, even during war. It is a dangerous trend. We are used to \n``splitting the difference'' here. Compromise is the nature of the \ngame, we are told, and indeed it is. You favor a $100 million program, \nperhaps, and I oppose it; and maybe we end up compromising on $50 \nmillion. The thing may have worked at $50 million, or it might have \nbeen a failure at $50 million. Who knows? But we compromise. But that \nis about money. This is about war, about the life and death of people, \nas fine as you can find in this country, who volunteered to serve us.\n  Some may say it is not certain that negative resolutions will weaken \nthe resolve of our friends and hurt the morale of our soldiers and \nembolden our enemies. Logic, however, says it will. Maybe you disagree. \nBut how can it be otherwise? Logic says it will. General Petraeus said \nit well a few days ago. Negative resolutions will likely have negative \nconsequences on our policy and place at greater risk the lives and \nhealth of our soldiers. What other purpose is there for this \nresolution, other than to somehow ratchet up the effort to force an \nabandonment of the policy we have funded and we are now executing.\n  Indeed, the whole world will think such a resolution that expresses \nonly ``feelings'' represents a weakening of American will, even while \nthe actual policy we are funding is to increase our strength and \ncommitment to the Iraq effort. Think about it. As their foundations, \nthese negative resolutions can only be described as totally \ncontradictory to our policy that we are at this moment executing. New \ntroops are moving there right now. Some have already arrived in Iraq. \nHave you not heard that?\n  For those unhappy and worried, I say let's get busy, all of us, and \ndo a better job. Let's find out more about this difficult struggle that \nwe are engaged in, find out more about Iraq, find out more about what \nour troops need, what their challenges are and what can and cannot be \ndone. Let's meet with General Pace and General Casey and Secretary \nGates; let's read the periodic reports that General Petraeus will be \nsending and spend more time keeping up with the situation on the ground \nin Iraq, rather than on polling numbers in our States. If we then reach \na point of no return, when our honest and best judgment is that success \nis not possible, then we can join with those few who are prepared to \ncast votes to force an end to our deployment in Iraq. That is what we \nare supposed to do.\n  Certainly, at this point, none can honestly say that we know what the \noutcome will be. I wish I could give full assurance of success, but I \ncannot. We do know this is a very difficult time. Al-Qaida is still \nactive, despite heavy losses and an inability--we may thank the Lord--\nto attack us again on our homeland, so far. The Iraqi Government has \nnot been strong and decisive, and violence, especially in Baghdad, has \nsteadily increased. The al-Qaida attack on the Samarra Mosque last \nFebruary, designed to create sectarian violence in the country, \nsucceeded in sparking a spate of sectarian killing and reprisals that \ncontinue today.\n  Still, General Abizaid and General Casey, our former commander, and \nGeneral Petraeus, our new commander, know the true situation there \nbetter than we do. General Abizaid has been there four years, I \nbelieve, and General Casey, 30 months. They have lived it. They have \nstudied it. They sincerely believe and have publicly stated, under \noath, that this surge of American troops, with a surge of Iraqi troops \nand the new tactics to be employed, can lead to the goals that we \nseek--a stable, peaceful, and prosperous Iraq. It can be successful. We \nshould not be overly negative. Indeed, I asked this question of General \nPetraeus. A few days ago in his testimony, he said he would not take \nthis job if he didn't believe he would succeed. General Petraeus \ncommanded the 101st Airborne Division when they went into northern \nIraq, in Mosul. He did a fabulous job. They jokingly called him the \n``mayor of Mosul.'' We toured the area the projects he had worked to \nestablish. He understands the need of walking the streets and talking \nwith the Iraqi people and encouraging them to take over their country. \nHe came home, and then they asked him to go back and train the Iraqi \nsecurity forces and he agreed to do so. He left his family again and \nwent back and spent a year in Iraq. I am sure he knows every top \ngeneral by name in the Iraqi Army, or virtually all of them. He spent \nanother year there doing that. Then he came back and he spent a year \ndrafting and writing the Department of Defense counterinsurgency \nmanual. It is 100 or more pages, a big document; it is a very \nimportant, complex, carefully worked out document that tells how to \nconfront and defeat an insurgency operation. That is the plan we have \nasked him to go back with now. I believe we need to give General \nPetraeus a chance.\n\n  We have lost over 3,000 lives in our Iraq effort. The losses, in my \nview, are less than expected during the initial assault on Baghdad in \nIraq and far more than I expected in the aftermath. Much of this, I am \nsure, was the result of errors we made. Much arises from the inherent \ndifficulties of the tasks that were underestimated. Of that, there can \nbe no doubt. But no Government agency even comes close to our military \nin being brutally honest and doing after-action reports and self-\nevaluations. That is going on now and will continue for years. They are \na magnificent force. I can only believe that if we truly support them, \nas a great Senate and a great Congress should when they are executing \nthe policies we have directed them to execute, they will be successful. \nI further believe it is premature for us to withdraw. We owe it to \nthose State Department officials, other Government agencies, NGOs, \npatriotic Iraqi civilians who voted for a new and better Iraq, to the \nIraqi security forces who have taken more casualties than we have, to \nthose international allies who have stood with us in Iraq and, most of \nall, to our military personnel who have given their heroic best to \naccomplish our Nation's just and decent goals in Iraq, to give this new \npolicy and General Petraeus a chance. I think they can and will do it. \nBut I do not doubt the difficulties and I do not doubt there is \nuncertainty.\n  If, heaven forbid, our efforts do not prevail, it will be appropriate \nto completely rethink our commitment to Iraq. So why do we want to pass \na resolution? Senator Reid says he wants to provide Senators a chance \nto show their disapproval of the President's policy. With respect, \nSenator Reid has--I know it is unwitting and unintentional--crossed the \nline there. It is clear that this resolution, which has no binding \neffect and is only a political document, is not necessary, does not \nhelp, and I totally oppose it. It is wrong, in my view.\n  While our soldiers are courageously placing their lives on the line \nfor us, and while there is no serious suggestion that we should cut off \nthe funds for the surge the Commander in Chief has ordered and which \nthe Baker-Hamilton group suggested might be necessary, a toothless \nresolution is the wrong thing to do. I am certainly glad it did not \ngarner many votes.\n  So can we, for a while at least, stand united in our good and worthy \nefforts to help the people of Iraq achieve a decent, peaceful and \nstable Government? Can't we do that? The challenge remains great. The \ncosts are high. I say\n\n[[Page S1673]]\n\nlet's follow through, united, on this new strategy under our new \ngeneral. I believe we can be successful. If the Iraqis fail to respond \nand if the new strategy is not effective, we will know soon enough. And \nan honest, professional, and realistic evaluation of what to do next \nwill fall into our hands. We should complete that task effectively, \ngiving our best effort and judgment to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Montana be recognized next for up to 15 minutes, to be followed by \nmyself for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, I further ask unanimous \nconsent that after the completion of the remarks of the Senator from \nNevada, and after one other Democrat, I be recognized for up to 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of the thousands of \nMontanans who have lost faith in the way this administration is \nconducting the war in Iraq.\n  Our troops have given more than most of us can imagine. This \nadministration has asked much of them. They should be commended for \ntheir performance in a war that has been mismanaged from the get-go.\n  In 1972, deep into the Vietnam war, the great Senator, the great \nstatesman, Senator Mike Mansfield, whose seat I am now honored to hold, \nspoke of a great nation. When times demand it, it is wise for us to \ntake a step back and look at those who served before us.\n  Standing not far from where I stand today, Senator Mansfield said:\n\n       Mr. President, it does no great nation any harm to admit \n     that a mistake has been made. And sometimes when nations and \n     men will do so, they will be the bigger and the better for \n     it.\n\n  Many years later, Mansfield would say that when he was gone, he \nwanted to be forgotten. We have not forgotten Mike Mansfield, and we \nmust not forget his measured approach to diplomacy, his steady hand, \nand the lesson that admitting a mistake is the first step in correcting \nit.\n  It is time we debate the facts of this situation so this country's \nleaders can make the right decisions.\n  I have said for more than a year that this war is being conducted \nwithout a plan for success and there is no end in sight. For too long, \nthis body has refused to ask the tough questions, to debate the merits \nof this war, and has not held the President accountable for the \ndeteriorating situation in Iraq.\n  Disturbingly, recent reports confirm that our invasion of Iraq has \ncreated more terrorists than it has eliminated. Yet the terrorist who \nplotted the most deadly attack on U.S. soil--Osama bin Laden--remains \nat large and ignored by the administration.\n  In addition to the more than 3,000 killed since the war began, 17 of \nwhom are from Montana, there have been more than 23,000 wounded in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. Many will come home missing one or more limbs. Others \nwill return home to battle posttraumatic stress disorder.\n  Last week, I joined several of my colleagues, along with two Iraqi \nwar veterans, and called on the administration to get serious about \nfunding for veterans health care. I renew that call today for permanent \nmandatory full funding of VA health care. There is no reason veterans \nshould be forced to come to us every year hat in hand and beg for \nfunding. It should be permanent, and it should be fully funded. Right \nnow, it is neither.\n  Our country's veterans do not seek, nor do they expect, recognition \nfrom their Commander in Chief, nor the American people. But we owe them \nnot only the recognition but also the promise that we will care for \nthem and their families when they return.\n  Following the gulf war, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nGEN Colin Powell, outlined his plan for efficient and decisive military \naction, now referred to as the Powell doctrine.\n  The Powell doctrine clearly outlines what U.S. military action should \nlook like:\n  Military action should be used only as a last resort and only if \nthere is a clear risk to the national security by the intended target.\n  Force, when used, should be overwhelming and disproportionate to the \nforce used by the enemy.\n  There must be strong support for the campaign by the general public.\n  And last, there must be a clear exit strategy from the conflict in \nwhich the military is engaged.\n  One by one, this administration has violated every principle of the \nPowell doctrine and, as a result, we are lost in Iraq and alone in the \nworld.\n  Clear risk to national security? Prior to the invasion, the \nadministration claimed that Iraq's nuclear capabilities made it a grave \nthreat to America's national security, allegations that proved to be \nfalse.\n  Overwhelming force? The administration was unprepared for the dangers \nof urban combat, for improvised explosive devices, and continues to \nsend troops into harm's way without proper armor. It is unconscionable \nthat these soldiers are being sent into battle without all of the tools \nthey need to be safe and successful. It is unacceptable to send them \nthere with no plan for, or definition of, success.\n  Public support? Perhaps the most significant difference between the \nfirst gulf war and the war in Iraq is the lack of support from our \nallies. Like World War II, the gulf war was successful because America \nbuilt a strong coalition and did not force our troops to carry the \nburden alone.\n  As support for this war continues to erode, so, too, does our \nstanding in the world. Just a few years ago, nearly the entire world \nstood at America's side following the attacks on September 11. That \ngood will has long since been squandered.\n  And finally, an exit strategy? The President has proposed sending \n21,500 more troops into Iraq as a strategy for victory. Staying the \ncourse by escalating this war only spells disaster.\n  This country should no longer tolerate, nor can it afford, an open-\nended conflict that has claimed more than 3,000 lives, injured more \nthan 23,000, and cost the United States taxpayers $2 billion every \nweek.\n  Recently, the President proposed sending 21,500 more troops into \ndowntown Baghdad. But according to the Congressional Budget Office, \nthat actually means almost 50,000 additional troops when you include \nthe 28,000 troops needed to provide critical support to those combat \ntroops. This could cost up to $27 billion to sustain over the next \nyear. That would be more than three times the largest estimate of troop \nescalation costs provided by the Bush administration.\n  The addition of almost 50,000 American troops means more American \nyoung men and women without adequate body armor riding in ill-armored \nhumvees into one of the most dangerous combat zones in history. \nHistorical data from this war tells us that sending 21,500 troops into \nIraq will mean that between 300 and 500 additional soldiers will die in \nIraq than if this escalation were not to occur.\n  Adding more troops is not a strategy, it is a tactic, and it is not a \nnew one. There have been four such troop escalations in Iraq so far, \nand to what end? What benefit has been realized by this country, the \nIraqi people, or the region?\n  The long-awaited National Intelligence Estimate, prepared \ncollectively by 16 intelligence agencies for the President, was \nreleased last week. It paints a bleak picture of the deteriorating \nsituation in Iraq, and it describes the urgent need for conditions to \nbe reversed measurably to stop the violence and widespread polarization \nof the Iraqi society.\n\n  So I call on the President to heed the grave warnings of the National \nIntelligence Estimate, to listen to his own Iraq Study Group, the \nCongress, and the American people.\n  Last month, my colleague Senator Baucus called on the administration \nto map a new course in Iraq. Senator Baucus said we must not escalate \nthe conflict, we must train Iraqi troops to stand up for themselves, we \nmust start bringing our troops home as soon as possible, and we must \nengage Iraqi's neighbors and the world community. He was right then; he \nis right today.\n  The solution for a new course in Iraq will not be solely a military \none.\n\n[[Page S1674]]\n\nSwitching to political and diplomatic solutions involving our allies in \nthe region is not a defeatist strategy, but instead an appropriate \ncourse for a war of this complexity and magnitude.\n  The President needs to set a timeline to give the Iraqi people \nmilitary control of their country. It should be the Iraqi Army--not \nMontanans, not Americans--disarming bombs and guarding bridges. The \nadministration needs to reinvest in special forces and human \nintelligence if we are to win the real war on terror.\n  Nearly 4 years have passed, more than a half a trillion dollars have \nbeen spent, more than 3,000 American soldiers have died since the \nPresident announced that major combat operations in Iraq had ended and \ntold us: ``Mission Accomplished.''\n  Funding for this war and its success or failure should have been \ndebated long ago. It is time for a real debate on the direction and \nstrategy of this war, starting with the President's proposal for \nescalation.\n  The President must also tell the American people what success means \nand how it should be quantified. If success is free elections in Iraq, \nthen we should have been gone 2 years ago. If success is toppling \nSaddam Hussein, then we should have been gone 3 years ago. If it is \nsomething else, then the administration needs to be honest with the \nAmerican people and identify a clear and achievable outcome.\n  I support the Warner-Levin resolution opposing the President's plan \nto escalate the war in Iraq. But I want to be clear: I view the Warner-\nLevin resolution as only a first step. We have a duty to debate the \nescalation on its merits and let both sides be heard.\n  This week's efforts to delay a vote on Warner-Levin do nothing to \nmake our troops safer. Blocking an up-or-down vote on this resolution \ndoes nothing to bring this bloody war any closer to its close.\n  I have been here not too long--just a month--and I am still learning \nthe ropes, but make no mistake, we should deliberate, we should not \nrush to judgment or sentence, but that does not mean we should not \ndebate.\n  For 3 days we have been debating about whether we should debate the \nPresident's plan to escalate the war in Iraq. I have been all over \nMontana in the last couple of years, and everywhere I went people were \nand continue to be deeply concerned about the war. They didn't all \nagree, but there was always a lively and passionate debate. Not a \nsingle person told me we should debate about whether to have a debate.\n  Our troops, the American people, and the Iraqi people deserve an open \nand honest discussion. We need to ask the tough questions, we need to \ndemand the answers, and we need to bring our troops home as safely and \nas quickly as possible.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, this afternoon, I rise to add my voice to \nthe current debate on the President's announced plan to reinforce \ncoalition forces in Iraq by sending additional American soldiers and \nmarines to Baghdad and Al Anbar Province in an effort to bring \nstability to that volatile part of that country.\n  For some time now, Senators have been clamoring for President Bush to \nsend additional troops to Iraq. They criticized him for trying to \naccomplish our goals in Iraq without committing sufficient resources to \nget the job done.\n  Look, the President has recognized that a change in strategy is \nabsolutely necessary. Many have previously called for this same \nstrategy. But it appears to this Senator that because it is the \nPresident's plan, some Senators are predisposed against it.\n  A simple review of newspaper and Sunday talk show transcripts reveals \nsome Senators appear to have supported the surge before they were \nagainst the surge. Senator Kerry on NBC's ``Today'' program on June 29, \n2005:\n\n       We don't have enough troops in Iraq. . . . There aren't \n     enough people on the ground. . . . The way you honor the \n     troops and the way you provide a policy to America is to do \n     everything possible to win.\n\n  Senator Durbin on December 21, 2006:\n\n       If we need initially some troops in Baghdad, for example, \n     to quiet the situation, make it more peaceful so that our \n     soldiers start coming home, then I would accept it.\n\n  Mr. President, that is exactly what General Petraeus has said, and \nSecretary Gates before the Armed Services Committee said the same \nthing. It is an initial surge to try to get Baghdad under control so we \ncan begin bringing our troops home.\n  Senator Dodd on December 18, 2006, said:\n\n       I'd be willing to support some additional people if we \n     needed it in order to get the job done.\n\n  He further said:\n\n       Show me some demonstrable evidence that they are coming \n     together as a people--Shias and Sunnis--sitting down and \n     recognizing that they have an obligation to come together as \n     a people. Then I'd be willing to support some additional \n     people if we needed it in order to get the job done.\n\n  Senator Levin in January of 2007 said:\n\n       A surge would be worth considering. The American people are \n     skeptical about getting in deeper . . . But if it is truly \n     conditional upon the Iraqis actually meeting milestones and \n     if it's part of an overall program of troop reduction that \n     would begin in the next four to six months, it's something \n     that would be worth considering.\n\n  Once again, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee \nyesterday, that is exactly what Secretary Gates said, that it is a \ntemporary surge in order to try to bring the troops home.\n  Senator Biden on June 29, 2005, said:\n\n       There's not enough force on the ground now to mount a real \n     counterinsurgency.\n\n  Senator Jack Reed, in a press conference on November 29, 2006, said:\n\n       If the military commanders in Iraq said, we need, for X \n     number of months, 20-plus, 25,000 troops, to do this mission, \n     I would have to listen to that proposal. I think I responded \n     to the question before: That if the military commanders in \n     Iraq said, we need, for X number of months, 20-plus, 25,000, \n     troops to do this mission, and with a reasonable certainty of \n     success, I would have to listen to that proposal, certainly.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, within the last 2 weeks, there have been \nadditional developments that would seem to add weight to the argument \nthat this temporary reinforcement of our troops currently in Iraq is \nnot only warranted but necessary to the overall national purpose. Those \ndevelopments are the unanimous confirmation by this Senate of General \nPetraeus, who is to become the new commander--he is the new commander \nof the Iraqi multinational force--also, the testimony of the Iraq Study \nGroup cochairman, relative to the President's plan, before the Senate \nCommittee on Foreign Relations, and the public release of the National \nIntelligence Estimate report on the prospects for Iraq's stability.\n  During his confirmation hearing, General Petraeus, also the author of \nthe Army's new counterinsurgency manual, stressed the fact that he \ncould not succeed in providing needed security for the citizens of \nBaghdad and Al Anbar Province without the additional troops called for \nin the President's plan.\n  General Petraeus further testified at his hearing that it was his \nopinion that any resolution which stated the Senate did not support the \nstrategy to be carried out by our men and women in uniform in Iraq \nwould be harmful to their morale. Are we going to support General \nPetraeus or not? The one resolution before us, I believe, is not \nsupporting General Petraeus and the troops.\n  Last week, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations held a hearing \non America's interests in Iraq, at which the witnesses were the Iraq \nStudy Group cochairman, former Secretary of State James Baker, and \nformer Congressman Lee Hamilton. Secretary Baker referenced the Iraq \nStudy Group's report in articulating that group's position on \nadditional troops to Iraq. He stated:\n\n       We could support a short-term redeployment or surge of \n     American combat forces to stabilize Baghdad or to speed up \n     the training and equipping mission if the U.S. Commander in \n     Iraq determines such steps would be effective. The only two \n     conditions are short-term and commander in Iraq determines it \n     would be effective. Both of those conditions have been met.\n\n  Mr. Hamilton made it clear his belief that the President's plan ought \nto be given a chance. He said:\n\n       We did not, in the Iraq Study Group report, come to the \n     conclusion that it was hopeless and, therefore, we should \n     just pull out immediately.\n\n  The much anticipated and just released National Intelligence Estimate \nreport entitled ``Prospects for Iraq's\n\n[[Page S1675]]\n\nStability: A Challenging Road Ahead'' was quite candid in its \nassessment that if coalition forces are withdrawn within the next 12 to \n18 months, we will see significant increase in the scale and scope of \nsectarian conflict in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, we need to accept the fact that we are engaged in a \nstruggle of biblical proportions. In true American fashion, though, we \nare doing the right thing. We are attempting to free a people from a \nlife of tyranny and violence. We are also in a struggle against the \nforces of evil who are bent on our destruction. Do we pack up and \nleave, even though every voice of reason tells us that Iraq would \nimplode into a terrorist state used by al-Qaida as a launching pad \nagainst the infidels, reminiscent of Afghanistan under the Taliban? And \nthose infidels, they think, are us.\n  As Senator McCain has reminded us time and again, Iraq is not \nVietnam. When we left South Vietnam, the Viet Cong did not pursue us \nback to our shores. Al-Qaida is not the Viet Cong. Al-Qaida has sworn \nto destroy us and is committed to bringing their brand of terror to \nAmerica.\n  President Bush never said the struggle for freedom in Iraq would be \neasy. But since the President is the one who said that, maybe it \ndoesn't ring quite as true to some. Maybe by quoting another who spoke \npassionately about similar struggles for freedom, the point could be \nmade more clearly. Back in 1857, Frederick Douglass spoke about the \nstruggle he knew for freedom. He said:\n\n       The whole history of the progress of human liberty shows \n     that all concessions yet made to her august claims have been \n     born of earnest struggle. If there is no struggle, there is \n     no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom, and yet \n     deprecate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing \n     up the ground. They want rain without thunder and lightning. \n     They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many \n     waters.\n\n  We are introducing freedom to a country and a region that has no \nhistory of such freedoms. We cannot expect to spread freedom and \ndemocracy to this region simply by wishing it so.\n  We currently have soldiers and marines in harm's way. We have a plan \nbefore us that will aid their mission. That mission is to achieve \nsuccess and leave behind a stable and democratic Iraq. Yet there are \nthose among us who want to cut and run. There are some among us who \nsimply want to cut and walk. And then there are others who want to have \nit both ways. They want to express their opposition to the idea of \nsending additional troops to Iraq without having to do anything that \nmight actually translate their opposition to a reality on the ground.\n  I belong to another group of thinkers. I belong to a group who \nbelieves General Petraeus's plan deserves a chance. I believe the \ntemporary surge in the number of soldiers and marines in Baghdad and Al \nAnbar is our best chance at getting this right. None of us knows for \nsure whether it will work. There are always uncertainties in war. Let \nus all pray, for all our sakes, that this new way works.\n  Last week, I stood here and spoke about what I thought needed to be \ndone in Iraq. I acknowledged that mistakes have been made in this war \nand that I did not believe we should be playing politics while our \nsoldiers and marines are deployed and fighting against an enemy bent on \ndestroying our country and our way of life. I called on my fellow \nSenators then to set party differences aside and focus on winning this \nwar. I am here again this afternoon making that same plea.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I notice there are no other Members here, \nso I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized for up to 15 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada expressed my \nfeelings in a much more articulate way than I ever could, and one of \nthe last things he said is: Mistakes have been made in this war. I \nwould suggest mistakes have been made in every war. Winston Churchill \nonce said:\n\n       Never, never, never believe any war will be smooth and \n     easy. Always remember, however sure you are that you could \n     easily win, that there would not be a war if the other man \n     did not think he also had a chance to win.\n\n  This statement was made many years ago, but it is relevant today. \nToday, we face an enemy who is determined, adaptive, and willing to go \nto any means of terror and violence to win. He cannot be negotiated \nwith, and he will not be satisfied until the entire world is brought \nunder his dreadful ideology.\n  We have seen this kind before. We saw it with Stalin, with Pol Pot, \nand with Hitler, but never before has an enemy metastasized this way. \nThere is no centralized headquarters we can bomb, no one leader we can \neliminate. We will continue to strike terrorism where it appears and \ntrack down its leaders but know this will not end the conflict. Victory \nwill come the way it always has. We will destroy the enemy's belief he \ncan win.\n  Any resolution against the President's plan does two things: It tells \nthe enemy, No. 1, that they have been successful; and, No. 2, it gives \nthem patience to wait us out. They are a very patient people. We have \nalready done ourselves damage by bringing the issue to the public eye. \nDo you believe they do not watch our news; that they are not scouring \nour media for any hope or any chink in our resolve? Don't be so naive. \nTheir very survival depends on it. This is the only way they can hope \nto win. If we cannot destroy their will, we will destroy them.\n  This sounds brutal and not very reconciling, but I intend it that \nway. There is a clear choice and no other option. If we do not fight \nthem in Iraq, we will be fighting them in Philadelphia, in Pittsburgh, \nin Kansas City, in Los Angeles, and in Seattle. We will be playing \ndefensive until, once again, just as occurred after 9/11, our resolve \nhardens and we summon up the courage to destroy the enemy. And we must \nbecause the alternative is what happened to Rome: Factions of internal \nstrife kept the great power tied up for so long that it lost its \nstrength, its will, and its resolve. The period following was known as \nthe Dark Ages, and this is indeed what al-Qaida seeks.\n  Our country represents the light of freedom and democracy. Yet I fear \nwe have begun a terrible introspective and downward cycle. Our resolve \nlasts for a few months, maybe a year, but all it takes is enough time \nand then we break. Our enemy knows this. We can look to our mission in \nSomalia in 1933, at our reaction to the bombings in Lebanon at the \nKhobar Towers and in Vietnam. I am not saying we necessarily should \nhave stayed in Vietnam, but I am saying we must recognize that while \nthis introspection guarantees our freedom, it is also our greatest \nweakness.\n  There have been no major terrorist attacks on U.S. soil since 9/11. \nThere have been attempts, and we know we have thwarted over 10 \noperations. However, we also know these were relatively underdeveloped \nand small in scale. I wish to ask a dark question: Why has al-Qaida not \nstruck again? Because they cannot? We have stepped up our security, but \nthey have shown their destructive creativity in the past. Because they \nare focused on Iraq and Afghanistan? Perhaps. But I would suggest \nanother option. What if they have chosen not to. What if they have \nrealized the strategy of restraint, pricking us just enough to launch \nourselves at them, and then they fade back. We expend ourselves \nattacking new enemies, building countries, and undermining each other. \nPolitics and personal reputations create an impetus of their own.\n  We should debate. That is exactly what the Senate body is intended to \ndo. But do not undermine. The new commander in Iraq, General Petraeus, \nhas stated that a resolution of disapproval would hurt his efforts. \nThis is the new guy. Let us keep in mind that we voted unanimously to \nconfirm General Petraeus to take over that very difficult job. When \nasked by Senator Lieberman about the effect a resolution of disapproval \nwould have on our troops and our enemies, General Petraeus stated that:\n\n       This is a test of will at the end of the day. A commander \n     in such an endeavor would obviously like the enemy to feel \n     there is no hope.\n\n  That is what General Petraeus said. He went on to say he does need \nmore troops and he believes the new plan can work.\n  I recognize there have been mistakes made in Iraq, as we have talked \nabout. The President has also recognized this.\n\n[[Page S1676]]\n\nEveryone has recognized this, and the President has taken full \nresponsibility for it. Yet we still find ourselves in a difficult \nsituation, with hard decisions to be made about the best way ahead. \nThese decisions affect many lives, both our soldiers in harm's way and \nthe American people they are pledged to protect. I think we all agree \nit would be disastrous to leave Iraq precipitously. If we do, we know \nwe can expect increased levels of violence, the spread of extremist \nideology, and Iraq itself collapsing into anarchy.\n  A personal friend of mine, who actually was a commander at Fort Sill \nin Oklahoma, General Maples, stated that:\n\n       Continued Coalition presence is the primary counter to a \n     breakdown in central authority. Such a breakdown would have \n     grave consequences for the people of Iraq, stability in the \n     region, and the U.S. strategic interest.\n       John Negroponte and the CIA Director, General Hayden agree \n     with that, as does General Petraeus. So it is not too late to \n     avoid this. I don't think it is time to start cutting our \n     losses and just hope it goes away. We have heard the \n     President ask for our support.\n\n  Let me share, on a personal note, that I have had the occasion to be \nin Iraq more than any other Member of either the House or the Senate, \nsome 12 times now, and the first thing I do is talk to the troops. The \ntroops come up to me, and the first question they ask is: Why is it the \nmedia doesn't like us? Why is it they are constantly undermining our \nefforts here? Why is it the American people don't understand or \nappreciate what we are doing? I say, yes, the American people do, but a \nlot of the politicians don't act that way.\n  I have been very much concerned about this, and I believe any \nresolution, and we are talking about five or six resolutions now, any \nresolution that is a resolution of retreat would be a resolution of \nsurrender.\n  I think it is ludicrous for any Member to say I support the troops \nbut I don't support their mission. You try to explain that to them. I \ntalked to the troops in Fallujah. In all this discussion about, do we \nneed to be training the Iraqis to be fighting their own war--sure we \ndo. That is what we have been doing. We have been doing that since we \narrived on the scene in Iraq, and they are very proud and they are \ntaking the frontal positions right now. The Iraqis are doing a good \njob. Their training has been good. Their equipment is not good, but it \nis getting better, it is improving.\n  I stood there at the last election in Fallujah when our marines were \nthere and I talked, through an interpreter, to the Iraqi security \nforces, and they said they are very proud. We are going to be in a \nposition--please stay with us until we can hold our own here, and that \nwon't be too long. I know that is true. I know they have come up with \nthe numbers, now, that would be equal to about 10 divisions. I believe \nthis can happen.\n  This is very serious. Politics has crept into this thing. But any \nsupport of a resolution of surrender not only is undermining our troops \nand saying to our troops: We don't support you, but also saying to the \nloved ones of those who paid the ultimate sacrifice that they have died \nin vain. We can't let that happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we have come to a critical crossroads with \nrespect to our operations in Iraq. After the Iraq Study Group spent \nmonths considering the issue of the best policy going forward, \nsuggesting a phased redeployment along with other measures, diplomatic \nmeasures that would enhance the security of the United States and \nprotect our soldiers there in Iraq, the President had the opportunity \nto accept those recommendations. It was a bipartisan panel of eminent \nAmericans--James Baker and Lee Hamilton and so many others. The \nPresident specifically rejected them, not just in substance but in \ntone. In his speech a few weeks ago, he declared that he had learned \nvery little from the Iraq Study Group, that he was not committed to a \nphased redeployment, he was committed to an escalation of approximately \n20,000 troops and a change in tactics in Baghdad.\n  I think he had the opportunity at that moment to do several things. \nFirst, he could have accepted the wisdom of the Iraq Study Group. But, \nmore important, he could have communicated to the American public that \nhis policy was based on the reality in Iraq, that he had learned from a \nseries of mistakes he and his administration had made, and that he \ncould have sustained a way forward in Iraq. He didn't do that, and I \nthink the American people reacted as they should have reacted, with \ndeclining confidence in his leadership and, frankly, posing the \nfundamental question of, How does one sustain any policy when 70 \npercent of the U.S. population considers it to be erroneous and not in \nthe best interests of this country going forward? I believe the \nPresident squandered the last opportunity he had to rally people behind \nhis policy.\n  Now we are in the midst of a debate, we hope, about that policy. We \nare being stymied in terms of bringing this to the floor in a clear and \nclarion vote that tells the American people where we stand as \nindividual Senators with respect to the President's plan for \nescalation. We are being frustrated in the sense that there is an \nattempt to present other issues and not the issue of the moment, the \nissue under debate. There is no debate about our support for American \nsoldiers around the globe and marines and sailors and airmen and \nairwomen. We support them. We think their mission should be changed to \nprotect them and to advance the interests of our country, but there is \nno stinting in our support of these valiant young Americans.\n  The issue which divides this Senate and the issue which captures the \nfeelings and the passions of the American public is whether we will \nstand in approval or disapproval of the President's proposal to \nescalate forces in Iraq. I believe that vote should come. That vote \nshould be clear. The vote should stand by itself, not shrouded by other \nmeasures that are designed not to address the concerns of American \npeople but simply to give the President additional cover.\n  What has happened since the last 3-plus years, from the invasion of \nIraq--indeed, preceding the invasion of Iraq, in this Senate, under the \ncontrol of the Republicans, has not done a good job at all of \noversight, of investigation, of asking critical questions. Where was \nthe Republican leadership, in the fall of 2002 and early 2003, when \nthey should have been asking a simple question: What if we win the \nconventional battle? What about the occupation? Where is the plan? \nWhere are the resources? How many Americans will it take to secure a \nlarge country with a population of about 26 million people, with a \nhistory of intersectarian tensions, with a history of a colonial past \nunder the British that has established, some would say artificially, \nthe boundaries of this nation? Those questions were not asked seriously \nand consistently and, as a result, this administration made huge \nmistakes when it came to the issue of how to successfully translate a \nconventional victory against the Iraqi military forces into a \nsuccessful transition to a stable country. Now we see Iraq enthralled \nin doubt and violence that seems to be unable to be quenched. Our \nAmerican forces are in the middle of that.\n  It is interesting, when we come to this point, to look seriously at \nthe National Intelligence Estimate. One of the grave deficiencies we \nrecognize today--some of us recognized it in October of 2002--is that \nthe intelligence being used to sell this operation was flawed. Now I \nthink we have a much more precise and carefully adjusted view of what \nis happening in Iraq today.\n  If you look at the NIE, it presents to us some profound \ncontradictions.\n  First, and I agree with this assessment, is that the violence today \nis principally the result of sectarian conflict. The accelerators that \nraise the tempo of this violence can be found in the insurgent groups, \nal-Qaida in Iraq, some of these Shia militias, but the underlying \nbattles today are between sectarian groups. The NIE describes this as a \nwinner-take-all approach, as an existential battle between Shias--who \nfeel a sense of insecurity given the history, particularly the last \ndecade, of total oppression by a Sunni minority--and Sunnis, who feel a \nsense of entitlement that is going to be frustrated by the new, \nemerging order in Iraq. These existential battles, as the NIE \nindicates, are in a sense self-sustaining.\n  But here is where the confusion, the conflict, the contradiction \ncomes\n\n[[Page S1677]]\n\nabout. Most of the remedies we are all talking about involve \nreconciliation--political sectarian reconciliation. The issue--and one \nwhich will be decided in the next months and weeks in Iraq--is, can any \nexistential conflict ever be reconciled? Has this conflict reached a \npoint where it is truly self-sustaining and our forces in the middle of \nit are unable to be a moderating force at all?\n  My view and the view of so many others is that when you look at this \nsituation on the ground and you consider what can be done, the decisive \nactions must be those of the Iraqi Government. They are political \nactions; that the presence of our military forces is important but not \ndecisive. Certainly the size of our military forces is probably not as \ndecisive as actions that must be undertaken by the Maliki government \nreining in the militias, truly trying to reach out beyond this huge \nsectarian chasm for reconciliation. These political, economic, and \nsocial decisions are not going to be made simply because we have \nincreased our presence in Baghdad by 20 percent or we have changed the \ntactics.\n\n  Another aspect of this debate is the concentration, almost \nexclusively, on the military aspects of the President's plan. That, \nfrankly, has been one of the great shortcomings and faults of the \nadministration--and of this and previous Congresses, I should say--in \nterms of our approach in Iraq. Any military commander on the ground \nwill tell you that they are buying time and that time has to be used \nfor economic progress and political progress. The component in the \nPresident's plan that I heard stresses an increase of 20,000 soldiers, \nbut where is the progress in terms of not only Iraqi decisionmakers \nmaking tough decisions but American advisers--State Department \nofficials, USAID officials, Justice Department officials--going over \nthere to help start the other side, the other part of the process, the \neconomic progress, the social progress, the political mentoring? That \nhas never been the case. As a result, our strategy has failed \nconsistently.\n  Unless this plan has complementary and reinforcing elements--\nmilitary, political, and economic--it, too, will fail. I do not see, \nfrankly, the complementary political and economic support necessary to \ncarry off this plan.\n  What we have is 20,000 troops. If you look at the doctrine--and it is \ninteresting because General Petraeus, the designated commander, is one \nof the principal authors of this new doctrine--that doctrine today \nwould call for 120,000 troops in Baghdad based upon the size in \nBaghdad. We are sending an additional 20,000, which means our presence, \nAmerican presence, is about 30,000 troops. The Iraqis have committed to \nroughly 55,000 troops, which brings us to a total of 85,000, but that \nstill is roughly 35,000 troops short of the doctrine.\n  In addition, I don't think anyone considers that the Iraqi forces can \ntruly muster 55,000 effective troops. We have already seen the reports \ncome in that brigades, Iraqi brigades, are showing up at 50 percent \nstrength, and of those, one has to ask seriously how many are effective \nfighters. Where are the shortcomings? If it is half a brigade and they \nare all privates and corporals, that is not an effective fighting \nforce, or if it is half a fighting brigade and they are all majors and \nlieutenant colonels, that is not an effective fighting force. So we are \nseeing a situation, even in military terms, where this surge is \nprobably lacking significantly in terms of the size of the force.\n  In addition, we all understand that there is a divided command. One \nof the key issues in any military operation is unity of command. There \nis an Iraqi commander who is selected probably for his political \nreliability more than his tactical or technical skill. There is also a \nsituation in that our new tactics require significantly more enablers. \nThese enablers are the translators, the civil affairs officers, the \ncombat service support officers to supply these outposts now in each \nneighborhood. In fact, the Government Accountability Office has done a \nreport indicating that if a 21,000 increment is made, it might turn out \nto be closer to 50,000 if you truly have all the support troops you \nneed to get the job done.\n  There are so many shortcomings in just the political and military \naspects of this plan. So I believe, again, this is an opportunity, a \nmoment we have to address this plan, this proposal of the President's, \nin a very serious way and take a stand on it one way or the other. I \nhope we can do that. I hope we can do that in the intervening days, \ncertainly before the end of this month, or the end of, I hope, this \nweek.\n\n  Now, I think there are other aspects that are important to consider \nwhen we talk about the situation as we go forward. I will go back to \nthe point I think hindered us consistently throughout our operations in \nIraq, and that is despite the extraordinary valor and technical skill \nof our military forces, they have never been truly complemented by non-\nDepartment of Defense personnel, by the State Department officials, by \nthe Agriculture officials. I can recall visiting Fallujah twice in the \nmiddle of Anbar Province. Those marines are doing a magnificent job \nalong with many Army units that are there. There is one State \nDepartment official in Fallujah who is charged with mentoring, with \nadvice, with reconstruction, with all of these things. That is not \nadequate, and I don't see any indication in the President's proposal \nthat is going to change. This is all about, again, trying to take a \nmilitary solution to what is a complicated military, political, and \neconomic problem. It hasn't worked for 3 years, it is not likely to \nwork, and I think we have to take a stand on that proposal.\n  One of the other consequences I think that is ensuing from this focus \non a purely military approach is we are losing out in terms of \ndiplomatic leverage in the region. Just this week, the Saudis are \nmeeting with delegates from Hamas and Fatah and the Palestinian \nAuthority because the American leadership has been so lacking. We have \nto, I think, have a diplomatic policy to complement anything we do \nwithin Iraq. We haven't done that and it does not appear to be part of \nthe President's agenda.\n  We have a situation which is grievous and which I think requires \nsomething more than simply more of the same, and that is just about \nwhat the President is offering. This is not a brand new diplomatic \ninitiative; this is not a large-scale economic push to complement \nmilitary action; this is a modest increase of forces, although I think \nthis increase is not justified, together with new tactics in Baghdad. \nBut again, I don't think that is going to be sufficient action. We have \nto start looking beyond the next several weeks and down the next \nseveral months and, indeed, the next several years.\n  The strategy that I think is inevitable is a phased redeployment of \nour forces and renewed diplomatic activity. It represents a focus on \nmissions that are more central to the defense of the United States. The \nfirst is continue to aggressively go after those international \nterrorists, the al-Qaida units. We have done that. We continue, as the \nmilitary indicates, to obtrude them very successfully. In fact, there \nare similarities of that mission to the recently conducted operations \nin Somalia where we sent in aircraft with some liaison from local \nEthiopian forces on the ground to go out and take out identified \nterrorists there. That mission should continue in Iraq and frankly in \nSomalia and many other places where we can identify and find \ninternational terrorists.\n  Second, we have a continuing obligation, I think, to strengthen the \nIraqi security forces. Ultimately it is their battle. We have made some \nprogress with the Army, but we have to make more progress. That is a \nmission we should undertake and continue.\n  Third, there is the obligation, I think, to maintain the territorial \nintegrity of Iraq, to make sure the locals do not take advantage of \nwhat is a tumultuous situation within Iraq. That, too, I think, is a \nvalid mission, and it can be performed much differently than we are \nproposing to conduct this mission in Baghdad, by redeploying forces \nwithin Iraq. In fact, it was interesting yesterday before the Armed \nServices Committee when Secretary Gates was asked, and I think it was \nby Senator Warner: Is this the last chance? If this fails, then all is \nlost? I think he quite authoritatively and thoughtfully said: No, of \ncourse, we have to have contingencies. Of course, there are other \napproaches we can take. Of course, there are other missions that can be \nassigned.\n  One of the dangers and one of the persistent aspects of the \nPresident's\n\n[[Page S1678]]\n\nrhetoric has been always summoning up the false dichotomy. Recall, back \nin October 2002, what was the choice the President proposed? Invade \nIraq or do nothing and let Saddam and the terrorists win. We recall the \nrhetoric. It seems hollow now when we think back to it. What was left \nout of the equation, of course, was what was already being done: \ninternational inspectors of the United Nations on the ground in Iraq \nlooking for weapons of mass destruction, supposedly the source of our \ngreat conflict with the Iraq regime.\n  There are other things that could have been done, too, much short of \nan invasion. There were, in fact, reports of terrorist activities. \nZarqawi was in the Kurdish region. What would have prevented the United \nStates from launching a very discrete military operation against \nZarqawi in the fall of 2002 in the Kurdish area, an area we were \nhelping to protect by our overflights of aircraft? Nothing, except, I \nbelieve, the administration didn't want to give up a good rhetorical \ndevice: this supposed terrorist presence in a part of Iraq that Saddam \ndid not control.\n  Again, here now, it is back to the false choices: Surge 20,000 troops \nor watch the country collapse as we leave precipitously next week. That \nis not the choice. The choice is missions that are more effectively \naligned with our national security interests: going after terrorists, \ntraining Iraqi security forces, protecting the territorial integrity of \nIraq, complemented with active diplomatic actions, complemented with, \nwe hope, progress by the Iraqis themselves in political decisionmaking. \nThat, I think, is the way to go.\n  We have, again, I think a very difficult situation before us. It \nrequires not only debate, but I think it requires at this moment a \ndecision by the Senate on a very simple proposal: where we stand with \nrespect to the President's proposal for escalation. Now, others have \ncome to the floor and pointed out past statements that have been made \nwith respect to increasing American forces. I have been open to these \narguments. Frankly, at this juncture I don't feel persuaded. In the \npast, when someone had asked me: Would you increase the size of forces \nin Iraq, certainly in those first few days after the invasion, and \nafter July of 2003 when I visited Iraq and found there were thousands \nof weapons dumps that were not being protected, I came back here and I \nthink, along with Senator Hagel, was one of the first to call for an \nincreased size of our Army so we could deploy more forces to Iraq. But \nthat window has closed very dramatically and nothing, frankly, was done \nby the administration to respond to those concerns.\n\n  I have said publicly that if a commander in the field came to me and \nsaid: We need additional forces, I would look at that proposal very \ncarefully. In fact, in a press conference I was asked:\n\n       So in no way would you be on board with the McCain plan to \n     surge in with, you know, 50,000 strong additional forces on \n     the ground, you would not be in favor of that?\n\n  My response:\n\n       I think I responded to the question before, that if the \n     military commanders in Iraq said we need for X number of \n     months 20 plus, 25,000 troops to do this mission and within \n     reasonable certainty was assessed, I would have to listen to \n     that proposal, sir.\n\n  Well, I have listened to that proposal and I find it wanting. I find \nit wanting, based on the doctrine of the U.S. Army as it has evolved \ntoday. I find it wanting because of the lack of complementary and \ncivilian support for that proposal. I find it wanting because of the \nlack of any serious indication that the Government of Iraq will make \nthose tough political decisions. So I have considered it as I said I \nwould, but I don't think it is the right way to proceed. Not at all.\n  Now, I am not alone, and I don't think it would be a shock to anyone \nto suggest this issue of escalation has prompted criticism from a wide \ngroup of individuals. GEN Colin L. Powell, former Secretary of State, \nsaid in December:\n\n       I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into \n     Baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this sectarian \n     violence, this civil war, will work.\n\n  Again, I think General Powell's insights and experience are very \ncritical at this moment.\n  The Joint Chiefs indicated, at least as reported in the Washington \nPost in December, using anonymous White House sources, that they were \nopposed, that White House officials are aggressively promoting the \nconcept over the unanimous disagreement of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \nThat is in December.\n  Time Magazine reported that General Abizaid said he opposes more \ntroops because it would discourage Iraqis from taking responsibility \nfor their own security. Here is a general, an officer who has served \nfor decades, the most knowledgeable individual when it comes to Middle \nEast military-political issues within the United States Army, within \nthe Department of Defense, and that is his opinion.\n  Robert Gates--before he became Secretary of Defense, or before he was \nconfirmed, according to two administration officials asking not to be \nnamed--Robert Gates expressed his skepticism about a troop surge in \nIraq on his first day on the job--excuse me; he was Secretary of \nDefense--at a Pentagon meeting overseeing the Air Force, Army, Navy, \nand Marines.\n  We are not alone. There have been some perhaps eleventh-hour \nconversions for this surge, but I think there are a number of \nindividuals with significant experience and insight, unquestioned \npatriots, who question this proposal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/07/senate-section/article/S1678-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. President, I see there are other speakers on the floor, so at \nthis time I ask unanimous consent that at 2 p.m., the period for \nmorning business be extended for 60 minutes, with the time divided and \ncontrolled as follows: 30 minutes each for Senators Menendez and \nRoberts or their designees; that the Senate then proceed to executive \nsession to consider the nomination of GEN George W.

Mr. President, last Friday I had the privilege of \nattending and speaking before a ``Farewell Dinner'' in honor of LTG \nDavid Petraeus at the Command and Staff College of the U.S. Army at \nFort Leavenworth, KS.\n  To say the least, it was quite an evening of tribute in behalf of the \ngeneral and his wife, who has become admired and beloved serving as the \nCommanding General of the Army's Intellectual Center. I estimate there \nwere around 250 officers and their wives and many from the Leavenworth \ncommunity to pay tribute to General and Mrs. Petraeus, to wish them \nwell, and to express pride and confidence in the general's immediate \nmission. He left for Iraq this past Monday, 2 days ago.\n  Throughout the evening I had the opportunity to again visit with \nDavid Petraeus, his feelings about his new mission, his impressive \nknowledge with regard to the war in Iraq, the history of the region, \nand his understanding with regard to the nature of past wars of \ninsurgency and the insurgency we face in Iraq. While at the Command and \nStaff school, he wrote the Army's new manual on counterterrorism. Let \nme say as a former marine who helped write a similar manual years ago \nfor the U.S. Marine Corps, I find this man unique in his knowledge and \nhis command ability.\n  I made a few remarks at the dinner, and being a Senator, why, the \nremarks turned into a speech with some additional strongly held beliefs \nthat I had penciled out in addition to my prepared remarks in behalf of \nGeneral and Mrs. Petraeus. I thought twice about saying some very frank \nand candid views, but as everybody knows, marines don't hold back. So \nconcluding my comments, I was glad I said what I said in that virtually \neverybody in the room--all 250--told me that I had said what they could \nnot say. Those who wear their officer rank on their shoulders or their \nenlisted stripes on their sleeves in most cases do not comment on \npolicy decisions or politics no matter how strongly they feel. They \nfollow orders and they serve their country.\n  I feel somewhat the same trepidation today. However, I believe my \nremarks to the general, his officer corps, veterans of previous wars, \nare dead on to\n\n[[Page S1679]]\n\nthe issue we face in this debate that we have been talking about here \non the floor of the Senate.\n  Before I express my views, I would stress I regret that we are at a \nstalemate in this body allegedly debating the issue of vital national \nsecurity, and I think most in the Senate wish we could do just that and \ndo it with comity, cooperation and, yes, in bipartisan fashion. The \nAmerican people, who are concerned and frustrated and angry about the \nwar, would certainly appreciate that, but that is not the case.\n\n  This issue is wrapped around a partisan and political axle procedure. \nMy friends across the aisle insist that we debate and vote on one of \nthe three nonbinding resolutions regarding the war in Iraq, and only \nthat resolution. They wanted to debate and vote on the Warner \nresolution and call it a day. The Warner resolution supports the troops \nbut not the mission. Let me repeat that: It supports the troops but not \nthe mission. That is a most unique position, to say the least, and that \nis about as far as my colleagues across the aisle wish to wade in the \nwaters of withdrawal at this particular time.\n  I also mention it might be helpful if we could consider the Feingold \nresolution. Senator Feingold's resolution actually does something and \nshould be considered in the Senate, as well. Others wish to debate and \nvote upon the McCain resolution and the Gregg resolution, but we are \nbeing denied that opportunity.\n  Now, to those in the press--of which I see none--those covering this \ndebate within the media, how on Earth can you describe this situation \nby writing headlines in 15-second news sound bites, stating Republicans \nhad voted to stifle debate on the war? Yes, let's debate and vote on \nthe Warner resolution. That is entirely proper and right. But let's \nalso debate and vote on resolutions offered by Senators McCain and \nGregg and, perhaps, Feingold. By the way, I intend to vote for McCain \nand Gregg if I get the chance. I do not share the resolution in regard \nto Senator Feingold, but I defend his honor to introduce it and to \ndebate it.\n  We are not stifling or shutting down debate. They are. Hello up \nthere. Is there any way you can discern that? I can help you. I majored \nin journalism. I used to be a newspaper editor. This is like playing \nbaseball with one strike and you are out. What happened to my other two \nstrikes? Well, sorry, back to the dugout. We are going to go to the \ncontinuing resolution. We run this ball game.\n  In any case, in my remarks last Friday at Fort Leavenworth, I said to \nGeneral Petreaus and the crowd that was assembled in his honor:\n\n       Throughout our history as a Nation there have been numerous \n     times when a Commander in Chief badly needed a Commanding \n     General with keen intellect and raw courage. However, I do \n     not think that it is a slight exaggeration to suggest the \n     last time one was this badly needed was 144 years ago, the \n     year 1853, when President Lincoln covered General Grant.\n       There are other historical allegories of tremendous \n     consequence. General Washington selected Nathaniel Green at a \n     crucial time in our Revolutionary War. Mr. Green was a \n     blacksmith's assistant. There was no understanding of rank at \n     this time. And he reputedly stuttered badly. He must have led \n     by example.\n       As most military historians know, Grant was discharged from \n     the Army for drinking. He went back home to Illinois. He \n     failed in farming. And he failed in running a mercantile \n     store. Four months into the war, he joined the Illinois \n     Volunteer Regiment, was reinstalled as an officer. Lincoln \n     chose Grant over many, many others.\n       As an aside, Sherman was a good friend of Grant and was \n     discharged for ``insanity.'' When he came back to the Army, \n     he made a famous remark about his friend: ``He was with me \n     when I was insane and I was with him when he was drunk.''\n       Then, of course, there was Ike. Selected by General \n     Marshall and agreed to by Franklin Roosevelt, he was picked \n     due to his particular talent of getting people, some with \n     tremendous egos, to come together in common cause. Eisenhower \n     was picked over 30 to 40 senior officers.\n       Then, just as now, our Nation stands at a critical \n     crossroads. Now, just as then, the freedom of many thousands \n     of people is at stake. Also at stake is the safety and \n     security of the United States of America.\n\n  Now, remember, these remarks came at a dinner for General Petreaus at \nthe U.S. Army Command and Staff College at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. \nSo I said to the general: General Petreaus, you and I have not been \npersonally acquainted over a long period of years. Yet in our \nrelatively short span of time I have come to know you well. I have had \nmany stimulating and enjoyable conversations with you over a wide range \nof issues--Lawrence of Arabia, the British experience in Iraq--so I \nknow full well you are exactly the right man for the job at the right \ntime.\n  Our brave young men and women in uniform deserve nothing but the very \nbest leadership, and they are getting it with General Petreaus.\n  I told him: You have captured America's imagination and enter this \njob with an enormous reservoir of goodwill.\n  However, it is a paradox of enormous irony that the Senate confirmed \nGeneral Petreaus without a dissenting vote--not one--a vote of \nconfidence unique given today's controversy, turmoil, and times.\n  Yet, at the same time, the same Senators who give you their vote of \nconfidence are now in the business of proposing what I call ``confetti \nresolutions,'' supporting you and the troops but not the mission you \nare about to undertake. That, to me, is unprecedented for the Senate \nand, to me, it is astounding. These resolutions are nonbinding. They \nhave no legislative impact. They are the so-called sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions--meaningless except for the message you wish to send to the \nExecutive and the folks back home or for whatever purpose you might \nhave a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. With all due respect, we have \ncrossed the Rubicon with regard to sending mixed messages to our \nallies, our troops, the American people, the media, and, yes, our \nadversaries. Don't forget our adversaries.\n  Words have consequences. Rest assured, unlike some of my colleagues, \nour adversaries will read every word and try to figure out and analyze \neach sentence of these resolutions. And I suspect they will scratch \ntheir heads and try to discern the sense and the reading of a \nresolution that states support for the troops and our new commander \nwith new rules of engagement with a limited timeframe for achieving and \nreporting benchmarks of progress but that opposes the mission. That \nmixed message should cause quite a bit of head scratching among the \nestimated 31 terrorist organizations we have planning various attacks \naround the world.\n  However, my real concern is that the Senate is not considering or \neven talking about the probable consequences of these actions, let \nalone our responsibilities should they happen. I make it clear, I don't \nquestion the intent, purpose, or patriotism of any Senator, regardless \nof the resolution, but I do question judgment and the law of unintended \neffects. Bluntly put, with all of this debate with regard to nonbinding \nresolutions, we appear like lemmings, splashing in a sea of public \nconcern, frustration, and anger over the war in Iraq. I understand \nthat.\n\n  In this regard, I should stress, I do not know of anybody in this \nSenate or the House of Representatives or anyone in America who does \nnot want our troops home at the earliest possible date, and stability \nin Iraq, if possible. That is not the issue.\n  When all of this confetti settles--and it is settling, apparently, \nbecause we are going to a continuing resolution and we will not have a \nvote on any of the resolutions--the end result of all this frenzy will \nbe: General, you and the troops have our solid support, but we don't \nsupport your mission. However, press on, and good luck.\n  What kind of message is that? This is not a profile in courage. This \nis not the Senate's finest hour. If we are going to debate and vote on \nnonbinding resolutions, let's at least consider resolutions that will \nsend a clear message or that can be of useful purpose. In that regard, \nwe should consider the McCain resolution that lists benchmarks of \nprogress, that General Petreaus has told me would be useful in his \ndiscussions with Prime Minister Maliki, certainly the Gregg resolution \nthat supports funding for our troops in harm's way. But that is the \nkiller in this debate because my colleagues across the aisle do not \nwant to vote on the Gregg resolution. Now we are not going to vote on \nany resolution. The only thing we voted on was cloture.\n  As a matter of fact, I think we should vote on a resolution, as I \nsaid before, proposed by Senator Feingold, a resolution that certainly \ndoes something. I do not agree with his resolution, but he is at least \nforthright and has the courage and sends a clear message.\n\n[[Page S1680]]\n\n  As the former chairman of the Intelligence Committee in the Senate, \nlet me stress what has not happened in the Congress or the media and \nhas received very little public discussion regarding this challenge \nthat we face in Iraq. No one is talking about the consequences of what \nwill happen if we simply withdraw. And we may just do that because I do \nnot believe this war can or should be sustained if we do not see \nprogress in the next 6 months.\n  I would also like to point out that most of the time deadlines for \nwithdrawal that have been proposed or are in the nonbinding resolutions \nmirror exactly the same time period that General Petreaus told the \nCommittee on Armed Services he would follow in reporting whether this \nnew effort is making measurable progress along the lines of the \nbenchmarks within the McCain resolution. The obvious question is, Who \ncan make a better judgment? Who can better make that judgment, General \nPetreaus, in theater, or Senators conducting theater?\n  We have not discussed the difficult policy decisions that will \nconfront us if it becomes necessary to withdraw or even how to \nwithdraw. The reality is, what will we do when certain consequences \ntake place? These are the possible, if not probable, consequences we \nshould be confronting, debating, and explaining to the American people \nand the media, even if some have a deaf ear. First, a dramatic increase \nin sectarian violence quickly escalating to a civil war, not the civil \nwar that people say exists today but a real civil war and a \nhumanitarian disaster far more devastating than what is happening now; \nShia versus Shia, Sunni versus Sunni, Shia versus Sunni. What do we do?\n  Second, given a civil war and a struggle for control, we can expect \nan incursion of Sunni troops from other Middle Eastern countries to \nprevent an Iranian takeover of Iraq and the very real possibility of an \nIraq led by Muqtada al-Sadr whose street appeal will endanger their own \ngovernments. When that happens, the war becomes regional. What do we \ndo?\n  Third, we can expect an Iraq dominated by Iran, thus completing a \nShia crescent with Iran and Iraq and Syria and Lebanon--and Lebanon is \ngoing through its own problems, to say the least. Today, countries such \nas Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt are talking about building their own \nnuclear programs, given Iran's nuclear ambitions and their \nprogress. Iran just refused inspectors from the IAEA. With the \npossibility of Shia Muslims and Sunni Muslims each working to achieve \nnuclear capability and weapons, what does Israel do? What do we do?\n\n  Fourth, Iraq will become a safe haven for terrorists. This time, it \nis for real. No, not the 2002 NIE, National Intelligence Estimate, that \nwe all agree was an egregious error. What do we do?\n  Fifth, in their eyes, with defeat of the ``Great Satan'' only months \naway--a clear signal by this body and perhaps inevitable--terrorists \naround the world are already emboldened, waiting us out and planning \nmore attacks. That is, of course, if you believe what they say. So what \ndo we do?\n  Sixth, we can expect a perceived, if not real, lack of American \nresolve in the eyes of adversaries and potential adversaries around the \nworld, resulting in additional national security threats. Read Putin \nand Belarus; Kim Jong Il, with his penchant for missile launches on the \nFourth of July; read Hugo Chavez--the Southern Hemisphere's new \nCastro--nationalizing his oil production and directly involved in five \ndifferent countries. What about American resolve? What do we do?\n  I realize in today's climate the obvious answer to ``What do we do?'' \nis simply to blame President Bush. But the point is that globally and \nover the long term, this is not a Bush issue or a Democratic or \nRepublican issue or even how you feel about Iraq or the views of the \nso-called international community.\n  Even as we argue about whether we debate and vote on one resolution \nor three--or apparently just have a vote on cloture and say that is the \nend of it--terrorist organizations and their second-generation \naffiliates--guided and inspired--are plotting attacks against the \nUnited States and throughout the world, even as I speak. It is obvious \nwe cannot really sustain the status quo in Iraq. But while we debate \nhow to proceed, they are not giving up.\n  Now, given the fact there were at least five successful attacks \nkilling Americans--and others that, thank God, were not successful--\nbefore President Bush came to office and before military action in Iraq \nand given the fact that this threat will face the next President--yes, \nthe next President--and future world leaders, surely, surely we can \nfigure out it makes no sense to fight each other when the terrorists, \nthen and now and in the future, do not kill according to party \naffiliation, nationality, race, age, or gender. If you were on one of \nthose planes the terrorists were planning to send--nine of them--over \nthe Atlantic to American cities, and they went down and exploded in an \nAmerican city or simply went down in the ocean, it would not make any \ndifference if you were Democratic, Republican, liberal, conservative, \nor anything--you would be dead. It would not make any difference.\n  We do not need a Republican approach to national security and the \nwar. We do not need a Democratic approach to national security and the \nwar. We need an American approach to our national security and the war \nand our individual freedoms.\n  This is a time to engage in honest dialog to work together and think \nthrough and agree on strategy that will defeat our enemies and make the \nAmerican people safe--look at those consequences of our actions that we \nhave not even discussed on what may happen--and, yes, bring our troops \nhome but in a way that we do not have to send them back.\n  My colleagues, I started my remarks by saying the majority of these \ncomments came from a speech I gave at the dinner honoring GEN David \nPetraeus and his wife Holly at our Leavenworth Command and Staff \nCollege in Kansas last Friday prior to David Petraeus leaving for Iraq \nthis Monday. I closed those remarks by saying I was confident that \nunder his leadership, this new mission with new rules of engagement, \nour chances of success were greater because failure is not in David \nPetraeus. It never has and it never will be. So America's destiny and \nGod's blessings are riding on the shoulders of GEN David Petraeus. And \nI closed by saying I was proud to offer him my full support and to call \nhim a friend.\n  So I say to the leadership, with all due respect, and to all of my \ncolleagues, let us end this business of nonbinding resolutions and get \nthese confetti resolutions behind us. Vote on all four. Vote on all \nthree. But let's not have the headlines that Republicans are trying to \nshut down debate on Iraq. That is just not the case. We should vote in \nregard to the Warner resolution, the McCain resolution, the Gregg \nresolution, and as far as I am concerned the Feingold resolution, if we \nmust. We have all had a chance now to discuss the war. We need to vote \non the three resolutions--maybe four--and come together with bipartisan \ncommitment--a difficult and perhaps impossible task but a task that \nmust be undertaken for the sake of our national security.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 10 minutes 23 \nseconds.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I yield the 10 minutes 23 seconds to my \ncolleague and my friend, Senator Thune.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Kansas for yielding and \ncommend him on an incredibly eloquent and insightful explanation of the \nevents of the day, why what we are doing in Iraq is so important. He is \nsomeone who has 10 years of experience on the Armed Services Committee. \nHas served as chairman of the Intelligence Committee. He has a great \ndepth of knowledge when it comes to national security matters, foreign \npolicy, and particularly with respect to the current debate about the \nMiddle East. So I thank him for his great comments.\n  I just want to point out that with respect to this debate, I had \nwatched, as everyone else did, I think, yesterday what unfolded on the \nfloor. I believe what happened in the last 24 hours has demonstrated \nwhat a charade this whole Iraqi resolution process has been.\n\n[[Page S1681]]\n\n  This is serious business. This is the most serious business we will \ndeal with in the Senate. Young Americans are fighting and dying in \nIraq. I would say, having been to Iraq on three different occasions--\nmost recently about 6 weeks ago--things in Baghdad are not going well. \nThere are other parts of Iraq where we have made much better progress, \neven in some parts of western Iraq where we have gotten some buy-in \nfrom some of the local sheiks who have decided to participate in the \ndemocratic process and support the effort to provide security in that \nregion of Iraq. But the fact is, things in Baghdad are not good.\n\n  What that has prompted is a change in strategy. We have undertaken a \nnew strategy. That strategy, of course, is something where the \nDemocrats in the Senate--less Senator Lieberman--and a handful of \nRepublicans have decided to put together a resolution to oppose. That \nresolution, in my view, is an absolutely wrong way to approach what we \nare trying to accomplish in Iraq today, but it is obviously their \nprerogative to be able to do that. I think they ought to get a vote on \nit. I will not vote with them. I disagree, as I said, intensely with \nthat resolution and its message. I know many of my colleagues on the \nother side intend that message to be different than it is perceived by \nour troops and by our enemies, but I think what we have to contend with \nhere when we send a message like that is, how is that perceived by \nthose audiences that are going to be impacted by it and, namely, our \ntroops, the young men and women who wear the uniform, and, of course, \nobviously, the enemy they are trying to fight? It is the absolute wrong \nmessage to send at the very time our troops are embarking on a new \nmission.\n  This may be our last shot at success in Iraq. We have a new \ncommander, GEN David Petraeus, whom my colleague from Kansas just \nmentioned. We have new rules of engagement on the ground in Baghdad, \nand we have new conditions for the Iraqis to meet. They have to take on \nthe militias. There are military benchmarks they have to meet. There \nare economic benchmarks. They have to figure out a way to divide the \noil revenues. They have agreed to invest $10 billion in infrastructure. \nThere are political benchmarks they have to meet, holding provincial \nelections.\n  There have been resolutions offered on the floor that address those \nbenchmarks but at the same time express support for this mission. \nEveryone agrees on the consequences of failure. As, again, my colleague \nfrom Kansas so very eloquently pointed out, it would be a humanitarian \ndisaster in Iraq--possible genocide, possible full-blown civil war at a \nminimum regional instability, Shiite versus Shiite, Sunni versus \nShiite; an increase in Iranian power on the Arabian peninsula. I do not \nknow if this new strategy is going to work, but I do know this: We owe \nit to those who have sacrificed so much to achieve success in that \nmission already to make sure we give this strategy an opportunity to \nwork.\n  I mentioned yesterday that I attended a couple of National Guard \nwelcoming-home ceremonies over the weekend in my home State of South \nDakota, one of which was Charlie Battery, a unit which was deployed to \nIraq for over a year and a unit which was hit incredibly hard. They \nwere in a very dangerous area in Baghdad going about the mission of \ntrying to train the Iraqi security police in that area. Because of some \nIEDs, we lost four of those young men. And their families--as I visit \nwith them--cannot help but show the pain they are experiencing and yet \nthe incredible sense of loyalty and duty they feel to their country and \nto the missions and what we are trying to accomplish in Iraq. Two \nothers of those were soldiers, one seriously injured, another also \ninjured, both recovering from those injuries. But the point, very \nsimply, is there is a cost to what we are trying to accomplish in Iraq. \nMany of our troops have already borne that cost. The point, very \nsimply, is their sacrifice should not be in vain.\n  The troops we are sending now into this region are going whether we \nlike it or not and irrespective of what the Senate does. The Senate \nwill be sending them a vote of no confidence if we adopt a resolution \nsaying: We support you, but we do not believe you can achieve victory, \nwe do not believe you can accomplish your mission there in Iraq, we do \nnot believe you can win.\n  On the substance, that resolution is a bad idea, but, more \nimportantly, it seems to me it was designed more as a political \nstatement. That came into full view yesterday when the Republican \nleader gave the Democratic leader exactly what they had wanted, which \nwas a debate here on the floor of the Senate on two resolutions. We \ninsisted on more resolutions. As my colleague from Kansas said, we \nwanted to have a debate on the Warner resolution, on the McCain \nresolution, on the Gregg resolution, even on the Feingold resolution. \nAs I said, we could all decide how we are going to vote, but we would \nenter into that debate. And there ought to be, if there is going to be \na debate in the Senate, a full debate. But, frankly, the Democrats \nobjected to even debating two resolutions, the Warner resolution and \nthe alternative Gregg resolution, because that would have forced them \nto vote on funding, a vote they did not want to have.\n  The American people deserve a full debate, not a one-sided debate, \nnot a debate in which one side dictates the terms. This ought to be a \ndebate about the full range of options that are available, the full \nviews of the Members of this body who represent their constituencies \nacross this country.\n  I heard one of my colleagues say--last week, I think it was, on the \nDemocratic side--they wanted a full-throated debate. Well, we saw what \na hoax that was yesterday. The agenda was exposed, and the charade \nabout a full-throated debate came to a crashing halt.\n  The American people and the Members of this body deserve a debate. \nThis is the most important issue of our time. As I said earlier, young \nAmericans are fighting and dying in Iraq. But if we are going to debate \nthis issue in the Senate, let's make this debate about substance, not \nabout political statements. Let's make sure all the views in this body \nare heard.\n  We tried to do that yesterday by essentially agreeing to what the \nDemocratic leadership had asked for; that is, two resolutions, the \nWarner resolution, which I happen to disagree with and would vote \nagainst, and an alternative resolution that would address the issue of \nfunding. The Democrats objected to that. I hope that if this issue \nreemerges on the floor of the Senate that it not be a one-sided debate, \nit be a full debate, so the American people and those families who have \nsacrificed so much for this cause get the debate they deserve and an \nopportunity to have their views heard on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, the question that should be before the \nSenate is: Do you support the President's escalation of the war? Don't \nconfuse it. Don't obfuscate it. Let's have a clean vote. The only \ncharade that is being played is by those who do not want to have a \nclean vote on this most fundamental question.\n  As a Senator, John F. Kennedy wrote a Pulitzer Prize-winning book \ntitled ``Profiles in Courage.'' His book told the stories of eight \nSenators from both sides of the aisle who took a stand based on \nprinciple and risked their careers to do so. Today, almost 50 years \nlater, I believe we, too, must take a stand based on principle. Today, \nI believe all of us who walk on the same floor where Senator John \nKennedy once stood should heed his words when he said:\n\n       The true democracy, living and growing and inspiring . . . \n     will not condemn those whose devotion to principles leads \n     them to unpopular courses, but will reward courage, respect \n     honor, and ultimately recognize right.\n\n  Today is an opportunity for every Member of the Senate to be a \nprofile in courage. Frankly, I am disappointed in my Senate colleagues \nwho voted against debating Senator Warner's resolution on Iraq. With \ntheir vote, all they have done is delay honest debate on a failed \nforeign policy that has been misguided since the beginning. I don't \nbelieve this Senate should turn its back on the American people and \ncast their lot with the President in his escalation of the war in Iraq. \nI believe those who support the President's ill-\n\n[[Page S1682]]\n\nadvised plan should be willing to stand behind that principle and go on \nrecord, rather than hide behind parliamentary maneuvers to avoid a \nvote.\n  Our colleagues should not be running interference for the President \non the floor of the Senate. In fact, I never supported the \nadministration's war--a war of choice, not of necessity; a war based on \nfiction, not on fact; a war fought without enough troops from the very \nbeginning and designed with no plan to win the peace. I didn't vote for \nthe war, and I certainly would not vote for an escalation of the war.\n  I was in the minority when I voted against the war in 2002. I was in \nthe minority, again, when I voted last year to transition and bring our \ntroops home over a period of time. But the majority of the American \npeople sent a clear message this last November. They said the \nPresident's plan for the Iraq war has failed. The American people \nelected the Senate and this Congress to change the course in Iraq. It \nis about time we started listening because it is clear the President \nhas not. He didn't listen to his generals. He didn't listen to the Iraq \nStudy Group. He didn't listen to anyone who disagreed with him. And he \ncertainly has not listened to the American people. That is the only \nexplanation for an Iraq plan that is simply more of the same.\n  As one of the witnesses before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nsaid:\n\n       When you're in a hole, stop digging.\n\n  The President's escalation plan will not work. Look at the news over \nthe past few days as the first wave of the new escalation troops has \narrived. At least 130 people were killed and over 300 wounded on \nSunday, in the deadliest single bomb blast since the U.S. invasion \nalmost 4 years ago. The U.S. military tells us that the four U.S. \nhelicopters that have crashed in the past 2 weeks were actually shot \ndown, with a fifth one down today. And Iraqi insurgents are using new \ntactics to shoot down our helicopters. The Brookings Institute says the \nnumber of daily attacks by insurgents and militias has gone from \napproximately 32 in November of 2003 to 185 in November of 2006, with \nIraqi civilian deaths going from 1,250 to 4,000 in that same period.\n  Michael O'Hanlon, an expert from Brookings, said that Iraq has become \n``one of the 3 or 4 most violent places on earth.'' And this escalation \nand violence has happened while U.S. troops were there and in spite of \nprevious U.S. troop surges. You only have to look to the past to see \nthat the President's escalation plan will not work. In fact, this \nescalation plan is based on false assumptions and failed ideas.\n  To quote one of the witnesses who testified before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee recently:\n\n       This plan is just stay-the-course plus 20,000 troops.\n\n  The escalation plan will not work because it depends on Prime \nMinister Maliki to do the right thing. The Associated Press reported \ntoday that the ``long-awaited security drive'' is underway. ``The \nimplementation of the prime minister's plan has already begun,'' said a \nmilitary spokesman. Yet even the architect of the escalation plan for \nthe administration, General Keane, told the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee that he doesn't know if we can count on the Prime Minister, \nand he admits that Prime Minister Maliki is an unknown quantity.\n  I don't know and certainly don't believe that we should put the lives \nof the sons and daughters of America on the line based on the hope--the \nhope--that Maliki will do the right thing. The escalation plan will not \nwork because it depends upon Iraqis, we are told by the administration, \nto take the lead. The administration keeps saying that is an Iraqi \nplan, with the Iraqis taking the lead. But the truth is, everyone \ndoubts that the Iraqi troops will actually show up.\n  Many of the troops Prime Minister Maliki promised will be Kurds. Yet \nan NPR story quotes General Dennis Chapman, who is commander of a team \nof American military advisers in Iraqi Kurdistan, saying that there \nhave already been desertions from Kurdish troops and that out of the \nbattalion of 1,600 Kurdish soldiers going to Baghdad, he only expects a \nfew hundred to report for duty.\n  Over and over again, we heard from experts testifying before the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee that there simply aren't enough \nIraqi troops who are loyal to Iraq as a nation and to Maliki as Prime \nMinister.\n  A recent New York Times article painted a frightening picture of what \na joint American-Iraqi patrol looks like. The article highlights the \nlack of troop strength and training of Iraqi forces and the confusion \nthat comes with having underprepared Iraqi troops take the lead. To \nquote from the article:\n\n        . . . As the sun rose, many of the Iraqi Army units who \n     were supposed to do the actual searches of the buildings did \n     not arrive on time, forcing the Americans to start the job on \n     their own. When the Iraqi units finally did show up, it was \n     with the air of a class outing, cheering and laughing as the \n     Americans blew locks off doors with shotguns . . .\n       Many of the Iraqi units who showed up late never seemed to \n     take the task seriously, searching haphazardly, rifling \n     through personal CD collections in the apartments.\n\n  In the article, a lieutenant colonel of the Third Stryker Brigade \nCombat Team talked about the difficulty of conducting such operations. \nHe said:\n\n       This was an Iraqi-led effort and with that come challenges \n     and risks. It can be organized chaos.\n\n  The escalation plan will not work because similar escalation plans \nhave already failed in Iraq, when the enemy simply waited us out. We \ntried a troop escalation and it didn't work, when we sent 12,000 troops \nto Baghdad last summer and death and violence on the streets of Baghdad \nactually increased. The escalation plan will not work because it has \nbenchmarks but no consequences. And benchmarks without consequences are \njust aspirations. The plan doesn't hold the Iraqis accountable. We have \nseen countless plans from this administration with benchmarks after \nbenchmarks that are never met.\n  The Iraq Study Group said, in recommendation 21, that if the Iraqi \nGovernment doesn't make progress toward milestones, ``the United States \nshould reduce its political, military, or economic support for the \nIraqi government.''\n  Yet when I asked Secretary Rice what would happen if the Iraqis \nfailed to meet the much-heralded benchmarks, she didn't list any \nconsequences. Instead she told me:\n\n       I don't think you go to Plan B. You work with Plan A.\n\n  Plan A hasn't been working. I will say it again: Benchmarks without \nconsequences are just aspirations. And they are aspirations that have \nfailed time and time again. The escalation plan, as a consequence, will \nbreak the back of our National Guard and Reserves.\n  Let me be clear: The President's escalation plan cannot be \nimplemented without using the National Guard and Reserves far beyond \nwhat they already have been used. There simply aren't enough troops. We \nhave already seen the tours of National Guard troops extended. A week \nago, I was informed that the New Jersey Army National Guard troops \ncurrently stationed in Iraq will see their tours extended by 125 days \nas result of President Bush's policy. I fully expect to see more \nextended deployments in the future.\n  The escalation is going to hurt our security at home by keeping those \nNational Guard and Reserve troops away in Iraq. Those who return home \nleave their equipment in Iraq, resulting in severe equipment shortages \nfor our National Guard at home. In fact, Larry Korb, an expert from the \nCenter for American Progress, says the units returned home so depleted \nthat the Marines have been referring to this phase as ``the \npostdeployment death spiral.'' That is why it is time to transition our \nmission and set a timeframe to get our troops out of Iraq.\n  Staying in Iraq isn't in the national interest or national security \ninterest of the United States. Our troops are caught in the middle of a \ncivil war they can't solve. Increasing troops will only put more of \nthem directly into a sectarian Iraqi fight. Keeping our troops there or \nadding more troops is trying to solve a political problem with a \nmilitary solution.\n  In one briefing, General Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nsaid: We need to get the Iraqis to love their children more than they \nhate their neighbors.\n  That is a powerful truism. The problem is, you don't get Iraqis to \nlove\n\n[[Page S1683]]\n\ntheir children more than they hate their neighbors through military \nmight. That is about reconciliation. It is about confidence building. \nIt is about power sharing. It is about revenue sharing. It is about a \nhost of other things, things that cannot be accomplished through \nmilitary might.\n  Staying would only continue to empower and embolden Iran, a country \nthat has turned out to be the biggest winner in our war with Iraq. Dr. \nPaul Pillar pointed out recently:\n\n       Among the neighbors, the largest winner has been Iran. The \n     war has not only toppled the dictator who initiated an \n     earlier war that killed hundreds of thousands of Iranians; it \n     has also crippled what had been the larger regional \n     counterweight to Iranian influence. Meanwhile, the all-\n     consuming preoccupation that the Iraq war has become for the \n     United States, along with the growing unpopularity of the war \n     among Americans, probably has made Iranian leaders less \n     fearful than they otherwise might have been about forceful \n     U.S. action, including military action, against Iran.\n\n  Our presence in Iraq only continues to serve as a battle cry for \nterrorists around the world. According to last year's National \nIntelligence Estimate on international terrorism, the war in Iraq has \nbecome ``a cause celebre'' for jihadists'' and is ``shaping a new \ngeneration of terrorist leaders and operatives.''\n  Let me be clear, because of how this war was entered into--weapons of \nmass destruction that never existed--because of how it was executed, \nthere are now no good options left for us in Iraq. But I do believe the \nfirst steps toward stabilizing Iraq is to set a date certain for troops \nto leave. It is only by setting a date certain for our troops to leave \nthat Iraqis will have to take responsibility for security in their own \ncountry and work out their political power struggles. Right now as much \nas they dislike us being there, we still bear the true burden for \ntrying to stop the violence. The Iraqis have little incentive to work \nout their turf wars over political power as long as we are in the \ncountry. Iraq's political leadership will never make the hard choices, \ncompromises, and negotiations necessary to achieve a government of \nnational unity, as long as they believe we will stay in an endless \noccupation, in which the lives of Americans will be shed and national \ntreasure will be expended.\n  It is only by setting a date certain for our troops to leave that \nIraq's neighbors will start to take responsibility for ending the chaos \ninside Iraq. Right now the violence has not reached the tipping point \nto get Iraq's neighbors involved. Ultimately, it is not in their \nnational security interest to have the conflict spill across their \nborders and to have Iraq disintegrate. But by setting a date certain to \nleave, we create a new incentive for Iraq's neighbors to help quell the \nviolence. It is only by setting a date certain for our troops to leave \nthat the international community will take a responsible role in Iraq. \nRight now the international community sees this as America's war. Once \nwe make clear we will not be there permanently, they, too, will have an \nincentive to get involved and help preserve stability in a region much \ncloser to Europe than the United States.\n  So by setting a date certain for our troops to leave, we actually \nmotivate the Iraqis, Iraq's neighbors, and the international community \nto take the necessary steps to stabilize Iraq.\n  But setting a date certain and getting our troops out of Iraq in a \nsafe and orderly way is not enough. I believe we must do more.\n  What we need now is a surge in diplomacy. That will involve much more \nthan a few trips to the region. We must actively engage with Iraq's \nneighbors in the international community.\n  But I cannot close without discussing the cost of this war in Iraq. \nSome say they want to have a talk about, or votes, not about the \nescalation but about whether there are resources for the troops. I \nthink we should have a real, honest debate that will come in the budget \nprocess about what this war is costing. Let's have a real, honest \ndebate about the administration's lack of honesty in telling the \nAmerican people what this war costs.\n  Our expenditures in Iraq will saddle our Nation's finances and our \nchildren's future. We spend over $8 billion a month in Iraq; we spend \n$2 billion a week in Iraq; we spend $280 million every day in Iraq; we \nspend $11.5 million an hour in Iraq.\n  The Congress has already appropriated $379 billion for Iraq, and \nPresident Bush is now asking for an additional $179 billion. Yet the \nSecretary of Defense announced to the Budget Committee, on which I \nserve, that he is not going to come before the committee to justify \nthis spending. To me, that is simply outrageous.\n  The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction released a new \nreport saying the Bush administration cannot account for critical \ndefense materiel, including over $36 million in weapons. Hearings in \nthe other body revealed that the administration cannot account for over \n$8 billion that was sent in cash bundles of $400,000 into a war region, \nwithout any controls. They cannot account for over $8 billion. Now the \nadministration wants the Congress to hand over another blank check.\n  Let me put our Iraq spending into perspective.\n  For what we spend in less than 2 months for operations in Iraq, we \ncould fully fund No Child Left Behind next year, ensuring that every \nschool district in the United States has the funds promised to them to \nmeet the goals of the law.\n  For what we spend in less than 2 months in Iraq, we could make up the \nshortfall in the SCHIP program to help cover children who would \notherwise be uninsured.\n  For what we spend in 4 days in Iraq, we could substantially improve \nsecurity at our Nation's ports with an additional billion dollars, \nincluding increased scanning of cargo containers.\n  For what we spend in 2\\1/2\\ months in Iraq, we could pay the $21 \nbillion cost of implementing all of the remaining 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations to secure our homeland.\n  Yet we need to look beyond the economic costs of this war at its true \ncost: 3,099 American lives, to date. That is invaluable. It is \npriceless. More will die in the days ahead if we do not change the \ncourse in Iraq. We now have more than 23,000 sons and daughters of \nAmerica who are wounded in ways that will affect their lives forever. \nWe have a real obligation to all of those who are wounded and their \nfamilies, and to the survivors of those who suffered the ultimate \nsacrifice. Yet we look at a budget that does not meet that \nresponsibility.\n  Today, we should be debating the President's escalation plan, \nparticularly since we recently learned from the CBO that the escalation \nproposed by President Bush would easily cost more than triple what the \nadministration has told us.\n  Let me be clear for those who may have not heard about the \nCongressional Budget Office report. That report says the President's \nescalation plan of 21,000 troops actually only includes combat troops \nand not all of the other troops necessary for force operations. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates this could mean an additional \n28,000 support personnel, and that the cost could go as high as $29 \nbillion. Now, to deviate from that would be to deviate from every \nstandard operating procedure the Defense Department has had to support \nthe men and women in the theater; it would be to deviate from every \nhistorical perspective. Yet that is not what they included in the \nbudget sent to the Congress.\n  I am also deeply concerned that the administration has left open the \npossibility of yet another emergency supplemental to fund this war in \nfiscal year 2008. All that means is we are putting it upon the next \ngeneration of Americans, which is how most of the costs of this war \nhave taken place--we are putting it on the backs of the next generation \nof Americans and not even being responsible for paying for it. We do \nall of this while we have the greatest tax cuts for some of the \nwealthiest people in the Nation, and at a time when the Nation is at \nwar. That has never been seen before in the Nation's history.\n  The administration has never been honest with the American people \nabout the cost of the war. It is time for that to end. This Senate must \ndemand an honest accounting before we hand this administration any more \nmoney or, even more importantly, any more troops.\n  In the end, it is in honor of those men and women who have given the \ngreatest sacrifice in the line of duty that we must change the course \nin Iraq. It is in honor of their courage we\n\n[[Page S1684]]\n\nmust ensure their comrades are not sent off to carry out a failing plan \ndesigned by their civilian leadership.\n  I ask each of my colleagues: Are you willing to look a young soldier \nin the eye and tell them you are sending them off to Iraq based upon a \nfailed policy and a recycled plan and based upon the hope that Prime \nMinister Maliki will get it right? How many more American lives will we \nlose before we realize this plan will not work? And if it were your son \nor daughter, how long would you be willing to wait? How long would you \nbe willing to listen to the counsel of patience, of delay, of only one \nmore chance, of stay the course?\n  I know I certainly am not willing to wait any longer.\n  I believe there is a difference between deference to the Commander in \nChief and blind loyalty. I cannot support blind loyalty that sends more \nof America's sons and daughters to die for a war of choice, to die for \na continuing failed policy. In my mind, that is irresponsible and I \nbelieve the very essence of the constitutional framework this country \nwas founded on requires us to act. That is what the majority leader \nwants to do. It is time for some real profiles in courage. I urge my \ncolleagues to allow us to have an up-or-down vote on the President's \nescalation, and to support the Warner-Levin resolution. I hope, beyond \nthat, at a later time, to support future binding actions to stop the \nfailed policy in Iraq.\n  I started today by reminding all of us of the words of John F. \nKennedy and the profiles in courage he detailed in this Senate. He \nsaid:\n\n       In whatever arena of life one may meet the challenge of \n     courage, whatever may be the sacrifices he faces if he \n     follows his conscience--the loss of his friends, his fortune, \n     his contentment, even the esteem of his fellow man--each man \n     [and I add each woman] must decide for himself the course he \n     will follow. The stories of past courage can define that \n     ingredient--they can teach, they can offer hope, they can \n     provide inspiration. But they cannot supply courage itself. \n     For this, each man must look into his own soul.\n\n  I ask each Member of the Senate to look into your own soul and your \nown conscience, allow us to move to the Warner-Levin resolution, allow \nus to have a vote against the escalation of troops in Iraq. The Nation \nis waiting and they are watching, and there is accountability to be \nhad.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/07/senate-section/article/S1684-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CASEY, JR., TO BE CHIEF OF STAFF, \n                           UNITED STATES ARMY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of General George \nW. Casey, Jr., to be Chief of Staff, United States Army.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support GEN George Casey's confirmation \nto be the next Chief of Staff of the United States Army. His nomination \nwas approved by the Armed Services Committee by a vote of 19 to 6.\n  Through a long and distinguished career, he has held positions of \nincreasing responsibility, culminating in that of Commanding General of \nmultinational forces in Iraq, in which capacity he served for over 2\\1/\n2\\ years.\n  Prior to that command, he was Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, which \nwas preceded by an assignment as Director of the Joint Staff, and \nbefore that as Director of Strategy, Plans, and Policy, J-5, on the \nJoint Staff.\n  General Casey is an infantryman, having commanded at all levels up to \nand including division command. As an assistant division commander, he \nserved in Bosnia, and earlier in his career he served in Cairo as a \nU.N. military observer with the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization. He \nalso served a tour of duty as a congressional liaison officer.\n  General Casey knows Iraq and the challenges the Army faces there. He \nalso knows the Pentagon and the challenges he will face there. General \nCasey has the knowledge to perform his primary responsibilities as \nChief of Staff, which is the training and equipping of soldiers and \ncaring for them and their families.\n  There is some opposition to General Casey's nomination because he is \nidentified with the administration's failed Iraq strategy, and I agree \nthat strategy has not been successful. As a matter of fact, I have \nargued as forcefully as I know how that strategy has not been \nsuccessful and that we need to change course in Iraq.\n  It is appropriate to hold military leaders responsible for their own \nfailures, but the principal failures that have led to the chaos in Iraq \nwere decisions of the civilian leaders. General Casey had to deal with \nthe consequences of a myriad of flawed policies, including having \ninsufficient forces at the outset of the operation, failing to properly \nplan for postwar stability operations, disbanding the Iraqi Army, then \ntrying to build a new army, initially using civilian contractors, and \nan overly extensive debaathification program, to name but a few.\n  All of these critical mistakes, which fueled the insurgency and civil \ndisorder, are attributed to the civilian leadership in the White House, \nin the Department of Defense, and in the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority. Compounding those mistakes was the effect of detainee abuse \nat Abu Ghraib attributed, in part, to ambiguities in what was \nconsidered permissible in the interrogation of prisoners fostered by \nthat very same civilian leadership in the administration, the White \nHouse, and the Pentagon, where the advice of uniformed military lawyers \nwas overruled. Those critical mistakes were made in the year before \nGeneral Casey took command and had severe adverse consequences which he \ninherited.\n  General Casey's focus in Iraq was on training and equipping Iraqi \nsecurity forces to bring them as quickly as possible to a level where \nthey could relieve American forces from the burden of providing the \nsecurity that Iraqis should be providing for themselves. He was not \nalone in seeing this was a priority. It was also the focus of his boss, \nthe Central Command commander, General Abizaid, and his subordinates, \nthe Corps commander, Lieutenant General Chiarelli, and the commanders \nof that training effort, Generals Petraeus and later Dempsey. General \nCasey put it this way:\n\n       The longer we in the United States forces continue to bear \n     the main burden of Iraq's security, it lengthens the time \n     that the Government of Iraq has to take the hard decisions \n     about reconciliation and dealing with the militias. And the \n     other thing is that they can continue to blame us for all of \n     Iraq's problems, which are at base their problems.\n\n  Those are wise words. General Casey recognized there is no military \nsolution to the situation in Iraq, that only a political solution \nenabled by Iraqi politicians making the essential political compromises \ncan save the Iraqis from themselves. General Casey is not alone. There \nactually seems to be an agreement among most observers that an Iraqi \npolitical settlement is a key to ending the violence in Iraq. The \ndifference of opinion exists on whether Iraqi politicians need \nbreathing space, as President Bush has said, to reach required \npolitical compromises or whether, as many of us believe, Iraqi \npoliticians need to be pressured to make those compromises and that the \naddition of 21,000 more troops doesn't make a political compromise more \nlikely, it just gets us in deeper into a civil conflict.\n  It has been said that General Casey was too optimistic about the \npossibility of troops being reduced, having predicted in the spring and \nsummer of 2006 and then subsequently predicting that reduction toward \nthe end of 2006 and into 2007 was possible. He did make those \npredictions, and I think he was clearly overly optimistic. He has made \na number of mistakes, but the key fundamental flaws were the mistakes\n\n[[Page S1685]]\n\nmade, the wrong judgments of the civilian leadership of this country, \nnot the uniformed military leaders of this country.\n\n  Was he too optimistic? Yes. Is he still too optimistic? I believe he \nis. When asked about whether he agreed with what the President finally \nsaid the other day, that we are on a road to slow failure--the \nPresident finally stepping up to acknowledging the reality in Iraq--\nGeneral Casey said he believed we are still on a road to slow success. \nThat is how optimistic he is.\n  I am not going to hold that against him. I think he is wrong in that \nexcessive optimism, but we expect our military leaders to be \nenthusiastic and positive about the missions they are assigned--the \nmissions that they are assigned--by their civilian leaders. We expect \nthem to be confident and to inspire their soldiers with the importance \nof those missions, to keep their morale high, and General Casey did \nthat.\n  He has also increased and decreased troops--both--depending on the \nmissions assigned to him by the civilian leaders.\n  As he testified, he requested additional troops on six occasions for \nspecific missions, such as to provide security for the elections or \notherwise deal with spikes of violence. However, mindful of the stress \non soldiers and their families and on the deteriorating readiness of \nthe nondeployed units in the Army and the Marine Corps, he also sought \nopportunities for reductions--both directions.\n  One of the real questions I had to face in addressing this nomination \nwas whether General Casey changed his tune when it came to this surge \nof additional troops that is being requested or being sent by the \nPresident. I pressed him on this issue at his nomination hearing before \nthe Armed Services Committee.\n  I want to read the exchange between General Casey and myself at his \nhearing within the last week.\n  I asked General Casey the following:\n\n       We asked General Abizaid back in November when he appeared \n     before this committee whether he needed more troops or \n     whether he supported more troops going to Iraq. And this is \n     just last November. And this is what he said. He said that he \n     met with every divisional commander, General Casey, the Corps \n     commander, General Dempsey. ``We all talked together. And I \n     said, in your professional opinion, if you were to bring in \n     more American troops now, does it add considerably to our \n     ability to achieve success in Iraq? And they all said no. And \n     the reason is because we want Iraqis to do more. It's easy \n     for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do this work. I believe--\n\n  This is General Abizaid speaking--\n\n     that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more, \n     from taking more responsibility for their own future.''\n\n  I continued in my questioning of General Casey:\n\n       Now, General Abizaid said that he spoke to you and that his \n     opinion reflected your opinion and all the other commanders. \n     Was that true when he said it?\n\n  General Casey:\n\n       I'm not exactly sure when in November it was, but it was.\n\n  Senator Levin:\n\n       So you've changed your view since November?\n\n  General Casey:\n\n       As I described in my opening testimony, Senator, in mid \n     November was when the reevaluation of the plan was taking \n     place. So I suspect John and I talked before that. And that \n     does reflect my general view on additional U.S. forces in \n     Iraq.\n\n  Senator Levin:\n\n       It reflects a general view, but then there was some kind of \n     a reevaluation which took place in mid November.\n\n  General Casey:\n\n       That's right, Senator. We're constantly reevaluating how \n     we're doing and what we need.\n\n  Senator Levin:\n\n       But that position that General Abizaid stated was your \n     position when you spoke to him in early November presumably \n     still remains your general view.\n\n  General Casey:\n\n       That's correct.\n\n  Senator Levin:\n\n       Well, if that's your general view, what is the change? Why \n     are you modifying your general view for this surge?\n\n  General Casey:\n\n       What has changed, Senator, are several things: One, the \n     development of a plan, a new plan that was conceived by the \n     Iraqis and worked in concert with us; so there is a plan that \n     laid out requirement for those forces. So just to say do you \n     need more forces is one thing; to say do you need more forces \n     to execute this plan is quite another. And we do need an \n     additional two brigades to implement that plan.\n\n  I think he is giving us a straightforward answer to that question. \nHis general view is, and was before the new plan was adopted, that we \ndid not need more forces in Iraq; that it took the Iraqis off the hook. \nThere was a new plan which was adopted by the administration, by the \nCommander in Chief, by the civilian leadership of this country. That \nplan requires that we not just clear neighborhoods but that we then \nremain in neighborhoods in Baghdad.\n  Do I think that is a wise plan? I do not. I am going to vote against \nthe surge. I think it gets us in deeper militarily. This is a military \nofficer who has been given a new plan and has been asked what are the \nrequirements for that new plan which has been adopted by the civilian \nleaders of this country. And when given a new plan by the Commander in \nChief, he very properly said that is going to require some additional \ntroops.\n  Again, we are going to debate the plan, the wisdom of it, I hope one \nof these days. We are going to debate the wisdom of whether this surge \nmakes sense. But given a new plan, given that decision, what General \nCasey is saying is that his general view about the lack of the wisdom \nof increasing the military presence in Iraq has to be modified when \nthere is a new requirement, a new plan which requires us to be present \nin the neighborhoods of Baghdad.\n  Once again, although I disagree with the plan, I view that as a \nsatisfactory explanation for why he now supports the additional troops. \nNot to the same extent that the President has proposed or decided upon, \nbut to the extent of two brigades. He said the additional brigades will \ngive additional flexibility. He doesn't have any problem with that, but \nhe testified that was not what his recommendation was.\n  So his emphasis on building up Iraqi security forces to relieve \nAmericans of the tasks that Iraqis should be doing for themselves is a \ncritical part of any strategy in Iraq that has a chance of success, and \nit is key to the ultimate U.S. military disengagement. The real key to \na stable and secure Iraq and a viable Iraq is a political solution that \ncan only be reached by the leaders in Iraq, the politicians. And what \nAmerican political leaders need to do, in my judgment, is to pressure \nthose politicians to make that happen.\n  That was never General Casey's responsibility. General Casey never \nhad the responsibility of doing what is critically essential \npolitically, which is to put pressure on the Iraqi politicians to reach \na political settlement. He is a military man. He is a military man who, \nby his own acknowledgment, has made a number of mistakes. Indeed, he \nlisted a number of mistakes for us that he has made and that he takes \nresponsibility for. But the fundamental mistakes which have led to the \nchaos in Iraq, which did not allow us to help to create in Iraq a \nstable and viable country, which is the goal of all of us, those \nfundamental mistakes were the mistakes made by the civilian leaders of \nthis country. To hold him accountable or responsible, and to vote \nagainst him because of the major mistakes which led to this chaos \nthrough not the uniformed leaders' mistakes but through our civilian \nleaders' mistakes, it seems to me, is inappropriate and unfair, and I \nwill vote for his confirmation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to express opposition to the \nnomination of General George Casey to be the next Chief of Staff of the \nArmy.\n  I admire General Casey's patriotism and his long service to our \ncountry. I have concluded, based on his role as commander of the \nmultinational forces in Iraq, that I cannot support his nomination.\n  Let me first make clear that General Casey has had a long and \ndistinguished career in the U.S. Army and is deserving of the utmost \nrespect and gratitude for the contributions he has made to this \nNation's defense over his long career. At his nomination hearing on \nFebruary 1, I stated my appreciation to him and his family for their \nextraordinary service and personal sacrifice, as well as the support \nthey have provided to the men and women in uniform and their families. \nI emphasized\n\n[[Page S1686]]\n\nthen, and I reiterate today, I do not in any way question General \nCasey's honor, patriotism or service to America, nor do I question his \nsincere desire to continue serving the Army.\n  At this critical moment in our history, however, with the obvious--\nobvious--lack of success in achieving our goals in Iraq, this \nnomination should bear unusual weight in our deliberations. All of the \nArmed Services, and particularly our ground forces, are undergoing \ndifficult changes to adjust to the global war on terror. The next Chief \nof Staff of the Army will be faced with enormous challenges in matters \nrelating to recruiting, training, and retention of soldiers, the \ncontinuing organizing of the Army, and requirements for the procurement \nof weapon systems. The next Chief of Staff must be able to evaluate \nongoing strategy and be able to react with sound advice when unforeseen \nchallenges are encountered. Perhaps most importantly, the next Chief of \nStaff must be unconstrained in evaluating the past while giving advice \nfor the future.\n  I have questioned in the past, and question today, a number of the \ndecisions and judgments that General Casey has made over the past 2\\1/\n2\\ years. During that time, conditions in Iraq have grown remarkably \nand progressively worse, and the situation now can best be described as \ndire and deteriorating. I regret that our window of opportunity to \nreverse momentum may be closing.\n  The bombing at the Golden Mosque in Samarra last February sparked \nsectarian violence throughout Iraq and in Baghdad, in particular. Yet \nin the face of this dramatic change in the Iraqi security environment, \nour military strategy--and I emphasize military strategy--remained \nessentially unchanged. Instead of conducting a traditional insurgency \ncampaign, our troops focused on training and equipping Iraqis, hoping, \nin vain, that they could do the job. After repeated elections and \npolitical events demonstrated that the democratic process would not, on \nits own, bring down the level of violence, our troops did not begin \nfocusing on protecting the population. Instead, the coalition and Iraqi \nforces launched Operation Together Forward in June 2006. This \noperation, aimed at securing Baghdad, failed. Yet the coalition \nlaunched Operation Together Forward II in August in a very similar \nfashion. The result, predictably, was a similar failure.\n  I am not going to go over the many times I complained about a failed \nstrategy. A number of times I asked our leaders, both civilian and \nmilitary, why they were continuing to pursue this failed strategy. I \ncontinued to give speeches denouncing this strategy and predicted we \nwould end up in the dire circumstances we are in today. It is all a \nmatter of responsibility--a matter of responsibility.\n  General Casey, more than any other individual, has been the architect \nof U.S. military strategy in Iraq over the last 2 years. During this \ntime, I fear he consistently presented unrealistically rosy, optimistic \nassessments of the situation in Iraq. For example, in December 2004, \nGeneral Casey stated at a Pentagon press conference:\n\n       My view of winning is that we are broadly on track to \n     accomplishing our objectives, with Iraqi security forces that \n     are capable of maintaining domestic order and denying Iraq as \n     a safe haven for terrorists. And I believe we are on track to \n     get there by December of 2005.\n\n  I repeat that:\n\n       I believe we are on track to get there by December of 2005.\n\n  Almost a year later, in September of 2005, General Casey repeated:\n\n       We have a strategy and a plan for success in Iraq, and we \n     are broadly on track in achieving our goals.\n\n  Last October of 2006, he stated, before the Armed Services Committee, \nI believe:\n\n       The idea that the country is aflame in sectarian violence \n     is just not right. General Casey said: I do not subscribe to \n     the civil war idea.\n\n  Mr. President, we have hearings to try to get an honest, unvarnished \nopinion of how our Armed Forces are doing, what their needs are, what \ntheir missions are, and of course because we are in a war, what is \nhappening in Iraq. We are not on the ground there. We visit frequently, \nbut we rely to a large degree, obviously, on the judgment and the \nrecommendations and the evaluations of our military leaders. This is \nthe opening statement of GEN George W. Casey before the Armed Services \nCommittee on 23 June of 2005:\n\n       Thank you, Mr. Chairman . . .\n\n  Remember, this is 23 June 2005.\n\n       . . . In the past year, the Iraqis, supported by the \n     coalition, have established an interim government, \n     neutralized the Shia insurgency, eliminated terrorist and \n     insurgent safe havens across Iraq, mobilized their security \n     forces to confront the insurgency . . .\n\n  How could he possibly give that kind of assessment? Senator Levin \nsays, well, we should have put pressure on the Iraqis. Well, maybe we \nshould have put pressure on the Iraqis, but it was pretty obvious to \neven the most uninitiated that the Iraqis weren't performing. They \nweren't performing.\n  In his nomination hearing last Thursday, I asked General Casey about \nthese and other statements he has made, both publicly and privately, \nthat seem entirely at odds with the situation as most observers find \nit. I noted, for example, that in recent days, the Secretary of \nDefense, General Pace, and Admiral Fallon, the new head of Central \nCommand, have all stated that the United States is not winning in Iraq \nand that we have had a failed strategy. These were clear-cut, realistic \nstatements. But General Casey disagreed, saying I do not agree that we \nhave a failed policy. I do not believe that the current policy has \nfailed.\n  He may be the only person in America who believes that. This is a \njudgment issue, not an honor issue. Of course, the civilian leadership \nis responsible. I believe that the former Secretary of Defense will go \ndown in history with Robert Strange McNamara. But military leaders are \nalso responsible. That is why we give them positions of responsibility \nbecause we place in their trust our most precious asset: American \nblood.\n  During his own nomination hearing on January 23, Lieutenant General \nPetraeus stated that five additional brigades were required to \nimplement the President's new military strategy and that he could not \naccomplish his mission if he didn't have these additional troops. I, \nfor one, worry that five brigades may still be insufficient to \naccomplish all we are asking our troops to do in Iraq and would prefer \nthat we are on the side of too many troops rather than too few, as has \nbeen the case in the past.\n  General Casey, however, confounding the experts, said in his hearing:\n\n       We do need an additional two brigades to implement that \n     plan.\n\n  Not five, not more than five, but just two.\n  General Casey said the additional three brigades the Department will \nsend ``merely gives General Petraeus great flexibility.''\n  Remember, we are putting this person, who still doesn't believe we \nneed five brigades, in the position to be the one who is implementing \nthe policy. Given this and other judgments, I don't see in this nominee \nan accurate assessment of the situation in Iraq or what is required to \navoid catastrophe there.\n  My colleague from Michigan says, well, it is all the civilian \ncommanders' fault. I will put plenty of blame on the civilian \ncommanders and I have for many years, but somehow to absolve the \nmilitary commander on the ground there, conducting the operations, of \nany responsibility flies in the face of everything I ever learned in my \nlifetime of involvement with the military.\n  Recently, I noticed in the paper there was a submarine with four \nsailors who were washed overboard. I believe they were later rescued. \nThe commander of the submarine was relieved. I still remember in my \nearliest youth, when the captain was asleep in the cabin and the USS \nMissouri ran aground in the mudflats someplace south of here, he was \nrelieved that day of his command.\n  We put people in positions of responsibility and hold them \nresponsible and we try to reward them as much as we can when they \nsucceed, with the approval of a grateful nation. But we also hold them \nresponsible for failure.\n  My friend from Michigan and I have a very different view of the \nresponsibilities of commanders in the field, which is why, during World \nWar II and other wars, we have relieved commanders in the field because \nthey were not accomplishing the mission and, if they didn't like the \nmission, they didn't speak up to get the mission changed, and if they \nembraced a failed mission, then they were held even more responsible.\n\n[[Page S1687]]\n\n  I would go on. I want to emphasize, again, what General Casey said in \nthe hearings the other day. Senator Levin said:\n\n        . . . even he came to the point, after all these years, of \n     not having what everybody wanted, which is success in Iraq. \n     He finally described that mistakes were made. And then he \n     said, ``Yes, one could define that, doing what we're doing, \n     as maybe a slow failure.''\n\n  In other words, Senator Levin was asking General Casey if what has \nhappened in Iraq was a ``slow failure,'' as stated by the President of \nthe United States. General Casey:\n\n       I didn't--I actually don't see it as slow failure. I \n     actually see it as slow progress.\n\n  In the last 4 weeks I believe we have had five helicopters shot down. \nCasualties have spiked to a very high level. I saw in one of the \nnewspapers this morning that over the past 3-month period they have \nbeen perhaps as high or the highest of any time in the war. And we are \nin a situation of slow progress?\n  Judgment. Judgment. Judgment. We expect people who are placed in \npositions of responsibility to exercise good judgment.\n  There is a lot I could say in response to the statement of my friend \nfrom Michigan concerning no responsibility whatsoever for the failures \nin the hands of the commander on the ground in Iraq. I mean, on its \nface it is a rather unusual interpretation of the responsibility we \ngive to our commanders on the ground. Of course the ultimate \nresponsibility rests with civilian leadership. Of course it does. That \nis how our democracy is shaped. But we don't absolve anybody in the \nchain of command, civilian or military, for the responsibility for \nfailure and it is widely believed by everyone, perhaps with the \nexception of General Casey, that the policy in Iraq is a failure and \nthat is why we are trying a new strategy in hopes that we prevail in \nvery difficult conditions. There is an old saw about those who ignore \nthe lessons of history are doomed to repeat them. During the Vietnam \nwar there was failure. General Westmoreland, then head of forces in \nVietnam, was brought back and made Chief of Staff of the Army even \nthough our policy and strategy in Vietnam had failed. Ask anyone who \nwas a young officer in those days in the United States Army or Marine \nCorps. It was a blow to their morale because they were held responsible \nfor their performance on the field of battle. We are holding our men \nand women, both officer and enlisted, responsible for their behavior on \nthe field of battle, as to whether they succeed or fail. But now, in \nthis particular instance, a failed commander is now, again, \nunfortunately, being promoted to a greater position of responsibility. \nWe are, again, repeating the lessons of history because we ignore them.\n  I intend to vote against the nomination of General Casey and I hope \nmy colleagues will as well. I say that with all due respect to the \nhonorable service of him and his family to this Nation. It has nothing \nto do with honorable service. It has everything to do with judgment and \npositions of responsibility. Just as Abraham Lincoln held generals \nresponsible for performance on the battlefield, so today we should hold \ncommanders responsible for performance on the battlefield.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a couple of quick comments on my good \nfriend's statement. First, no one suggests that the commanders be \nabsolved from any responsibility. In fact, when we asked General Casey \nwhat mistakes had been made, he listed a number of mistakes in his own \nanswers, including:\n\n       We underestimated the ability of al-Qaida, the Sunni \n     insurgents, to provoke sectarian conflict and failed to \n     preempt the attack against the Golden Mosque in Samarra; we \n     thought that as more security forces were trained and \n     equipped we would be able to gradually shift ever increasing \n     security responsibilities to them and thus reduce our forces \n     proportionately. This is occurring slower than we originally \n     projected. We were slow to anticipate the extent of the \n     radical Shia death squads.\n\n  He has acknowledged mistakes have been made. But the fundamental \nmistakes which have been made which caused us to be in the situation we \nare in were not George Casey's. Every commander makes mistakes. There \nis no commander I know of who would say he or she did not make \nmistakes. No one is absolving General Casey of the mistakes, which he \nis the first to acknowledge. The question is whether he is going to be \nheld accountable--not for his mistakes but for the fundamental mistakes \nwhich were made by the civilian leadership of this Nation. That is the \nquestion.\n  When my friend says General Casey must be the only one in America who \ndoesn't think this policy is a failure, let me give you a couple of \nother Americans who seem to think the same way. Let's start with the \nPresident of the United States, last October, when he said: ``We are \nabsolutely winning in Iraq.''\n  That is the Commander in Chief. ``We are absolutely winning in \nIraq.''\n  How about another person, the Vice President of the United States, \nwithin the last year? ``The insurgency is in its last throes.''\n  To say that General Casey is the only person in America who has made \nstatements that are overly optimistic, to put it mildly, in terms of \nwhat is going on in Iraq, when he is trying to carry out the policies \nof the administration, keep the morale of his troops, and now, after \nNovember the President now says we are on a road to slow failure, after \nthe American public told the President of the United States that we are \non a road to slow failure, now what we are saying is: OK, the President \nacknowledges we are on a road to slow failure unless we adopt his \npolicy of a surge. What General Casey is saying, honestly, when I \npressed him--he doesn't frame it that way. He believes we are on a slow \nprogress road. Are we going to say he is not qualified to be Chief of \nStaff of the United States Army, when he has been Vice Chief, he has \nbeen a Commander, he has been a three star general--because he believes \nit is slow progress instead of slow failure, when we have a Commander \nin Chief who just a few months ago said we are absolutely winning in \nIraq, absolutely winning?\n  And George Casey, now it is all piled on him. He is the only one in \nAmerica who seems to think we are winning in Iraq. Well, he doesn't \nthink we are winning in Iraq; he thinks we are slowly making progress \nin Iraq, to use his words. Do I agree with him? No. I think this policy \nhas been a failure right from the beginning. Going in was a mistake. It \nwas a mistake that was based on arrogance, it was based on a \nmisunderstanding of history, it was based on a misreading of what the \nthreat was, it was based on a lot of mistakes. Disbanding the Iraqi \nArmy? Look what it has led to. Not having a plan for the aftermath? \nLook what it has led to. These are the fundamentals. These are the \ntranscendent mistakes which have created the chaos in Iraq, and George \nCasey inherits that.\n  He makes his own mistakes at a totally different level, degree, than \nthese fundamental mistakes. Suddenly we say he is not qualified to be a \nchief of staff of the Army because he was a commander who inherited \nthat mess and made his own mistakes of a much lower degree, obviously. \nMuch too optimistic. He is a commander of troops, trying to keep morale \nup. So he is optimistic, I believe he is overly optimistic, history has \nproven he is overly optimistic. But to say we are trying to absolve him \nof mistakes when he acknowledges his own mistakes as any good commander \nwill, learning from mistakes--he listed his mistakes; it is his list--\nno one is absolving him. We are simply saying he should not be carrying \nthe load of the mistakes the civilian leadership of this country has \nmade, which has helped to create such chaos in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I repeat, in case Senator Levin didn't \nhear me, I have criticized the policies and, placed responsibilities on \nthe President, the Vice President and the former Secretary of Defense \nfor the last 3 years over a failed policy in Iraq. The difference \nSenator Levin and I seem to have is I also hold responsible the \ncommanders in the field for giving accurate information, for providing \nrecommendations that will help to win a conflict rather than \nsubscribing and continuing to this day, to this very day to support a \npolicy everyone acknowledges has failed.\n  By the way, I said today says are failed--not quotes from a month ago \nor\n\n[[Page S1688]]\n\n6 months ago or a year ago, I say to my friend from Michigan. No one \ndecried those comments, such as ``last throes'' and ``stuff happens'' \nand ``dead enders'' more than I did at the time. But I hold the entire \nchain of command responsible down to the commanders in the field.\n  He says just a few days ago:\n\n       I don't see it as slow failure. I actually see it as slow \n     progress.\n\n  The unclassified NIE we have read, the National Intelligence Estimate \non Iraq says, ``We are not making progress.'' It says, ``We are \nlosing.''\n  We are going to make the chief of staff of the Army the guy who \nthinks that ``We are making slow progress'' as opposed to the National \nIntelligence Estimate, which is agreed on by our entire intelligence \nestablishment, that we are losing. So, of course, we hold people \nresponsible. Of course we do. Do I hold our former Secretary of Defense \nresponsible? Absolutely. Absolutely. If he were up for another job, I \nwould be standing here on the floor objecting to it.\n  Do I hold others in the administration responsible? Absolutely. But \nthis is a leader who is up for an increased responsibility and he has \nfailed in his mission, and that is what it is all about. An honorable \nand decent man who has served his country, but the message throughout \nthe military now is, unfortunately, as it was with General \nWestmoreland, ``Even though you fail, you are going to be promoted.''\n  To somehow say the commander in the field is in some way not \nresponsible in any way for the ``mistakes'' I think flies in the face \nnot only of the record but the tradition we have in the United States \nof America, of placing the commanders in the field in positions of \nresponsibility and making them accountable for their performance and \nhow they carry out those responsibilities.\n  I am sure the Senator from Michigan and I will continue to disagree \nfor some period of time because we have a philosophical difference, a \nfundamental difference of opinion. If you want to blame everything on \nthe civilian leadership, who are of course responsible, who of course \nhistory will judge very harshly, that is one way of looking at it. If \nyou say that responsibility is shared down to the commanders in the \nfield, as I do, then you probably have a different view.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have no objection at all. I am just \ncurious as to about how long. I am not in any way trying to influence \nthe length of time.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Let me just say I am anticipating somewhere around 12 or \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. ALLARD. In October 2002, this body saw fit to authorize, by a \nlarge majority, the use of force against Iraq. Specifically the \nresolution authorizes the President: to use the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order \nto defend the national security of the United States against the \ncontinuing threat posed by Iraq.\n  I remind my colleagues that we did so because of two important \nreasons--the same two reasons offered by the President to the American \npublic.\n  First, Saddam Hussein was in breach of more than a dozen United \nNations Security Council resolutions. He refused to cooperate with U.N. \nweapons inspectors even after a decade of sanctions, and rejected \nproposal after proposal to verify that he did not have such weapons.\n  Second, after September 11, it was clear that America could not \nafford to allow imminent threats to our Nation go unopposed. At the \ntime, Iraq represented a dangerous crossroad between terrorism and \nweapons of mass destruction. In the context of Saddam's hostile \nintentions, it was a nexus that we could not ignore.\n  When critics attempt to cover up their support for the use of force \nagainst Iraq, they damage U.S. credibility overseas and send mixed \nmessages to our servicemembers. Even more dangerously, they encourage \nan enemy who believes America will give up when the fighting gets \ntough.\n  Of course, there is no doubt that the strategic imperatives in Iraq \nhave changed since 2002. I will readily admit that this fight is one \nthat we fully recognize. But that in no way diminishes the importance \nof our mission there now. We have a vital national interest to remain \nin Iraq and help maintain a secure and stable nation.\n  The terrorists have made it abundantly clear that Iraq is central in \ntheir war against the civilized world. They are committed to fighting \nthere and will not stop unless we defeat them. If we have to fight, it \nis preferable to fight on their own soil.\n  They have also made it clear that they will not stop with Iraq. They \nwill strike Iraq's neighbors as they did in Jordan and Lebanon. They \nwill strike Europe as they did in the Madrid bombings. And, they will \nnot hesitate to strike America again as they did on September 11.\n  And yet now, in this body, we are debating another resolution, but \none that does not hold any legal weight; a resolution that would tie \nthe hands of our soldiers in the field by limiting their options, lower \ntheir morale, and harm their efforts in Iraq. I am convinced that a \nlong-term stable Iraq is in the best interest of our national security, \nand as I have said many times before, the price of failure in Iraq is \ntoo great to walk away now.\n\n  We should not forfeit our progress in Iraq to meet arbitrary \ndeadlines whether they are in the short or in the long term. We should \nnot think about giving up when our men and women in uniform who have \nachieved so much. Such defeatism encourages the terrorists, undermines \nour efforts to persuade other nations to join us, and opens the door to \nattacks here at home. We must stand firm. We must stand strong.\n  Thus, I support the President's plan to move forward in trying to \nsecure Baghdad.\n  One of the keys to success in Iraq, I believe, is obtaining a sincere \ncommitment from the Iraqi Prime Minister to get the Iraqi government to \nplay a much stronger role in the destiny of Iraq.\n  President Bush is confident that we now have that commitment and I \nthink that this will have a major impact on our new efforts to bring \nstability to Baghdad.\n  I am supportive of this new strategy because it contains a much \nstronger commitment from Iraqis, in terms of their share of force \nstrength and their financial share of the costs of the war, and \nincludes new thresholds for the Iraqis to meet. To date, the Iraqis \nhave become too reliant on U.S. troops and U.S. dollars. This plan \nshows a new commitment from the Iraqis to step up to the plate and \nfight for their country's future.\n  I am optimistic that the President's shift in direction was needed, \nand may have already resulted in two positive results:\n  No. 1, Iraq's prime minister dropped his protection of an anti-\nAmerican cleric's Shiite militia after U.S. intelligence convinced him \nthe group was infiltrated by death squads; and\n  No. 2, recently, U.S. forces arrested the top aide to radical cleric \nal-Sadr in a raid. I think this signals that the important change in \nour strategy shows hope for success and that Iraq is ready to come \nforward with a renewed commitment to solving its problems.\n  Mr. President, I enter in the Record the following newspaper articles \ndescribing these accounts.\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 20, 2007]\n\n   Key Aide to Sadr Arrested in Baghdad--Iraqi-Led Operation Part of \n                              Broader Push\n\n                          (By Ernesto Londono)\n\n       U.S.-backed Iraqi forces arrested a top aide to anti-\n     American Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr in eastern Baghdad on \n     Friday, amid growing signs of stepped-up efforts to quell \n     Sadr and his supporters.\n       U.S. military officials said in November that Sadr's Mahdi \n     Army militia represents the greatest threat to Iraq's \n     security. U.S. and Iraqi forces are preparing a renewed \n     effort to pacify Baghdad, including the deployment of \n     additional U.S. troops.\n       Abdul Hadi al-Daraji, Sadr's media director in Baghdad, was \n     arrested at his house in the neighborhood of Baladiyat, near \n     the Mahdi Army stronghold of Sadr City, shortly after \n     midnight, said Sadr spokesman Abdul Razak al-Nadawi.\n       The spokesman said a guard was killed during the operation. \n     At least two other aides were taken into custody, according \n     to a statement released by the U.S. military.\n       The statement did not identify Daraji by name, but said the \n     main suspect was involved in the assassination of numerous\n\n[[Page S1689]]\n\n     members of Iraq's security forces and is ``affiliated with \n     illegal armed group cells targeting Iraqi civilians for \n     sectarian attacks.'' The military said the arrest was the \n     result of an ``Iraqi-led'' operation.\n       Nadawi said ``the occupation forces are provoking Sadr . . \n     . by these daily operations or every-other-day operations.'' \n     The spokesman added that the cleric's followers ``are the \n     only ones demanding and putting a timetable for the \n     occupation withdrawal.''\n       Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who has been \n     pressured by the Bush administration to bring the Mahdi Army \n     and other Shiite militias under control, was not forewarned \n     about the arrest, said Ali Dabbagh, a spokesman for Maliki. \n     Dabbagh said the prime minister was not notified about every \n     impending high-profile arrest.\n       ``No one is untouchable for the security forces,'' Dabbagh \n     said. ``At the same time, no one was interested to go into a \n     fight with the Sadr movement.'' Sadr, whose supporters hold \n     30 seats in parliament, is a key supporter of Maliki, who is \n     a Shiite, but the cleric is also widely seen as an instigator \n     of the country's sectarian violence.\n       Neither Dabbagh nor the U.S. military said whether Daraji \n     had been charged with a crime. ``Definitely, if he's not \n     charged, he will be released in a respectful way,'' Dabbagh \n     said.\n       Sadr said in an interview with an Italian newspaper \n     published Friday that a crackdown had begun and that 400 of \n     his men had been arrested, according to the Associated Press.\n       Maliki told reporters this week that 430 Mahdi Army members \n     had been arrested in recent days, but Nadawi said Thursday \n     that the arrests stretched back to August 2004.\n       In the interview, Sadr said his militiamen would not fight \n     back during the Muslim holy month of Muharram, which started \n     Friday for Sunnis and begins Saturday for Shiites, saying it \n     was against the faith to kill at that time.\n       ``Let them kill us. For a true believer there is no better \n     moment than this to die: Heaven is ensured,'' he was quoted \n     as saying. ``After Muharram, we'll see.''\n       Also on Friday, the U.S. military reported the death of an \n     American soldier killed Thursday by an improvised explosive \n     device.\n       The soldier, who was not identified pending notification of \n     relatives, was traveling in a convoy conducting an escort \n     mission in a neighborhood in northwest Baghdad when the blast \n     occurred. Three other soldiers were injured.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Jan. 18, 2007]\n\n          Maliki Pledges To Treat Militants With an Iron Fist\n\n                            (By Louise Roug)\n\n       Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki promised Wednesday to \n     crack down on Shiite Muslim militias and Sunni Arab \n     insurgents, warning that no one--not even political ally \n     Muqtada Sadr--would be above the law.\n       ``We will not allow any politicians to interfere with this \n     Baghdad security plan . . . whether they are Sunnis or \n     Shiites, Arabs or Kurds, militias or parties, insurgents or \n     terrorists,'' Maliki said in a rare interview.\n       The prime minister's comments appeared to align his \n     government's security plan with the Bush administration's \n     call to confront Shiite militias. But in other remarks, \n     Maliki underscored his differences with the U.S., suggesting \n     that American miscalculations had worsened the bloodshed in \n     Iraq, and warning that his patience for political negotiation \n     with warring factions was wearing thin.\n       ``When military operations start in Baghdad, all other \n     tracks will stop,'' Maliki said. ``We gave the political side \n     a great chance, and we have now to use the authority of the \n     state to impose the law and tackle or confront people who \n     break it.''\n       U.S. officials have said that renewed military operations \n     should go hand in hand with efforts at political \n     reconciliation between warring Shiites and Sunnis.\n       Maliki said if Iraqi security forces were given sufficient \n     training and equipment, they could stabilize the country \n     enough to allow the withdrawal of U.S. troops starting in \n     three to six months--a period in which President Bush's \n     proposed troop buildup would still be underway.\n       He said if better U.S. training and supplies had come \n     earlier, lives could have been saved.\n       ``I think that within three to six months our need for the \n     American troops will dramatically go down,'' Maliki said. \n     ``That's on the condition that there are real strong efforts \n     to support our military forces.''\n       The U.S.-Iraq security plan involves sending 21,500 more \n     American troops to Iraq and 8,000 to 10,000 Iraqi forces to \n     Baghdad in an effort to quell the civil war between Sunnis \n     and Shiites that on average kills more than 100 people a day.\n       Maliki said Iraqi security forces this week had detained \n     400 Shiite militiamen affiliated with Sadr, a radical Shiite \n     cleric whose followers constitute part of Maliki's political \n     base. He offered no further details.\n\n\n                        Return to political form\n\n       The interview, which took place in a pavilion inside the \n     heavily fortified Green Zone, was a return to the \n     freewheeling style that characterized Maliki's political \n     manner before he became prime minister last year.\n       When asked whether the Bush administration needed him now \n     more than he needed the administration, Maliki laughed \n     uproariously, calling it an ``evil question.''\n       Throughout, Maliki appeared confident and seemed to relish \n     the chance to respond to statements by Bush and U.S. \n     officials, including allegations that his government had \n     botched the hanging of deposed leader Saddam Hussein and had \n     not done enough to stop the sectarian violence.\n       Commenting on a recent statement by Secretary of State \n     Condoleezza Rice, he said, ``Rice is expressing her own point \n     of view if she thinks that the [Iraqi] government is on \n     borrowed time,'' humorously suggesting that it might be the \n     Bush administration that is on borrowed time.\n       ``I understand and realize that inside the American \n     administration there is some kind of a crisis situation, \n     especially after the results of the last election,'' he said.\n       Maliki said suggestions by Bush officials that the U.S. did \n     not fully support his government played into the hands of \n     insurgents.\n       ``I believe such statements give a morale boost to the \n     terrorists and push them toward making an extra effort, \n     making them believe they have defeated the American \n     administration,'' Maliki said. ``But I can tell you, they \n     haven't defeated the Iraqi government.''\n\n\n                           Concern all around\n\n       The widening split between the U.S. and Iraqi governments \n     comes at an inopportune time.\n       Maliki has promised to carry out a security plan to halt \n     the civil war, but his government has been riddled with \n     sectarian fighting and corruption.\n       The Bush administration is under fire in the U.S. over the \n     Iraq security plan. The strategy to send more American troops \n     is being resisted by many Democrats, who control the House \n     and the Senate.\n       In Washington on Wednesday, a group of senators introduced \n     a nonbinding resolution opposing the troop buildup.\n       In the Middle East, there is great concern that Iraq's \n     civil war could spill over into neighboring countries.\n       When Rice visited Kuwait this week, officials told her that \n     the U.S. needed to start talks with Syria and Iran in order \n     to ease the violence in Iraq. But the White House has \n     resisted the suggestion, also put forward by the bipartisan \n     Iraq Study Group.\n       U.S. rhetoric directed at Iran has become more aggressive \n     even as Iraq is working to strengthen its ties with its \n     eastern neighbor and largest trade partner.\n       When American forces detained five Iranians in northern \n     Iraq last week, some Iraqi officials were angered by what \n     they saw as U.S. interference in their foreign affairs.\n       In the interview, Maliki asserted his government's \n     independence from U.S. interests in the region. But he \n     underscored that the U.S. and Iraqi governments shared basic \n     goals for his country: stability and prosperity.\n       ``The success that can be achieved in Iraq will be a \n     success for President Bush and the United States, and vice \n     versa,'' Maliki said. ``A failure here would be a failure for \n     President Bush and the United States.''\n       He took issue with Bush's contentions during a PBS \n     interview Tuesday that Maliki's government ``has still got \n     some maturation to do,'' and that it had botched Hussein's \n     execution by allowing Shiite guards to taunt the former \n     leader and videotape his hanging.\n       Maliki said that Hussein and his codefendants were given a \n     fair trial, and that it was his government's constitutional \n     prerogative to carry out the death penalty. He said Hussein \n     was shown greater respect than the former president gave to \n     his rivals.\n       Maliki appeared to bristle at Bush's criticism, but he \n     acknowledged that ``mistakes had happened.'' He said he had \n     personally given orders to his deputies to treat Hussein with \n     respect before and after he was hanged.\n       He said the pressure Bush was feeling might have prompted \n     the critical remarks.\n       ``Maybe this has led to President Bush saying that he's \n     sorry, or he's not happy, ahout the way the execution \n     happened.''\n\n  Significant developments like these are exactly the type of results \nthe President is working toward. Iraqi officials must do more to defend \ntheir country and President Bush is making that clear. In turn, we must \nremain steadfast in our resolve to show the Iraqis that we will honor \nthis renewed commitment by allowing the plan to proceed without trying \nto weaken it before it has a chance to work.\n  Our new Commander in Iraq, General David H. Petraeus, has testified \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee that he would not be able to \nget his job done without an increase in troops.\n  Think about that Mr. President. Just two weeks ago, the Senate \nunanimously approved General Petraeus to head our efforts in Iraq, but \nsome in this body would now restrict his efforts by scuttling the new \nstrategy before the General has been given opportunity to perform.\n  Why would we support him and recognize his stellar career with a \nunanimous nomination vote, but say we would rather not give him the \ntroops to get the job done we have sent him over there for?\n  General Petraeus also testified that the adoption of a Congressional \nresolution of disapproval of our efforts in\n\n[[Page S1690]]\n\nIraq would not have a beneficial effect on our troops. I've felt all \nalong that the field commanders should be given the opportunity to try \nthe new plan of action.\n  Mr. President, I enter in the Record the following media report \nregarding General Petraeus' Senate confirmation hearing.\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 24, 2007]\n\n          General Says New Strategy in Iraq Can Work Over Time\n\n                         (By Michael R. Gordon)\n\n       Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus, President Bush's new choice as \n     the top commander in Iraq, told senators on Tuesday that the \n     new military strategy to secure Baghdad can work, and that he \n     had asked that the additional troops the administration \n     promised be deployed as quickly as possible.\n       In his first public comments about Mr. Bush's plan to send \n     some 21,500 troops, the general described the situation in \n     Iraq as ``dire'' but not hopeless. He asserted that the \n     ``persistent presence'' of American and Iraqi forces in \n     strife-ridden Baghdad neighborhoods was a necessary step, but \n     also cautioned that the mission would not succeed if the \n     Iraqi government did not carry out its program of political \n     reconciliation.\n       ``The way ahead will be neither quick nor easy, and \n     undoubtedly there will be tough days,'' he told the Senate \n     Armed Services Committee. ``We face a determined, adaptable, \n     barbaric enemy. He will try to wait us out. In fact any such \n     endeavor is a test of wills, and there are no guarantees.''\n       But much of the hearing focused not on details of the \n     strategy about to unfold in Iraq, but rather on the political \n     debate within the Senate over resolutions that would signal \n     disapproval of the new strategy.\n       When Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who has \n     long favored sending more troops to Iraq, asked if approval \n     of a Senate resolution assailing Mr. Bush's new strategy \n     could hurt the morale of American troops, the general \n     replied, ``It would not be a beneficial effect, sir.''\n       Asked by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who \n     also backs the plan, if a resolution would also ``give the \n     enemy some encouragement'' by suggesting that the American \n     people are divided, General Petraeus replied, ``That's \n     correct, sir.''\n       That answer sparked admonishments by critics of Mr. Bush's \n     strategy, who insisted that the point of the Senate \n     resolutions is to put pressure on the government of Prime \n     Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq to follow through on \n     its political program and take more responsibility for its \n     own security.\n       ``We know this policy is going forward,'' said Senator \n     Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York. ``We know the \n     troops are moving. We know that we're not likely to stop this \n     escalation. But we are going to do everything we can to send \n     a message to our government and the Iraqi government that \n     they had better change, because the enemy we are confronting \n     is adaptable.''\n       Senator John W. Warner, the Virginia Republican who is \n     promoting a resolution opposing Mr. Bush's troop \n     reinforcement plan, cautioned General Petraeus to be sure \n     that ``this colloquy has not entrapped you into some \n     responses that you might later regret.''\n       By the end of the hearing, General Petraeus sought to \n     extricate himself from the political tussle by insisting that \n     as a military man he did not want to take a position on the \n     Senate debate. ``There are a number of resolutions out \n     there,'' he said.\n       ``Learning that minefields are best avoided and gone around \n     rather than walked through on some occasions, I'd like to \n     leave that one there.''\n       Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the Democratic chairman of \n     the panel, said later that he was satisfied that the general \n     had not intended to involve himself in the debate. The \n     exchanges at the hearing did not appear to have any ill \n     effect on the prospects for the confirmation of General \n     Petraeus, and Mr. McCain said he hoped the commander would \n     ``catch the next flight'' to Iraq after winning Senate \n     confirmation.\n       When their questions focused on the military plan, senators \n     elicited several new details. General Petraeus said Lt. Gen. \n     Raymond T. Odierno, the day-to-day commander of American \n     troops in Iraq, advised that in order to carry out the new \n     strategy, five additional brigades were needed in Baghdad and \n     two additional battalions were needed in Anbar Province in \n     western Iraq.\n       Under the current deployment schedule, it will be May \n     before all five of the brigades are in Iraq, but General \n     Petraeus hinted that he would like them sooner, saying that \n     he had asked the Pentagon to dispatch them ``as rapidly as \n     possible.''\n       General Petraeus acknowledged that the guidelines in the \n     military's counterinsurgency manual implied that 120,000 \n     troops would be needed to secure Baghdad. But he reasoned \n     that the roughly 32,000 American troops that would be \n     deployed in the capital under the plan would be enough, \n     because the total number of American and Iraqi security \n     personnel would be about 85,000, while the use of civilian \n     contractors to guard government buildings would reduce troop \n     requirements.\n       If the troops are sent according to the current schedule, \n     General Petraeus said the United States would know by late \n     summer if the plan to clear contested neighborhoods of \n     insurgents and militias, hold them with American and Iraqi \n     security forces and win public support through reconstruction \n     was working.\n       He said he would raise the issue of suspending troop \n     reinforcements with his military superiors if the Iraqi \n     government appeared to have not lived up to its commitments. \n     But he suggested that withholding assistance from specific \n     Iraqi institutions that fall short would have a greater \n     influence. The general also said that a decision to withdraw \n     American troops within six months would lead to more \n     sectarian attacks and increased ``ethnic cleansing.''\n       General Petraeus acknowledged that he had concerns about \n     the absence of a unified command structure. Under the new \n     plan, the Iraqi Army and police units will be under direct \n     Iraqi command. The American Army units that work with them \n     will be under a parallel American command. To ensure proper \n     coordination, American officers are trying to establish joint \n     command posts.\n       Senator Levin said his committee had repeatedly asked the \n     administration to make available a list of the security and \n     political ``benchmarks'' the Iraqi had agreed to meet. He \n     warned that the committee would use its subpoena power or \n     hold up military nominations if benchmarks were not provided.\n       By insisting on that the benchmarks be provided, Mr. Levin \n     seemed to be trying to position himself to argue that the \n     ``surge'' of ``reinforcements be suspended if the Iraqis fell \n     short of meeting commitments.\n\n  There is no doubt that we face extremely difficult challenges in Iraq \nand we have not made enough progress. The citizens of Iraq must be \nwilling to fight for their own freedom. The President recognizes this \nand his new plan is the result of increased commitments from the Iraqi \nPrime Minister.\n  Again, the cost of failure in Iraq is too great as far as our future \nlong-term national security. It's in America's security interests to \nhave an Iraq that can sustain, govern and defend itself. Too much is at \nstake to simply abandon Iraq at this point; the price of failure is too \ngreat.\n  I wish we could move forward and have legitimate votes on when we \nshould leave or if we should reduce funding for the effort. But \nunfortunately we won't proceed to those votes due to a decision of the \nDemocratic leadership.\n  Let me remind the American people, it is the majority leadership \nwhich determines the schedule here in the Senate. It is the Democratic \nleadership that does not want to have a real debate on Iraq. I would \nwelcome an open and fair debate over our future involvement in Iraq and \nthe Middle East.\n  Personally, I cannot and will not support a proposal that would at \nthis time condemn the new strategy our Commander in Chief has advocated \nfor--a strategy that requires our full support in order for it to \nsucceed. I would rather have an opportunity to vote on Senator Gregg's \namendment in support of what our troops are trying to accomplish rather \nthan a resolution that does nothing but diminish morale, sow confusion \nand discord without achieving anything but short term political \npandering. If we are going to debate, let's have a real debate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the nomination of \nGeorge Casey to be Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army. I have had the \noccasion, as so many others have had, to visit Iraq on numerous \noccasions to talk to General Casey. I knew of him before his \nappointment to Iraq. I think you have to first begin assessing his \ntenure in Iraq by understanding the situation as he arrived. He arrived \nafter the CPA--the Coalition Provisional Authority--under Mr. Bremer \nhad made systematic and fundamental mistakes with respect to the \noccupation. He arrived, in fact, after our national command authority \nentered a country and attempted an occupation without a plan. That, I \nthink, can be attributed to many people but not to George Casey. \nWithout this plan, they were improvising constantly, both on the \nmilitary side and on the civilian side.\n  The chief master of improvisation was Ambassador Jerry Bremer. He and \nhis colleagues decided to disband the Iraqi Army without any \nalternative approach to retaining individuals, paying\n\n[[Page S1691]]\n\nthem, or directing them into useful services. He also embarked on a \nvery elaborate debaathification program.\n\n  In this time it became increasingly more obvious that our forces, \nbecause of the misguided and poor decisions by the President and the \nSecretary of Defense, were engaging in an occupation without sufficient \nresources. This became most obvious in Abu Ghraib, an incident that \nshocked the conscience of the world, shocked America particularly. \nAgain, this all preceded George Casey.\n  When he arrived on the ground he had a situation of chaos, both \nadministratively and also a situation in which the leadership of this \nNation--not the officers but the civilian leadership--had grossly \nmiscalculated in terms of successfully stabilizing this country.\n  Over the intervening months, General Casey established some degree of \nadministrative routine, some degree of planning. He, along with \ncolleagues such as General Petraeus, started an Iraqi training program. \nOnce again, to understand what he saw when he came in, I can recall, as \ncan many of my colleagues, going up and being briefed by Secretary \nRumsfeld and others about the 200,000 Iraqi security forces. In fact, \nthey usually pulled out a big pie chart which each week was designed to \nshow the slice of American forces as growing smaller and smaller. That \nwas a total fiction. These people could not be found. When they were \nfound, they were not trained. Again, that is what George Casey \ninherited.\n  If people are trying to lay blame and accountability on someone, \nGeorge Casey is somewhere in the middle or the end of the line. It \nbegins at the top, with the President of the United States whose \npolicies were flawed, with implementation that was incompetent. A large \npart of the burden should be shared by Secretary Rumsfeld whose \npersonality, whose temperament added further to the chaos that we saw \nin Iraq. I think we could also include Secretary Wolfowitz and other \ncivilians--Doug Feith, Steve Cambone all of them misguided and \nimpervious to the reality of the ground in Iraq.\n  Yet just a few weeks ago, as Secretary Rumsfeld left, he was lauded \nby the President of the United States and the Vice President as the \ngreatest Secretary of Defense we have ever had. That is really \naccountability.\n  This nomination is difficult in some respects because in that chaotic \nand difficult and challenging assignment, General Casey would be the \nfirst to admit that his performance was not without flaws. That is one \nof the appealing aspects of General Casey. He has a certain candor and \nhonesty that he has generated throughout his entire career.\n  Today, we are debating his nomination. I will support that \nnomination. I will support it not because he succeeded in every \nendeavor but because he gave his last ounce of effort and energy to a \nvery difficult and challenging role. He made progress, but that \nprogress today is hampered--but hampered not by his role, certainly, \nalone--but by strategic decisions that were made by the President, by \nthe Secretary of Defense, and by many others.\n  Interestingly enough, too, this nomination is not strictly the result \nof the President's work, but it is also that of Bob Gates who, I think, \nis an individual of competence and character who has already created a \nnew tone and a good tone in the Department of Defense. Secretary Gates \nthought long and hard about this, and in some respects to suggest that \nCasey is the wrong person for this job is to question the judgment of \nBob Gates. At this point, I am not quite ready to do that.\n  I will support General Casey's nomination. He has an important role \nto play in the Army, an Army that because of this administration has \nbeen severely strained. All of the nondeployed units in the United \nStates are not combat ready. There is a huge personnel turmoil caused \nby extended deployments overseas. The ability of the Army to modernize \nis sincerely compromised by operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has \nto face all these problems.\n  There is something else he has to face, too--and, again, it goes \nright back to the top. It is the selective realism of this President \nand his Cabinet and his civilian leadership. I was amazed to look at \nthe budget released yesterday, the budget that General Casey will have \nto operate with, to find out that this administration is estimating the \ncost of operations in Iraq--not in this fiscal year but the following \none, starting October 1, 2008--at a mere $50 billion. Yes, I say a mere \n$50 billion because this year we will spend about $240 billion; yet \nnext year it will remarkably be brought to $50 billion, although \nGeneral Pace told me in my questioning that they operate with the \nassumption at the Pentagon they will spend at least $84 billion.\n  Where is this $200 billion, or $34 billion, disappearing? It is \ndisappearing into the fiction that this administration is trying to \nproject, not just about Iraq but the deficit reduction, their tax cut \nplans--all of these things. And General Casey will have to work with \nthat budget.\n  And there are those in the Senate demanding we vote not to cut off \nfunds for troops. We are not going to cut off funds. But I tell you \nwhat. If the President's budget is to be believed, come October 1 of \n2008 there will be a huge reduction in funds for those troops in Iraq--\nbut, then again, do we believe the President on this or many other \nissues?\n  I will vote for General Casey. I think he should be criticized for \nshortcomings that he admits readily, but he should not be condemned \nbecause he was carrying out a strategy and a policy that was seriously \nflawed when he arrived on the ground in Iraq. He has done his best to \ndo the job he was given.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak 10 minutes \nin morning business.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, of course, I will not--did \nI understand the Senator to say 10 minutes? We don't have any shortage \nof time, so I am not trying to restrict the Senator in any way. I just \nwant to plan.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Ten minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I take a few minutes today, despite my \nhoarse voice, to discuss the fiscal year 2007 spending resolution that \nwe will be debating next week.\n  The operations of the Federal Government are currently being funded \nby a temporary spending measure that expires on February 15, and the \nproposed resolution will fund the Government for the rest of the year.\n  It is important we understand how we got to this point. Last year, we \ndid not debate and pass all of our annual spending bills before the \nNovember elections. When we came back after the election for the \nlameduck session, a few Members worked successfully to stop Congress \nfrom passing a last-minute, foot-tall omnibus spending bill--like this \none--that would have been filled with thousands of wasteful earmarks. \nAs a result, we passed an earmark-free stopgap spending measure that, \nif continued, would have saved the American taxpayer some $17 billion.\n  There were several media reports last year that said Republicans were \ntrying to push this debate into the future so Democrats would have to \nclean up this mess. That may have been true for some, but it was never \ntrue for me. My goal has always been to stop wasteful earmarks. I am \nhappy to work with Members in either party to get that done. That is \nwhy I offered to work with the Democratic leader to pass a clean \nresolution this year that would not contain any new earmarks and that \nwould keep spending at last year's levels.\n  While the Democratic leader did not work with me on this measure, I \nam pleased to say that it does not contain any new earmarks. Let me say \nthat again so that there won't be any confusion. There are no new \nearmarks in this spending resolution. I applaud the Democrats for \ncontinuing the progress we started last year.\n\n  As my colleagues can see, this resolution is only 137 pages. That can \nbe compared to where we were headed before we were able to stop the \nearmarks. It is a major improvement over the last omnibus spending bill \nwe passed that has over 1,600 pages.\n  Let me make another point clear if I could. This resolution does not \nstop the administration from enacting the hundreds and even thousands \nof earmarks\n\n[[Page S1692]]\n\nthat are not written into this bill. As my colleagues know, over 95 \npercent of all earmarks never show up in our bills but are buried in \nhidden committee reports that do not carry the force of law. This \nresolution says--the one we are considering next week--that the \nearmarks contained in fiscal year 2006, in the committee reports in \n2006, shall have no legal effect. That is a good thing, but those \nearmarks had no legal effect anyway. The administration was not bound \nby them last year and is not bound by them now.\n  Also, this resolution is completely silent with respect to the \nearmarks in fiscal year 2007 in those committee reports. I am not sure \nwhy these reports were left out of this measure, but it appears to be a \nglaring mistake.\n  The supporters of this resolution say it is earmark-free. While that \nis technically true, earmarks can still sneak in the back door. I \npraise Democrats when they call for a moratorium on earmarks, but this \nresolution does not actually achieve that goal. That is why I am \nsending a letter to the President today asking him to do his part by \nprohibiting anyone in his administration from giving preference to any \nearmark request that is not legally binding. We need to put a stop to \ncommittee report earmarks. We need to end the practice where a Member \ncalls up a Federal agency and threatens its funding if it does not fund \nthat Member's pet project.\n  Our Federal agencies need to be free to use American tax dollars in \nways that meet true national priorities rather than serving one special \ninterest or another. The President has the power to stop secret \nearmarks. He said in his State of the Union that he wants to stop them. \nI hope he will do so.\n  This spending resolution has several other flaws. For example, it \nuses budget gimmicks to hide its true cost. The proponents say it does \nnot exceed the budget, but that is less than honest. First, it cuts \nspending on national defense programs with the expectation that funds \nwill be added as emergency spending later this year. This is not the \ntime to cut defense and security spending while adding social programs. \nIt is not honest to hide spending this way. Second, the resolution also \npays for new spending by cutting funding in budget accounts that are \nalready empty. These are phony offsets, and they should not be used.\n  This resolution not only pretends to reduce spending in places where \nit does not, it also fails to reduce spending where it should. First, \nthe resolution leaves out thousands of congressional earmarks worth \nbillions of dollars. Rather than passing those savings along to \nAmerican taxpayers, it spends them on other programs. Second, this \nresolution fails to eliminate a number of programs which were proposed \nfor termination by the President and agreed to last year by the House \nand the Senate Committee on Appropriations. These programs should be \nterminated, but this resolution fails to do so.\n  There are a number of problems with this resolution. I hope we can \nfully debate this measure and offer amendments to make it stronger.\n  I understand the Democratic leader does not intend to allow \namendments, which is very unfortunate since we have plenty of time to \nconsider and debate them. The current stopgap spending measure lasts \nfor another week, and the House can easily take up our final bill and \npass it in a matter of hours. I am glad there are no new earmarks \nwritten into the text of this resolution, and I thank my colleagues for \nthat, but if we are not allowed to fix other problems in this \nresolution, I will not be able to support it.\n  As I am sure many of my colleagues remember, I came to the floor a \nfew weeks ago and had a spirited and important debate with the \nDemocratic leader on how the Senate will disclose earmarks. We worked \nthrough that issue and came to a bipartisan agreement that resulted in \nearmark disclosure rules that were unanimously approved. It was a clear \nexample of how this body can and should work together. I believe we can \ndo that again on this resolution. I hope the Democratic leader will \nreconsider his position and work with us to allow a limited number of \namendments.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I wish to address the body and my \ncolleagues about Iraq, the complex situation that exists there today, \nthe resolution we were not able to address on the floor this week. My \nhope is we will be able to address this resolution in the very near \nfuture.\n  Iraq is one of the most important and, certainly, complex subjects we \nwill ever debate on this floor. For example, there are some Members of \nthis body who want to reduce this to an either/or decision: surge into \nIraq or withdraw from it. But the issue cannot be discussed in such \noversimplified terms, I do not believe. Our decisions, whatever they \nend up being, carry consequences far beyond the number of troops who \nare deployed within Iraq's borders. Those who favor a withdrawal or a \nphased withdrawal from Iraq must wholly appreciate those consequences.\n  We have heard that withdrawal from Iraq would leave a safe haven for \nterrorists. That is almost certainly assured. We have heard that \nwithdrawal would destabilize the region. That is certainly true as \nwell. But a withdrawal is even worse than that. A cut-and-run strategy \nwould set the stage for a regionwide conflict between gulf states, Arab \ncountries, and Iran and its sphere of influence, and not just a \nregional war but a bigger one. Such a war would have enormous \nimplications for the war on terrorism and stability around the world. \nWe cannot withdraw from the Middle East and leave behind the kind of \nchaos in which al-Qaida thrives. If Arabs feel compelled to counter an \nIranian threat, the governments are likely to become more radical, not \nmore moderate. We recognized in the aftermath of September 11 that \nwinning the war on terror requires the emergence of moderate \ngovernments across the Middle East. Withdrawing from Iraq would amount \nto pushing the governments of the region toward the arms of Islamist \nradicals and undermine the core of our counterterrorism strategy since \n9/11. This is not the way to go.\n  We must acknowledge that we cannot afford to lose in Iraq because \nsuch a loss would reverse the gains we have made in the war on terror \nand extend the war on terror for years to come. On the other hand, I am \nnot convinced that a troop surge into Iraq will usher in the sort of \npeace we need to take the place of the consequences I have just \ndiscussed.\n  I have no doubt our forces are capable of winning any and every \nindividual battle in which they engage. I have been with the troops. I \nhave been with the troops within the past month. They are strong. They \nare determined. They are courageous. And they are doing a fabulous job. \nI believe strongly they are capable of defeating the al-Qaida \ninsurgency in Iraq and, as they have demonstrated recently, they are \nquite capable of defeating Iranian agents seeking to foment violence \nand instability inside of Iraq. What they cannot do, what our troops \ncannot do, is achieve a political solution between Iraq's sectarian \ngroups. That is a political problem which requires a political \nsolution. As I found out during my recent travels to Iraq, the \nsectarian violence is the overwhelming cause of Iraq's difficulties. \nAdditional troops on the streets simply will not make Sunni and Shia \ntrust each other.\n  I say this with great respect to General Petraeus, who is a friend, \nwhom we have confirmed to be the commander of the multinational forces \nin Iraq. I met with General Petraeus several times during his tenure \nwhen he was commander at Fort Leavenworth in my home State of Kansas. \nHe is a bright, articulate, and outstanding officer. I believe he is \nwell qualified to take on this extraordinarily difficult assignment. I \nvoted to confirm him because he is the right man for such a difficult \nposition, and I wish him Godspeed.\n\n[[Page S1693]]\n\n  I understand there are different constitutional roles that must be \nplayed in the debate over our strategy in Iraq. The President has the \nresponsibility as Commander in Chief to direct the Armed Forces. As \npart of that responsibility, he sent us a commander he believes will \nserve well under his overall direction, and I could not agree more.\n  The Senate has the right, if it chooses, to express its opinion of \nthe President's actions. And we do so. It is entirely possible for the \nSenate to express its disapproval of the President's strategy without \ntaking steps to undermine the commander or the troops. I have indicated \nthat I do not support the President's surge plan, but I did not attempt \nto undermine the Commander in Chief or our soldiers in the field by \nvoting against General Petraeus, who is very well qualified for \ncommand, nor will I attempt or support efforts to undermine our troops \nby withdrawing their funding. This is the essence of disagreeing at \nhome while being united overseas.\n  A Senate debate over strategy is consistent with our constitutional \nroles to voice opinion and oversee the executive branch. Denying \npromotions of qualified leaders or cutting funding to the troops in the \nfield would not only be inappropriate but irresponsible.\n  Let me now turn to those things which I endorse wholeheartedly.\n  First, I support our troops. They are brave, as I have stated, \ndedicated, and talented. They deserve not only our admiration and \ngratitude but our very best efforts to help them achieve their mission. \nAnd I support that mission. Our troops are vital to prevent the kind of \nregional instability I spoke of earlier. They are crucial to denying \nradical Islamic extremists a safe haven from which they can launch \nfurther attacks. They are essential to providing the training necessary \nfor the Iraqi security forces to take charge of their own country's \nsecurity.\n  As I have said, we cannot afford to lose this fight. Iraq is the key \nfront in the war on terrorism. We must remain in Iraq as long as it \ntakes to ensure that Iraq can fend off external threats in a tough \nneighborhood as well as take full responsibility for its own internal \nsecurity and prevent the establishment of terrorist safe havens within \nits territory. But I fully understand we cannot sustain this kind of \nlong-term commitment in Iraq that will likely be necessary unless we \nhave bipartisan support here at home. We must be united here if we are \nto achieve victory over there.\n  This principle was at the foundation of the efforts of the Baker-\nHamilton commission, which sought to bring people together on a way \nforward that could have broad support. I supported the commission's \nreport as something we could rally around together. I do not agree with \nevery part of that report. Some recommendations, such as those linking \nthe Arab-Israeli conflict with the problems in Iraq, just do not seem \nto make sense to me. Neither a peace accord between Israel and \nPalestinians nor new arrangements in the Golan Heights will convince \nIran or al-Qaida to get out of Iraq or end the sectarian violence. But \nI supported the overall report because it could have been something we \ncould use to build bipartisan support for a new strategy in Iraq.\n  If we cannot rally around that report, perhaps we can rally around a \nSenate resolution that can gain strong bipartisan support, uniting us \nhere to win over there. Many of us have been working toward this goal. \nMany of us support a resolution or resolutions that provide responsible \nopposition to the surge. We do not want to see funds withdrawn from our \ntroops, nor do we believe in withdrawing from Iraq. I hope the party \nnow in the majority in this Chamber will articulate exactly what it can \nsupport.\n  There has been a lot of discussion in the last several days about \nfunding for our troops. I am concerned that already there are plans to \nuse the supplemental and the regular appropriations process to restrict \nfunding for operations in Iraq. Our troops face the threat of real \ncasualties daily. They ought not be casualties of our debates on Iraq.\n  I have indicated my support for the Warner resolution because it \nresponsibly articulates an opposition to the surge while guaranteeing \nour troops in the field have the support they deserve from this body \nand from the American public. This is a responsible approach. I hope \nthat whatever resolution reaches the floor includes a promise of \nsupport for our troops. I will not support proposals that do not \ninclude such provisions. We need this debate, and we need to vote on \nthis.\n  I believe there is a way we can come together across the aisle. I \nthink we can be clear about our priorities. The first priority I think \nwe can agree on is getting the Iraqis to work and agree on a political \nsolution to the sectarian violence occurring between Sunnis and Shias. \nWe must encourage the Iraqis to reach a political equilibrium, \neliminating the motivation for sectarian strife. We should make sure \nIraq's borders are secure. We should chase the foreign fighters out of \nIraq and deny the terrorists safe haven. And we should limit the \ninfluence of Iran.\n  I believe we can sustain this kind of military strategy for the \nnecessary time to come, preserving our interests while we put pressure \non Iraq's various groups to reach a political settlement. For this \nreason, I have indicated support for the resolution, as I stated, put \nforward by Senator Warner. I believe it is the most constrictive \nresolution we will consider. It outlines the importance of winning in \nIraq, opposes the surge, offers reasonable political and military \ngoals, and praises the efforts of our men and women in uniform. This \nresolution moves us toward the kind of consensus needed for success.\n  Other proposals that fail to recognize the consequences of failure, \nthat advocate a precipitous withdrawal, or that provide less than full \nsupport for our men and women in uniform, polarize, move us away from \nconsensus and further from victory.\n  Madam President, the Senate needs to express itself on the subject of \nIraq. I hope we can get to a vote on a resolution that will have strong \nbipartisan support that achieves the goals I have outlined and sustains \nour commitments for as long as it takes to win in Iraq. We need to have \nan open process. We need to be able to vote on various resolutions. \nThis is the most important issue facing our country. We should have a \nfull, open debate and debate about it a long time and vote on several \nresolutions that people see as key. We need to address this, and we \nneed to do it now. We can win. We must pull together.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for up to 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, there has been much debate and \ndiscussion about President Bush's plan for a new way forward in Iraq. \nIn fact, there was much discussion between the President and his team \nof military and civilian advisers prior to his making the decision to \nchange course and outline a new strategy to help bring stability to the \ncountry and to hasten the day when our troops could come home.\n  There is no easy answer and no easy solution to the situation in Iraq \nand the Middle East. The President's decision was informed by input \nfrom many sources, including his national security advisers, civilian \nand military, members of his Cabinet, his intelligence experts, as well \nas Members of Congress, foreign leaders, and others with foreign policy \nexperience. In the end, it was the President who decided this new \nstrategy and that this new strategy had the best chance of success.\n  He acknowledged, and we all know, there is no guarantee of success. \nBut the dangers are too great to not try to create an opportunity to \nprovide an increased level of stability in Iraq. A temporary deployment \nof additional U.S. troops in Iraq to support the Iraqi security forces \nwill provide a new window of opportunity for Iraqi political and \neconomic initiatives to take hold and reduce sectarian violence.\n  The President and his military and civilian advisers reviewed last \nyear's\n\n[[Page S1694]]\n\nefforts and determined there were not enough troops to secure the \ncleared neighborhoods. They also determined that unnecessarily \nburdensome operational restrictions were placed on the military. The \nPresident and our military leaders have assured us that these mistakes \nwill not be repeated.\n  Prime Minister Maliki has assured us that more Iraqi troops will be \nengaged in the fight and that political restrictions will be removed. \nIn addition, the Prime Minister of Iraq has committed to take \nresponsibility for security for all Iraq provinces by November, to work \nto pass legislation to share oil revenues equitably among Iraqi \ncitizens, and to spend $10 billion of Iraqi reserve funds for \nreconstruction and initiatives that will create jobs. He will also work \ntoward demobilizing militias, holding provincial elections, and \nreforming debaathification laws, which should help improve the civil \nstructure so the Government can meet the needs of its people and help \npromote economic growth.\n  Last week the National Intelligence Estimate, entitled ``Prospects \nfor Iraq's Stability: A Challenging Road Ahead,'' was delivered to \nCongress. I will not speak to the 90-page classified report. But there \nwere some unclassified judgments provided to us that I can mention. \nWithin this National Intelligence Estimate, this information is \nprovided to support these conclusions:\n\n       If strengthened Iraqi security forces, more loyal to the \n     government and supported by Coalition forces, are able to \n     reduce levels of violence and establish more effective \n     security for Iraq's population, Iraqi leaders could have an \n     opportunity to begin the process of political compromise \n     necessary for longer-term stability, political progress, and \n     economic recovery.\n       Nevertheless, even if violence is diminished, given the \n     current winner-take-all attitude and sectarian animosities \n     infecting the political scene, Iraqi leaders will be hard \n     pressed to achieve sustained political reconciliation in the \n     timeframe of this Estimate.\n       Coalition capabilities, including force levels, resources, \n     and operations, remain an essential stabilizing element in \n     Iraq. If Coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly during the \n     term of this Estimate, [that is 12 to 18 months] we judge \n     that this almost certainly would lead to a significant \n     increase in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict in \n     Iraq, intensify Sunni resistance to the Iraqi government, and \n     have adverse consequences for national reconciliation.\n       If such a rapid withdrawal were to take place, we judge \n     that the ISF [Iraqi Security Forces] would be unlikely to \n     survive as a nonsectarian national institution: neighboring \n     countries--invited by Iraqi factions or unilaterally--might \n     intervene openly in the conflict; massive civilian casualties \n     and forced population displacement would be probable; AQI \n     [al-Qaida in Iraq] would attempt to use parts of the \n     country--particularly al-Anbar province--to plan increased \n     attacks in and outside of Iraq; and spiraling violence and \n     political disarray in Iraq, along with Kurdish moves to \n     control Kirkuk and strengthen autonomy, could prompt Turkey \n     to launch a military incursion.\n\n  Madam President, these statements remind me of prepared testimony \npresented by Dr. Henry Kissinger to the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee on January 31. He indicated that U.S. forces are \nindispensable and withdrawal would not only have dire consequences in \nIraq but would also have a negative impact on the region. I will quote \nfrom Dr. Kissinger's testimony at that hearing in the Senate:\n\n       The disenchantment of the American public with the burdens \n     it has borne largely alone for nearly four years has \n     generated growing demands for some type of unilateral \n     withdrawal, usually expressed as benchmarks to be put to the \n     Baghdad government that, if not fulfilled in specific \n     timeframes, would trigger American disengagement.\n       But under present conditions, withdrawal is not an option. \n     American forces are indispensable. They are in Iraq not as a \n     favor to its government or as a reward for its conduct. They \n     are there as an expression of the American national interest \n     to prevent the Iranian combination of imperialism and \n     fundamentalist ideology from dominating a region on which the \n     energy supplies of the industrial democracies depend. An \n     abrupt American departure would greatly complicate efforts to \n     stem the terrorist tide far beyond Iraq; fragile governments \n     from Lebanon to the Persian Gulf would be tempted into \n     preemptive concessions. It might drive the sectarian conflict \n     in Iraq to genocidal dimensions beyond levels that impelled \n     U.S. intervention in the Balkans. Graduated withdrawal would \n     not ease these dangers until a different strategy was in \n     place and showed progress. For now, it would be treated \n     within Iraq and in the region as the forerunner of a total \n     withdrawal, and all parties would make their dispositions \n     on that basis.\n       President Bush's decision should, therefore, not be debated \n     in terms of the ``stay the course'' strategy he has \n     repeatedly disavowed in recent days. Rather, it should be \n     seen as the first step toward a new grand strategy relating \n     power to diplomacy for the entire region, ideally on a \n     nonpartisan basis.\n       The purpose of the new strategy should be to demonstrate \n     that the United States is determined to remain relevant to \n     the outcome in the region; to adjust American military \n     deployments and numbers to emerging realities; and to provide \n     the maneuvering room for a major diplomatic effort to \n     stabilize the Middle East. Of the current security threats in \n     Iraq--the intervention of outside countries, the presence of \n     al-Qaida fighters, an extraordinarily large criminal element, \n     the sectarian conflict--the United States has a national \n     interest in defeating the first two; it must not involve \n     itself in the sectarian conflict for any extended period, \n     much less let itself be used by one side for its sectarian \n     goals.\n\n  Madam President, it is clear to me from Dr. Kissinger's comments that \nit is truly in our national interest to support the President's new \nstrategy to help provide a new opportunity for political and economic \nsolutions in Iraq and for more effective diplomatic efforts in the \nMiddle East region. Of course, we know there are no guarantees of \nsuccess. But according to the National Intelligence Estimate, the \nperspective of one of our most experienced foreign policy experts, Dr. \nKissinger, included maintaining the current course or withdrawal \nwithout additional stability in Iraq will be harmful to our national \ninterests and to the entire region.\n  Over the last few weeks, there have been a number of hearings in \nwhich the situation in Iraq and the President's new plan have been \ndebated. During the January 30, 2007, hearing before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee on his nomination to be Deputy Secretary of State, \nAmbassador John Negroponte stated:\n\n       . . . I believed, and still believe, that it is possible \n     for Iraq to make a successful transition to democracy. What I \n     would like to say is that my belief that success in Iraq \n     remains possible is based on my experience in dealing with \n     Iraq as U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. and Ambassador to Iraq, \n     and as Director of National Intelligence.\n\n  We know there are challenges in Iraq and in the region. And the \nPresident has developed a new strategy for dealing with the problem, \nwhich I applaud. This includes involving the Government in Iraq and the \nmilitary forces and the police in Iraq in a more aggressive way. \nTogether they have worked with our military and diplomatic leadership \nto come up with a new plan that, if it is not undermined by the \nCongress, has a chance of succeeding.\n  During the January 23 hearing before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee on the nomination of General David Petraeus to be Commander \nof the Multinational Forces-Iraq, General Petraeus said:\n\n       I believe this plan can succeed if, in fact, all of those \n     enablers and all the rest of the assistance is, in fact, \n     provided.\n\n  He, also, indicated this:\n\n       It will not be easy, but if we could get them to where they \n     are shouting instead of shooting, that would be a very \n     substantial improvement.\n\n  Madam President, it is obvious to me we need to do what we can to \nhelp stabilize this situation and bring our troops home. As a beginning \npoint for this strategy, for it to work, we should show a commitment by \nour country to success. I support this new initiative, and I think we \nshould give it a chance to work.\n  This does not mean we should not monitor the situation or that the \nplan should not be adjusted as new developments occur. But we need to \nmove forward in hopes of stabilizing Iraq, stabilizing the region, and \nin hopes of bringing our troops home at an early date. The President \ndeserves our support in this effort, and I intend to support him.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes as in morning business on Iraq.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this whole debate regarding what the \nSenate should do and how to send the right\n\n[[Page S1695]]\n\nmessages regarding Iraq war policy is important, but the most important \nmessage the Senate can send, to me, would be to our troops and to our \npotential enemies.\n  Everybody in America understands the war is not going well. Those who \ndon't understand it are in denial because it clearly has not been the \nsuccess we were hoping for.\n  The new strategy we are about to embark on, the Petraeus doctrine, \nfor lack of a better word, I do believe has the best chance left for us \nto succeed, and additional troops in Iraq can make a huge difference. \nWe have been able to clear in the past but never hold. We don't need \nany more combat power to clear. We have won every battle we have ever \nbeen in with the insurgents. But we have been unable to hold the \nterritory. Mr. President, 17,500 more troops in Baghdad would allow us \nto hold territory for the purpose of political reconciliation.\n  The ultimate question for the body is how to bring out the best in \nthe Iraqi political leadership. Some say we need to send a strong \nmessage that we are going to leave at a date certain, threaten to cut \noff funding for the Iraqi military, quit providing security to \npolitical leaders in Iraq.\n  My answer is that democracy is hard without being shot at. The reason \nwe don't solve immigration, Social Security, and other emotional \nproblems is because in our own country we get locked down by pretty \nextreme voices who have political action committees and run 527 ads.\n  The problem the Iraqi political leadership has to deal with is a \nviolent country, to the point where it is hard to get political \ncompromise. It is tough to go to Baghdad and do an oil-sharing revenue \nagreement among Sunnis, Kurds, and Shias when 100 of your constituents \nhave been shot in the head and left out in the street that day.\n  So I believe precondition to political reconciliation is better \nsecurity and the better security can only be achieved by going into \nmilitia strongholds that were previously off limits, by more combat \ncapability on the ground to hold territory cleared, and by putting the \nIraqi troops out front with a sufficient support network behind them \nand American hands to give them the capacity they are lacking today to \ndeal with the insurgency.\n  The McCain-Graham-Lieberman resolution understands a million troops \nwon't matter if the Iraqi political leadership doesn't reach political \nconsensus on oil, rule of law, and on a million other problems they \nhave. But the benchmarks in our resolution are an acknowledgment that \nit takes political compromise in Iraq to bring about stability, but we \ncannot have that political compromise with this level of violence.\n  The resolution also talks about a failed state in Iraq and the \nconsequences to this country. They are long lasting and far reaching. A \nfailed state in Iraq is partitioned, where the civil war environment \nspreads to the region, as a disaster. So if you throw in the towel on \nIraq, you don't stop the fight; you guarantee a larger fight.\n  The debate for the Senate is how many votes should we have to express \nthe differences we have in this body? If the Warner-Levin resolution--I \nrespect both authors, but I just disagree with the message it sends--if \nWarner-Levin is ever adopted by this body, the headlines throughout \nthis world will be: Senate condemns surge. Baghdad lost.\n  The resolution disapproves of sending more troops. I believe we need \nmore troops in the short term to bring about political reconciliation. \nBut it is not only me saying it. It is General Petraeus, the commander. \nI think the message from the resolution considers his efforts lost \nbefore they have had a chance to be implemented. It is a lack of \nresolve in terms of the enemy. The enemy will see this as a lack of \nresolve on our part, and no good comes from it because it doesn't stop \nthe troops.\n  Secondly, it says you can continue operations in Anbar, the Sunni \narea where al-Qaida is operating, but you can't go into Baghdad. \nBaghdad is a mess. Baghdad is a very violent place where they have \nsectarian violence occurring. The question is: Do we stop it now or let \nit grow bigger? There are 6 million people in Baghdad. The nightmare I \nworry about is an open civil war, where we have a bloodletting that \nwill bring in Sunni Arab nations to come to the aid of their Sunni \nbrothers, Iran will get involved in the south of Iraq, and nothing good \nwill come of that.\n  The reason we are having this sectarian violence is because al-Qaida \nstruck the mother lode when it bombed the Golden Mosque in Samarra, the \nthird most holy religious site in the Shia religion. That has created \nsectarian fighting that has gotten out of control.\n  For decades, Sunnis and Shias married and lived together in Baghdad \nand other places. The Shia population was terribly oppressed during the \nSaddam Hussein regime, but the Shia majority had remarkable restraint \nup until the bombing of the mosque, which was al-Qaida inspired. I \ndon't want to give in to acts of terrorism that bring out the worst in \npeople.\n  Our goal is not to get the oil from Iraq; it is not to create a \npuppet state for the United States in Iraq. It is to bring out the best \nin the Iraqi people, to allow the moderates in the region a chance to \nconquer and defeat the extremists who have no place for anybody other \nthan only their way of doing business, including us.\n  We can't kill enough of the terrorists to win, but we surely can \nempower the moderates so they have a chance of winning.\n  I am glad we did not take a vote in isolation on Warner-Levin. It \nwould have been 50-something votes, less than 60, and the headlines \nthroughout the world would read: Surge condemned. Baghdad lost. It \nwould have been embarrassing to the President. This is not about \nPresident Bush being embarrassed. It is about the message we send to \nour troops and our enemies.\n  The reason the Senate is not the House is because we have a chance \nfor the minority; we have a chance to have a healthy, full debate. We \nwere asking for two votes, not one. If you are going to vote on Warner-\nLevin, fine, I will come to the floor and take the responsibility for \nopposing it, vote against it, and argue vehemently that it undercuts \nour efforts in Iraq. But there was another vote being proposed on the \nJudd Gregg amendment that simply said we will not cut off funding, we \nwill not cap troops as a statement of this body. It would have gotten \n70 votes. And the reason we couldn't have those two votes, in my \nopinion, is because the Democratic left--and we have them on the \nright--would have ginned up and gone nuts over the idea that the \nDemocratic caucus would not cut off funding for a war that the \nDemocratic left thought should have ended last week.\n  I know what it is like. I have been through this on immigration. Once \nyour base gets mad at you, it is not pleasant, but you can't build \npolicies around bloggers.\n  So I am glad the Senate did not take a single vote that was designed \nto embarrass a single political element in the country. If we are going \nto debate Iraq on the floor of the Senate, we should be willing to take \nmore than one vote. Two votes is not too much to ask.\n  Where we go from here, I don't know. I can't promise success from \nthis new strategy, but I can promise the consequences of failure, and \nthese young men and women who will leave to go off as part of this new \nstrategy, I know every Member of the Senate wishes them well and prays \nfor their safety. But I do hope as they leave, we do not take any \naction to undercut their efforts because of 2008 politics. The war in \nIraq is much bigger than the next election.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, during the course of the afternoon, a \ngroup of Republican Senators have been meeting, including our final \nmeeting with our distinguished Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, and \nour assistant Republican leader, Senator Lott. We now have a letter \nsigned by seven Senators: myself, Senator Collins, Senator Smith, \nSenator Voinovich, Senator Snowe, Senator Hagel, and Senator Coleman. \nThe letter is addressed\n\n[[Page S1696]]\n\nto our two Republican leaders and to the distinguished majority leader, \nSenator Reid, and the assistant majority leader, Senator Durbin.\n  I would like to now read the text of the letter to place it into the \nRecord:\n\n       Dear Leaders: The war in Iraq is the most pressing issue of \n     our time. It urgently deserves the attention of the full \n     Senate and a full debate on the Senate floor without delay.\n       We respectfully advise you, our leaders, that we intend to \n     take S. Con. Res. 7 and offer it, where possible, under the \n     Standing Rules of the Senate, to bills coming before the \n     Senate.\n       On January 10, 2007, the President stated, with respect to \n     his Iraq strategy, ``if Members have improvements that can be \n     made, we will make them. If circumstances change, we will \n     adjust.'' In a conscientious, respectful way, we offered our \n     resolution consistent with the President's statement.\n       We strongly believe the Senate should be allowed to work \n     its will on our resolution as well as on the concepts brought \n     forward by other Senators. Monday's procedural vote should \n     not be interpreted as any lessening of our resolve to go \n     forward advocating the concepts of S. Con. Res. 7.\n       We will explore all of our options under the Senate \n     procedures and practices to ensure a full and open debate on \n     the Senate floor. The current stalemate is unacceptable to us \n     and to the people of this country.\n\n  Mr. President, for reference purposes, a copy of S. Con. Res. 7 is \nprinted in the Record of Monday, February 5, 2007 at page 51556.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in the debate over whether we should be \nsupporting or withdrawing our support from the President's plan to \nsurge over 20,000 more troops into Iraq, I am acutely aware of one \noverriding irony. Those who are seeking to begin the withdrawal from \nIraq are committing the same conceptual error that many of the same \ncritics have accused the administration of committing when they made \ntheir flawed plans for the invasion of Iraq. They are not thinking \nabout what will happen on the day after we begin our withdrawal.\n  Let me say that the situation in which we find ourselves today in \nIraq is certainly in part due to the administration's failure to \nanticipate many variables in the Iraqi theater, in the region, and in \nIraqi society. Those who prepared only for the military defeat of \nSaddam's forces committed such a profound error that it will be a \nlesson learned in the history books long after we are gone.\n  We did not prepare for the vehemence with which certain elements of \nthe displaced Sunni elite would fight to retain their status quo.\n  We did not anticipate how fractured and weak the oppressed Shia \nsociety of Iraq would be once the dictator was deposed, and we did not \nappreciate how unprepared the Shia would be to present true leadership.\n  And we did not anticipate, because we apparently did not plan for \nthis, that a political and leadership vacuum created by the fall of \nSaddam would invite the influence of Iran, whose interests in Iraq are \nanything but charitable.\n  The mistakes that we have read so much about--the failure to secure \nmassive ammunition dumps, the peremptory disbanding of the Iraqi army, \nthe sweeping de-Baathification policies that alienated many Sunnis not \ndirectly responsible for the Saddam's tyranny--all of these mistakes \nderive from our failure to think about what would happen in Iraq the \nday after Saddam fell. It was a much more profound mistake than not \nsending enough troops; we simply did not imagine that we would be \nfacing problems that would require more troops.\n  Thinking of what was the most fundamental criticisms of our failures \nto anticipate the terror of September 11, I am reminded of the 9/11 \nCommission's conclusion that we did not have the imagination to prepare \nfor that attack.\n  In Iraq, where our imagination failed again, a thorough understanding \nof Iraqi history and society should have helped.\n  I am not talking about rehashing the history of imperialists, who \nwould argue to justify their creation of the unnatural state of Iraq, \nor who would argue about the superiority of one sect over the other.\n  I am not talking about the history as told by anthropologists, who \nargue about ancient fights and long-simmering disputes.\n  A thorough study and understanding of Iraq would have required us--\nand the top policymakers of this administration--to understand the \ncomplexity of Iraqi society as it was in 2003. And if we had done so, \nwe would have had the imagination to prepare for the many contingencies \nthat quite naturally developed when we so boldly sought to change the \nstatus quo.\n  We know that we had next to no intelligence on Iraq--and if you have \nread the latest NIE on Iraq put out last Friday, you will be dismayed, \nas I am, to read that we have very little more intelligence today.\n  But how about open source knowledge on which we could have made more \ncareful assessments of what to expect the day after the tyrant toppled?\n  It was a tragic mistake to underestimate the role of criminality \nunderpinning Saddam's regime in its last decrepit days, a criminality \nthat was unleashed immediately after we invaded and which has added \ngreat complexity to the conflict among the many armed groups in Iraq \ntoday.\n  But we should not have underestimated the reluctance with which the \nSunnis would accept their new de-classed position in Iraq.\n  We should not have overestimated the ability of the Shia, with no \npolitical experience, to assume political power. Had we properly \nassumed the difficulties that we would have faced, we should have been \nprepared for a period of instability, during which the neighbor to the \neast, Iran, would not sit idle.\n  I say this because I cannot support the administration today without \nhonestly assessing what happened in the preparation and implementation \nof this war over 4 years ago.\n  And now, 4 years later, the Senate has determined to take up an \nincreasingly partisan debate over what to do to prevent losing the Iraq \nwar.\n  And we are now debating a variety of what I hope will be non-binding \nresolutions in response to the President's announcement to surge 21,500 \ntroops into the Iraq conflict.\n  This is an extremely somber moment in the history of this nation. We \nfind ourselves in the midst of a war that it appears some still do not \nfully understand. It is a war whose dynamics and politics are \ncompletely in flux, and with the consequences of both our actions in \nthe field--as well as in our politics right here--being profound for \nthe Iraqi people, the Middle East region and our national security.\n  Make no mistake: What we do communicate is America's political will, \nand our political will is directly related to the morale of our troops. \nThose who seek to, for rhetorical purposes only, assert their support \nof the troops while communicating their opposition to their mission \ncannot sever this natural connection between political will and morale.\n  While it is always good for the Senate to debate great matters of war \nand peace--and, indeed, there are no more important matters--the \nimbalance between partisan rhetoric and substantive direction on this \nquestion has been, to my mind, unsettling. A perilous state of war in \nIraq is not improved by the partisan level of debate here.\n  I have watched the course of this conflict with increasing concern \nand dismay.\n  As I said, I have been profoundly disappointed in realizing the \nerrors we have made in implementing this war.\n  I have been greatly dismayed in the failure of the Iraqi people to \nresist the descent into sectarian violence, and their failure to demand \nleadership from their elected leaders.\n  I have been horrified by the level of barbarism. I have not been \nsurprised, I must say, by the Sunni jihadists, whose barbarism should \nbe well known by now, but by Shia militias, who, operating under a \ngovernment dominated by the Iraqi Shia for the first time in modern \nIraq's history, seem to operate without restraint or morality by their \nauthorities in their nihilistic persecution of their real and perceived \nenemies. I can understand the sense of revenge one must feel when one \nhas been\n\n[[Page S1697]]\n\nreleased from decades of oppression; I can understand the anger and \ndespair one feels when one's family is targeted for murder; I can \nappreciate the rage when one's shrines and mosques are bombed. I will \nnever understand a revenge that takes as its victims other innocents \nand noncombatants.\n  The American people have been shocked by this level of brutality as \nwell--but we shouldn't call it mindless, because in the diabolic minds \nof the Sunni al-Qaida and ex-Baathist perpetrators, it has a reason: to \npush Iraq into chaos. In the minds of the bloody Shia militia leaders \nlike Moqtada al-Sadr, there is also a rationale: Their militias \ncomplete the cyclical logic of barbarism.\n  In this cycle is perpetuated a nihilistic violence that will so \ndestabilize Iraq that the Sunni jihadists will be able to create a \nsafehaven where they will expand their reach and refocus on their long-\nterm goals. They are succeeding, and if they succeed they will focus on \nus.\n  In this cycle is perpetuated a nihilistic violence that will so \ndestabilize Iraq that the Shia will be left so victimized and subject \nto militia rule that Iran will further assert its influence to \nundermine this fledgling nation. If post-Saddam Iraq succeeds, its \nsuccess would provide the Shia world with an alternate model to the \ncorrupt and failing regime in Tehran. If it fails, Tehran will have a \nfield in which to meddle for years.\n\n  The Iraqi Shia, so traumatized by years of oppression under Saddam, \nand traumatized--let us be perfectly honest about this--by America \nmisleading them and neglecting them in their hour of need immediately \nafter the first gulf war--have failed to stand up and present political \nfigures who can assert leadership instead of political impotence.\n  Iran is not a passive player here, no.\n  It is not in Iran's interest for the Iraqi Shia to build a strong, \nindependent, Shia Arab state.\n  It is not in Iran's interest to have the seminaries of Najaf and \nKarbala returned to their central position in the world of Shia \nscholarship, possibly eclipsing Qum. To have this occur would lessen \nthe legitimacy Iran desperately needs as ideological cover for Persian \nsupremacy. The Iraqi Shia, Arabs who were the rank-and-file cannon \nfodder in the 8-year war against Iran, are now left open to Iran's \nmeddling by their own weak government.\n  The Sunnis, Iraqi and others throughout the region, are quick to tell \nus we have fallen into a preexisting and ancient conflict between the \nArabs and the Persians, and the Iraqi Shia and their seemingly hapless \nleaders are caught in between. And that is where we find ourselves \ntoday.\n  Now the Senate is to respond to the policy advanced by the President \nbefore the Nation on January 10.\n  We are to express approval or disapproval to the President's \ninitiative in the middle of a war like this Nation has never faced. At \na moment when the situation in Iraq is critical and the outcome is \nuncertain, some believe our excercise here will provide valuable \nclarity.\n  As I have said, it is fitting that the Senate debate this war.\n  From the day we passed a resolution authorizing the use of force to \nremove Saddam Hussein the fall of 2002, it has been fitting to debate \nthis war, and we have, through many floor speeches and amendments to \nauthorizing or appropriating legislation. Whether it is fitting that we \nrespond to the President's latest change in military strategy with \nthese resolutions is another matter.\n  I have paid a great deal of attention to the hearings held before the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. I thank and commend the chairmen and ranking minority \nmembers of both committees for the many opportunities for substantive \nreview they have sought to present to us and to the American public.\n  Dozens of substantive testimonies have been submitted, and the \nquestioning has been, in many cases, direct and detailed.\n  As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I have \nalso had the opportunity to listen to the opinions of the leaders of \nthe intelligence community, and I have read the reports coming from \nIraq including, most recently, the National Intelligence Estimate \nreleased last Friday.\n  The public needs to be reminded: There are no silver bullets, no \nglowing assessments, no confident predictions.\n  Surrounding this debate, there is a level of political taunting \namongst ourselves that I find troubling.\n  From the majority leader, I hear public pronouncements of 21 \nRepublican seats to be defended in 2008--and I find it disturbing that \nanyone would question that a Senator of any party would hinge his or \nher voice on such momentous policy problems for the purpose of personal \npolitical survival.\n  Does anyone doubt that the November election in 2008 is a world away \nfrom the carnage of Iraq today?\n  Can anyone predict with certainty what the situation will be in Iraq \nalmost 2 years from now?\n  I do not like the rhetoric of ``cut and run'' any more than I like \nthe rhetoric accusing members of my party for ``heading for the tall \ngrass.''\n  Lives are in balance and we should not be throwing around glib \nrhetoric.\n  In that sense, the exclamation of a member of my party 2 weeks ago \nthat we should all be accountable on these resolutions or go be shoe \nsalesmen has a certain urgency, although I do not condescend to the \nworking man, a good many of whom are fighting in this war as we speak.\n  Nor do I believe that if I go and buy a pair of shoes from a good \nshoe salesman today that those shoes will not last longer and give \nbetter value than some of the resolutions being bandied about today, to \nbe forgotten months from now when the war will bring to us either the \nreality of some progress toward stability, more stalemate in strife or \neven greater chaos.\n  One should predict the future with caution and humility. But, I can \nmake one prediction here, particularly to those on the other side of \nthe aisle: Iraq will be a central issue before this Congress, and \nbefore the next administration, in 2009.\n  We cannot make it go away before then. There is no way that a \nwithdrawal begun now will leave a new administration free from the \npolicy problems presented by Iraq.\n  So we should liberate ourselves right now from seeking partisan \nadvantage, because as much as some may wish to walk away from Iraq, its \nrelevance to our security and standing is not going to diminish. Not \nfor a long time.\n  I will support the President's plan for this surge, and I will \nsupport any resolution that articulates such support, provided I can \nagree with all of its language. In doing so, I am acutely aware that \nthe situation we are addressing is at least in some part a function of \npolicy failures committed by this administration.\n  Admitting this, I have to say that I am unaware, through my reading \nof American military and diplomatic history, of any conflict in the \nmidst of which our leaders saw clearly the end. Rarely have outcomes \nbeen perceivable through the shifting tactics and circumstances that \nwar presented in the moment of greatest chaos.\n  Many times, in hot wars and cold wars, we have reassessed and changed \npolicy.\n  Retroactive analysis and accountability are important--sometimes it \nis critical to understand minor and major mistakes in order to correct \nflawed policy--but the challenge is to seek the policy amongst the \nrealistic options that will best deliver us to our goals for the \nfuture, not to sink in self-satisfying denunciations of the past.\n  I have read each of these resolutions carefully. I oppose the \noriginal Biden amendment, because I fundamentally disagree with it.\n  Its first resolution clause states:\n\n       It is not in the national interest of the U.S. to deepen \n     its military involvement in Iraq, particularly by escalating \n     the United States military force presence in Iraq.\n\n  I deeply disagree.\n  Not only does this set up a potential constitutional conflict between \nthe executive and legislature as to who runs foreign policy in a war, \nits intent is to inhibit the President from trying to improve the \nsituation in Iraq at a perilous time. Further, to maintain the status \nquo in Iraq, as this clause implies, is to guarantee greater chaos in \nIraq.\n  If the opponents of the President want to force a withdrawal, \nshouldn't they say so directly?\n  The second clause of the original Biden resolution stated:\n\n\n[[Page S1698]]\n\n\n       The primary objective of U.S. strategy in Iraq should be to \n     have the Iraqi political leaders make the political \n     compromises necessary to end the violence in Iraq.\n\n  When I read this, I have to ask, where have the authors of this \nlanguage been? That was our strategy, which we tried mightily, from \n2004 until last year: to let politics lead the way to security. But the \nforces of insurgency and chaos overwhelmed the fledgling political \nprocess and now we clearly realize we have to implement and achieve \nsecurity before we can regain political process.\n  Am I the only one here who finds it ironic that critics of the \nadministration who support this resolution appear to be advocating a \npolicy that has failed?\n\n  The next clause reads:\n\n       Greater concerted regional and international support would \n     assist the Iraqis in achieving a political and national \n     reconciliation.\n\n  This is not a policy option, but a dreamer's delusion. It is true, in \nthe abstract, that international support would be greatly beneficial to \nthe Iraqis. But if you look at the region, this dream of international \ncooperation is not based on reality. Aspirations should not substitute \nfor harsh reality.\n  Then the resolution states:\n\n       Main elements of the mission of the U.S. forces in Iraq \n     should transition to helping ensure the territorial integrity \n     of Iraq, conduct counterterrorism activities, reduce regional \n     interference in the internal affairs of Iraq, and accelerate \n     training of Iraqi troops.\n\n  But, we are conducting counterterrorist activities, and the fight in \nal-Anbar for which the President has requested a small number of this \nsurge is exactly for that. But this resolution disapproves of that, if \nyou are to re-read the first clause. We are accelerating training, but \nwe have learned that, if you are going to do it right, you can't speed \nit up beyond a certain point.\n  To paraphrase my colleague, the vice chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, Senator Bond, who has said of rushed intelligence \nassessments:\n\n       If you want it bad, you're going to get it . . . bad.\n\n  If we rush the training, as we have seen, we're going to get \nineffective results. If our training of the Iraqi security forces is to \nbe effective and successful, we need to take the time to do it right.\n  I am all for reducing regional interference, but to do so might mean \nexercising power and influence, and critics of this President have a \nconniption if you suggest anything other than a diplomatic tea party \nwith Syria or Iran.\n  And I do not consider it wise to commit to the territorial integrity \nof Iraq. We should be agnostic about this question, and recent history \nshould keep us humble against knee-jerk commitments to territorial \nlines drawn by imperial powers. A previous Bush administration fumbled \non the wrong side of history in the last days of the Cold War when it \nargued against ``suicidal nationalism'' at a time when the Soviet Union \nwas dissolving. A failure to recognize that Yugoslavia was a false \nstate led the U.S. to delay for years an involvement that could have \nsaved hundreds of thousands of civilian lives.\n  If a soft partition could be achieved without bloodshed, I would \nsupport that in Iraq, although no one has figured out how to do that, \nyet, and it remains unclear whether Iraqis themselves, particularly \nurbanized Iraqis, desire this or could survive a bloody partition.\n  But I repeat: If I could imagine a nonviolent partition implemented \nby an international organization that would have the support of the \nIraqi people, I would rather find the billions to do that than the \nbillions to fight a war. In the case of finding financial resources for \nsoft partition, I would expect we would have a somewhat better response \nfrom the international community than we are having now.\n  The next resolution clause states:\n\n       The U.S. should transfer, under an appropriately expedited \n     timeline, responsibility for internal security and halting \n     sectarian violence in Iraq to the Government of Iraq and \n     Iraqi security forces.\n\n  But just because we want to shed ourselves of this war does not mean \nwe can immediately stand up Iraqi security forces. We have been trying \nto do that, and it is taking time. This clause is, in effect, purely \naspirational. It makes us feel good, but it doesn't change the reality \non the ground.\n  The final clause states:\n\n       The U.S. should engage nations in the Middle East to \n     develop a regional, internationally-sponsored peace and \n     reconciliation process for Iraq.\n\n  Mr. President, who are the players in the Middle East who are both: \n(a) sympathetic to the Iraqi cause, and (b) strong enough to be \neffective?\n  No country meets both of these simple conditions.\n  They aren't there. It is too typical of the critics of this \nadministration to substitute the process of diplomacy for the substance \nof hard policy choices.\n  Now, I do not oppose diplomacy. It is a legitimate tool in the tool \nkit. But diplomacy must always be part of a broader policy. Before I \nwould support this administration's diplomatic initiative toward Iran, \nI would want to see a comprehensive Iran policy. However late in the \nday, the administration appears to to be forming such a policy, and it \nappears to include elements of confrontation and competition, as well \nas a clearly stated solicitation for more constructive relations, as \nany sound and sophisticated policy should.\n  If we are to sit down with Iran while Iran is continuing with a \nprogram for nuclear development, continues to be the No. 1 state \nsponsor of terrorism in the world, continues to undermine the stability \nin Lebanon, and is working against the coalition's forces in Iraq, I \nwould want those Iranian diplomats that we are sipping tea with to know \nthat we are competing and challenging them on all of those fronts. It \nwould be foolish to talk to Iran simply hoping we could convince the \nIranians to see the world our way.\n  The nations of the region with whom we are close do support the peace \nand reconciliation in Iraq. And those nations want us to remain in Iraq \nuntil the situation is stabilized. Kuwait, Jordan, Turkey, Saudi \nArabia--none of those governments want us to leave Iraq the way it is \nnow. But Syria and Iran and al-Qaida, too--they want us to leave, and \nleave behind chaos they can exploit.\n  My colleague and good friend, Senator Warner, has made an effort to \nwrite a resolution that smoothed away some of the aspects of the \noriginal Biden legislation which I find I cannot support.\n  In particular, the senior Senator from Virginia recognizes, in the \nfirst clause, the President's foreign policy prerogative, while \nsomewhat ambiguously also stating that the resolution's intent is not \n``to question or contravene'' the President's constitutional authority \nas Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n  I say ``ambiguously,'' because Senator Warner's first resolution \nclause is remarkably similar to Senator Biden's:\n\n       The Senate disagrees with the plan to augment our forces \n     and urges the President to consider all options and \n     alternatives for achieving the strategic goals set forth \n     below.\n\n  It seems to me, however, that adding troops to meet the goals the \nPresident has set--achieving a zone of security in Baghdad from which \nthe Iraqi political leadership can assert its leadership and implement \nessential policies--is a major option that the Warner resolution \nprecludes.\n  Further, Senator Warner's resolution strongly supports our efforts \nagainst Sunni jihadists, including al-Qaida, in Anbar Province, as I \ndo.\n  Senator Warner and the cosponsors of his resolution, however, do not \nwant to see us in between the various sects fighting in Baghdad.\n  I have to ask: If we are to encourage the anti-al-Qaida Sunni \nelements in Anbar to join us in a fight to eradicate al-Qaida, what \ncredibility do we have to do so if we are standing by while Sunni \njihadists target Shia in Baghdad, and Shia militias slaughter Sunnis in \nresponse?\n  Part of how we got here is by not imagining the way the perpetrators \nof sectarian strife calculate. We can't continue to fail to understand \nthis dynamic, nor to believe that we can ignore it.\n  I will support the President's surge strategy because I believe there \nis a reasonable chance--reasonable, not guaranteed--that a strong \nmilitary presence that has open rules of engagement to attack \ninsurgents, militias and other criminal elements may create a zone of \ncalm and security for Baghdad. This goal is to create the\n\n[[Page S1699]]\n\nspace for political leaders to make effective decisions on oil \nresources, federalism, economic development and other critical issues \nto entice the majority of the Iraqis into believing there is an \nalternative to civil war.\n  Such a period of calm, if achieved, is essential not only for the \npolitical system to assert itself, but for us to complete the majority \nof our training of Iraqi security forces.\n  If we are to succeed, we won't be able to do it alone. The Iraqi \nSunnis are going to have to lead in defeating the foreigners who are \nterrorizing them in their homes in western Iraq and leading the attacks \nagainst Shia in Baghdad.\n  The Sunnis will have to lead in ejecting al-Qaida, as they have begun \nto do so.\n  The Sunnis, not the Shia, are going to have to definitively expose \nand defeat the former Baathists who have not accepted that the Baath \nera is over.\n  The Sunni will have to address this challenge, not the Shia.\n  And the Shia, not the Sunni, are going to have to lead in ending the \nterror of the Shia militias.\n  The Shia are going to have to defeat those who claim to advance the \nShia cause by revenge, by torture, by barbarism. If the Maliki \ngovernment fails to muster the political will to do so, we cannot \nimpose it from the outside.\n  Perhaps the Iraqi government can finally make progress toward \nbuilding institutions that will sustain a unified Iraq, toward passing \nlegislation that will divide Iraq's enormous natural resources \nequitably among the three ethnicities, that will open the civil society \nto Sunnis, instead of punishing them indiscriminately for their \ndominance during the Baath era.\n  Perhaps.\n  But if not, this Nation and this administration should not be \nirrationally wedded to the notion of a unitary state of Iraq. We need \nto imagine all options, rather than cling to ideas which may have \ndeparted from the realm of reasonable options.\n  I will support this surge because the option right now of withdrawing \nleaves three critical questions unanswered:\n  No. 1: How do we continue the fight against foreign Sunni extremists, \nincluding al-Qaida, in the west of Iraq?\n  No. 2: Are we to leave a fractured Shia substate unstable enough for \nIran to exert expansionist influence, thereby strengthening Tehran?\n  No. 3: Are we prepared as a nation to see a bloodbath ensue, in \nBaghdad and elsewhere, that may make other American foreign policy \nfailures--Budapest in 1956, Vietnam in 1975, the Shia slaughter after \nwe ejected Saddam from Kuwait in 1991--pale in comparison?\n  As I said at the beginning of this speech, the critics' attempts to \nset the stage for withdrawal commits the same strategic blunder they \nlegitimately accuse the Bush administration of making in its \nimplementation of the Iraq war. They didn't think of the day after \nSaddam fell. Today the critics are not thinking of the day after we \nwithdraw.\n  Today, however, we need to recognize that worse than the vanity about \neasy victory committed in 2003 is the denial of calamitous defeat that \nwould occur if we leave before we make every attempt to stabilize the \ncountry.\n  For this reason, I will support the administration, but I will do so \nunder no casual assumptions or glib assurances.\n  I will also do so by demanding that the administration be much more \nforthcoming in its plans for the day after--the day after we complete \nour surge into Baghdad, the day after we can honestly assess that \nBaghdad has been pacified, and heaven forbid, the day after we assess \nthat the chaos unleashed and manipulated by the forces of destruction \nare prohibiting a meaningful and comprehensive success.\n  I am not conceding defeat, nor preparing for withdrawal.\n  I am supporting a strategy for success. So far, President Bush--who \nhas a lot to answer for the mistakes that have been made--is offering \nthe only way to try to leave Iraq in better shape than it is now.\n  He has my support, and I urge my colleagues to join me.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, we are all well aware in this Chamber \nthat our country finds itself in a deepening crisis in Iraq, and we \nfind ourselves at a moment of decision in the Senate. Nearly 4 years \nago, our President rushed us into war in Iraq, a war now longer than \nAmerican involvement in World War II, which next month will actually \nexceed the length of our own Civil War. For 4 years, Members on both \nsides of the aisle have watched with shock and dismay as our President \nhas made mistake after misjudgment after miscalculation. Even before \nthe invasion ended, the administration rejected the voluminous plans \ndrawn up by the State Department to deal with the chaotic aftermath. \nThe successful examples of the U.S. experience in Bosnia and Kosovo \nduring the 1990s were summarily rejected. State Department and other \nAmerican officials with experience in nation-building were blackballed \nin favor of inexperienced ideologues who were selected on the basis of \npolitical litmus tests, including answering questions about whether \nthey were for or against Roe v. Wade and whether they had voted for \nGeorge W. Bush.\n  Despite the urgent warnings of Army Chief of Staff Rick Shinseki and \nother senior military commanders, the necessary number of troops to \nensure security and stability was not sent at the start of the \nconflict. Our men and women in uniform were ordered into harm's way \nwithout the necessary body armor or armored vehicles, a mortal error I \nhave tried to correct time and again since I first learned of it. The \nstrategic blunders now fill an entire library shelf of books, and they \nare certainly too numerous for me to list in the time allotted here.\n  Through these 4 years, there has also been another abdication of \nresponsibility. That was the failure of this Congress to engage in its \nConstitutional obligation of oversight and accountability. While our \ntroops have stood valiantly on the frontlines, the Congress has stood \non the sidelines. Defending a partisan position trumped U.S. national \nsecurity interests and the welfare of our troops in the field. Many \nMembers attempted to raise the debate, and we were unable to do so \nbecause of the majority's refusal to hold the administration \naccountable.\n  In the election last year, the American people decided the status quo \nwas no longer acceptable. So we have a new Congress, and it is past \ntime we in this Chamber do our duty to balance the President and \nprovide a check against his failed policy in Iraq. As there is a \nmajority in our country against the President's failed policy in Iraq, \nthere is a bipartisan majority in this Senate against it, as well. The \nresolution before the Senate reflects that bipartisan consensus as it \nalso reflects the sentiments of the overwhelming majority of Americans.\n  But a partisan minority seeking to shield the administration's \ncontinuing failure in Iraq seeks to thwart the bipartisan majority and \nthe will of the American people. This is not a debate about \nabstractions. I have seen the consequences of our involvement in Iraq, \nas have many of my fellow Senators. Three weeks ago, I visited Iraq to \nexpress gratitude to our soldiers, to meet with Iraqi leaders and U.S. \ncommanders and our troops on the ground.\n  What I saw and what I did not see underscored my concerns. I saw \nAmerican service men and women performing their duty admirably, but I \ndid not see a strategy that, under the current circumstances, has much \nchance of success. The collective analysis of our intelligence \ncommunity in the latest National Intelligence Estimate is that the term \n``civil war'' does not adequately capture the complexity of the \nconflict in Iraq. The bipartisan Baker-Hamilton Commission said the \nsituation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating. Yet the President's \nresponse to the bipartisan commission and the latest National \nIntelligence Estimate does not match the urgency that is described. The \nso-called surge is not a new strategy but a tactic that has been tried \nand failed.\n  The absence of leadership on the part of the President leaves \nCongress no choice but to demonstrate the leadership that the American \npeople and the reality on the ground demand. The previous two \nCongresses abdicated their duty. We must not. Every single day our feet \nsink deeper into the sands. Every day the crisis worsens. To hide from \nthis debate with our troops in such danger is wrong, plain and simple.\n\n[[Page S1700]]\n\n  The crisis in Iraq has fostered a crisis of democracy at home. The \nAmerican people expect a debate. Our troops are owed a debate. Our \nConstitution commands we debate. But a partisan minority acting at the \nbehest of the administration is standing in the way. This amounts to a \ngag rule on our democracy, contrary to the national security interests \nof the United States.\n  Even though America voted for a new direction in Iraq, even though \nthe majority of Senators opposes escalation in Iraq, we cannot get the \nRepublicans to allow us to take a symbolic vote to condemn the \nescalation, much less a real vote to stop it. This resolution deserves \na debate. It deserves a vote. It deserves passage.\n  There are those in the Senate who invoke our grave troops, suggesting \nthat a debate on the most important issue facing our country and facing \nour troops would somehow undermine the mission and weaken our Nation. \nIt is a pernicious, shameful argument and it is dead wrong. Our \ndemocracy is stronger than that and the American people and our troops \ndeserve better than that.\n  Our troops understand we are debating this war. We are debating it \nnot just in this Senate, we are debating it in kitchen table \nconversations, around water coolers, and standing in line at \nsupermarkets. We are debating this war everywhere Americans gather. \nIndeed, our troops are debating this war.\n  The American people understand it is the policy that undermines our \nnational security interests, not a vote disapproving the policy.\n  This debate and this resolution have merit and purpose and it will, \nif permitted to go forward, begin the process of changing the policy; \notherwise, why would the administration and my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle fight so hard to prevent us from having a debate and \na vote? Because they understand this will be the first step to restore \nour strength and renew our leadership around the world, to begin \nredeploying our troops out of Iraq and start on the long road of \nundoing the damage brought by the President to America's leadership \naround the world.\n  If you believe the escalation is the right strategy, cast your vote \nfor it. If you believe, as the majority in this Chamber believes, that \nescalation is not the right strategy, then cast your vote against it. \nBut standing on the sidelines is no way to stand up for the troops.\n\n  Now, there are many--both in the Chamber and outside--who wish to go \nfurther than this resolution and look for ways to bind the actions of \nthe President and to require him to change course. I understand and \nagree with the frustration that has afflicted many Members in dealing \nwith the President's policy. However, if we can get a bipartisan vote \nagainst escalation, it will be the first time the Senate has exercised \nits constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance on the \nPresident. The first step for the Senate will be a giant leap toward \naccountability and toward the right end to this war.\n  There is a big difference between calling for the end of this war and \ndoing the difficult, painstaking work of building the political will \nwithin the Congress to take action. We, in the Senate, entrusted by our \nconstituents to cast tough votes, should not have the luxury of \nstanding outside the arena and lobbing criticism from within.\n  Once we pass this resolution, we should go further. Rather than an \nescalation of U.S. troops, which will not contribute to fundamentally \nchanging the conditions on the ground, we should put pressure on the \nIraqi Government in a way that they will understand there are \nconsequences to their empty promises and their continued inaction.\n  Last week, the National Intelligence Counsel released the \nunclassified key judgments of the National Intelligence Estimate on \nIraq. That presents the consensus views of the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity. It underscores the need for a political solution. The NIE \nstates that in the coming 12 to 18 months, the overall security \nsituation will continue to deteriorate at rates comparable to the \nlatter part of 2006. And it goes on further to say that even if \nviolence is diminished, given the current winner-takes-all attitude and \nsectarian animosities infecting the political scene, Iraqi leaders will \nbe hard-pressed to achieve sustained political reconciliation in the \ntimeframe of the estimate, namely, a year to a year and a half. Even if \nthe intelligence experts argue the escalation results in greater \nsecurity, their best judgment is that the bloodshed and violence will \ncontinue to spiral out of control.\n  So what should we do? Many believe, and we have been arguing for this \nand voting for this for more than a year and a half, that we have to \nchart a new course that emphasizes greater Iraqi responsibility. I \nstill believe that is the path we should be taking. Instead, the \nPresident has chosen a very narrow course that relies heavily on \nAmerican military force.\n  I will be introducing legislation that I think offers a better \nalternative. First, my legislation will cap the number of troops in \nIraq as of January 1st and will require the administration to seek \ncongressional authorization for any additional troops. The President \nhas finally said, this is not an open-ended commitment in Iraq, but he \nis providing the Iraqis with an open-ended presence of American troops.\n  Second, as a means to increase our leverage with the Iraqi Government \nand to clearly send a message that there are consequences to their \ninaction, I would impose conditions for continued funding of the Iraqi \nsecurity forces and the private contractors working for the Iraqis.\n  My legislation would require certification that the security forces \nwere free of sectarian and militia influence and were actually assuming \ngreater responsibility for Iraqi security, along with other conditions. \nWe must not let U.S. funds, taxpayer funds, be used to train members of \nsectarian militias who are responsible for so much of the violence in \nIraq. Unfortunately, it appears our funds to Iraqi security forces may \nbe going to the people we are trying to restrain.\n  A news report last week in an article entitled ``Mahdi Army Gains \nStrength through Unwitting Aid of U.S.'' reports that:\n\n       . . . the U.S. military drive to train and equip Iraq's \n     security forces has unwittingly strengthened Muslin cleric \n     Muqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army militia, which has been battling \n     to take over much of the capital city as American forces are \n     trying to secure it.\n\n  According to this new report, U.S. Army commanders and enlisted men \nwho are patrolling East Baghdad, said al-Sadr's militias had heavily \ninfiltrated the Iraqi police and Army units that they've trained and \narmed. Said one soldier:\n\n       They'll wave at us during the day and shoot at us during \n     the night.\n\n  We need to inform the Iraqi Government, in no uncertain terms, that \nthere are consequences, that we will take funds away from their \ntroops--not from our troops, many of whom still lack armored vehicles \nand counterinsurgency measure devices and communications equipment. And \nwe will not fund the Iraqis if our troops are going to enter into \nsectarian battles where some of the participants have received American \ntraining and support.\n\n  Third, I would hold the administration accountable for their empty \npromises as well. My bill requires the Bush administration to certify \nthat Iraq has disarmed the militias, has ensured that a law has finally \nbeen passed for the equitable sharing of oil revenues; that the Iraqi \nGovernment, under American influence and even pressure, has made the \nconstitutional changes necessary to ensure rights for minority \ncommunities; that the debaathification process has been reversed to \nallow teachers, professionals, and others who joined the Baath Party as \na means to get a job to serve in the new Iraqi Government.\n  I would also require the administration to engage in a regional \ndiplomatic initiative, including all of Iraq's neighbors, to address \nIraq's future and to understand and convey clearly that the United \nStates expects Iraq's neighbors to be partners in the stability and \nsecurity of the new Iraqi state.\n  If these conditions are not met or are not on their way to being met \nwithin 6 months, a new congressional authorization requirement would be \ntriggered.\n  Finally, I would prohibit any spending to increase troop levels \nunless and until the Secretary of Defense certifies that our American \ntroops will have the proper training and equipment for\n\n[[Page S1701]]\n\nwhatever mission they are ordered to fulfill.\n  Yesterday, I read the classified report outlining the findings by the \nDepartment of Defense inspector general about the problems that have \nbeen faced by our troops getting the equipment they desperately need in \ncombat areas such as Iraq.\n  The inspector general did not have the full cooperation of the \nDepartment of Defense. It is heartbreaking that the inspector general \ncould conclude that the U.S. military still has failed to equip our \nsoldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, especially for the kind of warfare \nthey are confronting, with IEDs and insurgents who are attacking them \nin asymmetric, unconventional warfare.\n  This report comes on the heels of an article in the Washington Post \nlast week titled ``Equipment for Added Troops Is Lacking: New Iraq \nForces Must Make Do, Officials Say.'' The Washington Post story raised \nserious questions about the adequacy of the supply of up-armored HMMWVs \nand trucks.\n  One of our generals is quoted as saying he does not have the \nequipment our forces need, and they will have to go into battle with \nwhat they have.\n  On my way back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I stopped at Landstuhl \nHospital in Germany to visit with some of our wounded soldiers. I met \nwith one young man who was lying in his bed with injuries he had \nsuffered from one of the shape charges, these new more advanced, more \nsophisticated command-controlled IEDs, the improvised explosive \ndevices. He told me that the armored, fully equipped HMMWV had saved \nhis life and that of the lives of his buddies who were with him. But he \nalso told me that not everybody he served with had that kind of \nprotection because there were not enough of those armored vehicles to \ngo around.\n  I do not believe the Congress can shirk its responsibility. It is \npast time we live up to our constitutional responsibility. If I had \nbeen President in October of 2002, I would have never asked for \nauthority to divert our attention from Afghanistan to Iraq, and I \ncertainly would never have started this war. But we are where we are, \nand this Congress must deliver a strategy to help us end this war in \nthe right way and begin returning our troops home.\n  So on this most important issue of our time, I call on my colleagues \nnot to hide from this debate but to welcome it, to welcome the \nopportunity to set forth whatever one's opinions might be because this \ndebate is about more than our policy in Iraq. It is about the role and \nresponsibility of this august institution. Great debates in our past \nhave not only moved public opinion but furthered the progress of our \ncountry.\n  This debate is not merely about whether the President should escalate \ntroops into Iraq, whether he has failed to grasp the complexity of the \nsituation we confront in Iraq, and to take every diplomatic, political, \neconomic, and military strategy available to him, but it is about our \ndemocracy itself.\n  We should consider this resolution, and I hope we will. Our duty is \nrooted in the faith entrusted to us by our constituents and enshrined \nin our Constitution. When we think about the patriotism and bravery, \nthe humor and resolve, the optimism and strength of our soldiers, \nmarines, airmen, and sailors, our Active Duty, our Guard, and Reserve, \nI think it humbles us all. But it comes out of this great democratic \ntradition that we are all blessed to be a part of.\n  I hope we have the opportunity in the next days to do our duty just \nas the men and women who are serving us have done and are doing theirs.\n  A week ago, I was privileged to go to San Antonio for the opening of \na remarkable center called the Center for the Intrepid. It is a new \nstate-of-the-art facility devoted to the rehabilitation and recovery of \nour wounded heroes. It was funded by contributions from more than \n600,000 Americans. It was not built by our Government. It was built by \nour citizens.\n  It is not only going to be a place of great hope and healing for the \nbrave men and women who have given their full measure, but it will also \nstand as a symbol of our democracy, of our values, of people coming \ntogether across our country--a unique partnership that you find nowhere \nelse in the world except here.\n  As I sat on the stage during the ceremonies for the opening of this \nnew rehabilitation center, I watched the hundreds of young men and \nwomen who had been injured march in, and in some cases wheeled in, to \ntake their place in the audience. I believe they are owed this debate. \nAnd certainly all those who are currently serving, and the thousands \nwho are on their way to carry out this escalation strategy, deserve it \neven more.\n  So I hope we will have a chance to express the will of our \nconstituents, our deeply held opinions, and participate in a debate \nthat is historic and necessary. That is the least we can do.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that an analysis \nof the consequences of our actions in Iraq entitled ``Now What?'' by \nArmy Retired LTG Jerry Max Bunyard be printed in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Now What?\n\n                         (By Jerry Max Bunyard)\n\n       At church every Sunday, the Fort Belvoir, VA Installation \n     Chaplain uses the question ``now what?'' to get the \n     congregation to analyze the message he just delivered and \n     find a way to apply it to their lives. I believe as citizens \n     and leaders of this nation we are at a point in the \n     continuing War in Iraq that we must ask the same question; \n     ``Now What?''\n       Today we have been bombarded with facts, figures, \n     commentaries, interpretations, and subjective thoughts \n     concerning the Middle East activities. Depending on the \n     writer, attempts are made to sway you one way or the other \n     concerning a particular issue. There are many half-truths \n     that are spoken, which tend to lead the reader in a given \n     direction. Our world-wide media has led us astray on many \n     Middle East subjects. They tend to be over zealous to ensure \n     what is being written follows the point they are attempting \n     to make or stays within the bounds of being politically \n     correct or meet their organization's marketing goals for \n     selling air time or copy. They sometimes convince the reader \n     to believe and support a particular political agenda. In many \n     cases these misleading and unbalanced reports cause the \n     reader to be convinced that what is being said is the truth. \n     On the other hand, there are some excellent articles, books \n     and writings that exist on the subject but they have been \n     overlooked or ignored to some degree by both academia and the \n     media because of political correctness coupled with political \n     sensitivity for fear of offending major non-western religion, \n     reigning political and ideological orthodoxies, or a mix of \n     both. So the question is how do we get to the truth of the \n     Middle East conundrum?\n       For many Americans (as well as other nationalities) they \n     simply rely on what the newspaper, radio or TV is telling \n     them. They do not question or seek other sources on any given \n     event or subject being discussed. They make no attempt to \n     understand the totality of the area of interest they just \n     swing with the ``news of the day'' from their favorite news \n     media or TV station. Then we have the politicians and their \n     army of supporters who will do and say what they think John \n     Q. Public wants to hear in order to glean their vote. They \n     twist and slant the news to meet their agenda. As we approach \n     the 2008 Presidential election this aspect has become the \n     norm and is simply misleading the American people, causing \n     great harm to our chances of achieving the National \n     objectives throughout the world as well as showing, \n     indirectly, lack of support for the members of our armed \n     forces who are serving in harms way supporting these \n     objectives. This, I consider personal aggrandizement and, \n     unquestionably, it is not in the best interest of the \n     country.\n       There are others, thank goodness, who do take the time and \n     energy to study the subject pro and con and attempt to be \n     objective and analyze the big picture along with the day to \n     day events as they occur. Likewise, there are some very \n     knowledgeable Middle East analysts who have made it their \n     life's endeavor to understand the intricacies of the \n     situation, various cultures, religion and politics of this \n     volatile region of the world. Many of these people are not in \n     the government. In my opinion, we should be listening to and \n     incorporating their thoughts and experience into any \n     decisions concerning that region of the world. These \n     dedicated, unbiased ``subject matter experts'' should be \n     consulted regularly for opinions and recommendations.\n       Based upon this multitude of diverse information one has to \n     sort the wheat from the chaff. This requires some personal \n     knowledge of the Middle East and Iraq war as well as the \n     writer or speaker providing information concerning the area \n     of interest. One must do his homework in order to place the \n     information in ``categories'' to establish a prioritization \n     of credible information. Once this task is completed then one \n     only uses that information and ``files'' the rest. Throughout \n     this paper I will use quotes or information from whom I \n     consider credible sources and will footnote where the \n     comments or quotes originated.\n       The purpose of this paper is to provide my two cents worth \n     on how to answer the question of ``Now What'' relative to \n     what we should be thinking about and doing concerning the \n     Iraqi situation or, better yet, the\n\n[[Page S1702]]\n\n     Middle East regional situation. There will not be any effort \n     to address the question of how we got into this situation. We \n     are where we are, so what course of action should we follow \n     from this point forward? To address this one must take a look \n     at the region itself and place into perspective the \n     consequences of the various choices that are now before us.\n\n\n                             The Challenge\n\n       I cautioned earlier about politicians and how they use or \n     misuse information. However, there is at least one exception \n     in the political arena, Senator Joseph Lieberman (I-CT) who \n     very clearly summed up the current Iraqi situation and the \n     challenge that faces Iraq, the United States and the free \n     world in general. Based on his long term interest in the \n     region, the wars (both past and current), and the information \n     gleaned from his trip to Iraq in December of 2006, he \n     provided the following comments upon his return:\n       ``Because of the bravery of many Iraqi and coalition \n     military personnel and the recent coming together of moderate \n     political forces in Baghdad, the war is winnable. We and our \n     Iraqi allies must do what is necessary to win it.\n       The American people are justifiably frustrated by the lack \n     of progress, and the price paid by our heroic troops and \n     their families has been heavy. But what is needed now, \n     especially in Washington and Baghdad, is not despair but \n     decisive action--and soon.\n       ``The most pressing problem we face in Iraq is not an \n     absence of Iraqi political will or American diplomatic \n     initiative, both of which are increasing and improving; it is \n     a lack of basic security. As long as insurgents and death \n     squads terrorize Baghdad, Iraq's nascent democratic \n     institutions cannot be expected to function, much less win \n     the trust of the people. The fear created by gang murders and \n     mass abductions ensures that power will continue to flow to \n     the very thugs and extremists who have the least interest in \n     peace and reconciliation.''\n       Senator Lieberman brought out very salient points--the war \n     is winnable; American people are frustrated by lack of \n     progress; price paid by troops and families has been heavy; \n     what is needed, especially in Washington and Baghdad, is not \n     despair but decisive action--and soon; most pressing problem \n     is the lack of basic security.\n       To me, that captures the status that continues to exist at \n     present.\n       So, this sets the stage as to the situation we find \n     ourselves in today. Now what do we do about it and how?\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       Before getting into the current Middle East issues and \n     possible courses of action it is necessary one have a general \n     understanding of the key religious aspects along with a basic \n     knowledge of the Jewish, Arab, and Islamic history.\n       Religion has once again become a force that no government \n     can safely ignore. The United States and other Western \n     countries experts have failed to recognize the importance of \n     faith as it relates to world affairs. One, if not the most, \n     important aspects to be considered when discussing the Middle \n     East and the growing dominance of the Islam religion concerns \n     the differences of opinion between Islam and the Western \n     World view of separation of Church and State.\n       Bruce Feiler states ``Abraham, the great patriarch of the \n     Hebrew Bible, is also the spiritual forefather of the New \n     Testament and the grand holy architect of the Koran. Abraham \n     is the shared ancestor of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. \n     He is the linchpin of the Arab-Israeli conflict. He is the \n     centerpiece of the battle between the West and Islamic \n     extremists. He is the father--in many cases, the purported \n     biological father--of 12 million Jews, 2 billion Christians, \n     and 1 billion Muslims around the world. He is history's first \n     monotheist.''\n       Thomas Jefferson once remarked that in matters of religion \n     ``the maxim of civil government'' should be reversed and we \n     should rather say, ``Divided we stand, united, we fall.'' In \n     this remark Jefferson was setting forth with classic \n     terseness an idea that has come to be regarded as essentially \n     American: the separation of Church and State. This idea was \n     not entirely new; it had some precedents in the writings of \n     Spinoza, Locke, and the philosophers of the European \n     Enlightenment. It was in the United States, however, that the \n     principle was first given the force of law and gradually, in \n     the course of two centuries, has become a reality.\n       Another very important aspect of this overall issue is to \n     address the total Middle East environment. An important \n     consideration is the countries that border Iraq and what \n     impact our actions and those of others may have on these \n     specific countries. Shown next is a map of the Middle East \n     countries. The countries directly adjacent to Iraq are Iran, \n     Jordan, Syria, Turkey, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.\n       George Friedman describes the dilemma that now faces the \n     United States as it relates to the potential influence of \n     Iran on the outcome of the Iraqi war. ``The Iraq war has \n     turned into a duel between the United States and Iran. For \n     the United States, the goal has been the creation of a \n     generally pro-American coalition government in Baghdad--\n     representing Iraq's three major ethnic communities. For Iran, \n     the goal has been the creation of either a pro-Iranian \n     government in Baghdad or, alternatively, the division of Iraq \n     into three regions, with Iran dominating the Shiite south.''\n\n\n                       The Costs of Disengagement\n\n       The next logical step would be to understand as best as \n     possible, the implications of not continuing our efforts in \n     Iraq and, in so doing, what this would mean to the United \n     States, in the future. One of the best analyses I have found \n     thus far comes from two men outside the government who have \n     significant experience in Middle East studies. Over the years \n     Daniel Bynum and Kenneth Pollack have gained an excellent \n     understanding of that region. In August of 2006 they \n     published an article titled, ``What Next,'' and have followed \n     that up with a 130 page report titled, ``Things Fall Apart'' \n     that was published in January 2007 by the Brookings \n     Institution's Saban Center for Middle East Policy. This \n     latest report states: ``Iraq is rapidly sliding into all-out \n     civil war that is likely to spill over into neighboring \n     countries, resulting in mass deaths and refugees, serious \n     disruption of oil supplies and a drastic decline in US \n     influence.''\n       In the August 2006 article, Bynum and Pollack state:\n       `` . . . The consequences of an all-out civil war in Iraq \n     could be dire. Considering the experiences of recent such \n     conflicts, hundreds of thousands of people may die. Refugees \n     and displaced people could number in the millions. And with \n     Iraqi insurgents, militias and organized crime rings wreaking \n     havoc on Iraq's oil infrastructure, a full-scale civil war \n     could send global oil prices soaring even higher.\n       ``However, the greatest threat that the United States would \n     face from civil war in Iraq is from the spillover--the \n     burdens, the instability, the copycat secession attempts and \n     even the follow-on wars that could emerge in neighboring \n     countries. Welcome to the new `new Middle East'--a region \n     where civil wars could follow one after another, like so many \n     Cold War dominoes.\n       ``And unlike communism, these dominoes may actually fall.''\n       There are other consequences of civil war as explained by \n     Bynum and Pollack. A top-level summary of their in-depth \n     study reveals: ``. . .civil wars tend to spread across \n     borders . . . and Washington must decide how to deal with the \n     most common and dangerous ways such conflicts spill across \n     national boundaries. Only by understanding the refugee \n     crises, terrorism, radicalization of neighboring populations, \n     copycat secessions and foreign interventions that such wars \n     frequently spark can we begin to plan for how to cope with \n     them in the months and years ahead . . . massive refugee \n     flows are a hallmark of major civil wars . . . refugee camps \n     often become a sanctuary and recruiting grounds for militias, \n     which use them to launch raids on their homelands . . . \n     terrorism finds new homes during civil wars . . . radicalism \n     is contagious as civil wars tend to inflame the passions of \n     neighboring populations . . . the problem worsens whenever \n     ethnic or religious groupings also spill across borders . . . \n     Iraq's neighbors are just as fractured as Iraq itself . . . \n     should Iraq fragment, voices for secession elsewhere will \n     gain strength . . . the first candidate for secession is \n     obviously Kurdistan . . . another critical problem of civil \n     wars is the tendency of neighboring states to get involved, \n     turning the conflicts into regional wars . . . covert foreign \n     intervention is proceeding apace in Iraq, with Iran leading \n     the way . . . Iran has set up an extensive network of safe \n     houses, arms caches, communications channels and proxy \n     fighters, and will be well-positioned to pursue its interests \n     in a full-blown civil war. The Sunni powers of Jordan, \n     Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Turkey are frightened by Iran's \n     growing influence and presence in Iraq and have been \n     scrambling to catch up . . . Turkey may be the most likely \n     country to overtly intervene in Iraq . . . none of Iraq's \n     neighbors thinks that it can afford to have the country fall \n     into the hands of the other side . . . an Iranian ``victory'' \n     would put the nation's forces in the heartland of the Arab \n     world, bordering Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Syria--\n     several of these states poured tens of billions of dollars \n     into Saddam Hussein's military to prevent just such an \n     occurrence in the 1980s . . . similarly, a Sunni Arab victory \n     (backed by the Jordanians, Kuwaitis and Saudis) would put \n     radical Sunni fundamentalists on Iran's doorstepa nightmare \n     scenario for Tehran . . . add in, too, each country's \n     interest in preventing its rivals from capturing Iraq's oil \n     resources . . . if these states are unable to achieve their \n     goals through clandestine intervention, they will have a \n     powerful incentive to launch a conventional invasion.''\n       George Friedman provides his assessment of Iran's concern \n     if Iraq is able to stabilize its government and the country \n     in general. He also indicates what the Iranians are doing to \n     counter the U.S. efforts to accomplish stabilizing Iraq.\n       ``A stable Iraq under U.S. influence represents a direct \n     threat to Iran, while a fragmented or pro-Iranian Iraq does \n     not. Therefore, the Iranians will do whatever they can to \n     undermine U.S. attempts to create a government in Baghdad. \n     Tehran can use its influence to block a government, but it \n     cannot--on its own--create a pro-Iranian one. Therefore, \n     Iran's strategy is to play spoiler and wait for the United \n     States to tire of the unending conflict. Once the Americans \n     leave, the Iranians can pick up the chips on the table. \n     Whether it takes 10 years or 30, the Iranians assume that, in \n     the end, they will win. None of the Arab countries in the \n     region has the power to withstand Iran, and the Turks are \n     unlikely to get into the game.''\n       The National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq, released 2 \n     February 2007, warns that\n\n[[Page S1703]]\n\n     pulling U.S. troops out of the country too soon would lead to \n     a collapse of the Iraqi military, outside intervention and \n     the creation of safe havens for al Qaeda terrorists. It also \n     states that if coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly . . . \n     we judge that this almost certainly would lead to a \n     significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian \n     conflict in Iraq, intensify Sunni resistance to the Iraqi \n     government and have adverse consequences for national \n     reconciliation. Additionally, if such a rapid withdrawal were \n     to take place, we judge that the [Iraqi Security Force] would \n     be unlikely to survive as a non-sectarian national \n     institution; neighboring countries . . . might intervene \n     openly in the conflict; massive civilian casualties and \n     forced population displacement would be probable. The report \n     also says that the al Qaeda terrorist group in Iraq would try \n     to ``use parts of the country''--particularly al-Anbar \n     province--to plan increased attacks in and outside of Iraq. \n     Additionally, Turkey could launch a military incursion if \n     there were no U.S. or allied troops to block Kurdish attempts \n     to control northern Iraq.\n\n\n        Alternative Courses of Action (C/A) and Supporting Base\n\n       Many alternatives and options have surfaced over the past \n     several weeks and months. The repercussion of exercising \n     certain alternatives have been looked at in considerable \n     depth with some alarming results that not only impact what \n     goes on in Iraq, but the impact they could have on the entire \n     Middle East.\n       In my opinion, there are at least four alternatives that \n     have been put on the table in respect to the way ahead in \n     Iraq. These are not new but have been identified by different \n     sources.\n       Cut and Run--The first C/A being considered was initiated \n     by Congressman Murtha in what has been termed as the ``cut \n     and run'' scenario. There are other variations of this C/A \n     but, essentially, they all boil down to get the troops out of \n     Iraq as quick as you can--some say immediately others say six \n     months others say by the end of the year (2007). This is easy \n     to say but carries with it tremendous implications and \n     ramifications.\n       In my opinion, this C/A would simply embolden the \n     terrorists to include Iran, Syria and other countries that \n     are supportive of terrorism. At the same time it would \n     demoralize our friends in the region. Once again it would \n     place America in everyone's minds as a feckless country that \n     does not have the will to see actions through to completion. \n     How many times do we have to learn that lesson? This would be \n     a strategic defeat for American interests with potentially \n     catastrophic consequences both in the Middle East region and \n     elsewhere. Thus, this C/A could lead to Iran expanding their \n     influence throughout the region and utilizing Hamas and \n     Hezbollah in Syria, Lebanon, Palestinian territories and \n     Jordan. What Arab friends the U.S. may have would feel \n     abandoned and it would place their governments in jeopardy. \n     No longer could they look to the U.S. as a reliable ally or \n     guarantor of peace and stability in this critical region. The \n     implications are that the effects of pulling out of Iraq \n     would spread over into the energy resources and transit choke \n     points vital to the global economy. How this would all play \n     out is unknown but these are potential outcomes of pursuing \n     this C/A.\n       Annexation of Iraq--The second C/A would be the annexation \n     of Iraq by American forces, which means the U.S. would govern \n     with a military governor-general and local commanders, and a \n     long-term commitment made that no matter the cost in \n     resources (people and dollars) the U.S. would defend, assist, \n     and help develop those who put their trust in us, in every \n     hamlet, village, and neighborhood until they are able to \n     defend themselves. This would entail sealing the borders and \n     providing local security, local civic actions and local \n     government and public services. The oil industry, agriculture \n     and other agencies would be franchised to U.S. companies to \n     redevelop with royalties going to the governor-general to \n     defray the costs of the occupation and security campaign. \n     This C/A could take decades before they are ready to become \n     an independent nation of Iraqis--no longer Kurds, Arabs and \n     other minorities but Iraqis. Complicating this C/A is Islam \n     and the differences that exist within the various \n     interpretations of Islam. In my opinion, this C/A would never \n     be supported by either Americans or Arabs/Iraqis and, \n     therefore, is discarded for further discussion.\n       Stay the Course--The third is to ``stay the course,'' which \n     falls in the unacceptable category, based on the failure to \n     date, plus the votes from the recent elections and the \n     sentiments of Congress. This C/A is not supported by the \n     Administration, Congress or the Defense Department. \n     Therefore, it is not considered viable and will be discarded \n     for further discussion.\n       Presidential Proposal--The fourth C/A follows what the \n     President is proposing. That is to provide support to the \n     Iraqi government in order for it to, as quickly as possible, \n     establish a unified democratic federal Iraq that can govern \n     and defend itself and serve as an ally in the War on Terror. \n     As I understand it, these have been the U.S. strategic goals \n     and objectives from the outset.\n       Stephen Hadley, Presidential security advisor, described \n     the President's proposal as follows:\n       ``The Baker-Hamilton report explained that failure in Iraq \n     could have severe consequences for our national interests in \n     a critical region and for our national security here at home. \n     In my many conversations with members of Congress and foreign \n     policy experts, few have disagreed.\n       ``Most people agree that we must focus on fighting al-\n     Qaeda. The president's strategy steps up this fight--\n     particularly in Anbar province, where al-Qaeda seeks a \n     sanctuary. The administration also agrees that we must \n     accelerate the training of Iraqi security forces. The \n     president's strategy does this--with benchmarks to track \n     progress and bolster the size and effectiveness of those \n     forces. Training and supporting Iraqi troops will remain \n     our military's essential and primary mission.\n       ``But the president's review also concluded that the \n     strategy with the best chance of success must have a plan for \n     securing Baghdad. Without such a plan, the Iraqi government \n     and its security institutions could fracture under the \n     pressure of widespread sectarian violence, ethnic cleansing \n     and mass killings. Chaos would then spread throughout the \n     country--and throughout the region. The al-Qaeda movement \n     would be strengthened by the flight of Sunnis from Baghdad \n     and an accelerated cycle of sectarian bloodletting. Iran \n     would be emboldened and could be expected to provide more \n     lethal aid for extremist groups. The Kurdish north would be \n     isolated, inviting separation and regional interference. \n     Terrorists could gain pockets of sanctuary throughout Iraq \n     from which to threaten our allies in the region and our \n     security here at home.\n       ``The new plan for Baghdad specifically corrects the \n     problems that plagued previous efforts. First, it is an \n     Iraqi-initiated plan for taking control of their capital. \n     Second, there will be adequate forces (Iraqi and American) to \n     hold neighborhoods cleared of terrorists and extremists. \n     Third, there is a new operational concept--one devised not \n     just to pursue terrorists and extremists but to secure the \n     population. Fourth, new rules of engagement will ensure that \n     Iraqi and U.S. forces can pursue lawbreakers regardless of \n     their community or sect. Fifth, security operations will be \n     followed by economic assistance and reconstruction aid--\n     including billions of dollars in Iraqi funds--offering jobs \n     and the prospect of better lives.''\n       Stephen Hadley continues his explanation of the totality of \n     the President's plan by explaining the key strategic shifts \n     that are major changes from previous approach:\n       ``Reinforcing our military presence is not the strategy--it \n     is a means to an end and part of a package of key strategic \n     shifts that will fundamentally restructure our approach to \n     achieving our objectives in Iraq.\n       ``Building on experience elsewhere in the country, the new \n     strategy doubles the number of provincial reconstruction \n     teams (PRTs) in Iraq. These civilian-led units will target \n     development aid where it is needed and help the Iraqi \n     government extend its reach to all corners of the country.\n       ``Because close civilian-military cooperation is key to \n     success, 10 new civilian PRTs will be embedded with U.S. \n     combat brigades.\n       The new strategy incorporates other essential elements of \n     the Baker-Hamilton report, such as doubling the number of \n     troops embedded with Iraqi forces, using benchmarks to help \n     us and the Iraqis chart progress, and launching a renewed \n     diplomatic effort to increase support for the Iraqi \n     government and advance political reconciliation.''\n\n\n                               Discussion\n\n       Earlier in this paper the Byman-Pollack report identified \n     consequences of an all-out civil war in Iraq. In their ``what \n     to do about it'' part of their report they had the following \n     to say:\n       ``Much as Americans may want to believe that the United \n     States can just walk away from Iraq should it slide into all-\n     out civil war, the threat of spillover from such a conflict \n     throughout the Middle East means it can't. Instead, \n     Washington will have to devise strategies to deal with \n     refugees, minimize terrorist attacks emanating from Iraq, \n     dampen the anger in neighboring populations caused by the \n     conflict, prevent secession fever and keep Iraq's neighbors \n     from intervening. The odds of success are poor, but, \n     nonetheless, we have to try.\n       ``The United States, along with its Asian and European \n     allies, will have to make a major effort to persuade Iraq's \n     neighbors not to intervene in its civil war. Economic aid \n     should be part of such an effort, but will not suffice. For \n     Jordan and Saudi Arabia, it may require an effort to \n     reinvigorate Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, thereby \n     addressing one of their major concerns--an effort made all \n     the more important and complex in light of the recent \n     conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. For Iran and Syria, it \n     may be a clear (but not cost-free) path toward acceptance \n     back into the international community.\n       ``When it comes to foreign intervention, Iran is the \n     biggest headache of all. Given its immense interests in Iraq, \n     some involvement is inevitable. For Tehran, and probably for \n     Damascus, the United States and its allies probably will have \n     to put down red lines regarding what is absolutely \n     impermissible--such as sending uniformed Iranian military \n     units into Iraq or claiming Iraqi territory. Washington and \n     its allies will also have to lay out what they will do if \n     Iran crosses any of those red lines. Economic sanctions would \n     be one possibility, but they could be effective only if the \n     European Union, China, India and Russia all cooperate. On its \n     own, the United States could employ punitive military \n     operations, either to make Iran pay an unacceptable price for \n     one-time infractions\n\n[[Page S1704]]\n\n     or to persuade it to halt ongoing violations of one or more \n     red lines.\n       ``A full-scale war in Iraq could result in hundreds of \n     thousands of deaths and millions of refugees streaming across \n     the nation's borders. The level of killings and displacement \n     from other major civil conflicts--such as those in Bosnia, \n     Congo, Lebanon and Rwanda--suggests the toll in Iraq could \n     surge even higher if conditions there deteriorate further.''\n       David Dolan, a reputable journalist and author, who has \n     spent the last 27 years living and working in Israel, \n     provides his assessment of what is viewed from the lens of \n     the Israeli military analysts concerning the turmoil that \n     exists today in the Middle East and the prognosis for the \n     coming year.\n       ``Israeli military analysts said the main reason for \n     growing regional instability is stepped up Iranian meddling \n     throughout the Middle East. They noted that the oil-flushed \n     theocratic Muslim regime in Tehran is pumping copious amounts \n     of financial aid and weapons to its Syrian, Lebanese \n     Hizbullah and Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad allies, \n     along with material aid going to Iranian-backed Shiite \n     militias operating next door in violence-torn Iraq. Coming \n     against the ominous backdrop of Iran's escalating nuclear \n     uranium enrichment program, the mullah's meddling is \n     succeeding in destabilizing the entire region, adding to \n     growing prospects that major portions of the tense Middle \n     East will erupt into full-scale warfare during 2007.''\n       The Brookings Institution Saban Center Analysis Number 11, \n     released 29 January 2007, examines the history of some dozen \n     recent civil wars to reveal the general patterns by which \n     such conflicts can ``spill over'' into neighboring states, \n     causing further civil wars or regional conflicts. \n     Historically, six patterns of spillover have been the most \n     harmful in other cases of all-out civil war: refugees; \n     terrorism; radicalization of neighboring populations; \n     secession that breeds secessionism; economic losses; and \n     neighborly interventions. The purpose of this review was to \n     determine what policy options the United States could employ \n     to try to contain the spillover effects of a full-scale Iraqi \n     civil war. It is recognized that with each passing day, Iraq \n     sinks deeper into the abyss of civil war. President Bush has \n     proposed one last-chance effort to quell the fighting and \n     jumpstart a process of political reconciliation and economic \n     reconstruction. Comments coming from this review state:\n       ``Should this last effort fail, the United States is likely \n     to very quickly have to determine how best to handle an Iraq \n     that will be erupting into Bosnia- or Lebanon-style all-out \n     civil war. The history of such wars is that they are \n     disastrous for all parties, but the United States will have \n     little choice but to try to stave off disaster as best it \n     can.''\n       These tasks will be difficult and will require the \n     deployment of large ground forces to accomplish them. Ending \n     an all-out civil war requires overwhelming military power to \n     nail down a political settlement. The Byman-Pollack report of \n     2006 states:\n       ``It took 30,000 British troops to bring the Irish civil \n     war to an end, 45,000 Syrian troops to conclude the Lebanese \n     civil war, 50,000 NATO troops to stop the Bosnian civil war, \n     and 60,000 to do the job in Kosovo. Considering Iraq's much \n     larger population, it probably would require 450,000 troops \n     to quash an all-out civil war there. Such an effort would \n     require a commitment of enormous military and economic \n     resources, far in excess of what the United States has \n     already put forth [and planned future increases].''\n\n\n                       Meanwhile, back in the USA\n\n       This discussion would be incomplete if we did not discuss \n     the home front and what is going on here in the United States \n     relative to the Iraq War. The November 2006 elections started \n     a fire storm of various anti-war factions rising to the \n     surface and demanding we pull out of the war immediately or \n     within a short period of time. With the Democrats taking over \n     both sides of the Congress we now have a political \n     confrontation as to who can get his or her resolution to pass \n     both sides of the Congress. Lately, the Congress is awash \n     with resolutions. Senator Obama submitted legislation 30 \n     January, which would remove all combat brigades from Iraq by \n     March 31, 2008. This timetable for completing a withdrawal \n     puts him at odds with other leading rivals for the Democratic \n     nomination. Senator Hillary Clinton supports capping the \n     number of troops at their levels of Jan. 1, 2007. Sen. \n     Christopher J. Dodd (Conn.) has proposed a similar troop cap. \n     But neither has embraced a timetable for a troop removal. \n     Former Senator and Vice Presidential candidate in 2004 and \n     now a Presidential candidate for 2008, John Edwards (D-NC), \n     has been outspoken in his opposition to Bush's new plan and \n     has called for the immediate withdrawal of 40,000 to 50,000 \n     troops. But he, too, has stopped short of setting a firm date \n     by which all would be removed. New Mexico Gov. Bill \n     Richardson is the only other prominent Democrat in the field \n     to set a withdrawal timetable, declaring that troops ``can \n     and should'' be brought home by the end of 2007. The Obama \n     plan, called the Iraq War De-escalation Act of 2007, would \n     begin a troop withdrawal no later than May 1, 2007, but it \n     includes several caveats that could forestall a clean break: \n     It would leave a limited number of troops in place to conduct \n     counterterrorism activities and train Iraqi forces. (The \n     question one must ask in respect to this proposal is how \n     could you leave a small contingent of U.S. forces in a \n     country rife with civil war?) And the withdrawal could be \n     temporarily suspended if the Iraqi government meets a \n     series of benchmarks laid out by the Bush administration. \n     That list includes a reduction in sectarian violence; the \n     equitable distribution of oil revenue; government reforms; \n     and democratic, Iraqi-driven reconstruction and economic \n     development efforts. Senator Obama's proposal also would \n     reverse Bush's troop-increase plan.\n       On the other side of the aisle the Republicans have their \n     own versions of resolutions. A resolution by Sen. John McCain \n     (R-AZ) and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) demanding tough \n     benchmarks for progress in Iraq was supposed to garner \n     overwhelming Republican support, being a more palatable \n     alternative to language by Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.) that \n     would state opposition to the troop buildup. Instead, rival \n     measures continue to proliferate. Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) \n     said he is circulating language that would forbid a cutoff of \n     funding for troops in the field under any circumstance, \n     similar to another proposal by Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). \n     Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) is shopping around a measure that \n     would demand that the president's policies be given a chance \n     to work while calling for the reversal of perceived war-\n     related mistakes, such as the wholesale purging of Baath \n     Party members from the Iraqi government and the failure to \n     ensure equitable oil-revenue sharing among Iraqi groups. \n     ``Resolutions are flying like snowflakes around here,'' Sen. \n     Specter said. There may be more in the wings of Congress that \n     have yet to surface but, at this writing, these appear to be \n     the ones being discussed.\n       Meanwhile, the two camps promoting competing resolutions of \n     opposition--one headed by Senators Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-\n     Del.) and Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) and the other by Senator \n     Warner (R-Va.) and Senator Levin (D-Mich.)--initially \n     appeared to be closing in on common language that could win a \n     clear majority within the Senate, but, at this writing it \n     appears that may not happen.\n       These non-binding resolutions, regardless of which side of \n     the aisle they come from, are not constructive--they change \n     nothing, take responsibility for nothing, and hurt both \n     morale and whatever semblance of national unity the USA might \n     project. They aid and abet the enemy just like the \n     discussions that occurred during the Vietnam War. If we set \n     deadlines or propose certain number of troops be withdrawn by \n     a certain date then this gives the enemy a timetable to work \n     to in respect to holding off until the Americans leave. It \n     certainly doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that one \n     out. Rhetoric influences perceptions, and perceptions can \n     drive responses.\n       Unless Congress can find the intestinal fortitude to assert \n     its true Constitutional authority and actually freeze or even \n     mandate a drawdown in spending on operations in Iraq and use \n     of funds to move troops individually or as units to Iraq, \n     this is just a lot of hypocritical political theater--\n     attempting to look assertive while in fact denying \n     responsibility and showing the lack of commitment and \n     fecklessness of America--once again. J. D. Pendry said, ``Our \n     enemies, just as enemies past, know that winning a war with \n     the United States is not about combat assaults, but about \n     wearing down the will of the American people to continue to \n     support the fight. Because they're winning the war of wills, \n     they wouldn't dare attack inside the country. Our enemies \n     know that our weak link in fighting a war is our politics, \n     media, and the socialist elites who ally with them in waging \n     war against the American will to sustain a fight.''\n       General David Petraeus, the new U.S. commander of the \n     forces in Iraq, explained in hearings before Congress, that \n     reinforcing U.S. troops is necessary for this new plan to \n     succeed. Any plan that limits our ability to reinforce our \n     troops in the field is a plan for failure--and could hand \n     Baghdad to terrorists and extremists before legitimate Iraqi \n     forces are ready to take over the fight. General Petraeus \n     made clear his disdain for ideas that are very much in vogue \n     in Washington these days: getting out of Iraq altogether, or \n     the current favorite of the Democratic leadership: passing \n     resolutions critical of the war.\n       In the Congressional confirmation hearing Sen. John McCain \n     asked what would happen if we were to leave Iraq. Gen. \n     Petraeus pointed to ``the very real possibility of \n     involvement of countries from elsewhere in the region, around \n     Iraq, entering Iraq to take sides with one or the other \n     groups.'' He added that there ``is the possibility, \n     certainly, of an international terrorist organization truly \n     getting a grip on some substantial piece of Iraq.'' In \n     response to questions from Sen. McCain and Sen. Joe \n     Lieberman, Gen. Petraeus added that resolutions of \n     disapproval for the war would be unhelpful to American troop \n     morale and would encourage our enemies in Iraq.\n       During the recent confirmation hearing of Admiral Fallon to \n     be the Central Command Commander Sen. Carl M. Levin (D-\n     Mich.), the committee chairman, proposed to hold the Iraqi \n     leaders accountable to meeting benchmarks, Admiral Fallon \n     said he believed that imposing ``edicts'' or ``deadlines'' \n     would be unconstructive. He also suggested a need to lower \n     American expectations for Iraq, indicating that U.S. goals \n     for Iraq following the 2003 invasion were unrealistically \n     ambitious.\n       Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican said, ``Congress is \n     sending mixed messages to the troops, to voters and to the \n     world with a ``no confidence'' vote that carries no force . . \n     . We\n\n[[Page S1705]]\n\n     can't claim to support the troops and not support their \n     mission,'' he said in a floor speech 31 January. ``If we \n     don't support the mission, we shouldn't be passing nonbinding \n     resolutions. We should be doing everything in our power to \n     stop it . . . we should send them the message that, yes, we \n     believe you can succeed and it's important to our national \n     security that you do.''\n       We also hear from Congress and others about how ``we \n     support the troops'' but also we hear anti-Iraq war and anti-\n     surge overtones. If Congress and the American public truly \n     support the troops then they must provide the full support. \n     It is incoherent and irresponsible to say one supports the \n     troops but not the war. How can Congress on one hand \n     unanimously approve the appointment of General Petraeus to \n     command the troops in Iraq and execute the war plan and, \n     at the same time, refuse to support the war effort and \n     provide resolutions restricting the necessary troops and \n     wherewithal to accomplish the task they have assigned to \n     him? This simply does not pass the common sense test. It \n     is simply a cop out!\n       Summarization--America cannot win a counter-insurgency \n     campaign in a Muslim territory as long as it is ruled by \n     Muslims. That is why the effort must be led by the Muslims \n     (Iraq) in order to win their own counter-insurgency campaign. \n     Absolutely, we must assist them and apply more forces but the \n     Iraqi leaders are the ones who have to gain the confidence of \n     the populace as well as subdue and disassemble the militias, \n     particularly that of Al Sadr. If Maliki and his government do \n     not take the lead and insist on the breakup of the militias \n     then we are wasting our time, soldier's lives and billions of \n     dollars to help reconstruct that country. The world is \n     watching to see what course of action Maliki takes and \n     whether we will continue to provide support. If this fails we \n     will have least tried to make it work. I don't know how long \n     we continue this support--probably a year to eighteen months \n     to see if it is going to work and then decide if it is being \n     successful or not. If not, then we execute a strategic \n     withdrawal removing our troops, equipment, and supplies. \n     Concurrently we must have made plans for dealing with the \n     aftermath of our withdrawal--a point which no politicians are \n     talking about right now. This action will embolden Iran and \n     Syria plus others and then the ``global'' terrorist and \n     economic problems will start to build. The predictions of \n     all-out civil war will prevail and the spill-over to adjacent \n     countries will most likely occur. How will the United States \n     address this situation Madam Speaker of the House/Mr. \n     President of the Senate?\n\n\n   Probable Scenario following a Collapse of Iraqi Government and US \n                               Withdrawal\n\n       ``Responsible'' Middle East experts say that if we withdraw \n     it will be a blood bath to start with and then the ``Middle \n     East region'' will turn into a haven for terrorists that will \n     be controlled by Iran and Syria--primarily Iran--all under \n     the guise of Islam and in preparation for the return of the \n     12th Imam. This in turn will cause our quasi Arab friends, \n     Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait (and perhaps a few others) to \n     begin making alliances with Iran in fear for their own \n     country and lives therein.\n       Then, guess what? Terrorism will spread like wild fire and \n     Iran et al will now control the majority of the world oil \n     reserves (which can be used for terrorist activities) and the \n     rest of the world will start experiencing an economic \n     disaster just over the price of oil. One may rest assured \n     that President Chavez in Venezuela will chime right in there \n     with them and raise the price of his oil as well.\n       The OPEC will be overtaken by Iran et al and the free world \n     will have no choice but to, most likely, use military force \n     to sort this out--assuming the free world has the will and \n     determination to do so. The free world would have no leverage \n     via the UN to do anything in respect to sanctions against \n     Iran et al as they would just thumb their nose at them. It is \n     a ``pay me now or pay me later'' situation and it appears at \n     present that Congress and much of the American public are \n     just sticking their heads in the sand and hoping it will all \n     go away. We continue to debate the overwhelming importance of \n     oil. Unfortunately, our efforts to find substitutes will not \n     pay off in a big way for most likely another 15-20 years.\n       A stronger and more pointed discussion needs to occur in \n     this country relative to the radical/militant Islamists. Our \n     enemy is not only terrorists. Terrorism is a symptom, not the \n     basic cause. Our true enemy is radical or militant Islam and \n     their goals and objectives are to take over the world by \n     jihad and impose on EVERYONE their beliefs, which include \n     living by the law of Shari'a under their interpretation of \n     the Koran. Daniel Pipes said, ``The problem at hand is not \n     the religion of Islam but the totalitarian ideology of \n     militant Islam. Islam is one of the world's major religions \n     in terms of duration, extent, and numbers of adherents; as a \n     faith, it has meant very different things over fourteen \n     centuries and several continents. Two common points one can \n     note are that: Islam is, more than any other major religion, \n     deeply political in the sense that it pushes its adherents to \n     hold power; and once Muslims gain power, there is a strong \n     impetus to apply the law of Islam, the Shari'a.'' There is no \n     separation of Church and State. Under their belief they are \n     one in the same.\n       Anyone who has any knowledge about the Islamic goals and \n     objectives knows full well that they are not going away and \n     will continue their pursuit to control the entire world and \n     have it under the Islamic law/religion and, in the meantime, \n     kill us infidels along the way. We have been told that Islam \n     is the religion of peace, and that the vast majority of \n     Muslims just want to live in peace. Although this unqualified \n     assertion may be true, it is entirely irrelevant. It is \n     meaningless fluff, meant to make us feel better, and meant to \n     somehow diminish the specter of fanatics rampaging across the \n     globe in the name of Islam. The fact is, in the Middle East, \n     the fanatics rule Islam at this moment in history. The \n     ``peaceful majority'' is the ``silent majority'' and it is \n     cowed and extraneous. Peace-loving Muslims have been made \n     irrelevant by their silence. Not a pretty picture at all!!\n\n\n    consequences of currently proposed actions need to be revisited\n\n       The proposed Congressional alternatives of capping the \n     number of troops, cutting off funds for the war, withdrawal \n     within six months or a year or sending our troops to \n     ``control the borders and search out terrorists but don't get \n     involved in Baghdad'' is irrational thinking. If that is what \n     they think we should be doing then we should withdraw \n     completely now and turn the country over to these radical \n     Islamists, terrorists, thugs and criminals and let them kill \n     each other off and watch Iran come in behind us and take \n     control. Then, watch Congress and the American public howl \n     and complain about how ``we lost the war.'' Sometime later \n     this would come back to haunt us here in the US when we \n     start having our fair share of terrorists attacks and \n     encroachment of radical Islamists on our soil.\n\n\n                             So, Now What?\n\n       I submit that in lieu of the defeatist attitude shown by so \n     many in the Congress and the media, that this is no time to \n     feel desperate. What we need is a sense of mission, a \n     purposeful dynamism. General Petraeus will be issuing a \n     progress report on Iraq every two weeks. He'll report on what \n     progress we are having on de-Baathification, disarming the \n     Shia militias, on taking the fight to the bad guys in a very \n     methodical way.\n       To lose this war is to lose our soul, the soul of our \n     country, the soul of America. If we lose in Iraq, it is \n     inevitable that the terrorists and radical Islamists will be \n     here. The war will come to our shores and threaten the \n     freedoms we so dearly cherish. It is not too late to resolve \n     to win instead. We still have an enormously strong hand to \n     play and we must play it.\n       The alternative of pursuing the President's proposal is the \n     only viable alternative we have at present time. The \n     Brookings Institute recent report states: ``If there is \n     anything that should make us recognize the need to stay \n     engaged in Iraq, it is the likely impact that such a war \n     could have on the Persian Gulf region (if not the entire \n     Middle East) and the enormous difficulties we will face in \n     trying to contain that impact. If we cannot prevent such a \n     full-scale civil war, then containment, as awful as it \n     threatens to be, might still prove to be our least bad \n     options.''\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, earlier this week the Senate had an \nopportunity to begin debate on Iraq and the current plan proposed by \nPresident Bush. While I and 48 of my colleagues supported moving \nforward with this important debate, others in this Chamber elected to \nprevent discussion on an issue of national importance.\n  I understand that there are doubts as to what is the proper course of \naction to pursue in Iraq. We all wish for victory. We all wish for an \nend to the death and destruction. None of us want to waste additional \nlives in futile missions, or futile gestures. We all wish for a stable, \ndemocratic Iraq--and I would add to that Afghanistan, as this conflict \nis being waged on more than one front. We all share those common \ndesires and none of us, none of us can predict the future. But what we \ncan do is to apply our wisdom and judgement as to what is the best \ncourse of action for the United States to take. That task is our solemn \nduty.\n  We cannot perform that duty with all the honesty and clarity that \nthis great body--the United States Senate--is known for if we cannot \nbegin debate. Denying an open discussion of the issues of grave \nimportance to our national security does not serve our Nation well.\n  We are at a great turning point and the consequences of this policy \nmust be debated. Future generations will be affected by the course of \naction our Nation takes in the Middle East. No one can say with \ncertainty which path will lead us toward light and which could lead us \ntoward a darker future. But these courses of action demand debate.\n  Right now our Nation's wealth is being poured into a growing \nmaelstrom in the Middle East--a storm that is engulfing the lives of \nour most talented soldiers, a storm that is exhausting our national \ntreasure and sinking us deeper into a debt that our grandchildren and \ngreat-grandchildren will be paying off. It means our Nation's \neducation, environment, health, and transportation\n\n[[Page S1706]]\n\nsystems are eroding for a lack of basic resources.\n  Again, the consequences of this policy must be debated. In Iraq, \nthere is a clear choice: support the President's policy of full steam \nahead and continue the current policy of putting American soldiers in \nharm's way or shift strategy and make it clear that it is time for the \nIraqi government to govern and Iraqi troops to protect the Iraqi \npeople.\n  In any case, whatever policy advocated--whether one supports staying \nin, getting out now, or getting out later--those choices deserve to be \nfully and completely debated and voted on in the United States Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side to support a full and open \ndebate on the President's Iraq policy.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding we are now in \nexecutive session; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

McCONNELL TO BE DNI\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today the Senate has confirmed the \nnomination of VADM Mike McConnell to be the next Director of National \nIntelligence. It is hard for me to imagine a better choice than Admiral \nMcConnell.\n  The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence received Admiral \nMcConnell's nomination to replace John Negroponte on January 22, 2007. \nHe completed all the requisite paperwork and the committee held a \nhearing with Admiral McConnell on February 1. The committee met on \nFebruary 6, and voted unanimously to report the nomination to the \nSenate with a favorable recommendation.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has moved quickly to act on this \nrecommendation. I think this swift consideration of the nomination is \nrecognition of both the importance of this position and of the \nqualifications of Admiral McConnell.\n  As my colleagues know, the position of Director of National \nIntelligence was created by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \nPrevention Act 2004. That legislation drew on recommendations from the \ncongressional and commission reports on the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the \nSenate Intelligence Committee report on Iraq prewar intelligence, the \nReport of the Joint Inquiry by the House and Senate Intelligence \nCommittees into the events of 9/11, and the recommendations of numerous \nother commissions and reviews going back 50 years.\n  The creation of the DNI was an important step. We now have, for the \nfirst time, an individual whose primary job is to run the intelligence \ncommunity as a whole. Until the creation of the DNI, the old Director \nof Central Intelligence wore two hats--as the head of the Intelligence \nCommunity and as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. But \nthis structural change, while important, was only the first step to \nreforming intelligence. The DNI must make the 16 agencies of the \nintelligence community work as one toward a common goal. Director \nNegroponte has started the community down that path. It is going to be \nup to Admiral McConnell to move us further along.\n  A quick review of his resume will show even the casual observer that \nAdmiral McConnell is incredibly well qualified for this critical \nposition. He retired from the Navy as Vice Admiral after 29 years of \nservice. Most of his service during this distinguished career was as an \nintelligence officer.\n  While on active duty he served as Director of Intelligence on the \nJoint Staff during the Persian Gulf War. This made him the principal \nintelligence advisor to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, GEN Colin \nPowell. He went on to become the Director of the National Security \nAgency, our Nation's largest intelligence agency.\n  Upon retiring from the Navy, Admiral McConnell went to work for Booz \nAllen Hamilton where he has been a senior vice president for \nintelligence and national security. He also is currently chairman and \nchief executive officer of the Intelligence and National Security \nAlliance, an industry group that works with the Government looking for \nways to solve some of our complex intelligence problems. He has the \nrequisite Government experience supplemented by a decade in the private \nsector.\n  In his appearance before the Intelligence Committee last week I think \nit is fair to say that he impressed all members of the committee with \nhis knowledge of the issues and the difficulty of the task ahead. But I \nwas particularly encouraged by his answers to questions about the \nrelationship with Congress.\n  It is no secret that I have not always been happy with the level of \naccess the intelligence committee has had to materials it needs to do \nits job. On some of the most important and sensitive programs in the \nIntelligence Community, we have been frustrated in our attempts to do \noversight because we have\n\n[[Page S1707]]\n\nnot been able to get documents and other information critical to \nunderstanding and therefore evaluating these programs. In other cases \nthe administration has placed burdensome and unwarranted limits on \naccess by Senators and staff.\n  Vice Chairman Bond and I are making a concerted bipartisan effort to \ndeal with these questions. And we are making headway. One issue that we \nboth raised with Admiral McConnell at his hearing has now been \nresolved. We also have seen movement, if not complete satisfaction, in \nother areas. Admiral McConnell's answers convinced me that he will be \nan ally in this area. It is my view that the intelligence community \nneeds to view Congress as a partner in supporting intelligence \nactivities that protect America and I think he will do that.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for supporting support the confirmation \nof Admiral McConnell and I look forward to working with him in his new \nrole as Director of National Intelligence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/07/senate-section/article/S1707-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to recognize Rear Admiral \nCharles ``Charlie'' S. Hamilton, upon the completion of his current \ntour of duty as the Program Executive Officer, Ships, PEO Ships. Since \nassuming the position nearly 4 years ago, Rear Admiral Hamilton has \nworked with Congress on numerous issues of vital importance to our Navy \nand our Nation. His successes and accomplishments have been significant \nand many. Rear Admiral Hamilton has earned my deep respect and that of \nmy colleagues through his exceptional competence, integrity, and innate \nability to cut through bureaucracy in order to get the job done. Today, \nit is my pleasure to recognize some of Rear Admiral Hamilton's many \naccomplishments, and commend his service to the Navy, the Congress, and \nour grateful Nation.\n  Rear Admiral Hamilton was born in Amityville, NY. He entered military \nservice in 1974 as an ensign after receiving a bachelor of science \ndegree in Zoology from Duke University where he was a member of the \nNavy ROTC program. He continued his education at the Naval Post \nGraduate School, where he earned a master of arts degree in national \nsecurity affairs, and at the National War College, where he earned a \nmaster of science degree in national security strategy. He is also a \ngraduate of the Defense Systems Management College, and a designated \nsurface warfare officer and joint specialty officer.\n  Rear Admiral Hamilton served in a variety of assignments at sea, \nwhere he consistently excelled as a leader of the highest caliber. His \npositions included combat information center officer aboard USS \nHawkins, DD 873, mission fire control officer aboard USS Coontz, DDG \n40, and operations officer aboard USS Callaghan, DDG 994. In September \n1986, he became the executive officer aboard USS Fox, CG 33, where his \nleadership played a key role in the success of Operation Earnest Will, \nensuring the safe passage of tankers and merchant vessels during the \nfiercest days of the Iran-Iraq conflict. In February 1991, he assumed \ncommand of USS O'Brien, DD 975, where he was hailed by his subordinates \nand superiors for his extraordinary leadership.\n  Rear Admiral Hamilton has also excelled in a variety of key staff \npositions, where he helped define and execute key elements of our \nnational security strategy. These assignments included serving as the \narsenal ship program manager; head of the Fleet Introduction and \nLifetime Support Directorate, program executive officer for Theater \nSurface Combatants; two tours with the Office of the Chief of Naval \nOperations as Anti-Submarine Warfare Program analyst, OP-91, and Head \nof the AEGIS Destroyer Section, OP-355. He also served in the Office of \nthe Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology as \nmilitary staff specialist for naval warfare.\n  On May 15, 2003, Rear Admiral Hamilton assumed command of PEO Ships, \nthen a newly established organization responsible for acquisition and \nsupport of the Navy's entire nonnuclear surface fleet, including boats \nand craft, special mission ships, and foreign military sales. In this \ncapacity, he skillfully planned and executed current and future \nshipbuilding programs that will carry our surface Navy well into the \n21st century.\n  During his tenure, 16 major surface ships were delivered to the U.S. \nNavy and 300 boats and craft were delivered to U.S. and foreign navies. \nTo place that in perspective, it is my understanding that Rear Admiral \nHamilton successfully shepherded the design and construction of more \ntypes of new ships than has ever been accomplished under a single flag \nofficer since the passage of the Naval Act of 1794. These new classes \nof surface ships included San Antonio, LPD 17, Lewis and Clark, T-AKE \n1, Makin Island LHD 8; Freedom, LCS 1, and Zumwalt, DDG 1000, classes \nof ships.\n  In addition, he tirelessly strove to facilitate the realistic \nconsideration of next-generation architectures as well as ship concepts \nsuch as maritime prepositioning force future, MPFF, Mobile Landing \nPlatform, MLP, and joint high speed vessel, JHSV. Rear Admiral \nHamilton's extraordinary legacy of service will be clearly reflected \nnot only in the improved warfighting capability of this Nation, but \nalso in the safety, readiness, and quality of life of our sailors and \nmarines.\n  On the eve of Rear Admiral Hamilton's change of command ceremony, I \noffer my congratulations to him, his wife Debbie and his children Chip, \nMike, and Christina. Rear Admiral Hamilton will be greatly missed, and \nI know I speak for all my colleagues in expressing our heartfelt \nappreciation to him. He is a man of extraordinary honor, courage, and \ncommitment, who always shot straight regardless of risk or possible \nperil. He is a credit to both the Navy and the United States of \nAmerica. We wish our friend the best of luck in future endeavors, and \ncongratulate him on the successful completion of an unprecedented tour \nof duty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/07/senate-section/article/S1707-4", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1707-S1708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Madam President, today I ask the Senate to join me \nin recognizing Dr. Dennis Merrell on the occasion of his retirement \nfrom York Technical College in Rock Hill, SC. Dr. Merrell officially \nstepped down last week as president of York Tech following over 30 \nyears of service at the vocational college. For the last seventeen of \nthose thirty years, Dr. Merrell led York Tech as the school's \npresident. He leaves York Tech having transformed the college into a \npowerful source of economic development and manufacturing workforce \ncreation for South Carolina and the country.\n  After serving 2 years in the military, Dr. Merrell earned a \nbachelor's degree in business and computer science from Winthrop \nUniversity and a master's degree in computer science from Virginia \nTech. He joined the faculty at York Tech to teach computer technology \nand programming in 1976 and in time became chair of the Computer \nTechnology Division. Eventually Dr. Merrell was named the college's \nVice President of Instruction. He served in that capacity until he was \nappointed president of the school in 1989 following the death of his \npredecessor, Dr. Baxter Hood.\n  To deliver true quality technical education, Dr. Merrell understood \nthat York Tech would need to rely on resources outside of those \nprovided by State and local government. To that end, Dr. Merrell \ndeveloped a culture of industry partnerships from which the school has \ntremendously benefited during his tenure. Under Dr. Merrell's \nleadership, enrollment in the college's continuing education programs \nnearly doubled. Six buildings including a child development center, \nlibrary, student services building, continuing education center, \ninstitute for manufacturing productivity, and science and technology \nbuilding were all constructed on Dr. Merrell's watch. Construction on a \nnew economic development training center is also currently underway--\nthe product of a collaboration with 3D Systems Corporation.\n  Like the relationship with 3D Systems, Dr. Merrell also championed \npartnerships with regional construction companies and other \nmanufacturing businesses to address practical job-training issues. In \nthe last year, York Tech has also joined with utility companies and \ncontractors in the Carolinas to help meet the growing need for entry-\nlevel line workers in the region. For efforts like these York Tech was \nrecognized as a Bellweather Awards Finalist in 2006 for its unique \napproach to industry alliances. The United States Department of \nEducation has even acknowledged York Tech for its innovative approach \nto meeting the local and national workforce needs in the area of \nmanufacturing.\n  Dr. Merrell even promoted distance learning, namely online \ninstruction, allowing countless students the opportunity to reach \neducational goals without giving up their jobs. As such the American \nAssociation of Community Colleges named York Tech the number one \ndigital-savvy college among the country's largest and urban community \ncolleges.\n  Dr. Merrell's community service outside of his work at York Tech \nincludes leadership roles at the Rock Hill and York County Economic \nDevelopment Boards, the Rock Hill Rotary Board, the Charlotte Area \nEducation Consortium Board, and the York County Red Cross Board, among \na host of other technical education organizations.\n  York Tech is sure to miss Dr. Merrell's leadership and vision, but I \nam confident that the school will build on his impressive legacy. In \nconclusion, I ask that the Senate join me in wishing Dr. Merrell a \nhealthy and happy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/07/senate-section/article/S1708-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN RECOGNITION OF FLOWERS FOODS\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, today I wish to recognize \nFlowers Foods of Thomasville, GA, which has just been named by Forbes \nmagazine as this year's ``Best-Managed'' publicly traded food company. \nThis honor comes on top of a record fourth quarter and a record year \nfor Flowers Foods.\n  Flowers Foods has clearly set a standard of excellence for which all \nof us should strive.

Madam President, I join my colleagues in \nsaluting Richard H. Shapiro, the executive director of the \nCongressional Management Foundation. As Rick moves on to new \nchallenges, I want to thank him for his remarkable service to the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Rick Shapiro is responsible for bringing 21st century management \nskills to an institution build on 18th century rules and practices. We \nstill have spittoons in the Senate--yet we also have blackberries.\n  Rick Shapiro helped us wrestle with issues that our Founding Fathers \ndidn't even dream about. How do you answer thousands of e-mails a week? \nHow do you hire, train, and retain excellent staff? How do you set \ngoals and measure progress--so that promises made can be promises kept? \nHow do you ensure that state and Washington offices communicate, \ncoordinate and cooperate? Whenever I had a question about managing my \noffice, I turned to Rick Shapiro--and my staff did the same.\n  Under Rick Shapiro's leadership, the Congressional Management \nFoundation has helped Members to set up their offices, upgrade office \nsystems, and adjust to new ways of connecting with constituents. His \nbook ``Setting Course'' is a must-read for all new Members of Congress. \nHe was the first to compile and analyze information from individual \noffices--to enable Senators to learn from the best practices of others.\n  Rick Shapiro is a part of our Senate family. In fact, he met his wife \nTrudy Vincent when she was my legislative director. Their daughter Abby \nhas been spotted selling Girl Scout cookies around the Capitol.\n  Rick Shapiro has made a lasting impact on the U.S. Senate. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in thanking him for his service. While he is \nstepping down from the Congressional Management Foundation, I look \nforward to great things from Rick in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/07/senate-section/article/S1708-4", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/07/senate-section/article/S1708-5", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1708-S1709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S1709]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/07/senate-section/article/S1708-5", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1708-S1709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S1709]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/07/senate-section/article/S1709-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:11 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 161.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 510. A bill to specify that the 100 most populous urban areas of \nthe United States, as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security, \nshall be eligible for grants under the Urban Area Security Initiative \nof the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Urban Area \nSecurity Initiative Improvement Act,'' which addresses eligibility for \nthe Department of Homeland Security's Urban Area Security Initiative \n(UASI) grant program.\n  This bill will improve the existing grant award process by broadening \nthe number of urban areas eligible to apply. In Fiscal Year 06, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security made arbitrary decisions about areas' \nneed for homeland security funding, threatening the eligibility of \neleven worthy areas to apply for future grants.\n  The eligibility of Sacramento and San Diego, in my State of \nCalifornia, were threatened in this way. Sacramento is the capital of \nthe most populous State in the Nation and home to\n\n[[Page S1711]]\n\ndozens of critical Federal and State government buildings. In addition, \nmuch of the State's water, electricity, and telecommunication systems \nare managed from Sacramento. The San Diego area contains the Nation's \nseventh-largest city adjacent to a heavily trafficked international \nborder, a busy port, tourist attractions, and major military \ninstallations.\n  My bill would ensure that the 100 most populous urban areas of the \ncountry are eligible to apply for UASI grants each year. The Department \nof Homeland Security would then have the discretion to award funds to \nas many applicants as it deems worthy and needy.\n  The bill would also require that the Department employ a \n``sensitivity analysis'' in its grant process, to deal with uncertainty \nin the mathematical models that it uses to evaluate the risk of \nterrorism for urban areas. The Department's leadership could make \nbetter-informed policy decisions if it used a sensitivity analysis to \nbetter understand the effects of policy judgments in estimating risk \neach year.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider and pass this bill, with its \nimportant implications for making our Nation more secure against \nterrorism.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. \n        Lieberman):\n  S. 511. A bill to provide student borrowers with basic rights, \nincluding the right to timely information about their loans and the \nright to make fair and reasonable loan payments, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \ngive rights to student borrowers. The Student Borrower Bill of Rights \nAct will provide student borrowers with five basic rights to protect \nthem when trying to repay their loans.\n  Students are borrowing now more than ever to pay for higher \neducation. Need-based grant aid has stagnated while college costs have \ngrown, resulting in more students borrowing and at higher levels. In \n1993, less than one-half of students graduating from 4-year colleges \nand universities had student loans. Now two-thirds are faced with this \ndebt.\n  Unlike other debt, young people take out student loans to invest in \nthemselves. Because these loans help to pay for college, student loans \ncan help people earn more money over the course of their lifetimes and \noffer students greater choices in their careers. Student borrowers must \ntake the responsibility of repaying their debt seriously so that future \ngenerations of students can have the chance to invest in themselves.\n  However, too many borrowers in New York, and around the country, are \noverly burdened or treated unfairly as they repay their student loans. \nThat is why I am introducing the Student Borrower's Bill of Rights Act.\n  This bill will make it easier for students to repay loans and give \nthem a basic set of enforceable rights. This bill would give student \nborrowers the right to fair monthly payments that do not exceed a \npercentage of their incomes, as well as access to fair interest rates \nand fees. This bill would also give students the right to shop in a \nfree marketplace for their lender and to borrow without exploitation. \nFinally, the bill will give students access to better information about \ntheir loans to provide students with better options during repayment.\n  The unfortunate truth is that student loan debt may even prevent \nborrowers from pursuing a higher degree. According to the Nellie Mae \nCorporation, 40 percent of college graduates cite alarming student loan \ndebt as the reason for not pursuing a graduate degree. Most \ndisturbingly, the burden of student loan debt alone can force graduates \nout of important, but low-paying professions, such as social workers, \nteachers and police officers. Our Nation cannot remain competitive in \nthe global economy if these trends continue.\n  I am happy to report that two of the provisions from the Student \nBorrower Bill of Rights Act of the 109th Congress were enacted into law \nthrough the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense 2006. \nThese provisions, a repeal of the single holder rule and consolidation \nbetween loan programs, will enable borrowers to choose lenders with \nacceptable income-sensitive repayment terms when consolidating student \nloans.\n  We need to make sure that student loans do not prevent students from \nfollowing their dreams. It is in our Nation's economic interest to \nprovide student borrowers with effective rights to make repayment of \nstudent loans easier.\n  The rights found in my bill are long overdue. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting the Student Borrower Bill of Rights.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 512. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to study \nthe feasibility of enlaring the Arthur V. Watkins Dam Weber Basin \nProject, Utah, to provide additional water for the Weber Basin Project \nto fulfill the purposes for which that project was authorized; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, not long ago, Utahns suffered a long and \ndevastating drought, from which we have not fully recovered. The \ndrought has instilled in us the need to plan for the future and ensure \nsound management of our water resources. For that reason, I rise to \nintroduce an important bill that will help make better use of Utah's \nscarce water supply.\n  The Arthur V. Watkins Dam Enlargement Act of 2007 would authorize the \nBureau of Reclamation to conduct a feasibility study on raising the \nheight of the Arthur V. Watkins Dam in Weber County. The bill would \ngive the Bureau of Reclamation access to the dam to study it and make \nadjustments as necessary to cater to the ever growing needs of Utah \ncitizens. This is no ordinary dam. It is roughly 14 miles long and \nencloses a reservoir containing more than 200,000 acre-feet of water.\n  Thousands of Utahns rely on the water provided by the reservoir. And \nthe Weber Basin is one of Utah's fastest growing areas, making the need \nto find additional water resources even more pressing. In my view, \nexpanding the dam is a simple and inexpensive way to increase water \nstorage capacity in an area that desperately needs it.\n  Moreover, last year, the Watkins Dam began to leak slightly. If the \ndam were to breach, it would flood many hundreds of acres of farm and \ngrazing land, which would spell an agricultural disaster. This \nlegislation would provide the resources and the opportunity to address \nquickly that looming problem, as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 512\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Arthur V. Watkins Dam \n     Enlargement Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Arthur V. Watkins Dam is a feature of the Weber Basin \n     Project, which was authorized by law on August 29, 1949.\n       (2) Increasing the height of Arthur V. Watkins Dam and \n     construction of pertinent facilities may provide additional \n     storage capacity for the development of additional water \n     supply for the Weber Basin Project for uses of municipal and \n     industrial water supply, flood control, fish and wildlife, \n     and\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF FEASIBILITY STUDY.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of \n     Reclamation, is authorized to conduct a feasibility study on \n     raising the height of Arthur V. Watkins Dam for the \n     development of additional storage to meet water supply needs \n     within the Weber Basin Project area and the Wasatch Front. \n     The feasibility study shall include such environmental \n     evaluation as required under the National Environmental \n     Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and a cost \n     allocation as required under the Reclamation Project Act of \n     1939 (43 U.S.C. 485 et seq.).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 513. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to revive \nprevious authority on the use of the Armed Forces and the militia to \naddress interference with State and Federal law, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last year, Congress quietly made it easier \nfor this\n\n[[Page S1712]]\n\nPresident or any President to declare martial law. That's right: In \nlegislation added at the Administration's request to last year's \nmassive Defense Authorization Bill, it has now become easier to bypass \nlongtime posse comitatus restrictions that prevent the Federal \nGovernment's use of the military, including a federalized National \nGuard, to perform domestic law enforcement duties. That change runs \ncounter to our founding principles, to the optimal use of our superb \nNational Guard here at home, and to whatever sensible reforms are \nneeded to improve our Nation's emergency response capabilities.\n  Today Senator Bond and I are introducing legislation to repeal these \nunwarranted and perilous changes, which were made to a little-known law \ncalled the Insurrection Act. Our amendment replaces every word, comma, \nand period from the original act and returns it to its original form. \nRepealing this ill-considered change in the Insurrection Act would \nallow Congress to have a more orderly, thoughtful, open and \nconsultative discussion on whether such sensitive and massive powers \nshould be changed, if at all. It is difficult to see how any Senator \ncould disagree with the advisability of having a more transparent and \nthoughtful approach to this sensitive issue.\n  The Insurrection Act is a Reconstruction-era law that provides the \nmajor exemption from posse comitatus--the legal doctrine that bars the \nuse of the military for law enforcement directed at the American people \nhere at home. The Insurrection Act is designed to ensure that Federal \nlaws are enforced and to ensure that American citizens' basic \nconstitutional rights are respected and protected. When the \nInsurrection Act is invoked, the President can--without the consent of \nthe respective governors--federalize the National Guard and use it, \nalong with the entire military, to carry out law enforcement duties. \nTreading as this does across basic constitutional issues relating to \nseparation of power and to state and local sovereignty, this is a \nsweeping grant of authority to the President. Because the use of the \nmilitary for domestic law enforcement is so sensitive an issue, the Act \nhas been invoked only sparingly since it was enacted.\n  The primary reason that the law has been invoked so rarely is that \nthere has been an inherent tension in the way it was crafted. Before it \nwas changed last year, the law was purposefully ambiguous about when \nthe President could invoke the Act in cases beyond a clear insurrection \nor when a state clearly violated Federal law in its actions. Because \nthere was this useful ambiguity--a constructive friction in the law--a \nPresident until now would have to use the power with great caution, and \nwith the impetus for appropriate consultation.\n  Yet by the time committee work was completed in the House and the \nSenate on the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Authorization Bill, the law had \nbeen changed and that useful ambiguity had vanished. In addition to the \ncases of insurrection, the Act can now be invoked to restore public \norder after a terrorist attack, a natural disaster, a disease outbreak, \nor--and this is extremely broad--``other condition.'' Restoring public \norder has suddenly become an entirely new purpose for the Insurrection \nAct. And, as if to underscore this fundamental change, the conference \ncommittee changed the name of the Act from ``Insurrection'' to \n``Enforcement of the Laws to Restore Public Order.''\n  This significant change was made without consulting the Nation's \nGovernors, mayors, sheriffs, or the National Guard Adjutants General. \nIt was made without consulting the other relevant policy committees in \nthe Senate and the House. It was merely slipped in, at the \nAdministration's request, as rider to a bill that was hundreds of pages \nlong. And when the Nation's Governors learned of the change and \nexpressed their strong opposition, they were ignored, and this \nfacilitation of presidential ability to federalize the National Guard--\neven over the objections of the Nation's Governors--remained in the \nbill that was signed into law by President Bush.\n  Now this President and future Presidents can more easily take control \nof the National Guard and use our entire military apparatus for law \nenforcement at home. In a situation like another Katrina or even a more \ncontained incident like a terrorist incident, the President will be \nable to bring in Federal troops and take away control from the \nGovernors, the Emergency Managers, the Sheriffs, and the State \nAdjutants General who know their communities best and are responsible \nfor responding.\n  What we should be doing instead is buttressing the response abilities \nof these local and State officials. We should ensure every State has a \nstate-of-the-art emergency operations center, that our first responders \nhave the best equipment and training, and that the National Guard has \nadequate equipment and available people at home to provide support. Any \nFederal assets--military or otherwise--that might come into a State \nshould be in a supporting and not commanding role. The local officials \nwho know their communities are in the best positions to control the \nsituation, not the President or the military.\n  Some have argued that the changes made were only a clarification of \nexisting law or that the Insurrection Act already gave the power to the \nPresident to use the military for law enforcement in an emergency. I \nstrongly disagree with that explanation, and so do the Governors, \nAdjutants General, and a host of other officials. They see it, as \nSenator Bond and I see it, as a tangible and troubling expansion of the \nPresident's powers and a parallel reduction in State sovereignty. But \nif some believe the original Act already gave the President this \nexpansive power, they should not object to bringing the law back to its \noriginal form.\n  Repeal of the recent changes to the Insurrection Act will help ensure \nthat our National Guard and larger emergency response capabilities \nremain strong. Repeal is crucial to ensuring that our Governors and \nlocal officials remain in control and that they are consulted when \nanyone considers overriding their authority. Repeal is simply essential \nto ensuring the military is not used in a way that offends and \nendangers some of our more cherished values and liberties.\n  We enter this effort with the strong support of Governors and of the \nNational Guard community, including the National Governors Association, \nthe National Guard Association, the Adjutants General Association, and \nthe Enlisted Association of the National Guard. I ask unanimous consent \nthat support letters from the National Governors Association, the \nAdjutants General Association, and the Enlisted Association of the \nNational Guard be printed at this point in the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Last year's Insurrection Act rider reflects the general lack of close \noversight that has taken a toll on our system of government. I hope the \ndays of rubberstamping are over, and I hope the Senate will quickly \nremedy this situation by considering and passing the bill that we \nintroduce today.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     National Guard Association of\n\n\n                                      the United States, Inc.,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Bond: The National Guard \n     Association of the United States (NGAUS) is pleased to \n     support your efforts to repeal those provisions of Section \n     1076 of the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act \n     (Public Law 109-364) enacted in the 109th Congress.\n       We believe those provisions removed the governors of the \n     several states from their constitutional role as the \n     commanders in chief of their respective states' National \n     Guard forces in responding to domestic emergencies, in both \n     an unnecessary and unwarranted manner.\n       We further believe that the exploitation of the language of \n     the Insurrection Act as a surreptitious method to gain \n     special presidential authority where clearly the Congress has \n     never intended the federal executive to hold sway is \n     ``creative'' but ``poor'' public policy. Please spare no \n     effort to reverse this dangerous precedent.\n       Thank you for your reasoned and forthright protection of \n     the prerogatives of the governors and the National Guard.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Stephen M. Koper,\n\n                                          Brigadier General (Ret),\n                                                        President.\n\n[[Page S1713]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 5, 2007.\n     Hon.Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christopher ``Kit'' Bond,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy and Senator Bond: Section 1076 of the \n     John Warner National Defense Authorization Act (Public Law \n     109-364) unnecessarily expanded the President's authority to \n     federalize the National Guard during certain emergencies and \n     disasters. The nation's governors opposed the inclusion of \n     this section in the bill because responsibility for \n     responding to disasters and other local emergencies to assure \n     the security and wellbeing of our residents along; with \n     managing the Guard within a state must rest with the \n     governor. The changes made in Section 1076 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act undermine governors' authority over \n     the Guard, place the safety and welfare of citizens in \n     jeopardy and should be repealed.\n       Unless activated in purely federal service, the National \n     Guard is and should remain under state control with governors \n     as commanders-in-chief. The dual mission of the Guard, a \n     combat ready force that can be called on by the President and \n     a first responder in domestic emergencies or disasters under \n     the command and control of the governor, requires that \n     federal law clearly delineate chains of command for each \n     mission. The changes made to the ``Insurrection Act'' by \n     Section 1076 of the National Defense Authorization Act are \n     likely to confuse the issue of who commands the Guard during \n     a domestic emergency. By granting the President specific \n     authority to usurp the Guard during a natural disaster or \n     emergency without the consent of a governor, Section 1076 \n     could result in confusion and an inability to respond to \n     residents' needs because it calls into question whether the \n     governor or the President has primary responsibility during a \n     domestic emergency.\n       The Insurrection Act, prior to passage of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act served the nation well as an \n     extraordinary remedy that allowed the President to take \n     control of the Guard in the most rare and exceptional of \n     cases. Despite the role of governors as commander-in-chief of \n     the Guard in their states, Section 1076 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act was drafted without consultation \n     with governors and without full discussion or debate \n     regarding the ramifications of such a change on domestic \n     emergency response. We urge Congress to repeal the provision \n     in Section 1076 of the Act and open a dialogue with governors \n     regarding how to best enhance the effectiveness of the Guard \n     in responding to domestic disasters and emergencies.\n       Sincerely,\n     Governor Michael F. Easley,\n       Co-Lead on the National Guard.\n     Governor Mark Sanford,\n       Co-Lead on the National Guard.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n           Adjutants General Association of the United States,\n\n                           Washington, DC. 2001, February 7, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Kit Bond,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       The Adjutants General Association of the United States \n     (AGAUS) represents the 54 Adjutants General of the fifty \n     states, three territories, and District of Columbia who are \n     responsible for training and readiness of Army and Air \n     National Guard units under their jurisdiction. We are united \n     in support of your legislation that repeals all language \n     contained in the John Warner National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2007 that significantly altered existing \n     law known as the Insurrection Act.\n       The language in the NDAA seriously upset the delicate \n     balance between Governors and the President in determining \n     the authority under which the National Guard will be used to \n     respond to domestic conditions endangering citizens. The \n     language significantly broadens the President ability to \n     declare martial law and mobilize the National Guard under \n     national command without consulting with the Governors. It \n     may in fact cause factions to pressure the President into ill \n     advised actions because the constructive ambiguity of the \n     original language which encourages consultation with \n     Governors no longer exists. For the National Guard this can \n     mean being federalized prematurely thereby losing important \n     capabilities available under State Active Duty and Title 32.\n       The National Guard has proven capable of operating flexibly \n     and responsively when retained under governor control. This \n     is well documented from the airport security mission in the \n     aftermath of 9/11 to sending 6,000 National Guard Soldiers \n     and Airmen to the southwest border in 2006 (with over 50,000 \n     citizen-soldiers rapidly deployed under EMAC and Title 32 to \n     support Hurricane Katrina recovery sandwiched in between). \n     The language in NDAA 2207 would likely discourage using the \n     National Guard in these innovative, responsive, and cost \n     effective ways.\n       NDAA 2007 enabled something completely unnecessary without \n     committee or floor debate in either legislative chamber and \n     with explicit opposition from the Governors. Your bill \n     restores the Insurrection Act to a proper balance. Expect \n     willing and energetic support from the AGAUS.\n       Sincerely,\n\n                                              Roger P.

Christopher Bond,\n     U.S. Senate Washington, DC.\n       The Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the \n     United States (EANGUS) is the only military service \n     association that represents the interests of every enlisted \n     soldier and airmen in the Army and Air National Guard. With a \n     constituency base of over 414,000 soldiers and airmen, their \n     families, and a large retiree membership, EANGUS engages \n     Capitol Hill on behalf of courageous Guard persons across \n     this nation.\n       On behalf of EANGUS, and the soldiers and airmen it \n     represents, I'd like to communicate our support for \n     legislation to repeal the changes to the Insurrection Act as \n     passed in Public Law 109-364, Section 1076, and to restore \n     the authority of the Governors as our founding fathers \n     designed over 230 years ago.\n       Public Law 109-364 stripped the nation's Governors of their \n     rightful authority to use the militia of the United States \n     (to wit, the National Guard) in times of natural disasters \n     and major public emergencies. Congress made this move without \n     any consultation with those Governors, duly elected by the \n     people of this great nation. It was an obvious knee-jerk \n     reaction to the events surrounding Hurricane Katrina in 2005, \n     yet without merit.\n       We applaud you for taking legislative steps to repeal this \n     law, and to restore to the Governors their rightful authority \n     over the militia when not in Federal service. The people of \n     America have a unspoken need for the National Guard in times \n     of public emergencies, and Washington is too far removed from \n     the challenges in each state. We look forward to working with \n     your staff as this legislation works its way into law.\n       Working for America's Best!\n                                  MSG Michael P.

A bill to provide a mechanism for the determination on the \nmerits of the claims of claimants who met the class criteria in a civil \naction relating to racial discrimination by the Department of \nAgriculture but who were denied that determination; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am introducing the Pigford Claims \nRemedy Act of 2007. This bill establishes a new cause of action for \nthose African-American farmers who filed late claim petitions as \nrequired by the Pigford v. Glickman Consent Decree, but whose petitions \nwere rejected.\n  These rejections have effectively barred African-American farmers \nfrom the one process that was established to bring closure to the \nclaims of discrimination by African-American farmers, many of which \nhave been pending for decades.\n  My bill attempts to remedy what appears to be a lack of sufficient \nnotice,\n\n[[Page S1714]]\n\nindicated by the late applicants. It helps bring justice for farmers \nwho have historically been discriminated against while being mindful of \nthe constitutional constraints on Congress's authority. This bill will \nprovide a new cause of action that will assist those putative claimants \nwhose claims have never been evaluated on the merits.\n  Studies conducted by the USDA revealed the depth and impact of this \ndisparate treatment. In 1994, the Department of Agriculture \ncommissioned a study to analyze the treatment of minorities and women \nin farm programs and payments.\n  In 1997, Secretary Glickman commissioned the Civil Rights Action Task \nForce to look into allegations of racial discrimination in the agency's \nloan program. In conjunction with this the Inspector General conducted \nits own investigation into the allegations of disparate treatment.\n  Each report confirmed what African-American farmers already \nexperienced first hand. USDA failed to act to adequately address these \npast wrongs. It took a class action lawsuit filed by African-American \nfarmers in 1997 to get USDA to respond.\n  The resulting Pigford v. Glickman Consent Decree was believed to be a \nturning point in this unfortunate history. Hopes were high that \nAfrican-American farmers would finally be compensated for the history \nof injustice. The consent decree was intended to provide a swift \nresolution for the claims of discrimination that had gone unaddressed \nfor decades.\n  Yet, in a sad twist, the process that was created to provide a forum \nfor those whose claims had been shut out, has itself shut out more than \n75,000 African American farmers who wish to have their claims of \ndiscrimination heard.\n  Hearings before the House Subcommittee on the Constitution revealed \nthat almost 76,000 farmers who submitted late claim petitions were \ndenied entry because they could not show that extraordinary \ncircumstances prevented them from filing a timely complaint.\n  Despite the lack of knowledge about the consent decree, which was \ncited by more than half of these petitioners, lack of notice was not \ndeemed an extraordinary circumstance under the consent decree. So these \npetitioners are left without any recourse to have their claims of \ndiscrimination heard on the merits. These people should be allowed to \nhave their case heard.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. PRYOR (for himself, Mr. Warner, and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 516. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \npermanent the option of including combat pay when computing earned \nincome; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to make \nthe Tax Relief for Americans in Combat Act permanent. This measure \ncorrects a discrepancy in the Tax Code that penalizes certain service \nmen and women serving in combat situations.\n  To give my colleagues a bit of history and perspective on this: In \n2003 I approached the distinguished chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, Senator Chuck Grassley, and ranking member of the committee, \nSenator Max Baucus, and asked them to join me in an effort to get a \nfresh look at the overall picture of how our Tax Code treats our \nmilitary.\n  I was very pleased when they agreed to work with me, and was \ndelighted to jointly request an expedited study by the General \nAccounting Office, GAO. It was an honor to work with them and their \nstaffs throughout this process.\n  The GAO raised many interesting findings but there was one especially \nimportant issue that demanded our immediate attention. In a nutshell \nservice men and women who were serving in combat zones and receiving \nnontaxable combat pay were not able to also take advantage of the \nEarned Income Tax Credit, EITC, and the Child Care Tax Credit.\n  The result was that thousands of our men and women serving in \ncombat--serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the globe--were seeing \na reduction or elimination of their EITC or child credit and in effect \nlosing money. In other words, the Tax Code had the impact of penalizing \nthem because they are serving in combat zones.\n  The GAO report characterized this result as an ``unintended \nconsequence.'' I saw it as just plain wrong and I am pleased to \nintroduce legislation to fix this glitch.\n  In 2004, we passed the Tax Relief for Americans in Combat Act. The \nbill allowed men and women in uniform serving in combat to include \ncombat pay for the purpose of calculating their earned income and child \ntax credit benefits. In other words, they would be able to continue \nreceiving their rightful combat pay exclusions while having the ability \nto take full advantage of other tax credits.\n  However, this legislation only made permanent the child tax credit \nbenefit, while the earned income tax credit provision must be \ncontinuously extended.\n  As of December 2006, the earned income provision was extended for \nanother year, but I believe we must work to permanently resolve this \nglitch and ensure our men and women in combat are fairly treated.\n  I would like to take the opportunity to thank cosponsors Senator John \nWarner and Senator Blanche Lincoln for their leadership and assistance \nto help gamer support for this bill.\n  The urgency of this situation is highlighted especially when you \nfocus on those of our troops which this really affects. We're talking \nabout troops that tend to be in combat for more than 6 months, those in \nlower pay grades, those who are married with children, and have little \nor no savings or spousal income.\n  The GAO analysis suggested that the amount of the tax benefit loss \ncould be up to $4,500 for enlisted personnel and $3,200 for officers. \nThis is real money--make or break money--to many of these families that \nare already under enormous stress.\n  I want to work in bipartisan fashion and permanently extend this tax \nprovision. This bill corrects the problem and lets our troops, risking \nlife and limb, know that while they are away fighting for us we will be \nhere in the Senate fighting for them and their families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 519. A bill to modernize and expand the reporting requirements \nrelating to child pornography, to expand cooperation in combating child \npornography, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senator \nSchumer in introducing the Securing Adolescents From Exploitation-\nOnline Act of 2007, otherwise known as the SAFE Act. This bill would \nclarify and strengthen the requirement that has been a Federal law for \nalmost a decade for electronic communications providers to report \nimages of child pornography to the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children (NCMEC) and then law enforcement. Simply put, this \nbill is designed reduce the sexual exploitation of our children, and \npunish those who cause them physical and emotional harm through sexual \nexploitation.\n  This bill would state specifically what information must be reported \nby electronic communications providers to NCMEC; impose higher \npenalties on companies that do not report child pornography; and \nrequire the Department of Justice to report on the number of \ninvestigation and convictions of sex offenders and purveyors of child \npornography. In addition, the bill would make the use of the Internet \nfor the exploitation of a child an aggravating factor to the underlying \noffense that would add 10 years imprisonment to a convicted offender's \nsentence.\n  Almost 20 years ago, President Reagan inaugurated the opening of the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and called on the \nCenter to ``wake up America and attack the crisis of child \nvictimization.'' Today, thanks to the efforts of NCMEC and many others \nin the public and private sectors, America is more conscious of the \ndangers of child exploitation. Unfortunately, our children still face \nsignificant threats from those who see their innocence as an \nopportunity to do harm. The continuing victimization of our children is \nreadily and all too painfully apparent in the resurgence of child \npornography in our world via the Internet.\n  Technology has contributed to the greater distribution and \navailability,\n\n[[Page S1715]]\n\nand, some believe, desire for child pornography. Cyberspace is host to \nmore than one million images of tens of thousands of children subjected \nto sexual abuse and exploitation, according to a report by the Texas \nState legislature. The same report estimated that the over 14 million \npornography sites on the Internet house an estimated one million \npornographic images of children with 200 new images being posted daily.\n  According to ECPAT International, a group dedicated to eliminating \nthe sexual exploitation of children, the production and distribution of \nabuse images of children is estimated to be at least a 3 billion dollar \nbusiness annually in the U.S. alone. Of all the child pornography \nimages on the Internet, 55 percent are generated from the United \nStates, according to the same group, but these images are also produced \naround the world.\n  Just today, the Associated Press reported that Austrian authorities \nuncovered a major international child pornography ring involving more \nthan 2,360 suspects from 77 countries, including over 600 in the United \nStates, who paid to view videos of young children being sexually \nabused. According to authorities, the children shown in the videos were \nunder the age of 14 and could be heard screaming in fear.\n  This investigation would not have happened without the good work of \nan employee of a Vienna-based Internet file hosting service who noticed \nthe pornographic material during a routine check and then approached \nauthorities. The employee blocked access to the videos while recording \nthe I.P. addresses of people who continued to try to download the \nmaterial, and gave the details to authorities. Within a 24-hour period, \ninvestigators recorded more than 8,000 hits from 2,361 computer I.P. \naddresses in 77 countries ranging from Algeria to South Africa.\n  The Federal Government already has a system in place for electronic \ncommunications providers to report these images to NCMEC. The Center is \ndirected by law to relay that information to local, State and Federal \nlaw enforcement agencies. This reporting system has been useful, but it \nis in need of several vital improvements.\n  Today, Federal law requires electronic communication service \nproviders to report child pornography they discover to NCMEC through \nthe CyberTipline, but the current reporting system does not specify \nexactly what information should be reported. This failure to set forth \nspecific reporting requirements makes the current statute both \ndifficult to comply with and tough to enforce. This omission may have \nled to less effective prosecution of child pornographers. During a \nSenate Commerce Committee hearing I chaired last September, NCMEC \ntestified that, ``because there are no guidelines for the contents of \nthese reports, some [companies] do not send customer information that \nallows NCMEC to identify a law enforcement jurisdiction. So potentially \nvaluable investigative leads are left to sit in the CyberTipline \ndatabase with no action taken.'' This is unacceptable.\n  This bill would address the problem by requiring that reporting \ncompanies convey a defined set of information to the Center, which is \nin large part the information that is provided to NCMEC today by the \nnation's leading Internet service providers. Among other things, the \nbill would require electronic communications providers to report \nspecific information about any individual involved in producing, \ndistributing, or receiving child pornography. In addition, it would \nrequire reporting companies to provide NCMEC with the geographic \nlocation of the involved individual such as the individual's physical \naddress and the IP address from which the individual connected to the \nInternet.\n  To ensure that law enforcement officials have better odds of \nprosecuting involved individuals, the bill would also require online \nservice providers to preserve all data that they report to NCMEC for at \nleast 180 days. The bill would help to ensure greater compliance with \nthe child pornography reporting requirements under Federal law by \nincreasing the penalties three-fold for knowing failure to report child \npornography to NCMEC. It would also move the reporting requirement from \ntitle 42, which relates to the public's health and welfare, to title \n18, our Federal criminal code. This is to underscore that a breach of \nthe reporting obligations constitutes a violation of criminal law. In \naddition, the legislation would eliminate the legal liability of online \nservice providers for actions taken to comply with the child \npornography reporting requirements.\n  The goal of this legislation, is to ensure more thorough reporting of \nchild pornography to NCMEC. I expect that more and better information \nprovided to the Center will lead to a greater number of prosecutions \nand enhanced protection of our children. However, let me stress that \nthis bill does not require surveillance by electronic communications \nproviders or require that they monitor the content of any \ncommunication. The legislation also does not require electronic \ncommunications providers to affirmatively seek out child pornography. \nRather, it requires online service providers to report child \npornography when they become aware of it, either through a report from \na subscriber or user, or through a discovery of the material by an \nemployee. As a result, the reporting requirement would protect children \nwhile not imposing a financial or administrative burden on online \nservice providers.\n  To emphasize the heinous nature of these crimes, this bill would make \nthe use of the Internet in the commission of a crime of child \nexploitation an aggravating factor that would add 10 years to the \noffender's sentence. The Internet is likely the greatest invention of \nthe 21st century; however, it has also allowed these children to be \nvictimized again and again as these images are widely distributed via \nthe Internet. The fight to protect our children from exploitation has \nmoved from the playground to the Internet, and we must update our laws \nto reflect this reality.\n  To address the international nature of child pornography, the bill \nwould permit NCMEC to share reports with foreign law enforcement \nagencies, subject to approval by the Department of Justice. In \naddition, the legislation would state the sense of Congress that the \nexecutive branch should make child pornography a priority when engaging \nin negotiations or talks with foreign countries.\n  The bill would authorize $25 million for our Nation's Internet Crimes \nAgainst Children Task Forces, which is identical to the amount \nrequested by the Administration in its FY 2008 budget. NCMEC, the \nNational Sheriffs Association, and others believe that such funding \nwould significantly improve the efforts of local, State and Federal law \nenforcement officials dedicated to identifying and prosecuting those \nwho use the Internet to prey upon our Nation's children.\n  Lastly, in order to aid law enforcement, the bill would reiterate the \nposition of the Administration that all suppliers of web site domain \nnames should investigate and correct inaccurate data regarding \nregistered domain names so that law enforcement can more easily locate \nthe hosts of such vile pictures of children. To aid Congress in \nunderstanding the need for more resources or legislation to combat the \nproliferation and distribution of child pornography, the bill would \nrequire the Department of Justice to report on the number of \ninvestigations, prosecutions and convictions of crimes involving the \nsexual exploitation of children.\n  This is the second bill Senator Schumer and I have introduced this \nsession to protect our nation's children. Last month, we introduced the \nKeeping the Internet Devoid of Sexual-Predators Act of 2007, known as \nthe KIDS Act, which would establish a database of e-mail addresses and \nother Internet identifying information of convicted sex offenders. The \ndatabase information would then be available to commercial social \nnetworking sites for the purpose of screening their sites' to ensure \nconvicted sex offender are not using the site to prey on children.\n  Protecting our children is a top priority for all members of \nCongress. I look forward to working with my colleagues to eradicate the \nvictimization and exploitation of our children, the most innocent \nmembers of society, by enacting the KIDS Act and the SAFE Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 520. A bill to enhance ecosystem protection and the range of \noutdoor opportunities protected by statute in the\n\n[[Page S1716]]\n\nSkykomish River valley of the State of Washington by designating \ncertain lower-elevation Federal lands as wilderness, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Wild Sky \nWilderness Act, a bill to protect some of Washington's most unique and \nremarkable public lands for families today and for future generations.\n  For more than six years, citizens, community leaders, groups and \norganizations have worked together with Representative Rick Larsen and \nme to make this proposal a reality. I am proud to offer our bill here \nin the Senate on their behalf. This is the fourth time I've introduced \nthis bill, and I'm really excited about finally moving this bill across \nthe finish line this year.\n  The Wild Sky Wilderness Act reflects the best values of my home State \nof Washington--environmental protection, stewardship of our land, and \ncommunity partnership. It also respects the economic and recreational \ninterests of the people of Snohomish County. Our bill will protect an \nimportant area while keeping it accessible for recreation and enjoyment \ntoday and for generations to come.\n  For many years, I've been concerned by the rapid growth taking place \nin Western Washington. It's no surprise that more people want to live \nand work in the region, but we need to make sure that development does \nnot destroy the natural beauty that is such an important part of our \nState's identity and our quality of life. We also need to ensure that \ngrowth and development do not destroy native species of plants and \nanimals that have flourished here for centuries.\n  So several years ago, I began to consider new wilderness legislation. \nI learned that we haven't added any new wilderness areas in Washington \nstate since 1984. I knew that if we were going to protect public land, \nI wanted to do it in an inclusive way by seeking input from local \ncommunities and stakeholders and working with them to develop a sound \nproposal. I am proud to say that the fruits of our labor are now before \nthe United States Senate. My partner in the House of Representatives, \nCongressman Larsen, and I worked alongside all of the local \nstakeholders every step of the way to select these particular areas in \nthe Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie Forest.\n  The Wild Sky Wilderness will protect wildlife and promote clean water \nby preserving the landscapes that host many native plants and animals. \nWe can still find many of the species that have historically called \nthis area home, but their populations are much smaller today. If these \nanimals are going to be here centuries from now, we must protect their \nhabitats. This wilderness designation is especially critical for \nthreatened species of salmon, steelhead and trout, and it will protect \nthe upper reaches of water to ensure prime habitat and clean water.\n  In addition, our bill ensures that the public will have access to \nthese remarkable, protected places. It's estimated that 2.4 million \npeople live nearby in King, Snohomish and Skagit counties. Our bill \nwill ensure they have new recreational opportunities in the Wild Sky \nWilderness. In this hectic, fast-paced time, more and more people and \ntheir families are turning to outdoor recreation on our public lands. \nThis bill will provide new opportunities for the public to use this \nland by directing the U.S. Forest Service to develop a series of hiking \nand equestrian trails.\n  In addition to the environmental protections and recreational \nopportunities, the Wild Sky Wilderness Area will be good for the local \neconomy. Every climber, hiker, hunter and angler setting out for the \nWild Sky Wilderness will be stopping at hotels, campgrounds, \nrestaurants, and stores in the gateway communities of Index, Skykomish, \nMonroe, Miller River, Startup, Grotto, Baring, Sultan, and Gold Bar.\n  Over the years, so many people have worked hard to make this bill \npossible. I can't name all of them, but I do want to recognize one \ngreat leader who is not with us to see the progress she helped make \npossible, Karen Fant. Anyone involved in wilderness protection knows \nthe legacy that Karen has left us through her years of advocacy for our \nstate's natural places. Early on, Karen recognized the need to bring \ntogether and involve local people in efforts to protect wilderness. She \nco-founded and directed the Washington Wilderness Coalition, and she \nwas instrumental in forming a statewide community of wilderness \nadvocates.\n  To those who knew her--and especially those lucky enough to sample \nher famous cookies--Karen provided never-ending inspiration and \nenthusiasm to continue working to protect wilderness and wild lands in \nthe Pacific Northwest and beyond.\n  I cannot summarize Karen's amazing four decades of service, but I \nthink some of her many friends said it best when they wrote:\n\n       ``There are thousands of miles of trails and millions of \n     acres of wilderness that are protected due to her work and \n     the work of others she organized to make a difference. As we \n     walk these trails and gain renewal from these lands, we \n     should all remember the work we shared and the fun and \n     camaraderie we all experienced with Karen.''\n\n  With Karen's passing, we've lost a pioneer in the fight to protect \nour wild spaces, but thankfully she's left a clear trail and a \ngeneration of inspired, empowered advocates to continue her work.\n  I urge my colleagues to help my State take a great step forward in \nprotecting our environment, improving recreation and supporting \neconomic development by supporting the Wild Sky Wilderness Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 520\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 75, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 75) congratulating the Indianapolis \n     Colts on their victory in Super Bowl XLI.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator \nBayh in submitting a resolution congratulating the Indianapolis Colts \non their historic season, culminating Sunday in a thrilling victory \nover the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI.\n  Like so many of my fellow Hoosiers, I have enjoyed cheering on the \nColts since the Irsay family brought them to Indianapolis almost a \nquarter of a century ago. Over the years Colts owner and CEO Jim Irsay \nand president Bill Polian have brought together a remarkable group of \ndedicated professionals such as Tony Dungy and players who through \ntheir hard work and dedication to community service are a credit to the \nColts organization, the City of Indianapolis, and the State of Indiana.\n  Special recognition should be given to Tony Dungy as the first head \ncoach of African-American descent to lead his team to victory in the \nSuper Bowl. I have enjoyed following Coach Dungy remarkable leadership \nand appreciate the example he sets for all Hoosiers.\n  I am hopeful that each of my colleagues in the Senate will join \nSenator Bayh and me in congratulating the Colts on this signal \nachievement.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 75\n\n       Whereas, on Sunday, February 4, 2007, the Indianapolis \n     Colts defeated the Chicago Bears by a score of 29-17 to win \n     Super Bowl XLI;\n       Whereas Colts owner and chief executive officer Jim Irsay \n     and the Irsay family have worked to build the Colts \n     organization not only into a championship caliber team, but \n     also a group dedicated to service in communities across the \n     State of Indiana;\n       Whereas Tony Dungy is the first head coach of African-\n     American descent to lead a team to victory in the Super Bowl;\n       Whereas Peyton Manning, having thrown for 247 yards and \n     made 1 touchdown, was named the game's Most Valuable Player;\n       Whereas the Colts' defense and special teams were able to \n     force 5 turnovers and to limit the Bears to 17 points;\n       Whereas Colts president Bill Polian, widely considered the \n     ``architect'' of much of the Colts' recent success, and the \n     Colts management have assembled a group of players and \n     coaches that has worked together to win 4 straight \n     championships in the Southern Division of the American \n     Football Conference;\n       Whereas the Colts' regular season record of 12-4 marks the \n     team's fourth straight year with at least 12 wins, and makes \n     the Colts only the second team to achieve such consistent \n     success in the history of the National Football League;\n       Whereas the Colts are committed to community leadership, \n     working to help those in Indiana communities who are \n     disadvantaged and underserved, through the generosity of the \n     Irsay family and player groups such as the Peyback Foundation \n     and D.R.E.A.M. Alive, Inc.;\n       Whereas tens of thousands of fans braved bitterly cold \n     temperatures to line the streets of Indianapolis, Indiana for \n     a victory parade and the rally that followed in the RCA Dome; \n     and\n       Whereas Hoosiers from across Indiana and the Nation have \n     rallied together to cheer the Colts not just for winning, but \n     for winning the right way, with dignity and professionalism: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate congratulates the Indianapolis \n     Colts on their victory in Super Bowl XLI.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/07/senate-section/article/S1726-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 2007\n\n  Mr. REID.
