Mr. President, I will be very brief. I know we have so many \nimportant things to do dealing with this legislation, but I do wish to \nsay something about what is going on in Nevada. We have a serious \nproblem in Nevada, and it is fires. This is about the fourth year we \nhave had these raging wildfires.\n  It is so difficult. The smoke is so thick, helicopters cannot fly. \nFirefighters have been lost not knowing where they are fighting these \nfires. It is rough terrain. What people do not understand is, Nevada--\nother than Alaska--is the most mountainous State in the Union. It has \n314 separate mountain ranges. We have 32 mountains over 11,000 feet \nhigh. Some of this terrain, where these fires are burning, is very \ndifficult.\n  We share Lake Tahoe with California. There was a raging fire there \nthat lasted 2 weeks. It has now been put out. But they think that at \nleast 400 structures have burned, with 275 or 300 homes burned to the \nground.\n  On a lot of the land in Nevada not many people live there. In spite \nof that, people do live there. It is rural, and fires have been raging. \nWhat has happened with the fires that have taken place in the past, we \nhave these species that are foreign to the high deserts of Nevada. They \nstart burning, they get into the low mountains, they get into the \ncedars and the pines and then start burning in the forests. That is \nwhat has happened in Nevada.\n  In one fire we have had three lives lost. This fire burned so quickly \nthat three grown men could not escape the fire. They were doing work on \ntheir farm. There was an 11-year-old boy. They saw the fire coming. \nThey said, ``Run for your life,'' literally, and the 11-year-old boy \nran and did survive. His family did not. They all died--three of them.\n  I say this because we have shut down roads. In one part of Utah, 100 \nmiles of interstate were closed because of fires. Think about that: 100 \nmiles of interstate closed. People could not go. One reason was the \nsmoke was so thick--not the fire, the smoke.\n  There has been remarkable heroism, as there always is with these men \nand women who fight these raging fires.\n  I quoted, a couple weeks ago, Edward Croker, a long past fire chief \nin the State of New York, who said:\n\n       I have no ambition in this world but one, and that is to be \n     a fireman. Our proudest moment is to save lives. Under the \n     impulse of such thoughts, the nobility of the occupation \n     thrills us and stimulates us to deeds of daring, even of \n     supreme sacrifice.\n\n\n[[Page S8884]]\n\n\n  The way fires are fought 100 years after this man said this is \ndifferent than the way they used to be fought, but it still takes a \ngreat deal of courage and many times heroism to go forward in these \nareas where burning is taking place.\n  So far, 245 square miles in northern Nevada have burned. That is a \nlot of ground: 245 square miles. Some of the fires are not under \ncontrol yet. So I want the Record to reflect we have problems in the \nWest. Some say it is because of global warming. Whatever the reason, we \nhave never had fires such as we have had in the last 4 years in Nevada \nand I think in the West, generally.\n  So I would finally say, long after the smoke has cleared, the \naccounts of bravery will still be told in Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/10/senate-section/article/S8884-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the pending \nbusiness before the Senate, which is the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill for fiscal year 2008.\n  This is a bill the Senate Armed Services Committee has worked long \nand hard on over a period of several months. I am privileged to be a \nmember of the committee and now doubly privileged to be chair of the \nAirland Subcommittee. I am proud of the work of the committee.\n  This is a bill that does the best we possibly can to support and \nexpand our forces during a time of war. Unfortunately, most of the time \nthat will be spent by this Chamber on this bill will not be about the \nsolid substance of the Department of Defense authorization bill but \nwill be on a series of amendments that will be offered to alter our \ncourse or force our withdrawal from Iraq.\n  In my considered opinion, respectfully, this is a mistake. These \namendments regarding Iraq, I believe, are untimely, they are unwise, \nand they are unfair.\n  They are untimely in the sense that they are premature and should \nawait September, when, as ordained by this Congress itself in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill, General Petraeus and Ambassador \nCrocker will come back to report to us fully.\n  They are unwise, if ever adopted, because they would essentially \nrepresent a retreat from Iraq, a defeat for the United States and the \nforces of a new Iraq, a free Iraq, and a tremendous victory for Iran \nand al-Qaida, who are our two most significant enemies in the world \ntoday.\n  Offering these amendments at this time, in my opinion, is unfair: \nunfair, most of all, to the 160,000 Americans in uniform over there--\nmen and women, brave, effective, in my opinion, the new greatest \ngeneration of American soldiers, committed to this fight, believing we \ncan win it, putting their lives on the line every day. They have made \ntremendous progress already in the so-called surge, counteroffensive. \nTo snipe at them from here is, in my opinion, unfair.\n  That is why I will oppose all the amendments I have heard about thus \nfar and why I wish to discuss them today.\n  I suppose, in terms of timeliness, if one felt the surge, \ncounteroffensive--which began in February, and has just been fully \nstaffed a couple of weeks ago--had absolutely failed, then one might \nsay: OK, we won't wait until September, as we promised we would do; we \nwill try to force a change in policy or a retreat right now. But the \nfacts, as I will discuss, will show the surge is showing some success--\nin some ways some remarkable success--and does not justify these \namendments of retreat being offered at this time.\n  Six months ago, this Chamber voted unanimously to confirm GEN David \nPetraeus as commander of our forces in Iraq. The fact is--which we all \nacknowledge--before that, the administration had followed a strategy in \nIraq that simply was not working. It was a strategy focused on keeping \nthe U.S. force presence as small as possible, regardless of conditions \non the ground, and of pushing Iraqi forces into the lead as quickly as \npossible, regardless of their capabilities to do so.\n  General Petraeus oversaw--let me step back. General Petraeus was part \nof a process, along with others, that presented a dramatically \ndifferent strategy to the President of the United States, the Commander \nin Chief. He accepted that dramatically different strategy, which was \nto apply classic principles of counterinsurgency that have been \nsuccessful elsewhere, so that instead of our main goal being to get out \nof Iraq, our main goal became to protect the civilian population that \nthe terrorists were persistently attacking, bringing chaos throughout \nthe country, including particularly in the capital city of Baghdad, and \nmaking it impossible for a new Iraqi Government to take shape.\n  As a result, over the past 5 months, many problems, many crises, many \nchallenges in Iraq that had long been described as hopelessly beyond \nsolution have begun to improve. In Baghdad, the sectarian violence that \nhad paralyzed the city for more than a year began to drop dramatically. \nIn Anbar Province, which the chief of Marine Corps intelligence in Iraq \ndescribed 9 months ago as ``lost''--and he was right at that point--a \ncity which I was not allowed to visit when I went to Iraq in December \nbecause it was too dangerous--our surge forces have moved in \neffectively.\n  Working together with Sunni tribal leaders and their Sunni followers, \nwe have al-Qaida on the run. As a matter of fact, they have effectively \nrun from Anbar Province, the province they said they intended to make \nthe capital of the new Islamist extremist Republic of Iraq.\n  When I was in Iraq a month ago, I was not only allowed to visit \nRamadi and walk its streets but was tremendously impressed by the peace \nand rebirth that is occurring there.\n  As John Burns of the New York Times recently put it, the capital city \nof Anbar, Ramadi, has since ``gone from being the most dangerous place \nin Iraq . . . to being one of the least dangerous places.'' Despite \nthese gains in Baghdad and Anbar, critics of the new strategy \nnonetheless insisted that it was not working, pointing to the fact \nthat, yes, al-Qaida is on the run, but it is running and causing \ndevastation in other parts of Iraq--now in Diyala Province, for \ninstance.\n\n  But what happened? General Petraeus, now with the other generals and \nadditional personnel brought under his command by the surge \ncounteroffensive strategy, was able to leave some troops in Anbar, \nfortified by Iraqi security forces and the Sunni tribal forces, and \nmove the surge forces to Diyala, to Bakuba there, where they now have \nal-Qaida on the run.\n\n[[Page S8885]]\n\n  Our forces in the field are, of course, still facing some daunting \nchallenges and a brutal, inhumane foe prepared to blow themselves up to \nmake a point, to kill others, hating us and others more than they love \ntheir own lives. But the plain truth is that Iraq in this month, July \n2007, is a very different and better place than Iraq in January or \nFebruary of 2000, and it is because of the so-called surge \ncounteroffensive strategy. Those who refuse to recognize that change \nand nonetheless go forward with the same policies of defeat and \nwithdrawal that they have been talking about for months have, I would \nsay respectfully, closed their eyes, not to mention their heads, to the \nreality of what is actually happening on the ground in Iraq.\n  General Petraeus has persistently appealed to us to have some \npatience, to not rush to judgment about the success or failure of a new \nsurge strategy. It is only right that we do so. But instead of \nrespecting those pleas, withholding our judgment, and remaining true to \nwhat we ourselves put into the supplemental appropriations bill, which \nwas a requirement for an interim report this week and a full report on \npaper about the benchmarks and in person by General Petraeus and \nAmbassador Crocker in September, instead of waiting for that to happen, \nI regret that some of my colleagues have decided to go ahead and submit \nthese amendments which, to me, represent the continuation of a longtime \nlegislative trench warfare against our presence in Iraq no matter what \nthe facts on the ground there are. Rather than giving General Petraeus \nand his troops a fair chance to succeed--and it is not just for them, \nit is for us--I regret that efforts will be made here to undermine our \nstrategy, which is now a successful strategy in Iraq, to dictate when, \nwhere, and against whom our soldiers can fight and when we should get \nout.\n  I suppose this would be justified if somebody concluded that the war \nwas lost in Iraq. The war is not lost in Iraq. In fact, now American \nand Iraqi security forces are winning. The enemy is on the run in Iraq. \nBut here in Congress, in Washington, we seem to be--or some Members \nseem to be on the run--chased, I fear, by public-opinion polls.\n  I know the American people are frustrated. I understand that. I know \nwhat they see every night on the TV, the suicide bombs. I know how much \nthey want their loved ones to come home. No one wants that more than we \ndo here. But the consequences of doing that would be a disaster for \nIraq, the Middle East, and for us because the victors would be Iran and \nal-Qaida, our two most dangerous enemies in the world today, and trust \nme, they would follow us back here to this country.\n  I said one might pursue a policy of changing course, directing a \nretreat, a withdrawal, accepting defeat if one thought the war was \nlost. The war is not lost. In fact, I will say to my colleagues today \nthat this war in Iraq will never be lost by our military on the ground \nin Iraq. The war in Iraq can only be lost with the loss of political \nwill here at home and, perhaps, with the loss of political will in \nIraq. But that story is not finished yet.\n  Perhaps there are some who would say the war is not lost but it is \nnot worth winning. I think we have to think of the consequences of \ndefeat. I know that in the midst of the consequences of defeat are a \nvictory for Iran and al-Qaida, chaos in Iraq, slaughter that will \nprobably begin to look like genocide, instability in the region, and \nthe danger that we will be forced to send our troops back into the \nregion in greater numbers to fight a more difficult war.\n  I think the amendments on Iraq to be offered on this Department of \nDefense bill are mistaken. What are the alternatives my colleagues are \ngoing to propose in these amendments? One of the amendments would \ndemand a total withdrawal of American troops from Iraq as quickly as \npossible. Its sponsors argue that we can continue to fight al-Qaida in \nIraq and defend our other key interests in the Middle East by operating \nfrom bases elsewhere there. With all due respect, this is fantasy.\n  As my friend, Senator Lugar, pointed out a short while ago, a \ncomplete American withdrawal from Iraq is likely to have devastating \nconsequences for American national security. Everyone knows Senator \nLugar is a skeptic about our strategy and events in Iraq. Yet, in his \nwords, a complete withdrawal from Iraq would:\n\n       Compound the risks of a wider regional conflict. It would \n     be a severe blow to U.S. credibility that would make nations \n     in the region far less likely to cooperate with us. It would \n     expose Iraqis who have worked with us to retribution, and it \n     would also be a signal that the United States was abandoning \n     efforts to prevent Iraqi territory from being used as a \n     terrorist base.\n\n  So spoke the distinguished Senator from Indiana, Mr. Lugar.\n  Another amendment would keep some forces in Iraq, pull most forces \nout by next April 1. Their numbers would be dramatically reduced and \nthe mission dramatically redefined.\n  Some argue that American soldiers should withdraw from Iraq's cities \nand instead focus on the training of Iraqi forces, targeting \ncounterterrorism, and protecting the remaining American troops there. \nLet me say that is a vision I would embrace for the future but not as a \nsubstitute for the surge counteroffensive strategy we are following now \nbut as a consequence of a successful implementation of that strategy, \nfor if we in this Chamber and in Congress mandate the withdrawal of our \ntroops down to a core group with a new mission before the Iraqi \nsecurity forces are ready to provide security, we are going back to the \nexact strategy some describe as the Rumsfeld strategy which didn't \nwork, which was roundly condemned by most people in both parties over a \nperiod of years.\n  I repeat my confidence that the number of American troops will be \nreduced, but it will be reduced best when it is reduced as a result of \nthe successful implementation of the surge strategy as carried out \nheroically by American forces.\n  I conclude with these words: Our responsibilities in this Chamber \nultimately do not allow us to be guided by our frustrations or even by \npublic-opinion polls when we respectfully believe those public-opinion \npolls do not reflect what is best for our Nation. We were elected to \nlead. We were elected to see beyond the next election, to do what is \nbest for the next generation of Americans. We were elected to defend \nour beloved country, its security, and its values. All of that is on \nthe line in Iraq today.\n\n  So I appeal to my colleagues, let's not undercut our troops and \nlegislate a defeat in Iraq where none is occurring now, where hope is \nstrong, where the momentum is, in fact, on our side. If you question \nthat, at least show the fairness and respect for General Petraeus, \nAmbassador Crocker, and all the people working for us there to wait \nuntil September, which is what we said we would do, until we take a \nserious look at these amendments. If we go down the path the amendments \nentice us toward, what awaits us is an emboldened Iran, a strengthened \nal-Qaida, a failed Iraq that will become not just a killing field but \nwill destabilize the entire Middle East and also, I fear, imperil our \nsecurity here at home.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I appreciate being recognized. Before my \ngood friend, Senator Lieberman, departs the floor, I will make one \nobservation about him that I think needs to be said. This winning/\nlosing is a big part of wars; it is a big part of politics. Everybody \nwants to win, and people are afraid to lose. But I have found in life \nthere are some things that are worth fighting for and willing to lose \nyour job over, and to me the policies in Iraq fall into that category \nbecause it is much more important in my election that we get it right \nin Iraq, and from Senator Lieberman's point of view--I don't think I \nhave seen in modern politics anyone more committed to their beliefs \nthan Senator Lieberman when it comes to a foreign policy issue like \nIraq. We all know the story of his last election, how he basically lost \na primary because he refused to give in to the forces on the left when \nit came to the war on terror policies, particularly\n\n[[Page S8886]]\n\nIraq. He literally risked losing his job, lost the primary, and in the \nend prevailed. I think he prevailed because the good people of \nConnecticut saw in Senator Lieberman a man committed to his ideas, and \nhis ideas he was committed to were bigger than himself. They may not \nhave agreed with Senator Lieberman about his policies on Iraq, but they \nsure admired what they saw in the man, and that is someone who was \nclearly putting the country's interests ahead of their own. There is \nnot enough of that. The only group I can say with certainty that is \ndoing the same thing is the men and women in Iraq.\n  On the Fourth of July this year, last week, I was in Iraq, in Baghdad \nfor my sixth or seventh visit. This was a special visit. I got to be on \nthe ground in Iraq on the Fourth of July, our Independence Day, and be \npart of a ceremony put on by General Petraeus's staff where he had 580-\nplus people reenlist. It was the largest reenlistment ceremony in a war \nzone in history, General Petraeus said. Right after the reenlistment \nceremony, we had 160-plus American soldiers who became naturalized \ncitizens. It was something to behold. To be in that former Saddam \npalace and be around those brave young men and women who are signing up \nto do it in Iraq yet again and who are becoming American citizens, \nliterally risking their lives to do so, was inspiring.\n  This debate we are about to enter into is not about anyone's \npatriotism. My colleagues here, we are friends politically one day and \nwe are on the other side the next. That is the nature of politics. It \nis never about respect for the person. I do have respect for my \ncolleagues, and I hope the same is said of me. It is about our \njudgment. When I question your judgment and you question mine, that is \npart of the political process. Our judgments need to be tested. The \ndecision we make now affects many people. It affects the long-term \nfuture of our country. It affects the soldiers in harm's way. Our \njudgment will be tested by the next election, and it will be tested by \nthe eyes of history.\n  So here is what I believe we need to do in terms of Iraq policy for \nthe immediate future. We need to listen very closely to what is being \nsaid in theater by our generals and by our enemy. Mr. Zawahiri, the \nsecond in command of al-Qaida, is not in Iraq, but he issued a \nstatement--I think it was last Thursday--it was about an hour-long \nstatement, and it was basically a call to not lose hope for al-Qaida in \nIraq. He was acknowledging that you are under strain and stress, that \nyou are really being pounded, but hang in there because your cause is \ngreat, and he encouraged everyone who is sympathetic to al-Qaida to run \nto Iraq now to beat us because our ideas are just abhorrent to their \nway of life.\n  The idea of being tolerant to different religions and views of \nreligion is an absolute mortal sin in the eyes of al-Qaida. The idea of \na woman having a say about her child is something they are just not \ngoing to have any part of. So I thought it was odd that he would make \nthis hour-long call for reinforcements. Why was he doing that?\n  The reason he chose to make that statement is because the new \nstrategy being employed now in Iraq is working against al-Qaida. I \ndon't want to overstate it. The main reason al-Qaida is losing ground \nin Iraq has more to do about them than us. Al-Qaida dramatically \noverplayed their hand. Wherever they occupied a region in the Sunni \npart of Iraq, they tremendously overplayed their hand. During this \ndebate, I will give some illustrations of some of the brutal, vicious \nthings they did to folks living in Iraq once they were under al-Qaida \ncontrol, and the Sunnis in Iraq basically are fed up with al-Qaida. \nThey have had a taste of what al-Qaida offers them, and they have said \nno thanks. They have rejected al-Qaida's view of how to live one's life \nand how to raise one's children.\n  Lucky for us the President made a change in strategy--which should \nhave happened years ago--where we are putting additional combat \ncapability into the Iraqi theater. This rejection of al-Qaida by the \nSunni leadership and the Sunni population came at a time where we have \nadditional combat capability to reinforce that rejection. No matter \nwhat you think about the surge, it is undeniable that there have been \nnew alliances formed between Sunni Iraqis and coalition forces in areas \npreviously controlled by al-Qaida; and al-Qaida, as Senator Lieberman \nsaid, is literally on the run, but they are still engaging in suicide \nbombing attacks and trying to create as much carnage as possible in \nIraq. Where they used to exist in Anbar, they exist no longer in any \nforce. They are isolated now. Anbar, the province dominated by the \nSunni Iraqis, is a transformed region in terms of al-Qaida operations. \nThe break of the sheik from the al-Qaida leadership and joining with \nthe coalition forces has been a transforming event.\n  What can al-Qaida do? They moved to Diyala when the population sided \nwith us, and their safe haven was denied. They went to the Diyala \nProvince. We are doing the same thing there as we did in Anbar: making \nalliances with local Sunni leaders and some Shia. The big loser is al-\nQaida. That is why last week Zawahiri made a call to his brothers in \narms: Don't leave the fight; too much is at risk; hang in there, we \nwill send reinforcements if we can.\n  He made this observation--I will get the quote later in the debate. \nHe said the winds were blowing in our favor in Washington.\n  Now, one of the highest ranking al-Qaida leaders in the world was \ntrying to inspire his troops by saying: No matter how much you are \nlosing ground in Iraq, help may be coming from Washington. The question \nfor this body is, do we want to be the cavalry for al-Qaida? If things \nare left the way they are now, and we gave General Petraeus the time \nand the resources and our total commitment, there is no doubt in my \nmind that, militarily, we can destroy al-Qaida in Iraq. Why? Because \nthe Iraqi people, particularly the Sunnis, have had a taste of that \nlifestyle, and they have said no. All they need is additional capacity \nto defeat al-Qaida. That additional capacity has been provided by the \nsurge. The additional military capability that exists now has made a \nworld of difference. The strategy is fundamentally different.\n  Before, for almost 4 years, we had been behind walls trying to train \nthe Iraqi Army and police, and getting in firefights and coming back \nwhen it was over. General Petraeus, with additional military personnel, \nhas created joint security stations all over neighborhoods where we are \nliving with the Iraqi Army and police, training them day in and day \nout. We are sleeping with them in terms of staying overnight, and we \nare stakeholders of that area. Not only are we helping clear the area, \nwe are holding that area and we are having more combat capability. The \nsurge provides that for every combat troop available to do operations \nbefore the surge, we have an additional soldier now. That has allowed \nus to go into areas that we previously could not go into to clear, \nhold, stay, and live with the Iraqi Army and police force and train \nthem day in and day out. It is truly working.\n  It is my hope that as we get into this debate we will understand that \nif we go back to the old strategy of withdrawing behind walls, the \nalliances that have been formed between the Sunni leadership in Iraq \nand the coalition forces and the central government will be destroyed. \nWe have put tanks around Sunni sheiks' homes. We have created joint \nsecurity stations in neighborhoods that have previously been occupied \nby al-Qaida. It is working. If we withdraw, all of those people who \nformed these alliances will be at risk. I think al-Qaida will emerge \nagain stronger.\n  One thing is clear to me. The old strategy of just training and \nstaying behind walls failed. The new strategy of getting into the \nfight, getting out into the neighborhoods, holding territory with \nadditional combat capability, and forming new transforming alliances is \nworking.\n\n  Senator Levin, a dear friend, wants to say we are going to leave in \nMarch of 2008, or 120 days from now--I cannot remember the wording of \nthe amendment. Basically, it is a statement by the Congress that we are \ngoing to undo the surge, the surge comes to an end, we begin to leave. \nWe will leave a force behind that will do a couple things--train the \nIraqi Army and police force. We tried that for 4 years. Training during \na war is a little different than training when you are not at war. We \ntrain our soldiers at home, but they\n\n[[Page S8887]]\n\nare not in a wartime situation while they are being trained. The people \nin Iraq are being trained and fighting at the same time. They need more \nthan training, they need combat capability that is nonexistent on their \npart.\n  That is a democracy that is less than 4 years old. Their constitution \nis less than 18 months old. The Iraqi Army and the police force, 4 \nyears ago, was there to support the dictator, not democracy. So if you \nexpect, from the ashes of the dictatorship, a functioning democracy in \n4 years, I think you are sadly mistaken. It took us 11 years to write \nour own Constitution.\n  Why am I hopeful that we can still win in Iraq? No. 1, there is \nevidence with the new strategy that we can defeat and destroy al-Qaida \nin Iraq. No. 2, every time an Iraqi soldier is killed or a policeman is \nmurdered, someone takes their place. Every time a judge is \nassassinated, somebody else comes along and says, ``I'll be a judge.'' \nWhat more can you ask? We are losing troops, and it is heartbreaking. \nThe enemy that we are fighting understands that Americans don't like \nthe taste of war--and that is an asset, not a liability. We are not a \nwarring people. It is not our nature as a people to go to other places \nand take land from people and dominate their life. It is our nature to \nallow people to chart their own destiny and to be partners \neconomically, while the enemy wants no part of that.\n  So what I hope we will do is take these amendments that will come to \nthe floor and ask ourselves one simple question: If this amendment \npasses, what affect does it have on our military commanders to execute \nthis new strategy that is clearly working? If this amendment passes, \nhow does it affect al-Qaida in Iraq and throughout the world? What \naffect would it have on the voices of moderation that are giving their \nown lives to change their own country in Iraq? If this amendment \npasses, how does it affect Iran?\n  The one thing I learned from this last trip is that al-Qaida \noverplayed their hand, and we are taking advantage of it. Iran is \ntrying to destabilize Iraq now more than ever. Don't mistake these new \nalliances between coalition forces and Sunni Iraqis to be a political \nreconciliation. The bad news from my trip is that the Iraqi Government \nis paralyzed, the political leadership in Iraq--Sunni, Shia, and Kurd--\nare unable to get their act together at this point. New elections would \nbe good for the Sunnis.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twenty seconds.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We will talk more about this. The good news is, the surge \nis al-Qaida's worst nightmare. They have been rejected by the Sunnis in \nIraq, and if we stay on them, we can destroy al-Qaida in Iraq. The bad \nnews is, the current political infrastructure in Iraq is incapable of \nmaking the hard decisions for the moment. We have to think of new ways \nto push them.\n  There is much more to follow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise for a brief period of time to pay \ntribute to a Pennsylvanian who just passed away this past week, a \nconstituent of mine whose family I have known for many years. I think \nhe is like a lot of people in our communities and in our States who \nlead lives of service and struggle and achievement, and often their \nlives are not the subject of big stories and headlines.\n  When I think of Alex George, Sr.--who is the father of Bill George, \nor William George, who is the president of the AFL-CIO in \nPennsylvania--I think of those people who grew up in parts of western \nPennsylvania, where over many generations steel was the foundation of \nthe economy, and in places like where Mr. George lived, Aliquippa, PA, \nwhich is a very strong community that had a thriving steel industry \nthat is now largely gone from the city and that community. It is not \nnearly what it was when thousands of people were employed.\n  Alex George, like a lot of Pennsylvanians and, frankly, a lot of \nAmericans, lived a life of triumph where he had to overcome \ndifficulties in his own life, and then he became a union leader of the \nAmalgamated Association of Iron and Steelworkers, which was the \nforerunner, of course, of the modern day Steelworkers Union that his \nson, Bill George, joined many years later. We think of his life today \nand what he did for the labor movement of western Pennsylvania, and \nPennsylvania generally, and also what he did as a law enforcement \nofficer. He was a police officer as well in his later years.\n  I rise briefly to pay tribute to him and his life of work for the \nbenefit of labor, doing everything possible to make sure they have \nlives that are rewarded, in the sense that they are allowed to organize \nand allowed to have the opportunity to have the dignity of their labor \nbe part of the fabric of their lives. We pay tribute to Alex George \ntoday and the many others who built the middle class in America. He is \nthe proud son of Aliquippa, PA.\n  In a special way, I express my condolences to the entire George \nfamily, and especially Bill George, president of the AFL-CIO of \nPennsylvania. Alex George leaves behind three sons: Bill, who I have \nmentioned, Robert, and Alex, Jr., as well as nine grandchildren and \nmany great-grandchildren. In the spirit of condolence, but also in the \nspirit of tribute, I pay tribute to Alex George and the legacy he \nleaves behind for the George family and for the labor family of \nPennsylvania.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, our country is home to some of the finest \nfighting forces in the world, and we can all be very proud of that \nfact. We need our military to be the best trained, the best equipped, \nand the most prepared force on the planet. Tragically, however, the \nPresident's war in Iraq and his use of extended deployments is \nundermining our military's readiness today.\n  The current deployment schedule hurts our ability to respond to \nthreats around the world, it causes our servicemembers to leave the \nmilitary service early, it weakens our ability to respond to disasters \nat home, it unfairly burdens family members, and it intensifies the \ncombat stress our servicemembers experience.\n  We need to rebuild our military, and the first step is giving our \nfighting men and women the time they need at home to prepare and train \nfor their next mission.\n  Today I rise to address the readiness challenges that threaten our \nmilitary strength and ultimately our Nation's security.\n  More than 4 years into the war in Iraq, our troops are stretched \nthin, our equipment is deteriorating, and the patience of our Nation is \nwearing thin. We have seen 3,600 servicemembers die, thousands upon \nthousands more have been injured, and month after month our fighting \nmen and women are pushing harder and harder. Troops leave loved ones \nfor months and years and put their lives on the line without complaint. \nWe owe them the best treatment and the best training possible.\n  Unfortunately, the Bush administration has fallen short in those \nareas. One of the major problems for our troops, for their families, \nand their communities is the growing gap between the time troops spend \nin battle versus the time they spend at home. This gap is alarming, it \nis disheartening, and it is a disservice to the brave men and women who \nput themselves in harm's way each and every day.\n  Sadly, our forces are being burned out. Many of our troops are on \ntheir third or even their fourth tour in Iraq and Afghanistan. Months \nago, the Department of Defense announced that their tours would be \nextended from 12 months to 15 months. And on top of all that, they are \nnot receiving the necessary time at home before they are sent back to \nbattle.\n\n[[Page S8888]]\n\n  Mr. President, that is not the normal schedule. It is not what our \ntroops signed up for. And we here in Congress should not simply stand \nby and allow our troops to be pushed beyond their limits. That is why \nhere on the Senate floor today we are debating the Webb amendment, and \nthat is why we need to pass it this week.\n  Traditionally, Active-Duty troops are deployed for 1 year and then \nthey rest at home for 2 years. National Guard and Reserve troops are \ndeployed for 1 year and then they rest at home for 5 years. Tragically, \nthat is not what is happening today. Today, Active-Duty troops are \nspending less time at home than they are in battle--less time at home \nthan they are in battle--and our Guard and Reserve forces are receiving \nless than 3 years' rest for every year in combat.\n  With that increasing number and length of deployments, this rest time \nis even more critical for our troops, and they are not receiving the \nbreak they need, which is increasing the chances that they will burn \nout. This administration--the Bush administration--has decided to go \nthe other direction, pushing our troops harder, extending their time \nabroad, and sending troops back time and again to the battlefield.\n  In March of this year, a few months ago, Salon.com reported what I \nhope is an extreme example of the length the military is going to get \nour soldiers back to the battlefield, and I want to read an excerpt \nfrom that story because I think it is really important we all \nunderstand what is happening to our troops.\n  This is from Salon.com:\n\n       Last November, Army Specialist Edgar Hernandez, a \n     communications specialist with a unit of the Army's 3rd \n     Infantry Division, had surgery on an ankle he had injured \n     during physical training. After the surgery, doctors put his \n     leg in a cast and he was supposed to start physical therapy \n     when the cast came off six weeks later.\n       But two days after his cast was removed, Army commanders \n     decided it was more important to send him to a training site \n     in a remote desert rather than let him stay at Fort Benning, \n     GA, to rehabilitate. In January, Hernandez was shipped to the \n     National Training Center at Fort Irwin, CA, where his unit, \n     the 3,900-strong 3rd Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division, \n     was conducting a month of training in anticipation of leaving \n     for Iraq in March.\n       Hernandez says he was in no shape to train for a war so \n     soon after his injury. ``I could not walk,'' he told Salon in \n     an interview. He said he was amazed when he learned he was \n     being sent to California. ``Did they not realize that I'm \n     hurt and I needed this physical therapy?'' he remembered \n     thinking. I was told by my doctor and my physical therapist \n     that this was crazy.\n       Hernandez had served two tours in Iraq, where he had helped \n     maintain communications gear in the unit's armored Bradley \n     Fighting Vehicles. But he could not participate in war \n     maneuvers conducted on a 1,000-square-mile mock battlefield \n     located in the harsh Mojave Desert. Instead, when he got to \n     California, he was led to a large tent where he would be \n     housed. He was shocked by what he saw inside. There were \n     dozens of other hurt soldiers. Some were on crutches, and \n     others had their arms in slings. Some had debilitating back \n     injuries. And nearby was another tent housing female soldiers \n     with health issues ranging from injuries to pregnancy.\n       Hernandez is one of a dozen soldiers who stayed for weeks \n     in those tents who were interviewed for this report, some of \n     whose medical records were also reviewed by Salon. All of the \n     soldiers said they had no business being sent to Fort Irwin \n     given their physical condition. In some cases, soldiers were \n     sent there even though their injuries were so severe the \n     doctors had previously recommended they should be considered \n     for medical retirement from the Army.\n       Military experts say they suspect that the deployment to \n     Fort Irwin of injured soldiers was an effort to pump up \n     manpower statistics used to show the readiness of Army units.\n\n  Clearly, if the military is going to those lengths to pump up \nreadiness statistics, we have a huge problem. But these problems are \nonly the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the effects of the \nadministration's rotation policy. The current rotation policy not only \nburns out servicemembers, but it hurts the military's ability to \nrespond to other potential threats.\n  For the first time in decades, the Army's ``ready brigade,'' which is \nintended to enter troubled spots within 72 hours, cannot do so. All of \nits troops are in Iraq and Afghanistan. The limited period between \ndeployments lessens the time to train for other threats.\n  Numerous military leaders have spoken to us about this problem. GEN \nJames Conway said:\n\n       I think my largest concern, probably, has to do with \n     training. When we're home for that 7, 8, 9 months, our focus \n     is going back to Iraq. And as I mentioned in the opening \n     statement, therefore, we're not doing amphibious training, \n     we're not doing mountain-warfare training, we're not doing \n     combined-arm fire maneuver, such as would need to be the \n     case potentially in another type of contingency.\n\n  That is not me, Mr. President; that is General Conway before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee in February of this year.\n  GEN Barry McCaffrey said that because all ``fully combat ready'' \nActive-Duty and Reserve combat units are now deployed in Iraq or \nAfghanistan, ``no fully-trained national strategic reserve brigades are \nnow prepared to deploy to new combat operations.''\n  The current deployment situation is hurting our troops, and it is \nhurting our troops in another way. It is contributing to a drop in our \nretention rates. Keeping battle-experienced and capable troops in the \nmilitary is essential to our ability to respond to future threats. West \nPoint classes of 2000 and 2001 have an attrition rate five times higher \nthan pre-Iraq war levels, with 54 percent of the West Point class of \n2000 leaving the Army by the end of last year and 46 percent of the \nWest Point class of 2001 leaving the Army by the end of last year. \nMarine Corps Active Forces are losing troops, especially critical \nmidgrade noncommissioned officers, and that is despite a bonus for \nthose who reenlist.\n  Clearly, this policy is not sustainable.\n  This deployment schedule we have been talking about is also making us \nless secure here at home. The rotation policy has left our Guard units \nshort of manpower and supplies and severely hindered their ability to \nrespond to disasters that can occur at any time here at home.\n  The recent tornado that destroyed much of Greensburg, KS, is a \nterrible example. After their town was destroyed, Greensburg residents \nneeded shelter, they needed food and water, and they needed it fast. \nBut because the Kansas National Guard was stretched so thin, it was \nhard for them to respond as fast as was necessary for an emergency \nright here at home. Governor Sebelius and MG Tod Bunting, who is the \nhead of the Kansas National Guard, said not only is Guard equipment \nbeing worn out, but so are its troops, some of whom were in their \nfourth tour in Iraq.\n  For years, these problems were the exception, not the rule. But I \nfear that balance is shifting. Last month, USA Today reported that \nNational Guard units in 31 States say 4 years of war in Iraq and \nAfghanistan have left them with 60 percent or less of their authorized \nequipment. And last month, LTG Steven Blum said the National Guard \nunits have 53 percent of the equipment they need to handle State \nemergencies, and that number falls to 49 percent once Guard equipment \nneeded for war, such as weapons, is factored in.\n  In fact, Blum said:\n\n       Our problem right now is that our equipment is at an all-\n     time low.\n\n  This is deeply concerning to all of us who worry about a national \ndisaster in our States, especially out in the West as we now face fires \nin our forests that are threatening homes and families and lives, and \nwe fear extreme devastation.\n  This problem is more than about equipment, it is more than about \nretention rates, it is about real people and about real families. We \nall know military life can be tough on troops and their families. They \ngo for months--sometimes years--without seeing each other. While troops \nare away fighting for all of us, sons and daughters are born, sons and \ndaughters grow up without their moms and dads present, husbands and \nwives don't see each other for years, fathers die, mothers die, and \nfamily members become sick. Our troops need adequate time at home to \nsee their newborns, to be a part of their children's lives, to spend \ntime with their spouses, and to see their parents. The current rotation \npolicy decreases dramatically the time families are together, and that \nplaces a tremendous strain on everyone.\n  Our troops facing these early deployments and extended tours have \nspoken out. When the tour extensions and early deployments were \nannounced, our troops themselves expressed their displeasure.\n  In Georgia, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution:\n\n\n[[Page S8889]]\n\n\n       Soldiers of a Georgia Army National Guard unit were hoping \n     to return home in April. Instead, they may be spending \n     another grueling summer in the Iraqi desert. At least 4,000 \n     National Guard soldiers may spend up to four extra months in \n     Iraq as part of President Bush's troop increase announced \n     last month. SGT Gary Heffner, spokesman for the 214th, said \n     news of the extension came as a ``little bit of a shock'' to \n     the Georgians.\n\n  The 1st Cavalry Division, according to the Dallas Morning News:\n\n       Eighteen months after their first Iraqi rotation, the 2nd \n     Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment and the last of the Fort \n     Hood, Texas-based 1st Cavalry Division returned to Iraq in \n     mid-November.\n\n  Those troops, according to this article, were deeply concerned about \nthat. And here in my home State, in Tacoma, WA, just this past weekend, \nthere was an article from the Tacoma News Tribune of soldiers going \nonce again.\n  These soldiers are talking about the tremendously difficult time they \nare having being redeployed.\n  So, Mr. President, I rise today to speak out for the Webb amendment. \nIt is an amendment that supports our troops. It supports our troops by \nrequiring that regular forces be at home for as long as they are \ndeployed. It requires that our National Guard and Reserve forces be \nhome for at least 3 years for every year deployed. Those seem to me to \nbe basic commonsense requirements.\n  I applaud our colleague from Virginia for being a champion for our \ntroops and for crafting the bipartisan measure of which he and I think \nthe entire Senate can be proud.\n  Our troops have sacrificed so much for us. We have to institute a \nfair policy for the health of our troops, for the health and well-being \nof their families, and for our Nation's security and the ability to \nrespond to disasters here at home. The Webb amendment does all of that, \nand I urge the Senate to adopt it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe full Salon.com article and the article from the Tacoma News \nTribune.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From salon.com, Mar. 26, 2007]\n\n                 Army Deployed Seriously Injured Troops\n\n                           (By Mark Benjamin)\n\n       Washington.--Last November, Army Spc. Edgar Hernandez, a \n     communications specialist with a unit of the Army's 3rd \n     Infantry Division, had surgery on an ankle he had injured \n     during physical training.

He said he was amazed when he learned he was being \n     sent to California. ``Did they not realize that I'm hurt and \n     I needed this physical therapy?'' he remembered thinking. ``I \n     was told by my doctor and my physical therapist that this was \n     crazy.''\n       Hernandez had served two tours in Iraq, where he helped \n     maintain communications gear in the unit's armored Bradley \n     Fighting Vehicles. But he could not participate in war \n     maneuvers conducted on a 1,000-square-mile mock \n     battlefield located in the harsh Mojave Desert. Instead, \n     when he got to California, he was led to a large tent \n     where he would be housed. He was shocked by what he saw \n     inside: There were dozens of other hurt soldiers. Some \n     were on crutches, and others had arms in slings. Some had \n     debilitating back injuries. And nearby was another tent, \n     housing female soldiers with health issues ranging from \n     injuries to pregnancy.\n       Hernandez is one of a dozen soldiers who stayed for weeks \n     in those tents who were interviewed for this report, some of \n     whose medical records were also reviewed by Salon. All of the \n     soldiers said they had no business being sent to Fort Irwin \n     given their physical condition. In some cases, soldiers were \n     sent there even though their injuries were so severe that \n     doctors had previously recommended they should be considered \n     for medical retirement from the Army.\n       Military experts say they suspect that the deployment to \n     Fort Irwin of injured soldiers was an effort to pump up \n     manpower statistics used to show the readiness of Army units. \n     With the military increasingly strained after four years of \n     war, Army readiness has become a critical part of the debate \n     over Iraq. Some congressional Democrats have considered plans \n     to limit the White House's ability to deploy more troops \n     unless the Pentagon can certify that units headed into the \n     fray are fully equipped and fully manned.\n       Salon recently uncovered another troubling development in \n     the Army's efforts to shore up troop levels, reporting \n     earlier this month that soldiers from the 3rd Brigade had \n     serious health problems that the soldiers claimed were \n     summarily downgraded by military doctors at Fort Benning in \n     February, apparently so that the Army could send them to \n     Iraq. Some of those soldiers were among the group sent to \n     Fort Irwin to train in January.\n       After arriving at Fort Irwin, many of the injured soldiers \n     did not train. ``They had all of us living in a big tent,'' \n     confirmed Spc. Lincoln Smith, who spent the month there along \n     with Hernandez and others. Smith is an Army truck driver, but \n     because of his health issues, which include sleep apnea (a \n     breathing ailment) and narcolepsy, Smith is currently barred \n     from driving military vehicles. ``I couldn't go out and do \n     the training,'' Smith said about his time in California. His \n     records list his problems as ``permanent'' and recommend that \n     he be considered for retirement from the Army because of his \n     health.\n       Another soldier with nearly 20 years in the Army was sent \n     to Fort Irwin, ostensibly to prepare for deployment to Iraq, \n     even though she suffers from back problems and has \n     psychiatric issues. Doctors wrote ``unable to deploy \n     overseas'' on her medical records.\n       It is unclear exactly how many soldiers with health issues \n     were sent to the California desert. None of the soldiers \n     interviewed by Salon had done a head count, but all agreed \n     that ``dozens'' would be a conservative estimate. An Army \n     spokesman and public affairs officials for the 3rd Infantry \n     Division did not return repeated calls and e-mails seeking \n     further detail and an explanation of why injured troops were \n     sent to Fort Irwin and housed in tents there during January.\n       The soldiers who were at Fort Irwin described a pitiful \n     scene. ``You had people out there with crutches and canes,'' \n     said an Army captain who was being considered for medical \n     retirement himself because of serious back injuries sustained \n     in a Humvee accident during a previous combat tour in Iraq. \n     ``Soldiers that apparently had no business being there were \n     there,'' another soldier wrote to Salon in an e-mail. \n     ``Pregnant females were sent to the National Training Center \n     rotation'' with the knowledge of Army leaders, she said.\n       One infantry sergeant with nearly 20 years in the Army who \n     had already fought in Iraq broke his foot badly in a \n     noncombat incident just before being sent to Fort Irwin. ``I \n     didn't even get to put the cast on,'' before going, he said \n     with exasperation. He said doctors put something like an \n     ``open-toed soft shoe'' on his foot and put him on a plane to \n     California. ``I've got the cast on now. I never even got a \n     chance to see the [medical] specialist,'' he claimed. The \n     infantry sergeant said life in the desert was tough in his \n     condition. ``I was on Percocet. I couldn't even concentrate. \n     I hopped on a plane and hobbled around NTC on crutches,'' he \n     said. He added, ``I saw people who were worse off than I am. \n     I saw people with hurt backs and so on. I started to think, \n     `Hey, I'm not so bad.'

This spring, the Pentagon \n     extended most combat deployments from 12 to 15 months. While \n     some are going to the war zone for the first time, this will \n     be the third trip for Staff Sgt. Benjamin Hernandez.\n       ``It's tough, especially leaving my family again,'' said \n     Hernandez, 33. He and his wife, Julieanna, have a daughter, \n     5, and a son, 7.\n       His children are older now and realize the dangers of \n     combat. ``They're more cognizant of what's going on,'' \n     Hernandez said.\n       During Monday's ceremony at the Soldier's Field House, the \n     maroon colors of the brigade were cased, or covered. They'll \n     be uncased when the first soldiers arrive in Iraq.\n       Members of the brigade will be leaving through the end of \n     November. The headquarters will be at Camp Victory near \n     Baghdad.\n       During the 35-minute ceremony, an audience of several \n     hundred family members and other soldiers broke into applause \n     repeatedly.\n       The crowd was quick to cheer when Brig. Gen. Sheila Baxter \n     asked for a round of applause for ``these great soldiers.''\n       ``The mission going forward is still complex and the enemy \n     is still dangerous,'' said Baxter, commander of Madigan Army \n     Medical Center. ``We are certain of your success and we are \n     grateful for your brave service.''\n       ``We pray for your safety,'' Baxter said.\n       Sgt. Kelly Perryman, 26, and her husband, Sgt. 1st Class \n     Tremayne Perryman, 30, will both be going to Iraq, but the \n     two medics don't know if they'll be based near each other.\n\n[[Page S8890]]\n\n       Kelly Perryman summed up her feelings for her second trip \n     to Iraq in one word: nervous.\n       Their 4-month-old baby boy, Jeffrey, will stay with her \n     mother in Detroit.\n       ``This will be our first time being apart,'' Kelly Perryman \n     said about her baby. ``That's kind of scary.''\n       Sgt. Derek Trubia, 32, said he was ready for his first tour \n     in Iraq.\n       ``I have no problem,'' Trubia said. ``I expected it.''\n       The brigade, which served in Iraq in 2003 and Kuwait in \n     2004-05, plays a life-saving role for U.S. and Iraqi soldiers \n     through trauma care and surgery.\n       Among its other specialties are dental health, preventive \n     medicine and stress control.\n       In his invocation, Chaplain Maj. Mark Mitera prayed for \n     ``healing and hope for those they treat.''\n       He offered thanks ``for supplying these soldiers with \n     strength for war and skill for battle.''\n       Col. Patrick Sargent, brigade commander, noted in an \n     interview that U.S. soldiers are more spread out in Iraq, and \n     the numbers of casualties and injuries are rising. Besides \n     treating physical wounds, the brigade will care for the \n     mental health of injured soldiers and its own members who \n     witness trauma, he said.\n       ``We will face adversity, danger,'' Sargent told the crowd.\n       But he said the brigade is fully trained and will prevail.\n       ``The soldiers standing before you today embody the essence \n     of patriotism,'' Sargent said.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 1585, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1585) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2008 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Nelson of Nebraska (for Levin) amendment No. 2011, in the \n     nature of a substitute.\n       Webb amendment No. 2012 (to amendment No. 2011), to specify \n     minimum periods between deployment of units and members of \n     the Armed Forces for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation \n     Enduring Freedom.\n       Nelson of Florida amendment No. 2013 (to amendment No. \n     2012), to change the enactment date.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again, I would like to thank my old friend \nfrom Hawaii for his patience so that, as the Republican ranking member \nof the committee, I may make a statement about the bill itself and \nabout the situation in Iraq. I thank him for his courtesy, and I will \ntry not to take too long a period of time. So I thank my old friend \nfrom Hawaii.\n  Mr. President, we have reached another moment of importance this week \nin debating the fiscal year 2008 Defense authorization bill. We will \nhelp set the course of the Nation's security policy and influence our \nparticipation in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Much of the debate, \nas we all know, will be about Iraq, and before I discuss that and my \nrecent visit, I would note that many provisions in this bill constitute \na good defense policy and will strengthen the ability of our country to \ndefend itself.\n  Under the leadership of my good friend from Michigan, the chairman of \nthe committee, Senator Levin, I think we have crafted an excellent \npiece of legislation. I think a testament to his leadership is that the \ncommittee voted unanimously to report the bill, and it fully funds the \nPresident's $648 billion defense budget request. It provides necessary \nmeasures to try to bring under control waste, fraud, and abuse in \ndefense procurement, and, frankly, it makes Members more accountable \nfor their spending in the earmark process.\n\n  Again, I thank Senator Levin, the subcommittee chairs, and all the \ncommittee members for their work in bringing this issue to the floor.\n  Very briefly, we have authorized a 3.5-percent, across-the-board pay \nraise for all military personnel. We have increased Army and Marine end \nstrength to 525,400 and 189,000, respectively. The committee also \napproved $2.7 billion for items on the Army Chief of Staff's unfunded \nrequirement list, including $775 million for reactive armor and other \nStryker requirements, $207 million for aviation survivability \nequipment, $102 million for combat training centers and funding for \nexplosive ordnance disposal equipment, night vision devices, and \nmachine guns.\n  The bill also authorizes $4.1 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush \nProtected vehicles, known as MRAP vehicles, for all of the Services' \nknown requirements.\n  The committee has come up with the money to support our troops, and I \nhave no doubt the full Senate will follow step.\n  Money and policy statements are not all that is required at this \nmoment in our national history. Courage is required--courage, not the \ngreat courage exhibited by the brave men and women fighting today in \nIraq and Afghanistan, but a smaller measure: the courage necessary to \nput our country's interests before every personal or political \nconsideration.\n  In this light, I would like to discuss America's involvement in Iraq, \nand finally I would like to make several points.\n  Final reinforcements needed to implement General Petraeus's \ncounterinsurgency tactics arrived just several weeks ago. Last week I \nhad the opportunity to visit with troops in theater. From what I saw \nand heard while there, I believe our military, in cooperation with the \nIraqi security forces, is making progress in a number of areas. There \nare other areas where they are not. I would like to outline some of \ntheir efforts, not to argue that these areas have suddenly become \nsafe--they have not; I want to emphasize the areas have not become \nsafe--but to illustrate the progress our military has achieved under \nGeneral Petraeus's new strategy.\n  Last year Anbar Province was believed to be lost to al-Qaida. On the \nmap we see that U.S. and Iraqi troops cleaned out al-Qaida fighters \nfrom Ramadi and other areas of western Anbar. Tribal sheiks broke with \nthe terrorists and joined the coalition side. It is a fact that some 16 \nout of the 24 sheiks in the Sunni area of Anbar Province have now \njoined with U.S. forces in their commitment to destroy al-Qaida in \nAnbar Province.\n  Ramadi, months ago, was Iraq's most dangerous city. It is now one of \nits safest. At considerable political risk, I point out that I visited, \nwith Senator Graham, downtown Ramadi where the shopping areas were \nopen. I did not visit without protection or without security forces \nwith me. But the fact is, a short time ago it was one of the most \ndangerous cities in all of Iraq. Attacks are down from 30 to 35 a day \nin February to zero on most days now.\n  In Fallujah, Iraqi police have established numerous stations and have \ndivided the city into gated districts. The violence has declined and \nlocal intelligence tips have proliferated. Throughout Anbar Province, \nthousands of young men are signing up for the police and Army, and the \nlocals are taking the fight to al-Qaida. All 18 major tribes in the \nprovince are now onboard with the security plan. A year from now, the \nIraqi Army and police could have total control of security in Ramadi, \nallowing American forces to safely draw down.\n  South of Baghdad, operation Phantom Thunder is intended to stop \ninsurgents present in the Baghdad belts from originating attacks in the \ncapital itself. A brigade of the 10th Mountain Division, which I \nvisited, is operating in Baghdad belts that have been havens for al-\nQaida. All soldiers in the brigade are living forward. That means they \nare in outposts away from the headquarters 24-7, living, working, and \nfighting alongside Iraqi military. Commanders report that the local \nsheiks\n\n[[Page S8891]]\n\nare increasingly siding with the coalition against al-Qaida.\n  Southeast of Baghdad, the military is targeting al-Qaida in safe \nhavens they maintain along the Tigris River. In Baghdad itself, the \nmilitary, in cooperation with Iraqi security forces, continues to \nestablish joint security stations and deploy throughout the city. These \nefforts have produced some positive results. Sectarian violence has \nfallen. Since January, the total number of car bombings and suicide \nattacks declined. In May and June, the number of locals coming forward \nwith intelligence tips has risen.\n  Make no mistake, violence in Baghdad remains at unacceptably high \nlevels, suicide bombers and other threats pose formidable challenges, \nand other difficulties abound. Nevertheless, there appears to be \noverall movement in the right direction.\n  I have no doubt how difficult suicide bombers are to counter. Ask the \nIsraelis. They literally had to seal their borders with Gaza and the \nWest Bank because of the way people who are willing to sacrifice their \nown lives in order to take the lives of others are able to get through \nand do these horrendous acts that we are exposed to quite often on our \ntelevision screens and in our newspapers in America.\n  In Diyala Province, Iraqi and American troops have surged and are \nfighting to deny al-Qaida sanctuary in the city of Baqubah. For the \nfirst time since the war began, Americans showed up in force and did \nnot quickly withdraw from the area. In response, locals have formed a \nnew alliance with the coalition to counter al-Qaida.\n  Why are some of these people now turning against al-Qaida? One reason \nis the extreme cruelty that is practiced by al-Qaida on a routine \nbasis, which has caused many people to reject that kind of extreme \nviolence and cruelty inflicted on the local people. Diyala, which was \nthe center of Abu Mus' Ab al-Zarqawi's caliphate, finally has the \nchance to turn aside the forces of extremism.\n  I offer these observations not to present a rosy scenario of the \nchallenges we continue to face in Iraq. As last weekend's horrific \nbombing indicates so graphically, the threats to Iraqi stability have \nnot gone away, nor are they likely to go away in the near future when \nour brave men and women in Iraq will continue to face great challenges.\n  What I do believe is, while the mission to bring a degree of security \nto Iraq and to Baghdad and its environs in particular in order to \nestablish the necessary preconditions for political and economic \nprogress--while that mission is still in its early stages, the progress \nour military has made should encourage us. It is also clear the overall \nstrategy that General Petraeus has put into place, a traditional \ncounterinsurgency tactic that emphasizes protecting a population and \nwhich gets our troops off of the bases and into the areas they are \ntrying to protect--that this strategy is the correct one.\n\n  Some of my colleagues argue that we should return troops to the \nforward operating bases and confine their activities to training and \ntargeted counterterrorism operations. That is precisely what we did for \n3\\1/2\\ years, and the situation in Iraq got worse. Over 3\\1/2\\ years we \nhad our troops from operating bases going out--search and destroy as we \nused to call it during the Vietnam war--and going back to their bases. \nThat was a failed strategy from the beginning. I am surprised that any \nof my colleagues would advocate a return to the failed Rumsfeld-Casey \nstrategy.\n  No one can be certain whether this new strategy, which remains in the \nearly stages, can bring about greater stability. We can be sure, should \nthe Senate seek to legislate an end to this strategy as it is just \nbeginning, then we will fail for certain.\n  Now that the military effort in Iraq is showing some signs of \nprogress, the space is opening for political progress. Yet rather than \nseizing the opportunity, the government of Prime Minister Maliki is not \nfunctioning as it must. I repeat, the government of Prime Minister \nMaliki is not functioning as it must. We see little evidence of \nreconciliation and little progress toward meeting the benchmarks laid \nout by the President. The Iraqi Government can function. The question \nis whether it will.\n  To encourage political progress, I believe we can find wisdom in \nseveral suggestions put forward recently by Henry Kissinger. \nIntensified negotiations by the Iraqi parties could limit violence, \npromote reconciliation, and put the political system on a more stable \nfooting. We should promote dialog between the Iraqi Government and its \nSunni Arab neighbors, specifically Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, in \norder to build broader international acceptance for the Iraqi central \ngovernment in exchange for that government meeting specific obligations \nwith respect to the protection and political participation of the Sunni \nminority. We should begin a broader effort to establish a basis for aid \nand even peacekeeping efforts by the international community, keyed to \npolitical progress in Iraq.\n  Taking such steps, we must recognize that no lasting political \nsettlement can grow out of the U.S. withdrawal. On the contrary, a \nwithdrawal must grow out of a political solution, a solution made \npossible by the imposition of security by coalition and Iraqi forces.\n  Secretary Kissinger is correct when he says ``precipitate withdrawal \nwould produce a disaster,'' one that ``would not end the war but shift \nit to other areas, like Lebanon or Jordan or Saudi Arabia,'' produce \ngreater violence among Iraqi factions, and embolden radical Islamists \naround the world.\n\n       The war between Iraqi factions would intensify. The \n     demonstration of American impotence would embolden radical \n     Islamism and further radicalize its disciples from Indonesia \n     and India to the suburbs of European capitals . . .\n       What America and the world need is not unilateral \n     withdrawal but a vision by the Bush administration of a \n     sustainable political end to the conflict.\n\n  As I said before, withdrawals must grow out of a political solution, \nnot the other way around.\n  The Shias and the Sunnis and the Kurds:\n\n       They need the buttress of a diplomatic process that could \n     provide international support for carrying out any internal \n     agreements reached or to contain conflict if the internal \n     parties cannot agree and Iraq breaks up . . .\n       The American goal should be an international agreement \n     regarding the international status of Iraq. It would test \n     whether Iraq's neighbors as well as some more distant \n     countries are prepared to translate general concepts into \n     converging policies. It would provide a legal and political \n     framework to resist violations. These are the meaningful \n     benchmarks against which to test American withdrawals.\n\n  He goes on to point out:\n\n       Turkey has repeatedly emphasized it would resist a breakup \n     by force because of the radicalizing impact a Kurdish State \n     could have on Turkey's large Kurdish population. But this \n     would bring Turkey into unwanted conflict with the United \n     States and open a Pandora's box of other interventions.\n       Saudi Arabia and Jordan dread Shiite domination of Iraq, \n     especially if the Baghdad regime threatens to become a \n     satellite of Iran. The various Gulf Sheikdoms, the largest of \n     which is Kuwait, find themselves in an even more threatened \n     position.\n       Syria's attitudes are likely to be more ambivalent. Its \n     ties to Iran represent both a claim to status and a looming \n     vulnerability . . .\n       Given a wise and determined American diplomacy, even Iran \n     may be brought to conclude that the risks of continued \n     turmoil outweigh the temptations before it.\n\n  He goes on to talk about a multilateral framework.\n\n       A forum for diplomacy already exists in the foreign \n     ministers' conference that met recently at Sharm el-Sheikh, \n     Egypt. . . . It is in the United States' interests to turn \n     the conference into a working enterprise under strong, if \n     discrete, American leadership.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Neither the international system nor American public \n     opinion will accept as a permanent arrangement, an American \n     enclave maintained exclusively by American military power in \n     so volatile a region.\n\n  I believe Secretary Kissinger is correct. I believe he is correct \nwhen he bases the premise that precipitate withdrawal would produce a \ndisaster.\n  Many of my colleagues would like to believe that should any of the \nvarious amendments forcing withdrawal become law, it would mark the end \nof this long effort. They are wrong.\n  Should the Congress force a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq, it \nwould mark a new beginning, the start of a new, more dangerous, more \narduous effort to contain the forces unleashed by our disengagement. \nOur efforts in Iraq today are critical to the wider struggle against \nviolent Islamic extremism. Already the terrorists are emboldened,\n\n[[Page S8892]]\n\nexcited that America is talking not about winning in Iraq but is rather \ndebating when we should lose.\n  Last week, Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaida's deputy chief, said the \nUnited States is merely delaying our ``inevitable'' defeat in Iraq and \nthat: ``The Mujahideen of Islam in Iraq of the caliphate and jihad are \nadvancing with steady steps toward victory.''\n  If we leave Iraq prematurely, jihadists around the world will \ninterpret the withdrawal as their great victory against our great \npower. The movement thrives in an atmosphere of perceived victory. We \nsaw this in the surge of men and money flowing to al-Qaida following \nthe Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n  If they defeat the United States in Iraq, they will believe anything \nis possible, history is on their side, and they can bring their \nterrible rule to lands the world over.\n  Recall the plan laid out in a letter from Zawahiri to Abu Mus'ab al-\nZarqawi before his death. That plan is to take shape in four stages: \nEstablish a caliphate in Iraq, extend the jihad wave to the secular \ncountries neighboring Iraq, clash with Israel; none of which shall \ncommence until the completion of stage one: Expel the Americans from \nIraq. The terrorists are in this war to win it. The question is, Are \nwe?\n  Withdrawing before there is a stable and legitimate Iraqi authority \nwould turn Iraq into a failed state and a terrorist sanctuary in the \nheart of the Middle East. We have seen a failed state emerge after U.S. \ndisengagement once before. It cost us terribly. In pre-9/11 \nAfghanistan, terrorists found sanctuary to train and plan attacks with \nimpunity. We know that today there are terrorists in Iraq who are \nplanning attacks against Americans. I do not think we should make this \nmistake twice.\n  Brent Scowcroft, whom we also know was opposed to the invasion of \nIraq in the first place, has said:\n\n       The costs of staying are visible. The costs of getting out \n     are almost never discussed . . . If we get out before Iraq is \n     stable, the entire Middle East region might start to resemble \n     Iraq today. Getting out is not a solution.\n\n  One of my great heroes and role models and a person whom I have had \nthe great honor of getting to know recently is Natan Sharansky, a man \nof inestimable courage and knowledge. He recently had a piece that ran \nSunday in the Washington Post. The title of his piece is: ``Leave Iraq, \nEmbrace for a Bigger Bloodbath.''\n  In his statement, he talks about:\n\n       The truth is that in totalitarian regimes, there are no \n     human rights. Period. The media do not criticize the \n     government. Parliaments do not check executive power. Courts \n     do not uphold due process. And human rights groups do not \n     file reports.\n\n  He talks about the moral divide that separates societies in which \npeople are slaves, from societies in which people are free.\n  ``Some human rights groups undermine the very cause they claim to \nchampion,'' he says.\n\n       Consider one 2005 Amnesty International report on Iraq. It \n     notes that in the lawless climate of the first months after \n     Hussein's overthrow, reports of kidnappings, rapes and \n     killings of women and girls by criminal gangs rose. Iraqi \n     officers at a police station in Baghdad said in June 2003 \n     that the number of reported rapes was ``substantially higher \n     than before the war.''\n       The implication was that human rights may not really be \n     improving in post-Hussein Iraq. But the organization ignored \n     the possibility that reports of rape at police stations may \n     have increased for the simple reason that under Hussein it \n     was the regime--which includes the police--that was doing the \n     raping.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       A precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces could lead to a \n     bloodbath that would make the current carnage pale by \n     comparison.\n\n  I am quoting from Natan Sharansky.\n\n       Without U.S. troops in place to quell some of the violence, \n     Iranian-backed Shiite militias would dramatically increase \n     their attacks on Sunnis; Sunni militias, backed by the Saudis \n     or others, would retaliate in kind, drawing more and more of \n     Iraq into a vicious cycle of violence. If Iraq descended into \n     full-blown civil war, the chaos could trigger similar clashes \n     throughout the region as Sunni-Shiite tensions spill across \n     Iraq's borders. The death toll and the displacement civilians \n     would climb exponentially.\n\n  He says:\n\n       Perhaps the greatest irony of the political debate over \n     Iraq is that many of Bush's critics, who accused his \n     administration of going blindly to war without considering \n     what would happen once Hussein's regime was toppled, now \n     blindly support a policy of withdrawing from Iraq without \n     considering what might follow.\n       In this respect, the debate over Iraq is beginning to look \n     a lot like the debate about the Vietnam War in the 1960s and \n     1970s. Then, too, the argument in the United States focused \n     primarily on whether U.S. forces should pull out. But many \n     who supported that withdrawal in the name of human rights did \n     not foresee the calamity that followed, which included \n     genocide in Cambodia, tens of thousands slaughtered in \n     Vietnam by the North Vietnamese and the tragedy of hundreds \n     of thousands of ``boat people.''\n\n  Mr. Sharansky lives in the neighborhood. Mr. Sharansky understands \nthe meaning of the word ``freedom.'' Mr. Sharansky understands the \nmeaning of the word ``sacrifice.''\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the Kissinger and Sharansky articles.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  [From the International Herald Tribune Media Services, July 2, 2007]\n\n                    A Political Program To Exit Iraq\n\n                        (By Henry A. Kissinger)\n\n       The war in Iraq is approaching a kind of self-imposed \n     climax. Public disenchantment is palpable. Congress will \n     surely press for an accelerated, if not total, withdrawal of \n     American forces. Demands for a political solution are likely \n     to mount.\n       But precipitate withdrawal would produce a disaster. It \n     would not end the war but shift it to other areas, like \n     Lebanon or Jordan or Saudi Arabia. The war between the Iraqi \n     factions would intensify. The demonstration of American \n     impotence would embolden radical Islamism and further \n     radicalize its disciples from Indonesia and India to the \n     suburbs of European capitals.\n       We face a number of paradoxes. Military victory, in the \n     sense of establishing a government capable of enforcing its \n     writ throughout Iraq, is not possible in a time frame \n     tolerated by the American political process. Yet no political \n     solution is conceivable in isolation from the situation on \n     the ground.\n       What America and the world need is not unilateral \n     withdrawal but a vision by the administration of a \n     sustainable political end to the conflict. Withdrawals must \n     grow out of a political solution, not the other way around.\n       None of Iraq's neighbors, not even Iran, is in a position \n     to dominate the situation against the opposition of all the \n     other interested parties. Is it possible to build a \n     sustainable outcome on such considerations?\n       The answer must be sought on three levels: the internal, \n     the regional and the international.\n       The internal parties--the Shiites, the Sunnis and the \n     Kurds--have been subjected to insistent American appeals to \n     achieve national reconciliation. But groups that have been \n     conducting blood feuds with one another for centuries are, \n     not surprisingly, struggling in their efforts to compose \n     their differences by constitutional means. They need the \n     buttress of a diplomatic process that could provide \n     international support for carrying out any internal \n     agreements reached or to contain their conflict if the \n     internal parties cannot agree and Iraq breaks up.\n       The American goal should be an international agreement \n     regarding the international status of Iraq. It would test \n     whether the neighbors of Iraq as well as some more distant \n     countries are prepared to translate general concepts into \n     converging policies. It would provide a legal and political \n     framework to resist violations. These are the meaningful \n     benchmarks against which to test American withdrawals.\n       The reason why such a diplomacy may prove feasible is that \n     the continuation of Iraq's current crisis presents all of \n     Iraq's neighbors with mounting problems. The longer the war \n     in Iraq rages, the more likely will be the breakup of the \n     country into sectarian units.\n       Turkey has repeatedly emphasized that it would resist such \n     a breakup by force because of the radicalizing impact that a \n     Kurdish state could have on Turkey's large Kurdish \n     population. But this would bring Turkey into unwanted \n     conflict with the United States and open a Pandora's box of \n     other interventions.\n       Saudi Arabia and Jordan dread Shiite domination of Iraq, \n     especially if the Baghdad regime threatens to become a \n     satellite of Iran. The various Gulf sheikhdoms, the largest \n     of which is Kuwait, find themselves in an even more \n     threatened position. Syria's attitudes are likely to be more \n     ambivalent. Its ties to Iran represent both a claim to status \n     and a looming vulnerability.\n       Given a wise and determined American diplomacy, even Iran \n     may be brought to conclude that the risks of continued \n     turmoil outweigh the temptations before it.\n       To be sure, Iranian leaders may believe that the wind is at \n     their backs, that the moment is uniquely favorable to realize \n     millennial visions of a reincarnated Persian empire or a \n     reversal of the Shiite-Sunni split under Shiite domination. \n     On the other hand, if prudent leaders exist--which remains to \n     be determined--they might come to the conclusion that they \n     had better treat these advantages as a bargaining chip in a \n     negotiation\n\n[[Page S8893]]\n\n     rather than risk them in a contest over domination of the \n     region.\n       No American president will, in the end, acquiesce once the \n     full consequences of Iranian domination of the region become \n     apparent. Russia will have its own reasons, principally the \n     fear of the radicalization of its own Islamic minority, to \n     begin resisting Iranian and radical Islamist domination of \n     the Gulf. Combined with the international controversy over \n     its nuclear weapons program, Iran's challenge could come to \n     be perceived by its leaders to pose excessive risks.\n       Whether or whenever Iran reaches these conclusions, two \n     conditions will have to be met: First, no serious diplomacy \n     can be based on the premise that the United States is the \n     supplicant. America and its allies must demonstrate a \n     determination to vindicate their vital interests that Iran \n     will find credible. Second, the United States will need to \n     put forward a diplomatic position that acknowledges the \n     legitimate security interests of Iran.\n       Such a negotiation must be initiated within a genuinely \n     multilateral forum. A dramatic bilateral Iranian-U.S. \n     negotiation would magnify all the region's insecurities. For \n     if Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait--which have \n     entrusted their security primarily to the United States--\n     become convinced that an Iranian-U.S. condominium is looming, \n     a race for Tehran's favor may bring about the disintegration \n     of all resolve.\n       Within a multilateral framework, the United States will be \n     able to conduct individual conversations with the key \n     participants, as has happened in the six-party forum on North \n     Korea.\n       A forum for such an effort already exists in the foreign \n     ministers' conference that met recently at Sharm el-Sheikh. \n     It is in the United States' interest to turn the conference \n     into a working enterprise under strong, if discreet, American \n     leadership.\n       The purpose of such a forum should be to define the \n     international status of the emerging Iraqi political \n     structure into a series of reciprocal obligations. Iraq would \n     continue to evolve as a sovereign state but agree to place \n     itself under some international restraint in return for \n     specific guarantees.\n       In such a scheme, the United States-led multinational force \n     would be gradually transformed into an agent of that \n     arrangement, along the lines of the Bosnian settlement in the \n     Balkans.\n       All this suggests a three-tiered international effort: an \n     intensified negotiation among the Iraqi parties; a regional \n     forum like the Sharm el-Sheikh conference to elaborate an \n     international transition status for Iraq; and a broader \n     conference to establish the peacekeeping and verification \n     dimensions. The rest of the world cannot indefinitely pretend \n     to be bystanders to a process that could engulf them through \n     their default.\n       Neither the international system nor American public \n     opinion will accept as a permanent arrangement an American \n     enclave maintained exclusively by American military power in \n     so volatile a region. The concept outlined here seeks to \n     establish a new international framework for Iraq. It is an \n     outcome emerging from a political and military situation on \n     the ground and not from artificial deadlines.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, July 8, 2007]\n\n              Leave Iraq and Brace for a Bigger Bloodbath\n\n                          (By Natan Sharansky)\n\n       Iraqis call Ali Hassan al-Majeed ``Chemical Ali,'' and few \n     wept when the notorious former general received five death \n     sentences last month for ordering the use of nerve agents \n     against his government's Kurdish citizens in the late 1980s. \n     His trial came as a reckoning and a reminder--summoning up \n     the horrors of Saddam Hussein's rule even as it underscored \n     the way today's heated Iraq debates in Washington have left \n     the key issue of human rights on the sidelines. People of \n     goodwill can certainly disagree over how to handle Iraq, but \n     human rights should be part of any responsible calculus. \n     Unfortunately, some leaders continue to play down the gross \n     violations in Iraq under Hussein's republic of fear and \n     ignore the potential for a human rights catastrophe should \n     the United States withdraw.\n       As the hideous violence in Iraq continues, it has become \n     increasingly common to hear people argue that the world was \n     better off with Hussein in power and (even more remarkably) \n     that Iraqis were better off under his fist. In his final \n     interview as U.N. secretary general, Kofi Annan acknowledged \n     that Iraq ``had a dictator who was brutal'' but said that \n     Iraqis under the Baathist dictatorship ``had their streets, \n     they could go out, their kids could go to school.''\n       This line of argument began soon after the U.S.-led \n     invasion in 2003. By early 2004, some prominent political and \n     intellectual leaders were arguing that women's rights, gay \n     rights, health care and much else had suffered in post-\n     Hussein Iraq.\n       Following in the footsteps of George Bernard Shaw, Walter \n     Duranty and other Western liberals who served as willing \n     dupes for Joseph Stalin, some members of the human rights \n     community are whitewashing totalitarianism. A textbook \n     example came last year from John Pace, who recently left his \n     post as U.N. human rights chief in Iraq. ``Under Saddam,'' he \n     said, according to the Associated Press, ``if you agreed to \n     forgo your basic freedom of expression and thought, you were \n     physically more or less OK.''\n       The truth is that in totalitarian regimes, there are no \n     human rights. Period. The media do not criticize the \n     government. Parliaments do not check executive power. Courts \n     do not uphold due process. And human rights groups don't file \n     reports.\n       For most people, life under totalitarianism is slavery with \n     no possibility of escape. That is why despite the carnage in \n     Iraq, Iraqis are consistently less pessimistic about the \n     present and more optimistic about the future of their country \n     than Americans are. In a face-to-face national poll of 5,019 \n     people conducted this spring by Opinion Research Business, a \n     British market-research firm, only 27 percent of Iraqis said \n     they believed ``that their country is actually in a state of \n     civil war,'' and by nearly 2 to 1 (49 percent to 26 percent), \n     the Iraqis surveyed said they preferred life under their new \n     government to life under the old tyranny. That is why, at a \n     time when many Americans are abandoning the vision of a \n     democratic Iraq, most Iraqis still cling to the hope of a \n     better future. They know that under Hussein, there was no \n     hope.\n       By consistently ignoring the fundamental moral divide that \n     separates societies in which people are slaves from societies \n     in which people are free, some human rights groups undermine \n     the very cause they claim to champion. Consider one 2005 \n     Amnesty International report on Iraq. It notes that in the \n     lawless climate of the first months after Hussein's \n     overthrow, reports of kidnappings, rapes and killings of \n     women and girls by criminal gangs rose. Iraqi officers at a \n     police station in Baghdad said in June 2003 that the number \n     of reported rapes ``was substantially higher than before the \n     war.''\n       The implication was that human rights may not really be \n     improving in post-Hussein Iraq. But the organization ignored \n     the possibility that reports of rape at police stations may \n     have increased for the simple reason that under Hussein it \n     was the regime--which includes the police--that was doing the \n     raping. When Hussein's son Uday went on his legendary raping \n     sprees, victims were not about to report the crime.\n       Of course, Hussein's removal has created a host of \n     difficult strategic challenges, and numerous human rights \n     atrocities have been committed since his ouster. But let us \n     be under no illusion of what life under Hussein was like. He \n     was a mass murderer who tortured children in front of their \n     parents, gassed Kurds, slaughtered Shiites, started two wars \n     with his neighbors and launched Scud missiles into downtown \n     Riyadh and Tel Aviv. The price for the stability that Hussein \n     supposedly brought to the region was mass graves, hundreds of \n     thousands of dead in Iraq, and terrorism and war outside it. \n     Difficult as the challenges are today--with Iran and Syria \n     trying to stymie democracy in Iraq, with al-Qaeda turning \n     Iraq into the central battleground in its holy war of \n     terrorism against the free world, and with sectarian militias \n     bent on murder and mayhem--there is still hope that tomorrow \n     may be better.\n       No one can know for sure whether President Bush's ``surge'' \n     of U.S. troops in Iraq will succeed. But those who believe \n     that human rights should play a central role in international \n     affairs should be doing everything in their power to maximize \n     the chances that it will. For one of the consequences of \n     failure could well be catastrophe.\n       A precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces could lead to a \n     bloodbath that would make the current carnage pale by \n     comparison. Without U.S. troops in place to quell some of the \n     violence, Iranian-backed Shiite militias would dramatically \n     increase their attacks on Sunnis; Sunni militias, backed by \n     the Saudis or others, would retaliate in kind, drawing more \n     and more of Iraq into a vicious cycle of violence. If Iraq \n     descended into full-blown civil war, the chaos could trigger \n     similar clashes throughout the region as Sunni-Shiite \n     tensions spill across Iraq's borders. The death toll and the \n     displacement of civilians could climb exponentially.\n       Perhaps the greatest irony of the political debate over \n     Iraq is that many of Bush's critics, who accused his \n     administration of going blindly to war without considering \n     what would happen once Hussein's regime was toppled, now \n     blindly support a policy of withdrawing from Iraq without \n     considering what might follow.\n       In this respect, the debate over Iraq is beginning to look \n     a lot like the debate about the Vietnam War in the 1960s and \n     '70s. Then, too, the argument in the United States focused \n     primarily on whether U.S. forces should pull out. But many \n     who supported that withdrawal in the name of human rights did \n     not foresee the calamity that followed, which included \n     genocide in Cambodia, tens of thousands slaughtered in \n     Vietnam by the North Vietnamese and the tragedy of hundreds \n     of thousands of ``boat people.''\n       In the final analysis, U.S. leaders will pursue a course in \n     Iraq that they believe best serves U.S. interests. My hope is \n     that as they do, they will make the human rights dimension a \n     central part of any decision. The consequences of not doing \n     so might prove catastrophic to Iraqis, to regional peace and, \n     ultimately, to U.S. security.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Should we leave Iraq before there is a basic level of \nstability, we will invite further Iranian influence at a time when \nIranian operatives are already moving weapons, training fighters, \nproviding resources and helping plan operations to\n\n[[Page S8894]]\n\nkill American soldiers and damage our efforts to bring stability to \nIraq.\n  Iran will comfortably step into the power vacuum left by a U.S. \nwithdrawal, and such an aggrandizement of fundamentalist power has \ngreat potential to spark greater Sunni-Shia conflict across the region.\n  Leaving prematurely would induce Iraq's neighbors, including Saudi \nArabia and Jordan, Egypt and Israel, Turkey and others, to feel their \nown security eroding and may well induce them to act in ways that \nprompt wider instability. The potential for genocide, wider war, \nspiralling oil prices, and the perception of strategic American defeat \nis real.\n  This fight is about Iraq but not about Iraq alone. It is greater than \nthat and, more important still, about whether America still has the \npolitical courage to fight for victory or whether we will settle for \ndefeat, with all the terrible things that accompany it. We cannot walk \naway gracefully from defeat in this war.\n  General Petraeus and his commanders believe they have a strategy that \ncan, over time, lead to success in Iraq. General Petraeus and \nAmbassador Ryan Crocker will come to Washington in September to report \non the status of their efforts and those of the Iraqis. They ask two \nthings of us: the time necessary to see whether their efforts can \nsucceed and the political courage to support them in their work. I \nbelieve we should give them both.\n  I know that Senators are tired of this war, tired of the mounting \ndeath toll, tired of the many mistakes we have made in this war and the \ngreat effort it requires to reverse them, tired of the war's \npoliticization and the degree to which it has become embroiled in \npartisan struggles and election strategies. I understand this fatigue. \nYet I maintain that we, as elected leaders with a duty to our people \nand the security of their Nation, cannot let fatigue dictate our \npolicies.\n  The soldiers I met last week have no illusions about the sacrifices \nnecessary to achieve their mission. On July 4, I had the great \nprivilege to be present as 588 troops reenlisted in the military and \nanother 161 were naturalized as U.S. citizens. Tragically, two of those \nwho were scheduled to be naturalized as U.S. citizens were killed very \nshortly before the ceremony.\n  Those men and women taking the oaths of enlistment and citizenship in \nthe center of Saddam's al Faw Palace, they understand the many \nhardships made in our name. They have completed tour after tour away \nfrom their families, risking everything, everything for the security of \nthis country. They do so because they understand the circumstances \nthat, however great the costs of this war, the costs are immeasurably \ngreater still if we abandon it prematurely. All they ask is that we \nsupport them in their noble mission.\n  I wish we had planned to fight this war correctly the first time. But \nwe can no more turn back the clock to 2003 than we can wish away the \nconsequences of defeat by imposing some artificial deadline for \nwithdrawal. Last week in Iraq, I met the bravest men and women our \ncountry has to offer, and not one of them told me it was time to go or \nthat the cause is lost.\n  They are frustrated with the Iraqi Government's lack of progress. \nThey are buffeted by the winds of partisanship in Washington, talking \ntoday of surges and tomorrow of withdrawal, voting to confirm General \nPetraeus and then voting for a course that guarantees defeat. But in \nthe end, they know the war in Iraq is part of a larger struggle, a war \nof moderation and stability against the forces of violence and \nextremism.\n  They recognize that if we simply pack up and leave, the war does not \nend--it merely gets harder.\n  Finally, I would like to give a couple of quotes. General Lynch, who \nis the third ID commander of the U.S. forces, says:\n\n       Pulling out before the mission was accomplished would be a \n     mess. We find the enemy regaining ground, reestablishing \n     sanctuaries, building more IEDs and the violence would \n     escalate.\n\n  GEN Anthony Zinni, one of my particular heroes, who opposed the war \nin Iraq, said:\n\n       . . . that we cannot simply pull out of Iraq, as much as we \n     may want to. The consequences of a destabilized and chaotic \n     Iraq, sitting in the center of a critical region of the \n     world, could have catastrophic implications. . . .There is no \n     short-term solution. It will take years to stabilize Iraq. \n     How many? I believe at least five to seven.\n\n  In the Baker Hamilton report, there is a lot of selective quoting. \nBut I would like to point out that they said:\n\n       Because of the importance of Iraq, the potential for \n     catastrophe in the role and the commitments of the United \n     States in initiating events that have led to the current \n     situation, we believe it would be wrong for the United States \n     to abandon the country through a precipitous withdrawal of \n     troops and support. A premature American departure from Iraq \n     would almost certainly produce greater sectarian violence and \n     further deterioration of conditions, leading to a number of \n     adverse consequences outlined above. The near-term results \n     would be a significant power vacuum, greater human suffering, \n     regional destabilization, and a threat to the global economy. \n     Al-Qaeda would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory. \n     If we leave and Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range \n     consequences could eventually require the United States to \n     return.\n\n  That is page 30 of the Iraq Study Group report.\n  Finally, I understand, I believe very well, how difficult this issue \nis for many of our Members. I know the sorrow and the frustration that \nthey and their constituents feel. If I knew a great option as to how we \ncould preserve our Nation's security and withdraw and stop the \nunfortunate casualties that are incurred by these brave young people, I \nwould embrace it tomorrow.\n  Part of this debate is going to be proposals that people have made \nabout how we can best leave. I intend to engage in vigorous discussion \nand debate. I would like to again begin this debate by pointing out I \nrespect the views of my colleagues on this issue.\n  I understand their frustration. I intend to be respectful of their \nviews, and I hope we can have a debate and discussion on this issue, as \nwe consider various amendments, that will better inform the American \npeople of both points of view. I hope over time somehow we can find a \nway to come together in this body and in this Nation because this war \nhas divided this Nation in the most terrible way.\n  I saw it once before. I saw it once before, a long time ago, and I \nsaw a defeated military, and I saw how long it took a military that was \ndefeated to recover. I saw a divided nation beset by assassinations and \nriots and a breakdown in a civil society. That is why we need, in my \nview, to try to come together--and I do not know how we do that--\nbeginning with respecting each other's views so we can come together \nand hopefully end the tragedy of Iraq and at the same time ensure \nAmerica's security.\n  I will be saying a lot more on this issue as we continue the debate. \nI say again, I respect the views of my colleagues. Then, finally, I \nagain pay my compliments to the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, who put together, as is his wont, a bipartisan package that \nwill ensure our Nation's security in the future, as exemplified again \nby a unanimous vote of the committee in reporting out the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, let me first thank Senator McCain for his \ngreat generosity in terms of his comments about the committee and the \noperations of our committee. As he well knows, our committee has had a \ngreat tradition of bipartisanship. He has made a major contribution, \nalways, to that tradition. As ranking member, he has more than \ncontinued that tradition. He has made a major contribution to it and to \nthe bill that is before us and to the bipartisan flavor of that bill.\n  While there obviously are and will be differences--which are \nunderstandable and appropriate--as he well points out, this is a bill \nthat had unanimous support in the committee. We, in the next week or \nso, will be hearing differences on issues, including Iraq, and that is \ntotally what we are all about: to express our feelings in a civil way \nand in a strong way.\n  But I add my thanks to him for his contribution for so many decades \ngoing back. When he speaks about the situation we are in in Iraq, he \nspeaks with not only great feeling but also with great experience, and \nI think every Member of this body treasures our relationship with \nSenator McCain and the\n\n[[Page S8895]]\n\nexperience he brings to this debate. He has the commitment, I hope, of \neverybody in this body that the debate, as we proceed relative to Iraq \nor any other issues in this week and next, will proceed in a very civil \nway.\n  This issue requires all of the wisdom we can muster, all of the \nexperiences of the various Members, and he has my assurance, and I \nthink he would have the assurance of every Member of this body, that \nthe tone he sets and wants us to maintain will indeed be maintained by \nthis Senate. I am confident of that, and thank him again for his \nremarks and for his great contribution to this bill.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Congressional \nBudget Office cost estimate of the Senate version of the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, which was not available \nwhen the report on that bill, S. 1547, was filed, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    S. 1547--National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008\n\n       Summary: S. 1547 would authorize appropriations totaling \n     $629 billion for fiscal year 2008 for the military functions \n     of the Department of Defense (DoD), for activities of the \n     Department of Energy (DOE), and for other purposes. That \n     total includes $128 billion for military operations in Iraq \n     and Afghanistan. In addition, S. 1547 would prescribe \n     personnel strengths for each active-duty and selected reserve \n     component of the U.S. armed forces. CBO estimates that \n     appropriation of the authorized amounts would result in \n     additional outlays of $621 billion over the 2008-2012 period.\n       Including outlays from funds previously appropriated, \n     spending for defense programs authorized by the bill would \n     total about $599 billion in 2008, CBO estimates. The bill \n     also contains provisions that would both increase and \n     decrease costs of discretionary defense programs in future \n     years. Most of those provisions would affect force structure, \n     compensation, and benefits. In total, such provisions would \n     raise costs by $9 billion in 2008 (this amount is included in \n     the above total of $629 billion specifically authorized for \n     that year) and by $4 billion to $6 billion annually over the \n     2009-2012 period.\n       The bill contains provisions that would both increase and \n     decrease direct spending from changes to TRICARE For Life, \n     the foreign currency fluctuation account, combat-related \n     special compensation, and other programs. We estimate that \n     those provisions combined would decrease direct spending by \n     $309 million in 2008, $714 million over the 2008-2012 period, \n     and $2.1 billion over the 2008-2017 period. Those totals \n     include estimated net receipts from asset sales of a little \n     under $0.6 billion over the 2008-2017 period. (Under current \n     scorekeeping rules and conventions, asset sale receipts are \n     recorded as a credit against direct spending as long as such \n     sales would not result in a net financial cost to the \n     government--as determined on a present value basis.) In \n     addition, enacting the bill would have a negligible effect on \n     revenues.\n       Section 4 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) \n     excludes from the application of that act any legislative \n     provisions that enforce the constitutional rights of \n     individuals. CBO has determined that section 1022 would fall \n     within that exclusion because it would amend the authority of \n     the President to employ the armed services to protect \n     individuals' civil rights. Therefore, CBO has not reviewed \n     that section of the bill for mandates.\n       Other provisions of S. 1547 contain both intergovernmental \n     and private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA but CBO \n     estimates that the annual cost of those mandates would not \n     exceed the thresholds established in UMRA ($66 million for \n     intergovernmental mandates in 2007 and $131 million for \n     private-sector mandates in 2007, adjusted annually for \n     inflation).\n       The bill also contains several provisions that would \n     benefit state and local governments. Some of those provisions \n     would authorize aid for certain local schools with dependents \n     of defense personnel and convey certain parcels of land to \n     state and local governments. Any costs to those governments \n     would be incurred voluntarily as a condition of receiving \n     federal assistance.\n       Estimated cost to the federal government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of S. 1547 is summarized in Table 1. Most of \n     the costs of this legislation fall within budget function 050 \n     (national defense).\n       Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that S. \n     1547 will be enacted near the start of fiscal year 2008 and \n     that the authorized amount will be appropriated for that \n     year. The estimated outlays from authorizations of regular \n     appropriations are based on historical spending patterns.\n\n      TABLE 1.--BUDGETARY IMPACT OF S. 1547, THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 a\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             By fiscal year, in millions of dollars\n                                               -----------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   2007       2008       2009       2010       2011       2012\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nSpending Under Current Law for Programs\n Authorized by S. 1547:\n    Budget Authority b........................    617,085          0          0          0          0          0\n    Estimated Outlays.........................    551,703    219,217     79,329     27,802     10,589      4,277\nProposed Changes:\n    Authorization of Regular Appropriations\n     for 2008:\n        Authorization Level...................          0    501,033          0          0          0          0\n        Estimated Outlays.....................          0    320,660    116,444     39,156     12,588      4,993\n    Authorization of Appropriations for 2008\n     for Military Operations in Iraq and\n     Afghanistan:\n        Authorization Level...................          0    128,226          0          0          0          0\n        Estimated Outlays.....................          0     59,054     45,470     15,961      4,751      1,648\nSpending Under S. 1547:\n    Authorization Level b.....................    617,085    629,259          0          0          0          0\n    Estimated Outlays.........................    551,703    598,931    241,243     82,919     27,928     10,918\n \n                              CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING (INCLUDING ASSET SALES) c\n \nEstimated Budget Authority....................          0       -112       -138         84         26         54\nEstimated Outlays.............................          0       -309       -287        -72        -62        14\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\na Enactment of S. 1547 would have an insignificant effect on federal revenues.\nb The 2007 level is the amount appropriated for programs authorized by the bill. That figure includes $99.3\n  billion that was recently provided in Public Law 110-28, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina\n  Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007. The 2007 level shown here is slightly lower than\n  the comparable figure presented in CBO's cost estimate for H.R. 1585, the National Defense Authorization Act\n  for Fiscal Year 2008, as passed by the House, because H.R. 1585 would authorize appropriations for some\n  existing programs that would not be authorized by S. 1547.\nc In addition to the direct spending effects shown here, enacting S. 1547 would have additional effects on\n  direct spending after 2012 (see Table 4). The estimated changes in direct spending (including asset sales)\n  would reduce outlays by $2.1 billion over the 2008-2017 period.\nNote--For 2008, the authorization levels under ``Proposed Changes'' include amounts specifically authorized by\n  the bill. As discussed in footnote 1 of the ``Summary'' to this estimate, the $629 billion that would be\n  authorized by the bill does not include $11 billion in TRICARE For Life accrual payments that will be made\n  under current law. (For additional information on those payments, see the discussion under ``Previous CBO\n  Estimates.'') The bill also implicitly authorizes some activities in 2009 through 2012; those authorizations\n  are not included above (but are shown in Table 3) because funding for those activities would be covered by\n  specific authorizations in future years.\n\n       Spending subject to appropriation: The bill would \n     specifically authorize appropriations totaling $629 billion \n     in 2008 (see Table 2). Nearly all of that amount falls within \n     budget function 050 (national defense), while a small \n     portion--$62 million for the Armed Forces Retirement Home--\n     falls within budget function 600 (income security).\n       Of the $629 billion in funding for 2008 authorized by the \n     bill for the costs of defense programs, $128 billion of that \n     amount would be for DoD costs associated with continuing \n     operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       The bill also contains provisions that would both increase \n     and decrease various costs, mostly for changes in end \n     strength, military compensation, and health benefits, that \n     would be covered by the fiscal year 2008 authorization and by \n     authorizations in future years. Table 3 contains estimates of \n     those amounts.\n       Multiyear procurement. Multiyear procurement is a special \n     contracting method authorized in title 10, United States \n     Code, section 2306b that permits the government to enter into \n     contracts covering acquisitions for more than one year but \n     not more than five years, even though the total funds \n     required for every year are not appropriated at the time the \n     contracts are awarded. As part of such a contract, the \n     government commits to purchase all items specified at the \n     time the contract is signed, including those to be produced \n     and paid for in subsequent years. Because multiyear \n     procurement allows a contractor to plan for more efficient \n     production, such a contract can reduce the cost of an \n     acquisition compared with the cost of buying the items \n     through a series of annual procurement contracts.\n       Such contracts frequently include provisions that require \n     DoD to pay for unrecovered fixed costs in the event that the \n     contract is canceled before completion. DoD does not budget \n     for, obtain, or obligate funds sufficient to pay for those \n     contractual commitments at the time they are incurred. \n     Authorizing DoD to initiate a multiyear procurement program \n     with such unfunded cancellation liabilities provides contract \n     authority--a form of budget authority--because it allows the \n     department to incur that liability in advance of \n     appropriations. CBO believes that the full cost of such \n     liabilities\n\n[[Page S8896]]\n\n     should be recorded in the budget at the time they are \n     incurred. The failure to request funding for cancellation \n     liabilities may distort the resource allocation process by \n     understating the cost of decisions made for the budget year \n     and may require future Congresses to find the resources to \n     pay for decisions made today.\n\n                                  TABLE 2.--SPECIFIED AUTHORIZATIONS IN S.

Amounts shown in this table for 2009 through 2012 are not included in Table 1,\n  because authorizations for those amounts would be covered by specific authorizations in future years.\nFigures shown here may not add to numbers in the text because of rounding.\n\n\n[[Page S8897]]\n\n       This bill would authorize the Department of Defense to \n     enter into multiyear procurement contracts for three \n     programs: enhancements to the Abrams tank, upgrades to the \n     Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and new Virginia class submarines.\n       Section 111 would authorize the Army to enter a multiyear \n     contract for up to five years to acquire a number of \n     improvements to M1A1 Abrams tanks over a five-year period. If \n     granted this authority, the Army plans to enter a contract \n     for the 2008-2012 period to modify 577 tanks at a total cost \n     of $1,595 million; it has requested $639 million in 2008 to \n     upgrade 241 tanks. The Army estimates that a multiyear \n     procurement contract for those tank modifications would cost \n     $178 million less than a series of annual procurement \n     contracts for those systems.\n       Section 112 would authorize the Army to enter a multiyear \n     contract to acquire a number of improvements to the Bradley \n     Fighting Vehicle. According to budget documents provided by \n     the Army, the service would use this authority to enter a \n     contract for the 2008-2011 period to modify 965 vehicles at a \n     total cost of $2,310 million; it has requested $1,151 million \n     in 2008 to upgrade 525 vehicles. The Army estimates that a \n     multiyear procurement contract for those modifications would \n     cost $131 million less than a series of annual procurement \n     contracts for those systems.\n       Section 131 would authorize the Navy to enter a multiyear \n     contract for Virginia-class submarines beginning in fiscal \n     year 2009. The Navy plans to enter a contract for the 2009-\n     2013 period to purchase seven submarines at a total cost of \n     $19.1 billion; it has requested $703 million in 2008 to buy \n     certain components in economic quantities and to order items \n     that have lengthy production times. The Navy estimates that a \n     multiyear procurement contract would cost $2.9 billion less \n     than a series of annual procurement contracts for those \n     vessels.\n       Force structure. The bill would affect force structure by \n     setting end-strength levels for the various military services \n     and by increasing the number of personnel in higher pay \n     grades.\n       Military end strength. Title IV would authorize end-\n     strength levels in 2008 for active-duty personnel and \n     personnel in the selected reserves of about 1,370,000 and \n     850,000, respectively. Of those selected reservists, about \n     76,000 would serve on active duty in support of the reserves. \n     In total, active-duty end strength would increase by about \n     4,000 and selected-reserve end strength would decrease by \n     about 5,000 when compared to levels authorized for 2007.\n       Section 401 would authorize increases to the active-duty \n     end strengths of the Army and Marine Corps relative to the \n     personnel levels authorized for 2007. CBO estimates that \n     those increases--13,000 additional personnel for the Army and \n     9,000 for the Marine Corps--would increase costs to DoD by \n     about $7 billion in 2008 and about $22 billion over the 2008-\n     2012 period. Those costs include the pay and benefits of the \n     additional personnel, as well as costs for operation and \n     maintenance, procurement, and construction.\n       Section 401 also would decrease the Navy's active-duty end \n     strength by 12,300 and the Air Force's active-duty end \n     strength by 5,600. CBO estimates that, combined, those \n     decreases in end strength would cut costs for salaries and \n     other expenses by about $580 million in the first year and \n     about $1 billion annually in subsequent years.\n       Sections 411 and 412 would authorize the end strengths for \n     the reserve components, including those full-time reservists \n     who serve on active duty in support of the reserves. Under \n     this bill, the selected reserve would experience a net \n     decrease in end strength of 4,900, with the Navy Reserve and \n     Air Force Reserve losing personnel while the Army Reserve and \n     National Guard would see an increase. However, the cost \n     savings from that net decrease would be more than offset by \n     the cost of an increase of 1,900 in the number of reservists \n     who serve on active duty in support of the reserves. CBO \n     estimates that the net result of implementing those \n     provisions would be an increase in costs for salaries and \n     other expenses for selected reservists of $306 million in \n     2008 and about $50 million a year thereafter as compared to \n     the authorized end-strength levels for 2007. Costs would be \n     higher in 2008 and 2009 than in later years as a result of \n     the need to procure new equipment for the additional Army \n     National Guard personnel.\n       In addition, sections 413 and 414 would authorize the \n     minimum end-strength level for military technicians, who are \n     federal civilian personnel required to maintain membership in \n     a selected reserve component as a condition of their \n     employment. Under this bill, the required number of \n     technicians would decrease by 128 relative to the levels \n     currently authorized. CBO estimates the savings in civilian \n     salaries and expenses that would result from fewer military \n     technicians would be about $7 million in 2008 and about $15 \n     million annually thereafter, as compared to the minimum end-\n     strength levels for technicians in 2007.\n       The bill also would authorize an end strength of 10,000 \n     servicemembers in 2008 for the Coast Guard Reserve. Because \n     this authorization is the same as that under current law, CBO \n     does not estimate any additional costs for this provision.\n       Grade structure. Sections 501, 502, and 521 would increase \n     the number of servicemembers in certain grades. Sections 501 \n     and 502 would increase the number of officers authorized to \n     serve as majors in the Army and as lieutenant commanders, \n     commanders, and captains in the Navy. Section 521 would allow \n     the services to increase the percentage of personnel serving \n     in the pay-grade of E-9 from 1 percent of the enlisted force \n     to 1.25 percent. Those changes would not increase the overall \n     end strength, but would result in more promotions to those \n     ranks. CBO estimates that the additional pay and benefits \n     associated with promoting personnel to those higher grades \n     would be about $100 million in 2008 and $1 billion over the \n     2008-2012 period.\n       Compensation and benefits. S. 1547 contains several \n     provisions that would affect military compensation and \n     benefits for uniformed personnel. The bill would specifically \n     authorize regular appropriations of $109 billion and \n     additional appropriations for operations in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan of $13 billion for costs of military pay and \n     allowances in 2008.\n       Pay raise. Section 601 would raise basic pay for all \n     individuals in the uniformed services by 3.5 percent, \n     effective January 1, 2008. CBO estimates the total cost of a \n     3.5 percent raise in 2008 would be about $2.2 billion. \n     Because the pay raise would be above that projected under \n     current law (under current law a 3 percent across-the-board \n     increase would go into effect on January 1, 2008), CBO \n     estimates that the incremental cost associated with the \n     larger pay raise would be about $311 million in 2008 and $2.1 \n     billion over the 2008-2012 period.\n       Bonuses and allowances. Sections 611 through 614 would \n     extend DoD's authority to pay certain bonuses and allowances \n     to military personnel. Under current law, most of these \n     authorities are scheduled to expire in December 2007. The \n     bill would extend these authorities for another year. Based \n     on data provided by DoD, CBO estimates that: Authorities to \n     make special payments and give bonuses to certain health care \n     professionals would cost $26 million in 2008 and $15 million \n     in 2009; special payments for aviators and personnel \n     qualified to operate and maintain naval nuclear propulsion \n     plants would cost $104 million in 2008 and $72 million in \n     2009; retention and accession bonuses for officers and \n     enlisted members with critical skills would cost $95 million \n     in 2008 and $42 million in 2009; payment of reenlistment \n     bonuses for active-duty and reserve personnel would cost $1.2 \n     billion in 2008 and $451 million in 2009; and enlistment \n     bonuses for active-duty and reserve personnel would cost $638 \n     million in 2008 and $330 million in 2009.\n       Most of these changes would result in additional, smaller \n     costs in subsequent years because many payments are made in \n     installments. In total, extending authority for the expiring \n     bonus and allowances would cost about $2.1 billion in 2008 \n     and $3.8 billion over five years.\n       Hardship duty pay. Section 617 would increase the maximum \n     allowable amount of hardship duty pay from $750 per month to \n     $1,500 per month. The Army reports that it would use this \n     additional authority as part of its ``Warrior Pay'' program, \n     which would provide extra incentives to military personnel \n     who make frequent deployments to combat zones. Based on \n     information from the Army, CBO estimates the total cost of \n     implementing this section would be $79 million in 2008 and \n     $214 million over the 2008-2012 period. Costs would be lower \n     in later years because CBO expects overseas deployments will \n     decrease.\n       Leave carryover. Section 591 would allow servicemembers to \n     carry up to 90 days of leave from one year to the next and \n     also would allow members to sell accumulated leave in excess \n     of 120 days back to the government. Under current law, \n     members may carryover a maximum of 60 days of leave at the \n     end of each fiscal year, unless they have recently \n     participated in a contingency operation, in which case they \n     can carry over up to 120 days of leave. Section 591 would \n     increase the maximum carryover allowed to 90 days for members \n     who have not participated in a contingency operation.\n       When members reenlist or separate, they are currently \n     allowed to sell up to 60 days of leave back to the \n     government. However, increasing the amount of leave carried \n     over from year to year would increase the average amount of \n     leave sold back to the government, even within the 60-day \n     buyback limit. According to data from DoD, in 2006, almost \n     150,000 personnel were each paid for an average of 19 days of \n     leave at a total cost of about $250 million. Based on an \n     analysis of current leave balances provided by the Defense \n     Finance and Accounting Service, CBO estimates that increasing \n     leave carryover to 90 days would increase the average amount \n     of leave sold back to the government by about 7 percent. This \n     would increase the annual cost of payments for unused leave \n     by about $17 million beginning in fiscal year 2009.\n       In addition, section 591 would allow members to sell \n     accumulated leave in excess of 120 days back to the \n     government. Based on data from DoD, CBO estimates that, each \n     year, about 2,000 servicemembers will have leave in excess of \n     120 days--about 131 days of leave, on average, for that \n     group. The cost to DoD to buy back those extra days would be \n     about $155 per person per day, so that the cost would be \n     about $4 million in 2008 and $21 million over the 2008-2012 \n     period. When combined with the increase in leave carryover, \n     CBO estimates the total cost of implementing section 591 \n     would be $4 million in 2008 and $93 million over the 2008-\n     2012 period.\n       Accession bonus for health professions scholarship. Section \n     624 would allow DoD to\n\n[[Page S8898]]\n\n     award accession bonuses of up to $20,000 to students who \n     enroll in the Health Professions Scholarship and Financial \n     Assistance Programs. Those programs pay the tuition and \n     stipends of medical students who agree to serve in the armed \n     forces upon completion of their studies. Because the armed \n     forces are having difficulty recruiting medical \n     professionals, CBO believes that DoD would use the maximum \n     amount of this authority if funding were made available. \n     Based on data from DoD, CBO estimates about 750 students \n     would enroll in the program and receive this bonus each year, \n     and that the total cost of implementing section 624 would be \n     $15 million in 2008 and $74 million over the 2008-2012 \n     period.\n       Special pay for medical officers. Section 615 would \n     increase the maximum allowable amounts for both incentive \n     special pay and the multiyear retention bonus for medical \n     officers from $50,000 to $75,000 for each year the officer \n     agrees to remain in the armed forces. There are currently \n     only three medical specialties that are paid at, or near, \n     the current maximum amounts: neurologists, radiologists, \n     and anesthesiologists. The total number of personnel in \n     those specialties is currently about 630, although to \n     qualify for incentive special pay medical officers must \n     first complete their initial service agreements with DoD, \n     and to qualify for the retention bonus an officer must \n     have at least eight years of service. Based on DoD data, \n     CBO estimates that about 50 percent of those 630 people \n     would be eligible for the increased incentive special pay \n     and about 15 percent would receive the higher retention \n     bonus. CBO estimates the total cost of implementing this \n     section would be $8 million in 2008 and $48 million over \n     the 2008-2012 period.\n       Dental officer special pay. Section 616 would increase \n     additional special pay for dental officers with less than 10 \n     years of service by $6,000 per year. Currently, those \n     personnel receive either $4,000 or $6,000 per year depending \n     on their seniority. This section would increase those amounts \n     to $10,000 and $12,000. Based on data from DoD, CBO estimates \n     about 1,350 dentists would receive the increase in additional \n     special pay if this section were enacted, for a cost of $8 \n     million in 2008 and $41 million over the 2008-2012 period.\n       Loan repayment for reserves. Section 672 would expand DoD's \n     education loan repayment program to include officers in the \n     selected reserve. Enlisted reservists are currently eligible \n     to receive benefits under this program. Assuming that officer \n     enrollment in this program would be proportionate to that of \n     enlisted members with college degrees, CBO estimates that DoD \n     would initiate loan repayment for about 620 reserve officers \n     each year if this authority were enacted. CBO estimates the \n     average amount of the loan repayments would total about \n     $7,000 per person and would be paid over six years in annual \n     increments of about $1,200, so that the total cost of this \n     section would be $1 million in 2008 and $14 million over the \n     2008-2012 period.\n       Discount drug pricing. Under current law, DoD is one of \n     several federal agencies that receives from pharmaceutical \n     makers a significantly reduced price for drugs on the Federal \n     Supply Schedule (FSS). Through this program, DoD is able to \n     procure at a discount the drugs that it provides to \n     beneficiaries through its hospital pharmacies and mail-order \n     program. However, under DoD's TRICARE programs, beneficiaries \n     can also fill prescriptions at retail pharmacies. Many drug \n     manufacturers have refused to provide discounted prices to \n     DoD for medications provided to beneficiaries in that manner.\n       Section 701 would require drug manufacturers to provide FSS \n     pricing on purchases covered by TRICARE at retail pharmacies. \n     Based on information from DoD about prescriptions filled at \n     retail pharmacies by active-duty dependents and retirees and \n     their dependents under age 65, CBO estimates that \n     implementing this section could result in savings of about \n     $300 million in 2008 and about $1.8 billion over the 2008-\n     2012 period. This estimate is based on the difference between \n     what DoD currently pays drug manufacturers for prescriptions \n     filled at retail pharmacies and the FSS prices for those \n     drugs. The estimate takes into account price inflation, \n     projected increases in drug usage, and a growing active-duty \n     population, resulting in increased savings in future years. \n     (See the discussion in the ``Direct Spending'' section for \n     CBO's evaluation of this provision on the mandatory TRICARE \n     For Life program.)\n       Defense acquisition workforce development fund. Section 844 \n     would establish the Defense Acquisition Workforce Development \n     Fund to dedicate funding for recruiting, training, and \n     retaining acquisition personnel in excess of the levels DoD \n     is currently using for those purposes. Military services and \n     defense agencies would be required to deposit into the fund \n     in each fiscal year a percentage of the funds expended in \n     that year on contracts for services, other than services \n     related to research and development or construction. That \n     percentage would increase in even steps from 0.5 percent of \n     such expenditures in 2008 to 2 percent in 2011 and \n     thereafter.\n       Based on information from the Federal Procurement Data \n     System, CBO estimates that DoD will expend approximately $75 \n     billion to $80 billion each year on contracts for services \n     covered under this provision. The required deposit would be \n     in addition to the amounts necessary to pay for the \n     performance of the services contracts. CBO estimates that \n     implementing section 844 would increase personnel and \n     training costs by about $5.5 billion over the 2008-2012 \n     period. Most of the deposits to the fund would be related to \n     expenditures of future appropriations. Those discretionary \n     costs would total $300 million in 2008 and $5.4 billion over \n     the 2008-2012 period. The remainder of the deposits, which \n     would be related to the expenditure of funds that were \n     appropriated in fiscal year 2007 and in prior years, would \n     constitute direct spending. Those costs are described later \n     in this estimate.\n       Direct spending: The bill contains provisions that would \n     increase and decrease direct spending from changes to TRICARE \n     For Life, the foreign currency fluctuation account, combat-\n     related special compensation, and other programs. S. 1547 \n     also would increase receipts from asset sales, as discussed \n     in the following section. We estimate that those provisions \n     combined would decrease direct spending by $309 million in \n     2008, $714 million over the 2008-2012 period, and $2,088 \n     million over the 2008-2017 period (see Table 4).\n\n                                                                        TABLE 4.--DIRECT SPENDING, ASSET SALES, REVENUES\n

Under current law, DoD is one of \n     several federal agencies that receives from pharmaceutical \n     makers a significantly reduced price for drugs on the Federal \n     Supply Schedule (FSS). Through this program, DoD is able to \n     procure at a discount the drugs that it provides to \n     beneficiaries through its hospital pharmacies and mail-order \n     program. However, under DoD's TRICARE programs, including the \n     TRICARE For Life program for retirees and their dependents \n     age 65 and over, beneficiaries can also fill prescriptions at \n     retail pharmacies. Many drug manufacturers have refused to \n     provide discounted prices to DoD for medications provided to \n     beneficiaries in that manner.\n       Section 701 would require drug manufacturers to provide FSS \n     pricing on purchases covered by TRICARE at retail pharmacies. \n     Based on information from DoD about prescriptions filled at \n     retail pharmacies by retirees and their dependents age 65 and \n     over, CBO estimates that implementing this section could \n     reduce direct spending by about $360 million in 2008, $2.1 \n     billion over the 2008-2012 period, and $5.3 billion over the \n     2008-2017 period. This estimate is based on the difference \n     between what DoD currently pays drug manufacturers for \n     prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies and the FSS prices \n     for those drugs. The estimate takes into account price \n     inflation and projected increases in drug usage, resulting in \n     increased savings in future years. (See the above discussion \n     under ``Spending Subject to Appropriation'' for CBO's \n     evaluation of this provision on the discretionary TRICARE \n     program for active-duty dependents and those retirees and \n     their dependents under age 65.)\n       Transfers to the foreign currency account. Section 1007 \n     would enhance DoD's ability to use expired appropriations to \n     cover the costs of certain contracts and projects which are \n     financed using foreign currencies. CBO estimates that section \n     1007 would increase direct spending outlays by $100 million \n     in 2008, $1.7 billion over the 2008-2012 period, and $2 \n     billion over the 2008-2017 period.\n       Under current law, most appropriations are available for \n     obligation for a specified number of years and, after that \n     time, they expire and cease to be available for new \n     obligations. Once expired, however, those balances can be \n     used during the following five years to record, adjust, or \n     liquidate existing obligations. At the end of that five-year \n     period, any remaining balances are cancelled. Appropriations \n     for military personnel and for operation and maintenance \n     generally are available for obligation for one year, except \n     as discussed below.\n       Current law also contains another use for certain DoD funds \n     that have expired. Title 10 of the U.S. Code, section 2779, \n     allows DoD to transfer expired appropriations from its \n     military personnel and operation and maintenance accounts \n     into its Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Defense (FCF,D) \n     account, provided that the transfer occurs within two years \n     of when the applicable appropriation expired, and that the \n     account balance does not exceed $970 million at the time the \n     transfer is made. Funds in the account can then be \n     transferred back to the military personnel and operation and \n     maintenance accounts and be obligated to cover ``losses'' \n     that occur when actual exchange rates are less favorable than \n     the exchange rates that DoD used in formulating its budget. \n     If those transfers--to cover such losses--prove to exceed \n     DoD's requirements, the department can once again transfer \n     funds back to the FCF,D account within a corresponding two-\n     year period. In addition, if actual exchange rates prove more \n     favorable than DoD's forecast, the department can transfer \n     those ``gains'' into the FCF,D account.\n       Section 1007 would extend--from two years to five years--\n     the time period that DoD could transfer expired balances from \n     the military personnel and operation and maintenance accounts \n     to the FCF,D account. This would result in a reappropriation \n     of funds by allowing existing appropriations that are \n     currently expired--or that will otherwise expire under \n     current law--to become newly available for obligation.\n       Under section 1007, DoD would have access to a larger pool \n     of balances that could be transferred into the FCF,D account \n     because under the existing two-year limit, DoD's program \n     managers are reluctant to allow such transfers when those \n     balances may ultimately be needed to adjust or liquidate \n     obligations in later years. Under section 1007, once the life \n     of the balances approach the end of the applicable five-year \n     period, managers would likely allow almost all such balances \n     to be transferred because those funds would otherwise be \n     cancelled.\n       During the 2002-2006 period, transfers of expired balances \n     ranged from $0.6 billion to $1.9 billion annually. Based on \n     DoD's past use of expired balances to cover currency losses, \n     on the expanded pool of balances that would be available to \n     cover currency losses, and considering the inherent \n     uncertainty in forecasting exchange rates, CBO estimates that \n     enacting this section would result in reappropriations of \n     about $200 million in 2008 and about $2 billion over the \n     2008-2012 period. Outlays would total about $100 million in \n     2008, $1.7 billion over the 2008-2012 period, and roughly $2 \n     billion over the 2008-2017 period.\n       Under current law almost all applicable balances from \n     appropriations provided in 2007 and prior years will be \n     cancelled after 2012. Therefore, CBO estimates that no \n     balances would be reappropriated in 2013 or in later years. \n     However, when the Congress provides DoD with appropriations \n     for 2008 and future years, DoD would ultimately spend a \n     higher percentage of those funds if section 1007 is enacted \n     into law. That added spending is not reflected in Table 4 \n     because those outlays would be subject to future \n     appropriation actions.\n       Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC). Currently, \n     disabled servicemembers who are allowed to retire with less \n     than 20 years of service see their retirement annuity offset \n     or reduced by any amount of disability compensation that they \n     receive from VA. Retirees who have served 20 or more years in \n     the service and whose VA-rated disability is related to \n     combat, hazardous duty, or military training are eligible to \n     receive CRSC. This compensation replaces part or all of the \n     portion of their retirement annuity that is offset by VA \n     disability compensation. Section 653 would allow disability \n     retirees with less than 20 years of service to receive CRSC. \n     Based on information from DoD, CBO estimates that enacting \n     this provision would increase direct spending by $7 million \n     in 2008, $308 million over the 2008-2012 period, and $678 \n     million over the 2008-2017 period.\n       Aviation war-risk insurance. Under current law, the Federal \n     Aviation Administration (FAA) offers a commercial aviation \n     insurance program that, for a premium, insures air carriers \n     and certain manufacturers against liabilities arising from \n     losses caused by terrorist events. The FAA also offers a non-\n     premium insurance program to air carriers that participate in \n     the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). The FAA's authority to \n     operate both of those programs is scheduled to expire on \n     March 30, 2008. Section 353 would extend those programs \n     through December 31, 2013. CBO estimates that extending the \n     CRAF program through 2013 would have no significant budgetary \n     impact; however, extending the FAA's authority to offer \n     commercial aviation insurance through 2013 would reduce net \n     direct spending by $80 million in 2008 and $430 million over \n     the 2008-2012 period, but would increase net direct spending \n     by $400 million over the 2008-2017 period.\n       Those long-term net costs result because CBO assumes that \n     the FAA would continue to offer commercial aviation insurance \n     at rates that would not fully offset the government's cost of \n     providing that coverage. Based on information from the FAA \n     about current rates, CBO estimates that increased offsetting \n     receipts from premiums (which are credited against direct \n     spending) would total $1.1 billion over the 2008-2014 period. \n     CBO also estimates, however, that payments for expected \n     losses under section 353 would cost $1.5 billion over the \n     next 10 years, with residual spending after 2017.\n       CBO cannot predict how much insured damage terrorists might \n     cause to air carriers and manufacturers in any specific year. \n     Instead, our estimate of the cost of commercial aviation \n     insurance under section 353 represents an expected value of \n     payments from the program--a weighted average that reflects \n     the probabilities of various outcomes, from zero damages up \n     to very large damages caused by possible future terrorist \n     attacks. The expected value can be thought of as the amount \n     of an insurance premium that would be necessary to just \n     offset the risk of providing this insurance; indeed, our \n     estimate of the expected cost of implementing section 353 is \n     based on actual premiums for terrorism insurance that have \n     been paid by non-U.S. air carriers that must purchase such \n     insurance from the private sector. Our estimate also \n     recognizes that some costs faced by private insurance firms \n     are not borne by the federal government. While this cost \n     estimate reflects CBO's best judgment on the basis of \n     available information, such future costs are a function of \n     inherently unpredictable future terrorist attacks. Actual \n     costs could fall anywhere within an extremely broad range.\n       Multiyear contracts for renewable energy. Section 826 would \n     allow DoD to enter contracts for a term of up to 10 years to \n     purchase electricity from renewable sources such as wind or \n     solar power generators. Based on information from DoD, CBO \n     expects that the department would commit to\n\n[[Page S8900]]\n\n     purchasing a guaranteed amount of electricity as part of \n     those contracts, to encourage producers to invest in \n     renewable energy generation equipment and to enable them to \n     acquire financing at favorable interest rates.\n       When the government enters a contract with a guaranteed \n     purchase amount, it incurs a legal obligation for the full \n     cost of those purchases. However, when DoD has used other \n     multiyear contracting authorities in the past, it has \n     typically obtained budget authority and recorded obligations \n     only for the payments that were due in the first year of the \n     contract, even though its actual contractual obligation \n     exceeded that amount. That method of implementing multiyear \n     procurement authority provides DoD with contract authority--a \n     form of budget authority--because it allows the department to \n     incur an obligation in excess of available appropriations. \n     Budget authority for the full cost of such contracts should \n     be recorded at the time it is signed and outlays should be \n     recorded over the term of the contracts as payments are made \n     for the electricity consumed.\n       Under current law, DoD is required to obtain 7.5 percent of \n     its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2013. It \n     currently gets about 4 percent of its electricity from such \n     sources. If section 826 were enacted, CBO estimates that DoD \n     would use multiyear contracts to purchase half the additional \n     renewable electricity it needs--nearly 500,000 megawatt hours \n     per year--to meet that requirement. The cost of renewable \n     energy would vary based on the mix of wind, solar, and \n     biomass power generators that were used; CBO estimates that \n     DoD would pay roughly $100 per megawatt hour of renewable \n     electricity. CBO assumes that over a six-year period, DoD \n     would initiate a series of 10-year contracts for even \n     increments of additional electricity at a cost of $80 million \n     per year until it was acquiring 500,000 megawatt hours of \n     electricity from renewable sources by 2013. Under such \n     contracts, direct spending would increase by $8 million in \n     2008, $120 million over the 2008-2012 period, and $360 \n     million over the 2008-2017 period. The first group of \n     multiyear contracts that would be initiated in 2008 would \n     expire after 2017. At that time, the department would need to \n     enter new contracts for renewable electricity to continue to \n     satisfy the requirement in current law. CBO estimates that in \n     total, such contracts would increase direct spending by about \n     $50 million each year after 2017.\n       Early reserve retirement. Under current law, members of the \n     reserve components may not receive retirement annuities for \n     their service until they reach 60 years of age. Section 655 \n     would allow retired reservists to receive such annuities \n     earlier if they were called to active duty as a reservist and \n     served for at least 90 days. Under this proposal, for every \n     90 days a reservist is activated after passage of S. 1547, \n     they would be eligible to begin receiving their retirement \n     annuities 90 days earlier than they otherwise would. \n     Relatively few reservists would be able to take advantage of \n     this provision in the near future. As most reservists stop \n     active participation in the reserves well before their 60th \n     birthday, few reservists nearing retirement over the next \n     decade will have served on active duty during that decade. \n     Therefore, the full annual costs of this provision would \n     occur more than 10 years after enactment and are not \n     reflected in this estimate. Based upon information from DoD, \n     CBO estimates that enacting this provision would have an \n     insignificant effect on direct spending in 2008, and would \n     increase direct spending by about $35 million over the 2008-\n     2012 period and $213 million over the 2008-2017 period.\n       Defense Acquisition Workforce Development Fund. Section 844 \n     would establish the Defense Acquisition Workforce Development \n     Fund to dedicate funding for recruiting, training, and \n     retaining acquisition personnel in excess of the levels DoD \n     is currently using for those purposes. Deposits to the fund \n     would be based on a percentage of expenditures on contracts \n     for services in a given year. CBO estimates that over the \n     2008-2010 period more than $23 billion will be expended on \n     such contracts from funds that have already been \n     appropriated.\n       Most contracts for services are paid from appropriations \n     for operation and maintenance, which generally are available \n     for obligation for only one year. For the following five \n     years, those funds--now expired--are available only to \n     record, adjust, or liquidate existing obligations to the \n     account. At the end of that five-year period, any remaining \n     balances are cancelled. (Over $1 billion in unexpended \n     balances of operation and maintenance funds are cancelled \n     each year.) Expired, unobligated balances are available to \n     pay for an increase in the cost of contracts for which funds \n     were obligated during the period of availability. CBO expects \n     that the department would treat the requirement to make \n     deposits into the Fund as an increase in the cost of the \n     contracts on which such deposits are based, thus allowing it \n     to use expired, unobligated balances to make the required \n     deposits for expenditures of funds that were appropriated \n     prior to enactment of this bill. Thus, this section would \n     make those expired balances available for expenditure, \n     resulting in a reappropriation of those funds. CBO estimates \n     that those reappropriations would increase direct spending by \n     $65 million in 2008 and $140 million over the 2008-2011 \n     period. (This section would also require DoD to make deposits \n     based on the expenditure of funds that have yet to be \n     appropriated. Those deposits are discretionary costs and are \n     discussed above in the section on ``Spending Subject to \n     Appropriation.'')\n       Spending of reimbursements from Palau. Section 1213 would \n     allow DoD to spend reimbursements from the government of \n     Palau. Under current law, Palau reimburses the United States \n     for the cost of providing military civic action teams and \n     those receipts--about $250,000 annually--are deposited into \n     the U.S. Treasury. CBO estimates that enacting section 1213 \n     would cost less than $500,000 in every year, and would cost a \n     total of $1 million over the 2008-2012 period and $2 million \n     over the 2008-2017 period.\n       Extension of Federal Employees Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) \n     for reservists. Civilian employees of the federal government \n     are entitled to purchase life insurance under the FEGLI \n     program. Under current law, that insurance coverage may be \n     continued for up to 12 months for reservists who are called \n     to active military service. Section 1103 would extend FEGLI \n     coverage for up to 24 months of active military service. This \n     extension of coverage would initially increase net outlays \n     from the Employees Life Insurance Fund because private \n     insurers would most likely increase the premiums they charge \n     the federal government. However, in later years, the \n     Employees Life Insurance Fund would offset those additional \n     costs by increasing the amount participating employees are \n     required to contribute to the fund. CBO estimates that the \n     net cost of implementing this section would be $1 million in \n     2008 and $1 million over the 2008-2017 period.\n       Housing leases in Korea. DoD has authority under title 10 \n     of the U.S. Code, section 2828, to lease 2,800 family housing \n     units in Korea, at a maximum cost of $35,000 per unit per \n     year. Under current law, that cost limit is adjusted for the \n     change in the consumer price index since 2003, and for the \n     change in the foreign currency exchange rate since 1988. \n     Section 2812 would increase the unadjusted cost limit to \n     $35,050 per unit.\n       The department has requested that the cost limit on the \n     authority in current law be increased so that it can acquire \n     family housing through build-to-lease contracts. In a build-\n     to-lease agreement, the government contracts with a developer \n     to build a specified number of housing units in a specified \n     location for use by military personnel. According to DoD, the \n     military services often agree to a fixed lease term--\n     currently limited to a maximum of 15 years in Korea--with \n     renewal options for additional periods of time. Those renewal \n     options can extend the duration of the lease term to 30 years \n     or more. Based on the government's commitment to lease the \n     housing, the developer borrows money to pay for construction \n     of the units, using the promised payments from the government \n     to demonstrate to lenders a reliable source of income for \n     debt service.\n       CBO believes that acquiring military housing through a \n     build-to-lease contract is a governmental activity that uses \n     a private-sector intermediary to serve as an instrument of \n     the federal government by borrowing funds to finance the \n     construction of housing on the government's behalf. Those \n     build-to-lease agreements should be considered acquisitions \n     rather than leases for several reasons. First, the housing \n     would be constructed at the request of the government to fill \n     an enduring need for housing for DoD personnel. Second, \n     because the government would agree to lease the housing for \n     up to 15 years, and may extend the lease term for additional \n     years under renewal options, the government would likely \n     consume most of the useful economic life of the housing. \n     Third, the need for at least 15 years of government \n     commitment to obtain financing indicates that there may not \n     be a private-sector market for the new housing. Finally, the \n     government would be the dominant or only source of income for \n     such projects. Lease payments are made directly by the \n     government to the housing developer. If the lease is \n     terminated before the end of the fixed term, or before the \n     end of any exercised lease options, the government is liable \n     for early termination costs, which, under DoD's current \n     practice, are not funded in the budget when the lease is \n     signed. The federal government also agrees to pay rent on all \n     the units it leases, regardless of whether they are occupied \n     by DoD personnel or are vacant.\n       The acquisition cost of the housing that would be acquired \n     using the authority is determined by calculating the present \n     value of 15 years of lease payments less the portion of those \n     payments needed for operating and maintenance costs. That \n     amount should be recorded as budget authority in the year the \n     lease is signed, and outlays should be recorded over the \n     construction period. Instead, DoD treats such arrangements as \n     operating leases, by recording each year's lease payments on \n     an annual basis. (The department may not record any \n     obligations in the year it enters a contract for the housing \n     because such housing takes more than one year to build and \n     the first payment would not be due until construction \n     was completed.) By using the authority to incur an \n     obligation in advance of appropriations, current law \n     provides contract authority, which is a form of direct \n     spending.\n       According to DoD, the lease payment under the current cost \n     limit calculation do not provide enough income for housing \n     developers in Korea to recover their construction costs \n     during the initial 15-year term of the lease. Because it \n     increases the cost limit by only $50 per unit, CBO believes \n     that section 2812 is unlikely to facilitate additional build-\n     to-lease contracts in Korea, and thus would have no effect. \n     If such contracts were feasible under the increased limit, \n     DoD could acquire housing worth $575 million, CBO estimates.\n\n[[Page S8901]]\n\n       Other provisions. The following provisions would have an \n     insignificant budgetary impact on direct spending:\n       Section 504 would clarify the maximum age of service for \n     certain general and flag officers.\n       Section 534 would set to 38 the maximum years of service \n     for reserve officers in the grade of lieutenant general or \n     vice admiral, aligning such limit with that for the active \n     duty force.\n       Section 652 would allow guardians or caretakers of \n     dependent children to be designated beneficiaries under the \n     Survivor Benefit Plan.\n       Section 682 would change the treatment of overseas \n     residence relating to certain immigration benefits for \n     military spouses and children.\n       Section 825 would extend by five years the authority for \n     the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to \n     provide services to nongovernmental organizations and enter \n     into unconventional cooperative agreements with private \n     contractors for research relating to the development of \n     advanced weapons systems. This provision also would extend \n     the authority for DARPA to collect and spend reimbursements \n     for any services rendered.\n       Section 934 would authorize DoD to operate a Western \n     Hemisphere Center for Excellence in Human Rights. This \n     provision would allow the center to accept and spend \n     donations to help defray operating costs.\n       Section 1024 would make permanent the authority of the \n     Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to accept gifts \n     on behalf of members of the Armed Forces and of civilian \n     employees of DoD who are injured in the line of duty.\n       Section 1030 would prohibit DoD from selling parts for the \n     F-14 fighter aircraft, except to museums or to other \n     organizations in the United States that work to preserve F-14 \n     fighter aircraft for historical purposes. (DoD can spend the \n     proceeds from any such sales without future appropriation \n     action.)\n       Asset sales--National Defense Stockpile: Enacting the bill \n     would lead to increased receipts from the sale of material in \n     the National Defense Stockpile. Those additional sales would \n     reduce direct spending by $409 million over the 2008-2012 \n     period and by $582 million over the 2008-2015 period.\n       Section 1413 would increase by $129 million the target \n     contained in the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2000 (Public Law 106-65; later revised by Public \n     Laws 108-136 and 109-163) for continual sales of chromium and \n     beryllium from the National Defense Stockpile. CBO estimates \n     that the additional sales would begin in 2010 and that there \n     would be sufficient quantities of those materials in the \n     stockpile to complete those additional sales by 2012. Thus, \n     CBO estimates that this section would increase receipts from \n     stockpile sales by $129 million over the 2010-2012 period.\n       Section 1413 also would increase by $453 million the target \n     contained in the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 1999 (Public Law 105-261; later revised by Public \n     Laws 106-398, 107-107, 108-375, 109-163, and 109-364) for \n     continual sales of tungsten from the National Defense \n     Stockpile, and it would extend sales through fiscal year \n     2015. CBO estimates that there would be sufficient quantities \n     of tungsten in the stockpile to achieve additional receipts \n     of $50 million in 2008, $280 million over the 2008-2012 \n     period, and $453 million over the 2008-2015 period.\n       In addition to the increased targets, section 1413 \n     initially would limit the sales of ferromanganese from the \n     National Defense Stockpile to no more than 50,000 tons in \n     2008. Additional sales of up to 50,000 tons of ferromangenese \n     would be allowed if the market demand was sufficient. Based \n     on recent sales, CBO estimates that the provision would not \n     reduce sales because market demand would be sufficient to \n     allow for the continued sales of ferromangenese at planned \n     levels.\n       Section 1413 also would allow for additional sales of 500 \n     tons of chrome metal (up from planned levels of 500 tons) if \n     the market demand was sufficient. CBO estimates that this \n     provision would have no significant budgetary effect because \n     recent sales suggest that those additional sales would not \n     occur.\n       Revenues: Sections 934 and 1024 would allow DoD to accept \n     and spend gifts. Such donations are classified as revenues. \n     CBO expects, however, that enactment of those sections would \n     not have a significant effect on revenues.\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: Section 4 of \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act excludes from the \n     application of that act any legislative provisions that \n     enforce the constitutional rights of individuals. CBO has \n     determined that section 1022 would fall within that exclusion \n     because it would amend the authority of the President to \n     employ the armed services to protect individuals' civil \n     rights. Therefore, CBO has not reviewed that section of the \n     bill for mandates.\n       Other provisions of S. 1547 contain both intergovernmental \n     and private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA but CBO \n     estimates that the annual cost of those mandates would not \n     exceed the thresholds established in UMRA ($66 million for \n     intergovernmental mandates in 2007 and $131 million for \n     private-sector mandates in 2007, adjusted annually for \n     inflation).\n       Increasing the end strength of the armed services: Sections \n     401 and 412 would increase the costs of complying with \n     existing intergovernmental and private-sector mandates as \n     defined in UMRA by increasing the number of servicemembers \n     and reservists on active duty. Those additional \n     servicemembers would be eligible for protection under the \n     Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) including the right to \n     maintain a single state of residence for purposes of state \n     and local personal income taxes and the right to request a \n     deferral in the payment of certain state and local taxes and \n     fees. SCRA also requires creditors to reduce the interest \n     rate on servicemembers' obligations to 6 percent when such \n     obligations predate active-duty service and allows courts to \n     temporarily stay certain civil proceedings, such as \n     evictions, foreclosures, and repossessions. Extending these \n     existing protections would constitute intergovernmental and \n     private-sector mandates and could result in additional lost \n     revenues to government and private-sector entities.\n       The number of active-duty servicemembers covered by SCRA \n     would increase by less than 1 percent in fiscal year 2008. \n     CBO expects that relatively few of these servicemembers would \n     take advantage of the deferrals in certain state and local \n     tax payments; the lost revenues to those governments would be \n     insignificant.\n       CBO does not have sufficient information to estimate \n     precisely the increase in costs of existing private-sector \n     mandates. Servicemembers' utilization of the various \n     provisions of the SCRA depends on a number of uncertain \n     factors, including how often and how long they are deployed. \n     Nonetheless, because the increase in the number of active-\n     duty servicemembers covered by SCRA would be less than 1 \n     percent, CBO expects that the increased costs to the private \n     sector caused by those new servicemembers utilizing SCRA \n     would be small.\n       Prohibiting the sale by Department of Defense of parts for \n     F-14 fighter aircraft: Section 1030 contains a private-sector \n     mandate as defined by UMRA because it would prohibit the sale \n     of any parts of the F-14 aircraft by the Department of \n     Defense. It also would prohibit the United States government \n     from issuing an export license for sale of F-14 aircraft \n     parts. Those prohibitions would be a mandate upon U.S. \n     persons or entities that purchased F-14 parts legally from \n     the Department of Defense with the intention to resell the \n     aircraft parts.\n       The cost of the mandate to the private sector, if any, \n     would be the amount certain United States persons and \n     entities have already paid to purchase the F-14 parts from \n     the Department of Defense added to the foregone profit \n     attributable to the prohibition of resale of the F-14 parts. \n     From April 2006 to December 2006, F-14 parts were sold for a \n     total of $38,000. As a result, CBO estimates that the cost, \n     if any, to comply with that mandate would be minimal.\n       Providing benefits to state and local governments: This \n     bill contains several provisions that would benefit state and \n     local governments. Some of those provisions would authorize \n     aid for certain local schools with dependents of defense \n     personnel and convey certain parcels of land to state and \n     local governments. Any costs to those governments would be \n     incurred voluntarily as a condition of receiving federal \n     assistance.\n       Previous CBO estimates: On April 12, 2007, CBO transmitted \n     a cost estimate for H.R. 1441, the Stop Arming Iran Act, as \n     ordered reported by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on \n     March 27, 2007. Section 1030 of S. 1547 is similar to H.R. \n     1441 and the estimated costs are the same for both \n     provisions.\n       On May 14, 2007, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for H.R. \n     1585, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2008, as reported by the House Committee on Armed Services. \n     On June 12, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for H.R. 1585, \n     the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, \n     as passed by the House. Differences in the estimated costs of \n     S. 1547 and the House-reported and House-passed versions of \n     H.R. 1585 reflect differences in the legislation, as well as \n     different treatments of TRICARE For Life accrual payments, as \n     discussed below.\n       S. 1547 and H.R. 1585 as passed by the House, would \n     authorize different levels of appropriations but they \n     nevertheless envision a similar overall level of funding--\n     roughly $640 billion--for 2008. Specifically, S. 1547 would \n     authorize appropriations totaling $629 billion, while the \n     House-passed version of H.R. 1585 would authorize about $12 \n     billion more than that figure, or $641 billion. The $12 \n     billion difference, however, does not reflect a vastly \n     different level of recommended funding. Rather, it primarily \n     reflects different treatments of $11 billion in TRICARE For \n     Life accrual payments that are part of DoD's budget; S. 1547 \n     does not contain an authorization of appropriations for those \n     payments, while H.R. 1585 implicitly does.\n       Those accrual payments, which are categorized as military \n     personnel spending, will be made under current law regardless \n     of whether or not they are authorized on an annual basis. \n     Furthermore, the payments will be charged to the House and \n     Senate Appropriations Committees and will count against their \n     discretionary allocations as set forth in the most recent \n     budget resolution.\n       Despite envisioning similar levels of overall defense \n     funding, there is a notable difference in the authorizations \n     in S. 1547 and H.R. 1585 as passed by the House. S. 1547 \n     would authorize $128 billion for DoD's costs of military \n     operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, or about $13 billion less \n     than the amount in the House-passed act (which is about equal \n     to the President's request.) In authorizing the lower amount, \n     the Senate Committee on Armed Services states that it\n\n[[Page S8902]]\n\n     reallocated requested war-related authorizations--which the \n     committee believes are not directly related to operations in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan--into authorizations for DoD's ``base \n     budget accounts.'' As a result, the authorizations in S. 1547 \n     for DoD's base budget are about $13 billion higher than in \n     the House-passed version of H.R. 1585 (after making \n     adjustments for the TRICARE For Life accrual payments \n     discussed above.)\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Defense Outlays: Kent \n     Christensen; Military and Civilian Personnel: Matthew Schmit; \n     Military Construction and Multiyear Procurement: David \n     Newman; Military Retirement and Education: Mike Waters; \n     Health Programs: Michelle S.

Fontaine, Deputy Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe remarks of the Senator from Hawaii, on this side of the aisle, the \norder then be Senator Biden and Senator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I thank Chairman Levin and Ranking Member \nMcCain for their leadership and working in a bipartisan fashion to \nunanimously pass the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2008 out of committee. I also thank my ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Readiness, Senator Ensign, and the members of that \ncommittee for their work in bringing this about.\n  This bill exemplifies what can be achieved through the spirit of \nbipartisan cooperation to address a number of important defense \npriorities. As our distinguished chairman has already highlighted, this \nbill includes a 3.5 percent across-the-board pay raise for all \nuniformed personnel, adds $4 billion to the President's budget for mine \nresistant vehicles to protect our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. It \nalso authorizes fiscal year 2008 end strengths for the Army and Marine \nCorps, of 525,400 and 189,000 respectively, an increase of 13,000 for \nthe Army and 9,000 for the Marine Corps, and it supports the \ntransformation of our Armed Forces to meet the threats of the 21st \ncentury.\n  As chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, both Ranking Member Ensign \nand I worked with our colleagues to continue the subcommittee's strong \ncommitment to increasing the readiness of the Armed Forces. In this \nlegislation, we are providing support to projects and programs that are \nimportant to the readiness of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines, \nboth active and reserve components. In this regard, $188.4 billion is \nauthorized to meet the services' operation and maintenance requirements \nto support the combat operations, improve the readiness of deploying \nand nondeployed forces, and to support the Army and Marine Corps plans \nto increase their fiscal year 2008 end strengths.\n  I believe all of us in the Senate are concerned that our military \nforces have what they need to be trained and ready, but I am \nparticularly concerned about the readiness of our ground forces. This \nlegislation before us today fully funds the Army and Marine Corps \nrequest for depot level maintenance. I am encouraged that neither the \nArmy nor Marine Corps identified a shortage of funds for depot \nmaintenance. While the Chief of Naval Operations did bring to this \ncommittee's attention a funding shortfall for Navy aircraft depot \nmaintenance, we approved an increase of $77 million. In addition, we \nincluded $4.8 billion for the procurement of ammunition of all types to \nsupport the services' war fighting, training, and war reserve \nrequirements.\n  With regard to the Department of Defense's management and acquisition \npolicy, I am particularly pleased this bill includes a provision \nrequiring, for the first time, that the Department of Defense have a \nchief management officer. The Comptroller General has told the members \nof this committee on numerous occasions that the Department needs to do \nthis to ensure that the Department's many high-risk areas get the top-\nlevel management attention they deserve.\n  Other important acquisition reform provisions included in this bill \nare as follows: a provision that would provide the resources that DOD \nneeds to address the shortcomings in its acquisition workforce; a \nseries of provisions that would tighten DOD management of contract \nservices; a provision that would ensure that our commanders on the \nbattlefield have the authority they need to establish rules for armed \ncontractors in an area of combat operations; a provision establishing \nguidelines for DOD to use in determining whether savings are \n``substantial'' for the purpose of justifying multiyear contracts; and \na provision that would require that each of the Assistant Secretaries \nfor Acquisition in the military departments be assisted by a three-star \nmilitary deputy who has significant acquisition experience. I believe \nthese provisions, taken together, will lead to substantial improvements \nin the DOD acquisition process.\n  I am particularly pleased this year's authorization bill includes a \nprovision to establish a Director of Corrosion Control Policy and \nOversight, and funding for corrosion prevention and control programs. \nCorrosion is a costly problem. In fact, it is one of the largest costs \nin the life cycle of weapons systems. In addition, corrosion reduces \nmilitary readiness, as the need to repair or replace corrosion damage \nincreases the downtime of critical military assets. Consequently, I \nfirmly believe that cohesive corrosion control programs are integral to \nmaintaining military readiness. This critical maintenance activity \nincreases the life of multimillion dollar weapons systems and ensures \ntheir availability during times of crisis. Effective corrosion control \nshould be made a key component of the Department of Defense's resetting \nstrategy and funds should be allocated accordingly.\n  This legislation also includes my legislation to establish a National \nLanguage Council to develop a long-term and comprehensive language \nstrategy and oversee the implementation of that strategy. This will \nensure that the administration's current efforts to promote foreign \nlanguage competency will develop into an organized and concerted effort \nto improve the Nation's foreign language capabilities.\n  We also make a valuable and important investment in our \ninfrastructure by providing an additional $461 million above the budget \nrequest to repair, replace, and modernize our aging defense facilities \nand improve the quality of life and the productivity of our military. \nFurthermore, we make a true commitment to provide quality health care \nfor all beneficiaries, including authorizing $24.6 billion for the \nDefense Health Program, authorizing the use of Federal pricing for \ndrugs dispensed through the TRICARE retail program. In addition, we \nreject the administration's proposal to give DOD broad authority to \nincrease TRICARE program cost-sharing amounts for military retirees and \ntheir dependents.\n  As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and a member of the \nArmed Services Committee, I am able to look at the issue of seamless \ntransition from military to civilian life from two different \nperspectives and, at the appropriate time, I will be offering an \namendment to the underlying bill to improve care specifically for \nveterans. My friend and colleague Chairman Levin and I have worked \ntogether on these issues. We held a joint hearing on April 12 and have \ndeveloped a thoughtful set of provisions to deal with the VA's response \nto traumatic brain injuries, also known as TBI and also known as \ninvisible wounds. The amendment I will be offering includes provisions \nrecently approved by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs at our markup \non June 27. In fact, this amendment is a direct product of the \ncommittee's work to address seamless transition issues and is the \ncorresponding piece to S. 1606, the Dignified Treatment for Wounded \nWarriors Act.\n\n  At the heart of my amendment are the improvements to TBI care. \nRanking Member Craig and I worked on these traumatic brain injury \nprovisions and they have garnered the support of many organizations, \nincluding the American Academy of Neurology, the Brain Injury \nAssociation of America, and the Disabled American Veterans. The VA was \ncaught flat-footed by the large number of devastating TBI cases \nresulting from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. My amendment \nwould go a long way toward resolving the difficulties faced by soldiers \nafflicted with TBI by providing comprehensive TBI\n\n[[Page S8903]]\n\nlegislation. It would require individual rehabilitation plans for \nveterans with traumatic brain injury and authorizes the use of non-VA \nfacilities for the best TBI treatment available. The amendment also \nrequires much more research and education for severe TBI. We have even \ndeveloped a pilot program for assisted living services for veterans \nwith TBI.\n  My amendment would also extend the period of automatic eligibility \nfor VA health care from 2 to 5 years for servicemembers returning from \ncombat. It would ensure access to care for conditions that may not be \napparent when a servicemember first leaves active duty and would \ncontribute to a seamless transition from military to civilian life. In \naddition, this amendment requires a preliminary mental health \nevaluation be conducted within 30 days of a servicemember's request. VA \nmust be prodded to ensure timely access to mental health care. I thank \nSenator Obama for working with me on this important provision.\n  Finally, our ongoing global operations have utilized the reserve \ncomponents on an unprecedented scale. When these citizen soldiers \nredeploy, it is essential that VA include them in their outreach \nefforts. To recognize the importance of the National Guard and Reserve \nand to acknowledge their contributions to the Nation's efforts, my \namendment redefines the VA's definition by specifically including them \nin the outreach program.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee has taken bold and necessary \nsteps in this legislation that will provide the necessary funds and \nmanagement reforms required to support our service men and women while \nallowing the military to continue to meet our Nation's future defense \nneeds.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, Senator Biden was to be recognized next. \nI don't see him on the floor at this moment, so I will note the absence \nof a quorum for a few moments, and if he does not arrive, then I will \ngive my remarks on the Webb amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Parliamentary inquiry: I understand I am supposed to \nspeak after Senator Biden, but he told me before he left the floor that \nif he weren't here, I could reverse the order. I wonder if Senator \nLevin would give me permission to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I thank my good friend from California, \nand I have no objection at all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, this is a very important week for this \ncountry as we bring the issue of Iraq back to the Senate floor and \nlisten to the American people, who are very clear. They want this war \nto end. They want the troops to come home. They know our service men \nand women have given everything there is to give, and more. They know \nthe policies we have followed in Iraq since day one have backfired. \nThey are looking to us.\n  If I might say where we are in this debate in this Senate, in my \nopinion, is between talk and action. It is very easy to talk and say: \nOh, we need a change. We must have a change. It is important that we \nhave a change, and call press conferences and say we need a change. It \nis time for change. But let's see how people vote. Will they vote for a \nsense of the Senate that has absolutely no force of law, which says it \nis the sense of the Senate we should change course, or will they vote \nto start redeploying our troops out of the middle of a civil war, out \nof chaos?\n  My colleagues know I represent the largest State in the Union, and we \nare taking a major hit. We have lost hundreds and hundreds of soldiers. \nWe see thousands injured from our State. We see a National Guard that \ndoesn't have the equipment it has to have. Some reports are the \nequipment is down 50 percent. What does that mean? It means if, God \nforbid, there is an earthquake, a fire, all the things we have to deal \nwith in my beautiful State, who is going to protect the people? How \nmuch longer can we afford the bloodshed? The dollars--we are now told \n$12 billion a month is being spent in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The Presiding Officer and I share a lot of common interests. One of \nthem is, for example, to make sure our kids can go to afterschool care, \nbecause that is the time they get in trouble. That is a high-risk time. \nDo my colleagues know what it would cost to fund afterschool care to \nthe level that it is supposed to be, according to No Child Left Behind? \nIt would cost $3 billion a year. We are funding it at $1 billion. \nMillions of kids are on the street. We spend $12 billion in Iraq and \nAfghanistan in 1 month, but we cannot find a couple of billion in a \nyear for our children. We can't find the money to insure our children, \nto protect their health. Oh, no. We don't have the money for that. The \nPresident is going to veto this bill and veto that bill. He can't help \nthe farmers. We can't do this, we can't do that, but $12 billion in \nIraq and Afghanistan--no problem. No problem to save his reputation, to \nsave him from having to prove to the world he was wrong. Well, it is \none thing to have an argument with someone and have pride and say: You \nknow, I am not going to admit I made a mistake. It is another thing \nwhen people are dying because of your mistake--every day.\n  Now, in November of 2006, the American people voted against the Iraq \nwar. They elected Democrats. They want this war to end. They want this \nmission to end. They don't want our troops in the middle of a civil \nwar, getting killed and getting maimed, getting post-traumatic stress, \ngetting brain injuries that are the signature injury of this war.\n  We will be dealing with the problems of this war for decades to come. \nAnyone who lived through Vietnam knows that if you go on the streets \ntoday and look at who the homeless are, you know who they are. A third \nof them are veterans, most of them from Vietnam who never got over the \nexperience. That is why Senator Lieberman and I have worked together to \ntry and get the people who are coming back the mental health care they \nneed. Senator Lieberman and I do not agree on this war. We are polar \nopposites on this war. But let me tell my colleagues, we are working \ntogether to get these troops the mental health care they need. Their \nmarriages are breaking up. They can't sleep at night. They are having \ntrouble with their employers. We have so many problems, and the \nAmerican people expect us to fix it.\n  I see my friend Senator Biden is on the floor, and I will tell him I \nwill speak for about another 10 minutes.\n  Now that my friend is on the floor, Senator Biden is the Senator who \nhas looked ahead, who has said there is a light at the end of the \ntunnel. He has put forward a plan, and he put it forward a long time \nago, for a diplomatic solution here, because there is no military \nsolution. How many more explosive devices are going to blow up in the \nfaces of our troops before we start bringing them home? How many more \nIraqis are going to die--women, children? How many more faces are we \ngoing to look at on the front page before we get the guts to do the \nright thing?\n  The President doesn't listen. He didn't listen after the election. \nOh, he said he did. He said he had a new strategy. What was it? The \nsurge. The surge is not a new strategy. It is a military tactic, and it \nisn't working. Here is what the President said after he sent in more \nthan 20,000 additional troops. He said:\n\n       Over time, we can expect to see . . . fewer brazen acts of \n     terror, and growing trust and cooperation from Baghdad's \n     residents. When this happens, daily life will improve, Iraqis \n     will gain confidence in their leaders, and the Government \n     will have the breathing space it needs to make progress in \n     other critical areas.\n\n  Wrong. The President was wrong again. The Washington Post reported on \nSunday:\n\n       The Iraqi government is unlikely to meet any of the \n     political and security goals or time lines President bush set \n     for it in January. . . .\n\n  And today the AP, Associated Press, reports:\n\n       Iraq fails to meet all reform goals.\n\n  Not even one goal was met, and our people are dying. They cannot meet\n\n[[Page S8904]]\n\none goal. The violence continues unabated.\n  Since the President made his speech on January 10, after the \nelection, when he said there was going to be a new strategy, 590 U.S. \nservice men and women have been killed, 107 of whom did not live to see \ntheir 21st birthday. What kind of change is that this President \nbrought?\n  The average number of daily attacks by insurgents and militias has \nnot dropped below 150 per day. In Baghdad alone, there has been an \naverage of 50 insurgent attacks a day. Over the weekend, more than 150 \nIraqis were killed in one single bombing. These bombings are not \nisolated events. In June alone, there were 39 bombings in Iraq that \nresulted in multiple fatalities. The number of suicide attacks more \nthan doubled in Iraq since the surge began--from 26 in January to 58 in \nApril. What kind of new strategy is that? If that is a new strategy, it \nis worse than the other one. The average number of Iraqi civilians \nkilled has risen to more than 100 per day.\n  The administration is failing on the security front; they are failing \non the political front. They don't listen to Senator Biden, chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. They don't listen to Senator Lugar, \nthe ranking member. They are all saying you have to have a political \nsolution.\n  The administration is failing on the reconstruction front. Iraqis \nliving in Baghdad still receive an average of 5.6 hours of electricity \na day. The President can't even keep the lights on, let alone succeed \nin this surge.\n  Yesterday, Tony Snow said:\n\n       The President wants to withdraw troops based on the facts \n     on the ground, not on the matter of politics.\n\n  Well, I say to Tony Snow, elections have consequences, and you lost \nin 2006. The issue was Iraq and the policies on the ground are not \nworking; they are failing. So whether you listen to politics or what is \nhappening on the ground, the answer is the same.\n  On February 1, Tony Snow described the surge in this way:\n\n       We are talking about significant economic development \n     efforts; we're talking about significant political \n     reconciliation. These are the kinds of things we expect to \n     see.\n\n  Well, they have not seen them. We know the President is going to \naddress the American people. I say to the President, tell the truth to \nthe American people. Lay out what you expected, and then lay out the \nreality, and start getting the troops home. We have not seen \nimprovements. Now our military is at the breaking point. Listen to \nretired generals. They don't have to toe the line. They tell the truth. \nNearly 90 percent of Army National Guard units in the U.S. are rated \n``not ready''--largely as a result of shortfalls in equipment that \njeopardize their capability to respond to crises at home and abroad. In \nmy State, our equipment is down 50 percent. So who will be responsible \nwhen we have a disaster, I say to the President? Who is going to be \nresponsible? The same people who have brought us Iraq are going to \nbring us a crisis in our States. We already saw what happened in \nKatrina from incompetence. Let's match incompetence and lack of \nequipment and see what happens then.\n  What about Iraqi forces? On January 11, Secretary Gates said:\n\n       We are going to know pretty early on whether the Iraqis are \n     meeting their military commitments. . . .\n\n  He said we would know early on. The answer is they are not meeting \ntheir military commitments. After this weekend's violence, senior Iraqi \nofficials called on Iraqi civilians to arm themselves and fight \ninsurgents. That is from their Government. They are not telling the \npeople this Government will protect you; that the Americans have \ntrained 300,000 of us and we are ready to protect you. No. The answer \nis to arm yourselves so that when insurgents break down your door, you \ncan kill them before they kill you. What a situation.\n  The Iraqi Vice President said:\n\n       The people have no choice but to take up their own defense.\n\n  We need to chart a new course on Iraq today. As Senator Lugar said:\n\n       Persisting indefinitely with the surge strategy will delay \n     policy adjustments that have a better chance of protecting \n     our vital interests over the long term.\n\n  But the administration doesn't seem willing to chart a new course. As \nstated on the front page of today's Washington Post, ``GOP Dissent \nSpurs Change in Message But Not Course.'' That is another way of, I \nthink, confusing the subject. Get up and give a great speech and then \nyou vote against anything that has any teeth in it. You vote for \nsomething that says it is the sense of the Senate that things are not \ngoing well, rather than it is time to change this mission and get our \ntroops out of the middle of a civil war, and make sure what we are \ndoing is training the Iraqi soldiers, and that is fine, and going after \nal-Qaida, which is fine, protecting our forces, and that is fine, but \nget most of them out of there.\n  A change in message will not prevent the deaths of more Americans and \nwill not salvage the President's failed policy. Over the next 2 weeks, \nwe will have the opportunity to debate several amendments that will \nmandate a change of course on Iraq. I urge my colleagues, as strongly \nas I can, as someone who has stood up here time and time again and said \nwe are making mistakes, to finally admit it--but not just admit it, do \nsomething about it. That is what we have to do. We have to change the \nreality of what is happening.\n\n  As the experts have told us over and over again, what are we doing \nhere? We are in the middle of a civil war; we are neglecting the war on \nterror. We say we are fighting the terrorists there and we will stop \nthem from coming here. That is what Tony Blair said, but it didn't stop \nanything. This is a recruitment tool for al-Qaida. Iraq is a \nrecruitment tool for al-Qaida. Peter Bergman said that a long time ago \nwhen we went into Iraq. He is an expert on the Middle East. I don't \nwant to recruit al-Qaida; I want to go after them. I voted to go after \nthem after 9/11. I didn't vote to change course and go in another \ndirection for regime change based on faulty information, faulty \nintelligence.\n  This week and next week, we will find out who talks in the Senate and \nwho is willing to take action in the Senate. I hope the American people \nwill look at the amendments we are voting on and, at the bottom line, \nunderstand which ones are just talk and which ones will actually result \nin redeployment of the troops out of a civil war--who walks the walk \nversus who talks the talk. Action means a deadline. Action means you \nchange the mission. Action means you start bringing the troops home. \nAction doesn't mean a change in message, but a change of course. \nReshuffling the chairs on the deck of the Titanic is not what we should \nbe doing. We need to change course.\n  I have spoken with mothers and fathers who have lost sons and \ndaughters. They have begged me in the most tearful way to spare other \nfamilies what they are going through. If this war was working, that \nwould be one thing. But there is no military solution here. We need to \nlisten to what our chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee is \nsaying about a political solution, about separating the warring \nparties, about bringing in the nations of the region, and doing it \nnow--before another soldier is blown up or breaks up with his wife \nbecause of the stress, or before another child has no dad or mom. The \ntime is now.\n  I am so glad we are going to be doing the Defense authorization bill \nand have our opportunity to actually put our ideas into action. I will \nbe supporting every single amendment that will result in a change of \ncourse, accountability, starting to bring the troops home.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from Delaware for allowing \nme to go before he goes.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  [Applause in the Gallery.]\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sergeant-at-Arms will restore order in the \ngallery. The expression of approval or disapproval is not permitted.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I certainly appreciate the passion of \nthe Senator from California and her concern for the men and women \nserving in the military and those who have sacrificed a great deal \nalready. The fact is, according to Lee Hamilton and Henry Kissinger, \nGeneral Zinni, and according to literally almost every--not all--\nrespected national security expert in this country, it is acknowledged \nthat we will have a lot more casualties.\n\n[[Page S8905]]\n\n  The Senator's concern is emotional and well-founded and very moving. \nI am also moved by the fact that Henry Kissinger and Lee Hamilton say \nCongress should drop fixed deadlines for the withdrawal of U.S. forces. \nAs Commander in Chief, the President needs flexibility on troop \nwithdrawals. He will accept no bill that has a timeline or a fixed date \nfor withdrawal. Lee Hamilton says:\n\n       The American people have the war in Iraq figured out. They \n     know American troops cannot settle Iraq's sectarian conflict, \n     and they want to withdraw responsibly. They do not want a \n     messy or sudden withdrawal to prompt wider sectarian strife \n     and an escalating humanitarian disaster.\n\n  To some degree, I have seen this movie before. I remember when the \ndebate was going on on the floor of the Senate on our withdrawal from \nCambodia on December 15, 1970. Mr. Gravel, now one of the candidates \nfor President of the United States, said:\n\n       We come back to the argument of protecting American forces. \n     It is simple. Take the forces out and we do not have any \n     problem. It is simple. Do not get into Cambodia. Do not get \n     involved. Then we do not get into anything.\n\n  Yes, there was an argument on the floor of the Senate about \nwithdrawal. There was an argument that prohibited the United States \nfrom being involved in Cambodia. Three million people were \nslaughtered--one of the great acts of genocide in modern history. Yes, \nwe cared about American casualties after Vietnam and we withdrew. The \nNorth Vietnamese attacked and millions of people got on boats, \nthousands were killed in reeducation camps, and thousands were \nexecuted. I have seen this movie before. I have seen this movie before \nfrom the liberal left in America, who share no responsibility for what \nhappened in Cambodia when we said, no, as I quote Senator Gravel:\n\n       We come back to the argument of protecting American forces. \n     It is simple. Take the forces out and we do not have any \n     problem. It is simple. Do not get into Cambodia. Do not get \n     involved. Then we do not get into anything.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to finish my comments, and then I will be \nglad to yield to the Senator from California.\n  Continuing to quote Senator Gravel:\n\n       What would happen if Cambodia fell tomorrow? It may well \n     fall. . . . Obviously, it would become communistic. We would \n     have some gnashing of teeth, but life would go on. We would \n     have our traffic jams and everything else.\n\n  There were no traffic jams in Phnom Penh, Madam President, not a one. \nIn fact, all of the people were killed or told to walk out of the city.\n\n       Life would go on. Basically, that would increase the \n     casualties of Americans in South Vietnam. That would be the \n     difference, except the American people are going to get up \n     and say, ``We do not want Americans getting killed at that \n     rate.''\n        . . . it means we are going to put more money in, and if \n     there is a danger that Cambodia will be overrun 6 months from \n     now, we would have to escalate to the next higher step, and \n     they will devise some way of getting American troops in \n     there. Or they would go the mercenary route until they \n     butcher enough of those people.\n\n  Interesting.\n\n       This, to my mind, is wrong, and adds nothing to our \n     security. Supposing South Vietnam fell, and became totally \n     Communist tomorrow, and then Cambodia fell and became totally \n     Communist; would that appreciably change the life of my \n     colleague from Kansas? Would that change his life?\n\n  The debate goes on and on. It is very worthwhile reviewing the debate \nthat went on about Cambodia and Vietnam, not to mention, as I mentioned \nearlier, the impact of losing a war on America, our military, and \nothers.\n  The Senator from California and I am sure the Senator from Delaware \nwill speak very movingly about the strain on the families of the men \nand women and the strain on our troops.\n  By the way, we do in this authorization bill before us increase the \nsize of the Marine Corps and the Army, and we need to increase it even \nmore because of the challenges around the world--something that some of \nus have sought to achieve for a long period of time.\n  But the fact is, when you lose a war, the consequences of failure are \nfar, far more severe on the military than the strain that is put on the \nmilitary when they are fighting. It is a fact. It is a fact of military \nhistory. It is a fact of the war that we lost in Vietnam, which took us \nwell over a decade to restore any kind of efficiency in our military.\n  I will be glad to yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank the Senator for yielding. The \nSenator made the point that the liberal left wants us out of Iraq. I \nwant to make sure the Senator is aware that the latest polls show 70 \npercent of the American people want us to have a strategy to leave. And \nmy question is, A, is the Senator aware of that? And, B, the followup \nto that question is, has the Senator read the various proposals, the \nLevin-Reed proposal, which I strongly support? There is no precipitous \nwithdrawal.\n  I think the Senator is setting up a straw man, if you will, here. The \nfact is, those of us who want to leave want to do it in the right way--\n--\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the regular order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And we also change the mission to continue training the \ntroops, and so on. I want to make sure the Senator is aware of that \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from California for \nthat thoughtful question. The fact is, I do read the polls, and if the \nSenator from California had paid attention to my opening statement, she \nwould have known that I made it very clear that I understand the \nfrustration and sorrow of the American people. I also know a lot of us \nare not driven by polls. A lot of us are driven by principle, and a lot \nof us do what we think is right no matter what the polls say.\n  So I appreciate the concern of the Senator from California about \nwhether I read the polls. I appreciate that greatly. But I do know also \nthat when you send a signal, and I appreciate the Senator's concern--I \nwas talking about the liberal left addressing the war in Cambodia, is \nwhat I was speaking of. The record is clear, and I will be glad to \nprovide other quotes of a similar nature. But I do also know that those \nof us who study history, those of us who spend time in Iraq, those of \nus who spend time with various leaders, such as General Zinni, such as \nGeneral Scowcroft, such as Secretary of State Baker, such as many \nothers, we all know what the consequences of a date for withdrawal will \nbe. And it isn't my opinion alone. It is shared by a broad variety of \nnational security experts in this field.\n  I also point out that it does have an effect on the troops in the \nfield when they see effort after effort after effort to withdraw, to \nforce them to be withdrawn and, obviously, a failure of their mission.\n  I welcome this debate, as I said earlier. I think it is important to \ninform the American people. I think it is important to have a \nrespectful exchange of views. And I will continue to respect the views \nof the Senator from California, but I will tell her that I have seen \nthis movie before, and I have seen what happens when we have a defeated \nmilitary and we have people who assure us that a withdrawal is without \nconsequences.\n  I believe, as Henry Kissinger as recently as a few days ago said:\n\n        . . . precipitate withdrawal [from Iraq] would produce a \n     disaster. It would not end the war but shift it to other \n     areas, like Lebanon or Jordan or Saudi Arabia. The war \n     between the Iraqi functions would intensify. The \n     demonstration of American impotence would embolden radical \n     Islamism and further radicalize its disciples from Indonesia \n     and India to the suburbs of European capitals.\n\n  Natan Sharansky says the same thing. A person who knows about \noppression, who knows about freedom, who served as a beacon to me and a \nhero in my entire life says:\n\n       A precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces could lead to a \n     bloodbath that would make the current carnage pale by \n     comparison.\n\n  All of these are statements by people for whom I have the greatest \nrespect. I hope we will heed some of their admonitions.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Boxer). The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I was interested in the last exchange. \nLet me just say that one of my heroes is the Senator from Arizona. I \nmean this sincerely. We use the phrase around here ``my friend.'' I \nconsider him my friend. I believe if neither he nor I were Senators and \nI picked up a phone and\n\n[[Page S8906]]\n\ncalled him and said: I need you to show up at such-and-such a place, I \ncan't tell you why, he would be there. I do not pretend to be his best \nfriend in the world, but I admire him.\n  But I think I should point out a couple of things. No. 1, the Senator \nfrom California is not poll-driven. As I remember it, when the whole of \nthe country was clamoring to go to war, the Senator from California \nstood up and voted against going to war. If I am not mistaken, it was \nviewed as political suicide at that time. I know the Senator from \nCalifornia, and I know she needs no defense, but I know her. If I know \nanybody who is not poll-driven, it is the Senator from California, No. \n1.\n  No. 2, Henry Kissinger, Lee Hamilton, and Baker--all these people \nmentioned--they all say get out. None of them think the policy of this \nPresident makes any sense. So let's start off where they are. Henry \nKissinger has endorsed the Biden plan and the Boxer plan and all the \nrest who have done it. They need a political solution.\n  I remind everybody that the Baker-Hamilton report set a date of March \n2008 as a goal to get the majority of our troops out, if not all of \nthem out. They talked about drawing down our troops. The President \nrejected that policy.\n  I don't know a serious person--there probably are--I don't know of \nany in the international community, I don't know of anybody in the \nforeign policy establishment in the United States of America, from \nColin Powell, a former Secretary of State, to former Secretaries of \nState and Secretaries of Defense in Republican administrations, who \nthinks this policy makes any sense.\n  Madam President, I say to my colleagues, to quote Gravel--I was here \nin 1972 while my friend John McCain, God love him, was in a prisoner-\nof-war camp. I was a 29-year-old Senator. Nobody agreed with Gravel. \nGive me a break. Quoting Gravel as the voice of the left--he was the \nvoice of his voice. God love him, as my mother would say, and he still \nis the voice of his voice. Who agrees with Gravel? Maybe somebody does. \nBut to quote him as if it was the Democratic position on Cambodia--go \ncount the votes, how many votes Gravel got. That is not representative \nof even the left. This is a man who, God love him, nominated himself \nfor Vice President. Come on. Come on.\n  And who is calling for a precipitous withdrawal? If I am not \nmistaken, the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee is \nnot voting for a precipitous withdrawal. This is what we call, in the \nlaw business, which I have been practicing 34 years, a red herring.\n  The question is, Do we continue to send our kids into the middle of a \nmeat grinder based on a policy that is fundamentally flawed? I don't \nthink there are a dozen Republicans on that side of the aisle who agree \nwith the President's strategy, nor do I believe, if the President had \nfollowed the recommendation of the Senator from Delaware and then the \nSenator from Arizona back before there was a civil war to put enough \ntroops in to solidify the situation on the ground, we might not be \nhere. The rationale he offered and I offered, if I am not mistaken, \nwas: Mr. President, you don't have a strategy. Secretary of Defense, \nthese are not a bunch of dead-enders, they are not a bunch of thugs. \nThey are thugs, but you have a big problem, Mr. President.\n  If I am not mistaken, I heard the Senator from Arizona make those \nspeeches 4 years ago. I heard him, along with me, call for more troops \nback then in order to get out sooner. We predicted there would be a \ncivil war if we didn't gain control. Surprise, surprise, surprise. We \nhave a civil war.\n  Look, I understand the political dilemmas in which we find ourselves: \nWe have a President of our own party we have a problem with. I have \nbeen there. It never kept me from speaking up. If my colleagues recall, \nmy friend from California, who is presiding, remembers, to use the \ntrite expression, I beat President Clinton up and about the head, as \nthey say in the neighborhood where I come from, to use force in Bosnia, \nto end a genocide. The President didn't agree with me. I was told: Calm \ndown, don't put him in that spot. I am accustomed to taking on \nPresidents in my own party, and I know it is hard. It is hard. But I \ntell you what, name me any one of the people who were quoted here who \nthinks the policy we are pursuing now makes any sense.\n  Ever since the Democrats took control of the Congress back in \nJanuary, we have been working to build pressure on the administration \nand, quite bluntly, on our Republican colleagues to change course in \nIraq because I have reached a point where I think the President is \nimpervious to information. There is a great expression, I believe it \nwas Oliver Wendell Holmes referring to prejudice--and the President is \nnot prejudiced, but I make the point. He said prejudice is like the \npupil of the eye: the more light you shine upon it, the more tightly it \ncloses. This administration is like the pupil of the eye: the more hard \nfacts you give them to prove their policy is a failure, the tighter it \ncloses and the less inclined to change they are. More and more \nRepublicans--more and more Republicans--have stopped backing the \nPresident and started looking for ways to work with us to bring our \nsoldiers home in a responsible way so we don't merely trade a dictator \nfor chaos.\n\n  Let me say something I am going to be reminded of, I am sure, again \nand again and again. Having been here for 34 years, I know you should \nnot make statements I am about to make lightly, but I am reminded of it \nby the comments made about Cambodia. On this, we have a sell-by date. \nYou know when you buy milk, it says sell by a certain date or it turns \nsour? There is a sell-by date here, folks, for us to change policy. \nBecause if we do not change policy in a radical way in this calendar \nyear, I believe we will be left with one of two alternatives.\n  We have a chance now to change policy and maybe salvage--maybe \nsalvage--a circumstance in Iraq, whereas we gradually leave, and we \nwill not have traded a dictator for chaos and the possibility of a \nregional war. That is alternative one. I think that alternative two is \nSaigon revisited. We will be lifting American personnel off the roofs \nof buildings in the green zone if we do not change policy and pretty \ndrastically.\n  There is not a single person in here that knows anything about the \nmilitary who can tell me they think there is any possibility of us \nsustaining 160,000 forces in Iraq this time next year. What my friend \nfrom Arizona did not say--and he knows a great deal about this--is that \nleading generals in the military say straightforward that we are \nbreaking--let me emphasize that--breaking the U.S. military--breaking \nthe U.S. military. Let me put it another way. We have more \nprofessionally trained academy graduates, such as my friend from \nArizona, leaving the military after 5 years than we have had any time \nin the last 30-plus years. The cream of the crop are being broken by \nthis failed--this failed policy in Iraq.\n  What is worse is not that it is a failed policy, but it is impervious \nto recommendations made by the most informed people in both political \nparties inside and outside Government. What did the President do with \nthe Baker-Hamilton Commission? Picked it up, gave it real lip service, \nand flipped it on the shelf. Who was on that commission? Two former \nSecretaries of State, who were Republicans; the present Secretary of \nDefense; some of the leading conservative voices in America on military \nmatters; along with mainstream Democratic leaders. What did they do? \nWhat did they do? They blew it off. Now they are revisiting it. Now \npress reports are that maybe we have to have a plan B.\n  Look, it matters profoundly how we end this war. It matters to our \nsoldiers, it matters to the Iraqis, and it matters to America's future \nsecurity. As I said before, I don't want my son, a captain in the Army, \ngoing to Iraq, but he will go, if called. But I also don't want my \ngrandson going. How we leave will determine whether my grandson goes. \nSo far this President has offered absolutely no political solution to \nIraq. None.\n  What does he say? He says surge troops. Why? To give the Iraqis \nbreathing room. Why? So the Iraqis will get together and form a unity \ngovernment that can be trusted by all the Iraqi people to govern the \nnation, allowing us to leave.\n  Not in the lifetime of anyone on this floor, including these talented \nyoung pages, will there be a unity government in Baghdad that has the \nconfidence of all the Iraqi people, able to\n\n[[Page S8907]]\n\nmaintain security, provide opportunity, and have a stable unity \ngovernment. It will not happen.\n  I had a proposal over a year ago--and I have been roundly criticized \nfor it, except for the Presiding Officer and a few others--wherein I \nlaid out--and not because I am so smart; I happen to be chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee because I have lasted longer than others--\nbut I laid out a comprehensive proposal. What does everybody say in \nthis body? Everybody says, in and out of Government, that there is no \nmilitary solution to Iraq, only a political solution. Name me a single \nperson who has offered a political solution, except the Senator from \nCalifornia, myself, and the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Brownback. Name me \nanyone. What is the political solution? What is the political solution \nmy friend is offering? What is it?\n  The political solution is that somehow the Iraqis will have an \nepiphany--and I know Muslims don't have epiphanies; that is a Christian \nthing--they will have an epiphany and all of a sudden they are going to \nget together, realizing what is at stake, and form this unity \ngovernment that can deliver.\n  I met with al-Maliki last year. I have been to Iraq and Afghanistan \neight times. I am heading over there again shortly. I sat with al-\nMaliki, and when I came back, the President asked my views. He was kind \nenough to ask what I thought. I said, I don't think al-Maliki has it in \nhis bone marrow, in his heart or his brain to desire to reconcile with \nthe Sunnis. Even if he did, he doesn't have the capacity.\n  What have we rested everything on here? We are about to have a report \nthat was going to be filed this June 15, pointing out the Iraqis \nhaven't met a single benchmark. Isn't that strange? What did we do? \nEvery opportunity we had to help them along, we walked away from. I \nremember after they voted on their Constitution. I was there for the \nofficial vote, I stuck my finger in the ink that does not come off your \nfinger. I went to the polling places. The Iraqis voted overwhelmingly \nfor a constitution. Know what it says? I wish somebody would read it \nonce in a while. It says, I believe it is article 1, we are a \ndecentralized federal system. Then in articles 15, 16, 17, and 18, if I \nam not mistaken--this is from memory--it lays out how any 1 of the 18 \ngovernates, political subdivisions, basically, in Iraq can become a \nregion, vote for their own constitution, and have their own local \nsecurity. It also implies there will be an allocation of the oil \nresources through a constitutional amendment.\n  I remember immediately after that vote, coming back from my third or \nfourth trip, then meeting with the administration and saying: What are \nyou going to do? And being told: Oh, it is too premature to push any of \nthat. I said: Whoa, let me get this straight. How are you going to \nbring these folks together unless you help them implement the \nConstitution? No, no, too tough now--too tough.\n  This administration has not made, when given a choice, a single \ncorrect decision on Iraq. Hear me. That is a bold statement. I cannot \nthink of a single decision when they have been faced with a choice that \nthey have made the right choice. I cannot think of one. Way back, when \nthe President asked me why I was calling for Rumsfeld's resignation, \nand the Vice President was in the room, in the Oval Office, I said: \nWith all due respect, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, if, Mr. Vice \nPresident, you were not a constitutional officer, I would call for your \nresignation too. He looked at me and said: Why? I said: Because, Mr. \nPresident, name me one piece of advice either Rumsfeld or Cheney have \ngiven you in Iraq that has turned out to be right. Name me one. One. \nOne. It is not about retribution, Mr. President, it is about \ncompetence. If all the advice you have been given is bad, don't you \nthink it is a good idea to look for new advice--new advisers?\n\n  Look, I believe there is a comprehensive strategy to end this war \nresponsibly and it has three parts. First, is a roadmap to bring most \nof our troops out and home by early next year. Two, is a detailed plan \nfor what we leave behind, a political solution. Three, is the \ncommitment that so long as there is a single American--a single \nAmerican soldier--in Iraq, we should do everything in our power to \nprotect them.\n  Let me go through this very briefly. First, bringing our troops home. \nInstead of escalating the war with no end in sight, we have to start to \nbring our troops home now and withdraw most by next year. This was the \nBaker-Hamilton recommendation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I wish to remind the Senator that we had an \norder to recess after him speaking for 10 minutes. What is the pleasure \nof the Senator?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 10 \nmore minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered, and then \nwe will recess for the lunch hour.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If we don't start bringing home combat forces within the \nnext few months, get them out of the midst of a civil war, we will have \nso soured the American people on the ability to do even the things that \nneed be done that this President and the next President will be left \nwith absolutely no option--absolutely no option--but to withdraw \ntotally from that area and let the chips fall where they may.\n  You know, that is exactly what we started to propose, the Senator \nfrom California and others, Senator Levin, in the Biden-Hagel-Snowe-\nLevin resolution opposing the surge back in January and of the Biden-\nLevin provision in the Iraqi supplemental bill, the very thing the \nPresident vetoed. The common denominator in all these efforts has been \nto transition our troops to a more limited mission so we can start to \nbring them home and set the groundwork for being able to leave behind a \npolitical solution.\n  That is exactly what Senator Levin is doing today. He is taking the \nBiden-Levin amendment, now called the Levin-Reed amendment, and he is \ngoing back at it. I compliment him for it because we have to keep \npushing in order to change the minds of our Republican friends by \nkeeping pressure on them to start to vote for the troops and not the \nPresident.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On Page S8907, July 10, 2007 the following appears: now called \nthe Levin-Reid amendment,\n  \n  The online version has been corrected to: now called the Levin-\nReed amendment,\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  The second thing is getting our troops out of Iraq is necessary, but \nit is not sufficient. We also need a plan for what we are going to \nleave behind so we don't trade a dictator for chaos. What happens \nmatters and how it happens. About everyone agrees there is no purely \nmilitary solution. A political solution. Our plan is getting more \nbipartisan support--the so-called Biden-Brownback-Boxer-Hutchison-\nNelson-Smith amendment--and that is we recognize the fundamental \nproblem in Iraq is the self-sustaining cycle of sectarian violence.\n  I would respectfully suggest that history shows these cycles of \nsectarian violence end in only one of four ways. One, a bloodletting \nthat leaves one side victorious and both sides exhausted. In the case \nof Iraq, that would take years, and I believe it would generate a \nSunni-Shia revival of hatred from the Mediterranean to the Himalayas.\n  Second, is an open-ended foreign occupation for a generation or more. \nThat is not in America's DNA. It is not what we do. We are not the \nOttoman Empire.\n  Third, a return to a strong man, one who is not on the horizon. Even \nif there were, wouldn't it be the ultimate tragic irony that the United \nStates replaced Saddam Hussein with another dictator?\n  The fourth way they have ended is a political agreement to form a \ndecentralized federal government that separates the warring factions, \ngives them breathing room in their own regions. That is what we did a \ndecade ago in Bosnia. We have had over 24,000 NATO troops there for 10 \nyears and not one has been killed. The sectarian violence has stopped, \nthe genocide is over, and they are trying to become part of Europe. The \nplan we put forward has five pieces. I will not take the time to go \ninto it now, but one is in order to maintain a unified Iraq we have to \ndecentralize it, with a limited central government that has common \nconcerns of guarding the border and distributing oil revenues.\n\n  Second, we have to secure support from the Sunnis by giving them a \nguaranteed piece of the oil revenues because they have nothing in that \ntriangle.\n  Third, we have to increase, not diminish, aid to rebuild that \ncountry, and we should look to the gulf states who have an overwhelming \ninterest and overflow of dollars to do that.\n\n[[Page S8908]]\n\n  Fourth, since we have lost all credibility in the region, this has to \nbe a consequence, this idea--it has to have an international imprimatur \non it. It must come out of the Security Council. They must call an \ninternational conference. It must involve the stamp of the United \nNations and a regional conference, where the international community \npursues this--and they are ready to do it. I will not take the time to \ngo into why.\n  Last, we have to begin to draw down. We have to have military plans \nto draw down our combat forces by 2008, leaving behind a small force to \ntake on terrorists and train Iraqis, assuming there is a political \nsettlement. If there is no political settlement, mark my words, the \npublic will insist they all come home. If they come home it means \neverything comes home. The idea that we are going to be able to leave \nan embassy there with thousands of people without 10,000 or more \nAmerican soldiers to guard it is a joke. If we fail to make federalism \nwork, if there is no political accommodation at the center, violent \nresistance will increase, the sectarian cycle of revenge will continue \nto spiral out of control, and we will not have this country break into \nthree neat pieces. You will watch it fragment into multiple pieces, \ncreating incredible difficulties for the entire region.\n  The Bush administration, though, has another vision. Their vision for \nIraq, their entire premise, as I said, is based on a fundamentally \nflawed premise that they can build a competent, popular, supported \ngovernment based upon a consensus among the three parties, and it \nreside in Baghdad. That is the central flaw in their strategy. It \ncannot be sustained. The hard truth is that absent a foreign occupation \nor a dictator, Iraq cannot be run from the center. The sooner we \nunderstand that, as Secretary Kissinger does and all the people quoted \ntoday--the sooner we understand that, the faster we will get this thing \nresolved and the fewer American casualties there will be.\n  The last part of this strategy is, so long as we have a single \nsoldier in Iraq, it is our most sacred responsibility to give him or \nher the best protection this country can provide. Two months ago I \ncalled upon the President and Secretary Gates to make building of Mine \nResistant Ambush Protected vehicles, so-called MRAPs, the Nation's top \npriority. Roadside bombs are responsible for 70 percent of the 25,000-\nplus injuries and 70 percent of the roughly 3,600 deaths. It is hard to \nkeep count, unfortunately; 70 percent. Yet if we transition our troops \nfrom those flat-bottomed, up-armored HMMWVs to these V-shaped-bottom \nMRAPs, the facts show that somewhere between 66 percent and 80 percent \nof the casualties will be avoided.\n  An article on the front page of USA Today last Friday pointed out a \nmilitary person saying if we built these when we were supposed to, \nthere would be, I think, 731 fewer deaths.\n  These are our sons, our daughters, not somebody else's--all of ours. \nThese are the people. These are the kite strings upon which our whole \nnational ambition is lifted aloft. What are we doing? What are we \ndoing? We are spending $10 billion a month in Iraq, and I get push-back \nfor wanting to spend $20 billion to build these vehicles? I find it \nobscene.\n  I fought to front load money in the emergency spending bill for these \nvehicles. As a result we will get 2,500 more of these vehicles to Iraq \nby the end of the year than we otherwise would have. That is why I \nvoted for the bill.\n  But I also insisted that the administration tell us by June 15 \nwhether it would need even more of these vehicles so that we make sure \nthe money is there to get them built.\n  Last week the Army concluded that it would need seven times the \nnumber of mine-resistant vehicles it had originally requested--some \n17,700, up from 2,500. When you factor in all the service requests, the \ntotal need for mine-resistant vehicles jumps from the 7,774 vehicles \nnow planned to nearly 23,000 vehicles.\n  But the Joint Chiefs have not yet made the Army request a ``clear and \nurgent'' requirement.\n  And there is no plan to budget for and build these vehicles over the \nnext 6 months, as well as proven technology that protects against so-\ncalled explosively formed projectiles--EFP--that strike from the side.\n  We need a commitment from the administration--now--to build every \nlast one of these vehicles as soon as possible.\n  We can't wait till next year or the year after. Our men and women on \nthe front lines need them now.\n  I will offer an amendment to the Defense bill to make it clear--with \nabsolutely no ambiguity--that Congress will provide every dollar needed \nand every authority necessary to build these vehicles as quickly as \npossible.\n  Every day we delay is another life lost.\n  The war in Iraq must end. That is what the American people want. And \nthat is where America's interests lie.\n  I conclude by saying that in Congress we have a tremendous \nresponsibility to turn the will of the American people into a practical \nreality. It is long past time we meet this responsibility head on, and \nit is long past time our Republican colleagues join us in what I \nbelieve they know to be right--forcing this President to radically \nchange course in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/10/senate-section/article/S8908-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be laid aside so that an amendment by Senator Specter and \nmyself be in order for discussion, with the understanding that then \nthat amendment will eventually be set aside so we can go back to the \nprior amendment.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I object on behalf of another Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I withdraw my request, but I would note that the Senate \nthis week is considering the National Defense Authorization Act. \nSenator Specter and I will introduce an amendment at such a point as we \ndo not receive objection from the Republican side. What we will \nintroduce will be the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007.\n  I want to, first and foremost, thank and actually praise Senator \nSpecter for his strong and consistent leadership on this issue. It is \nnot just leadership this year, it has been leadership in past years. I \nhope all Senators, both Republicans and Democrats, join us in restoring \nbasic American values and the rule of law while making our Nation \nstronger.\n  Last year, Congress committed a historic mistake by suspending the \ngreat writ of habeas corpus. They did this not only for those confined \nat Guantanamo Bay but for millions of people who are legally residents \nin the United States.\n  We held a hearing on this, the Senate Judiciary Committee did, in \nMay. That hearing illustrated broad agreement among people of very \ndiverse political views and backgrounds, that the mistake committed in \nthe Military Commissions Act of 2006 has to be corrected. The Habeas \nCorpus Restoration Act of 2007 has 25 cosponsors, and the Senate \nJudiciary Committee passed it last month with a bipartisan vote.\n  Habeas corpus was recklessly undermined in last year's Military \nCommissions Act. Like the internment of Japanese Americans during World \nWar II, the elimination of habeas rights was an action driven by fear, \nand it has been a stain on America's reputation in the world. In many \nplaces around the world where we had been so admired in the past, they \nhave asked why would America turn its back on one of its most basic \nrights.\n  We are at a time of testing. Future generations will look back to \nexamine the choices we made during a time when security was too often \ninvoked as a watchword to convince us to slacken our defense of liberty \nand the rule of law.\n  The great writ of habeas corpus is the legal process that guarantees \nan\n\n[[Page S8909]]\n\nopportunity to go to court and challenge the abuse of power by the \nGovernment. It is enshrined in the Constitution, and as stalwart a \nRepublican conservative as Justice Antonin Scalia has recently referred \nto it as ``the very core of liberty secured by our Anglo-Saxon system \nof separation of powers.''\n  The Military Commissions Act rolled back these protections by \neliminating that right permanently for any non-citizen labeled an enemy \ncombatant. In fact, a detainee does not have to be found to be an enemy \ncombatant; it is enough for the Government to pick up someone, hold \nthat person with no charges, and say: They are awaiting determination. \nWhen we make up our mind this year, or next year, or 10 years from now, \nthen we may label them an enemy combatant. In the meantime, they do not \neven have the power to say to a court: They picked up the wrong guy. \nThey don't even have my name right. They picked me up by mistake. You \ncan't even do that.\n  Is this America? Is this America?\n  The sweep of this habeas provision goes far beyond the few hundred \ndetainees currently held at Guantanamo Bay, and it includes an \nestimated 12 million lawful permanent residents in the United States \ntoday. Under this law, the people who can be picked up are people who \nwork and pay taxes, who abide by our laws, and should be entitled to \nfair treatment.\n  Under this law, any of these people can be detained forever without \nany ability to challenge their detention in court. Stanford Professor \nMariano-Florentino Cuellar called this an issue about which the Latino \ncommunity, which encompasses so many of the Nation's legal permanent \nresidents, must be concerned.\n  Giving the Government such raw, unfettered power should concern every \nAmerican. Since last fall, I have been describing a nightmare scenario \nabout a hard-working, legal permanent resident who makes an innocent \ndonation to, among other charities, a Muslim charity, that the \nGovernment secretly suspects of ties to terrorism. I suggested that on \nthe basis of this donation, and perhaps a report of suspicious behavior \nof an overzealous neighbor or a cursory review of library records, this \npermanent resident can be brought in for questioning, can be denied a \nlawyer, and confined indefinitely. Such a person would have no recourse \nin the courts for years, or for decades, or forever.\n  When I said this, some people thought this nightmare scenario was \nfanciful. I wish it were, but it was not. In November that scenario was \nconfirmed by our Department of Justice in a legal brief submitted in a \nFederal court in Virginia. They asserted that the Military Commissions \nAct allows the Government to detain any non-citizen designated an enemy \ncombatant without giving that person any ability to challenge his \ndetention in court. This is true, the Justice Department said, even for \nsomeone arrested and imprisoned in the United States. In other words, \nwe could do what we always condemned other countries for doing, \ncountries behind the then-Iron Curtain, where they would pick up \nsomebody, hold them indefinitely, and that person had no recourse in \ncourt.\n  Rightly so, Republican and Democratic Presidents condemned those \ncountries for doing that. Now we have given ourselves the same power. \nThe Washington Post wrote that the brief ``raises the possibility that \nany of the millions of immigrants living in the United States could be \nsubject to indefinite detention if they are accused of ties to \nterrorist groups.'' I might add, this accusation can be totally \nerroneous.\n\n  This is wrong; it is unconstitutional. But more than that, it is \ntruly un-American. It is designed to ensure that the Bush-Cheney \nadministration will never again be embarrassed by court decisions that \nreview their unlawful abuses of power.\n  The conservative Supreme Court, with seven of its nine members \nappointed by Republican Presidents, has been the only check in this \nadministration's lawlessness. The Supreme Court and other conservative \nFederal courts, and recently even military judges, have repeatedly \noverturned the lawless systems set up by this administration governing \ndetainees. Many have hoped the courts will come to the rescue again on \nthe issue of habeas corpus. With the continued drift of the Supreme \nCourt toward endorsing greater executive power, we cannot count on the \nintervention of this conservative, activist court. Besides, are we \ngoing to pass the buck? Congress cannot and must not outsource its \nmoral responsibility.\n  We all want to make America safe from terrorism. We come to work \nproudly every day, in a building that was targeted by those criminals \nwho hijacked planes on 9/11. We do not hesitate to come to work here. \nWe do it proudly. I implore those who support this change to think \nabout whether eliminating habeas corpus truly makes America safe from \nthe world. Does it make us any safer in this building? Does it comport \nwith the values and liberties and legal traditions we hold most dear?\n  Top conservative thinkers such as Professor Richard Epstein and David \nKeene, head of the American Conservative Union, agree this change \nbetrays centuries of legal tradition and practice. Professor David \nGushee, head of Evangelicals for Human Rights, submitted a declaration \ncalling the elimination of habeas rights and related changes ``deeply \nlamentable'' and ``fraught with danger to basic human rights.''\n  GEN Colin Powell recently advocated habeas corpus rights for \ndetainees, asking:\n\n       Isn't that what our system's all about?\n\n  General Powell has it right.\n  But probably the most powerful for me was the testimony of RADM \nDonald Guter, who was working in his office in the Pentagon as Judge \nAdvocate General of the Navy. He was working there on September 11, \n2001. He saw firsthand the effects of criminality and terrorism. He saw \nhis colleagues killed by the plane that crashed into the Pentagon. I \nbelieve his credibility is unimpeachable when he says that denying \nhabeas rights to detainees endangers our troops and undermines our \nmilitary efforts. In testimony to the committee, Admiral Guter wrote:\n\n       As we limit the rights of human beings, even those of the \n     enemy, we become more like the enemy. That makes us weaker \n     and imperils our valiant troops, serving not just in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan, but around the globe.\n\n  The admiral was right. Whether you are an individual soldier or a \ngreat and good nation, it is difficult to defend the higher ground by \ntaking the lower road. The world knows what our enemies stand for. The \nworld also knows what this country has tried to stand for and live up \nto in the best of times but especially in the worst of times.\n  Now as we work to reauthorize the many programs that comprise our \nvaliant Armed Forces, it is the right time to heed the advice of \nAdmiral Guter and so many of our top military lawyers who tell us that \neliminating basic legal rights undermines our fighting men and women, \nit does not make them stronger. Elimination of basic legal rights \nundermines, not strengthens, our ability to achieve justice.\n  It is from strength that America should defend our values and our way \nof life. It is from the strength of our freedoms and our Constitution \nand the rule of law that we shall prevail. I hope all in the Senate, \nRepublican and Democrat alike, will join us in standing up for a \nstronger America, for the America we believe in, and support the Habeas \nCorpus Restoration Act of 2007.\n  That is why I am proud to be here with the distinguished senior \nSenator from Pennsylvania. We have worked together. You know, every one \nof us serves here only for a certain time. When we leave, we have to \nask ourselves: If we had the privilege of being only 1 of 100 people to \nget to represent 300 million in America in this great body, what do we \ndo to make America better? If we leave this blight--if we leave this \nblight--on our laws, we have not made it better, we have made it \nweaker.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nVermont, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for his generous \nremarks. I compliment him on his leadership on the committee and for \nhis work generally, but especially on our efforts to restore habeas \ncorpus.\n  The Great Writ has been the law since 1215 for Great Britain, and it \nhas been the law of the United States of America since the founding of \nthe Constitution. That writ allows someone in\n\n[[Page S8910]]\n\ndetention to receive evidence of a reason for detention before the \ndetention can continue. Regrettably, the legislation in the Military \nCommissions Act, passed last year, eliminated the writ of habeas \ncorpus. I offered an amendment last September, which was defeated \nnarrowly 48 to 51, and then on December 5, 2006. Again on January 4 of \nthis year, with the new Congress, I reintroduced legislation to bring \nback the writ of habeas corpus.\n  We have on the detainees in Guantanamo a procedure on what is called \nthe Combat Status Review Board. The procedures there are fundamentally \nunfair in not establishing any colorable reason for detention. That has \nbeen demonstrated in a variety of contexts.\n  One which I would quote at the outset is an opinion which appears in \n355 F. Supp. 443, in a case captioned ``In re Guantanamo Detainee \nCases,'' where the court comments about the procedures in the case \ncaptioned ``Boumediene v. Bush.'' This involves an individual, a \ndetainee, who was charged with associating with al-Qaida. This is what \nthe transcript says.\n\n       Detainee: Give me his name.\n       Tribunal President: I do not know.\n       Detainee: How can I respond to this?\n\n  Then the detainee goes on to comment about his inability to respond \nto the charges that he associated with someone from al-Qaida because he \ndoes not have any way to identify the individual with whom he was \nsupposed to have associated. Nobody could even give him his name.\n  At one point the detainee comments about his difficulty in responding \nto a charge when there is no charge, and as the opinion says, everyone \nin the tribunal laughs. The court notes the laughter reflected in the \ntranscript is understandable. This exchange might have been truly \nhumorous had the consequences of the detainee's enemy combatant status \nnot been so terribly serious and had the detainee's criticism of this \nprocess not been so piercingly accurate.\n  But here is a case reported where the Combat Status Review Board \nupheld detention when they could not even tell the detainee the \nidentity of the person who was supposedly an al-Qaida person with whom \nhe was supposed to have been associated.\n  There has been considerable comment about the fundamentally unfair \ntactics in the Combat Status Review Board, but none came into sharper \nfocus than the declaration of LTC Stephen Abraham, who worked on the \nCombat Status Review Board, and who found, with some substantial \ndetail, the process was fundamentally flawed. Results were influenced \nby pressure from superiors rather than based on concrete evidence.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the text of the \ndeclaration of LTC Stephen Abraham be printed in the Record at the end \nof my remarks to permit me to abbreviate the length of this floor \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia came \ndown with the decision in the Boumediene case saying that the act of \nCongress was effective in eliminating habeas corpus, but in so doing, \nthe Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia really ignored the \ndecision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Rasul v. Bush.\n  To read the opinion of the Court of Appeals, for a student of the \nlaw, is not hard to understand; it is impossible to understand. I think \na fair reading of the circuit opinion, simply stated, is that they \nflagrantly disregarded the holding of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates, which under our system of laws they are obligated to uphold. \nThey analyzed Rasul and said Rasul was based on the statute providing \nfor habeas corpus and not on the constitutional mandate that habeas \ncorpus is a part of the Constitution of the United States.\n  There can be no doubt that habeas corpus is a constitutional mandate \nbecause the Constitution explicitly states that habeas corpus may be \nsuspended only in time of invasion or rebellion, and no one contends \nthat we have either invasion or rebellion. The opinion of Rasul is \nexplicit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that relevant portions of the \nRasul opinion be printed in the Record following my statement--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Without taking the time to read them into the Record now \nbecause they are apparent on their face that the opinion by Justice \nStevens goes through the chronology of the writ, starting with King \nJohn at Runnymede in 1215 and running through the adoption of the \nconstitutional provision in the U.S. Constitution.\n  Now, it is true there is also a statute which provides for a writ of \nhabeas corpus. The Court of Appeals said the portion of Justice \nStevens' opinion as to the constitutional basis for habeas corpus was \ndictum and that the holding involved the statute. The Court of Appeals \nsays since the holding involved the statute, the statute could be \nchanged. It is true the statute was changed by the Congress of the \nUnited States, but the Congress of the United States, by statute, \ncannot change the constitutional mandate of habeas corpus.\n\n  For the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to say the \nconstitutional basis for habeas corpus in Rasul was not the holding but \nonly the statute was the holding is, simply stated, ridiculous. It is \ninsulting to the Supreme Court of the United States for what the Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia did. Pretty harsh words, but \naccurate words, and I say them with respect for every court. But as a \nlawyer who has worked with the Constitution for a number of decades, it \nwas hard for me to comprehend how the District of Columbia Court of \nAppeals could come to that conclusion. But they did. Well, I think it \nis about to be corrected.\n  There has been a curious history on the petition for a writ of \ncertiorari to review the decision by the Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia. There were only three votes for the original \npetition for a writ of certiorari, which surprised people because \nJustice Stevens did not vote for certiorari. But, instead, he joined \nwith Justice Kennedy in an opinion saying they would await another \nappeal from the Combat Status Review Board. The speculation by the \nanalysts was that Justice Stevens was reluctant to see certiorari \ngranted because Rasul might be overruled.\n  But then after the declaration of LTC Stephen Abraham appeared in the \npublic press, there was a petition for reconsideration of the writ of \ncertiorari. On this occasion, it was granted in a very unusual \nprocedure. It made the front pages. I have studied the Constitution for \na long time, and I did not know that a petition for reconsideration on \na writ of certiorari takes five votes. Perhaps my distinguished \ncolleague from Vermont knew that. I asked that question of quite a few \nlawyers. I have not found one yet, and some very learned in \nconstitutional law who knew if you petition for reconsideration on a \nwrit of certiorari, it takes five votes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield on that point, \nwhen I saw that in the press I went and looked it up too. It was a \nsurprise to me. It will be interesting to see what might come out of \nit, but I think it goes back, though, to what the Senator and I have \ntalked about. We should not have to be bucking this to the Supreme \nCourt for them to decide. We should correct the error here.\n  I will be leaving the floor at this moment, Mr. President, but I want \nto assure the Senator from Pennsylvania, when they do allow our \namendment to come up, I will be here with him proudly side by side on \nthis issue. We can correct what otherwise would become a historic \nmistake. With his help, his leadership, we will do that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Vermont for \nthose comments. I do not think there is a more important issue to come \nbefore this body. What happens in Iraq, obviously, is of enormous \nimportance. But if we lose the basic fundamental rights to require \nevidence before somebody is held in detention, if we lose the right of \nhabeas corpus, it is a very sad day in America.\n  But, in any event, now the Supreme Court of the United States has \ngranted certiorari in the Boumediene case. The speculation is that \nJustice Kennedy was the fifth vote, along with Justice Stevens. They do \nnot tell you who the\n\n[[Page S8911]]\n\nfive votes are, but we know there were three votes initially from \nJustice Souter and Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg granting it, \nvoting to grant certiorari before, and Justice Stevens and Justice \nKennedy writing a separate opinion, and the other four Justices voting \nto deny certiorari.\n  So I think this case is headed to the Supreme Court of the United \nStates for reversal by the opinion by the Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia. But I believe the Congress should act in the \ninterim. That is why Senator Leahy and I are pressing this issue on the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill. I hope it will not be cited \nas grounds for veto if we are successful in putting this amendment \nthrough. We cannot offer it yet because there is an amendment pending, \nand the request to set the amendment aside, which requires unanimous \nconsent, was objected to. But this is a very important amendment. The \nprocedures in Guantanamo under the Combat Status Review Board are \nwoefully inadequate, do not satisfy the requirements of the Supreme \nCourt of the United States in having a collateral proceeding which is \nadequate to protect the rights of someone who is in detention. So when \nwe are permitted to offer the amendment, we will do so. But I ask my \ncolleagues to consider the background as to what has happened here, the \nimportance of it and its abrogation, what is happening with Guantanamo, \nthe disrepute there, and what is happening with the Combat Status \nReview Board so that the Congress can correct what I consider to be an \nerror made last year and stand up and not await a decision by the \nSupreme Court of the United States.\n\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nDeclaration of Stephen Abraham, Lieutenant Colonel, United States Army \n                         Reserve, June 15, 2007\n\n       I, Stephen Abraham, hereby declare as follows:\n       1. I am a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army \n     Reserve, having been commissioned in 1981 as an officer in \n     Intelligence Corps. I have served as an intelligence officer \n     from 1982 to the present during periods of both reserve and \n     active duty, including mobilization in 1990 (``Operation \n     Desert Storm'') and twice again following 9-11. In my \n     civilian occupation, I am an attorney with the law firm Fink \n     & Abraham LLP in Newport Beach, California.\n       2. This declaration responds to certain statements in the \n     Declaration of Rear Admiral (Retired) James M. McGarrah \n     (``McGarrah Dec.''), filed in Bismullah v. Gates, No. 06-1197 \n     (D.C. Cir.). This declaration is limited to unclassified \n     matters specifically related to the procedures employed by \n     Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of \n     Enemy Combatants (``OARDEC'') and the Combatant Status Review \n     Tribunals (``CSRTs'') rather than to any specific information \n     gathered or used in a particular case, except as noted \n     herein. The contents of this declaration are based solely on \n     my personal observations and experiences as a member of \n     OARDEC. Nothing in this declaration is intended to reflect or \n     represent the official opinions of the Department of Defense \n     or the Department of the Army.\n       3. From September 11, 2004 to March 9, 2005, I was on \n     active duty and assigned to OARDEC. Rear Admiral McGarrah \n     served as the Director of OARDEC during the entirety of my \n     assignment.\n       4. While assigned to OARDEC, in addition to other duties, I \n     worked as an agency liaison, responsible for coordinating \n     with government agencies, including certain Department of \n     Defense (``DoD'') and non-DoD organizations, to gather or \n     validate information relating to detainees for use in CSRTs. \n     I also served as a member of a CSRT, and had the opportunity \n     to observe and participate in the operation of the CSRT \n     process.\n       5. As stated in the McGarrah Dec., the information \n     comprising the Government Information and the Government \n     Evidence was not compiled personally by the CSRT Recorder, \n     but by other individuals in OARDEC. The vast majority of the \n     personnel assigned to OARDEC were reserve officers from the \n     different branches of service (Army, Navy, Air Force, \n     Marines) of varying grades and levels of general military \n     experience. Few had any experience or training in the legal \n     or intelligence fields.\n       6. The Recorders of the tribunals were typically relatively \n     junior officers with little training or experience in matters \n     relating to the collection, processing, analyzing, and/or \n     dissemination of intelligence material. In no instances known \n     to me did any of the Recorders have any significant personal \n     experience in the field of military intelligence. Similarly, \n     I was unaware of any Recorder having any significant or \n     relevant experience dealing with the agencies providing \n     information to be used as a part of the CSRT process.\n       7. The Recorders exercised little control over the process \n     of accumulating information to be presented to the CSRT board \n     members. Rather, the information was typically aggregated by \n     individuals identified as case writers who, in most \n     instances, had the same limited degree of knowledge and \n     experience relating to the intelligence community and \n     intelligence products. The case writers, and not the \n     Recorders, were primarily responsible for accumulating \n     documents, including assembling documents to be used in the \n     drafting of an unclassified summary of the factual basis for \n     the detainee's designation as an enemy combatant.\n       8. The information used to prepare the files to be used by \n     the Recorders frequently consisted of finished intelligence \n     products of a generalized nature--often outdated, often \n     ``generic,'' rarely specifically relating to the individual \n     subjects of the CSRTs or to the circumstances related to \n     those individuals' status.\n       9. Beyond ``generic'' information, the case writer would \n     frequently rely upon information contained within the Joint \n     Detainee Information Management System (``JDIMS''). The \n     subset of that system available to the case writers was \n     limited in terms of the scope of information, typically \n     excluding information that was characterized as highly \n     sensitive law enforcement information, highly classified \n     information, or information not voluntarily released by the \n     originating agency. In that regard, JDIMS did not constitute \n     a complete repository, although this limitation was \n     frequently not understood by individuals with access to or \n     who relied upon the system as a source of information. Other \n     databases available to the case writer were similarly \n     deficient. The case writers and Recorders did not have access \n     to numerous information sources generally available within \n     the intelligence community.\n       10. As one of only a few intelligence-trained and suitably \n     cleared officers, I served as a liaison while assigned to \n     OARDEC, acting as a go-between for OARDEC and various \n     intelligence organizations. In that capacity, I was tasked to \n     review and/or obtain information relating to individual \n     subjects of the CSRTs. More specifically, I was asked to \n     confirm and represent in a statement to be relied upon by the \n     CSRT board members that the organizations did not possess \n     ``exculpatory information'' relating to the subject of the \n     CSRT.\n       11. During my trips to the participating organizations, I \n     was allowed only limited access to information, typically \n     prescreened and filtered. I was not permitted to see any \n     information other than that specifically prepared in advance \n     of my visit. I was not permitted to request that further \n     searches be performed. I was given no assurances that the \n     information provided for my examination represented a \n     complete compilation of information or that any summary of \n     information constituted an accurate distillation of the body \n     of available information relating to the subject.\n       12. I was specifically told on a number of occasions that \n     the information provided to me was all that I would be shown, \n     but I was never told that the information that was provided \n     constituted all available information. On those occasions \n     when I asked that a representative of the organization \n     provide a written statement that there was no exculpatory \n     evidence, the requests were summarily denied.\n       13. At one point, following a review of information, I \n     asked the Office of General Counsel of the intelligence \n     organization that I was visiting for a statement that no \n     exculpatory information had been withheld. I explained that I \n     was tasked to review all available materials and to reach a \n     conclusion regarding the non-existence of exculpatory \n     information, and that I could not do so without knowing that \n     I had seen all information.\n       14. The request was denied, coupled with a refusal even to \n     acknowledge whether there existed additional information that \n     I was not permitted to review. In short, based upon the \n     selective review that I was permitted, I was left to \n     ``infer'' from the absence of exculpatory information in the \n     materials I was allowed to review that no such information \n     existed in materials I was not allowed to review.\n       15. Following that exchange, I communicated to Rear Admiral \n     McGarrah and the OARDEC Deputy Director the fundamental \n     limitations imposed upon my review of the organization's \n     files and my inability to state conclusively that no \n     exculpatory information existed relating to the CSRT \n     subjects. It was not possible for me to certify or validate \n     the non-existence of exculpatory evidence as related to any \n     individual undergoing the CSRT process.\n       16. The content of intelligence products, including \n     databases, made available to case writers, Recorders, or \n     liaison officers, was often left entirely to the discretion \n     of the organizations providing the information. What \n     information was not included in the bodies of intelligence \n     products was typically unknown to the case writers and \n     Recorders, as was the basis for limiting the information. In \n     other words, the person preparing materials for use by the \n     CSRT board members did not know whether they had examined all \n     available information or even why they possessed some pieces \n     of information but not others.\n       17. Although OARDEC personnel often received large amounts \n     of information, they often had no context for determining \n     whether the information was relevant or probative and no \n     basis for determining what additional information would be \n     necessary to establish a basis for determining the \n     reasonableness of any matter to be offered to the CSRT board\n\n[[Page S8912]]\n\n     members. Often, information that was gathered was discarded \n     by the case writer or the Recorder because it was considered \n     to be ambiguous, confusing, or poorly written. Such a \n     determination was frequently the result of the case writer or \n     Recorder's lack of training or experience with the types of \n     information provided. In my observation, the case writer or \n     Recorder, without proper experience or a basis for giving \n     context to information, often rejected some information \n     arbitrarily while accepting other information without any \n     articulable rationale.\n       18. The case writer's summaries were reviewed for quality \n     assurance, a process that principally focused on format and \n     grammar. The quality assurance review would not ordinarily \n     check the accuracy of the information underlying the case \n     writer's unclassified summary for the reason that the quality \n     assurance reviewer typically had little more experience than \n     the case writer and, again, no relevant or meaningful \n     intelligence or legal experience, and therefore had no skills \n     by which to critically assess the substantive portions of the \n     summaries.\n       19. Following the quality assurance process, the \n     unclassified summary and the information assembled by the \n     case writer in support of the summary would then be forwarded \n     to the Recorder. It was very rare that a Recorder or a \n     personal representative would seek additional information \n     beyond that information provided by the case writer.\n       20. It was not apparent to me how assignments to CSRT \n     panels were made, nor was I personally involved in that \n     process. Nevertheless, I discerned the determinations of who \n     would be assigned to any particular position, whether as a \n     member of a CSRT or to some other position, to be largely the \n     product of ad hoc decisions by a relatively small group of \n     individuals. All CSRT panel members were assigned to OARDEC \n     and reported ultimately to Rear Admiral McGarrah. It was well \n     known by the officers in OARDEC that any time a CSRT panel \n     determined that a detainee was not properly classified as an \n     enemy combatant, the panel members would have to explain \n     their finding to the OARDEC Deputy Director. There would be \n     intensive scrutiny of the finding by Rear Admiral McGarrah \n     who would, in turn, have to explain the finding to his \n     superiors, including the Under Secretary of the Navy.\n       21. On one occasion, I was assigned to a CSRT panel with \n     two other officers, an Air Force colonel and an Air Force \n     major, the latter understood by me to be a judge advocate. We \n     reviewed evidence presented to us regarding the recommended \n     status of a detainee. All of us found the information \n     presented to lack substance.\n       22. What were purported to be specific statements of fact \n     lacked even the most fundamental earmarks of objectively \n     credible evidence. Statements allegedly made by percipient \n     witnesses lacked detail. Reports presented generalized \n     statements in indirect and passive forms without stating the \n     source of the information or providing a basis for \n     establishing the reliability or the credibility of the \n     source. Statements of interrogators presented to the panel \n     offered inferences from which we were expected to draw \n     conclusions favoring a finding of ``enemy combatant'' but \n     that, upon even limited questioning from the panel, yielded \n     the response from the Recorder, ``We'll have to get back to \n     you.'' The personal representative did not participate in any \n     meaningful way.\n       23. On the basis of the paucity and weakness of the \n     information provided both during and after the CSRT hearing, \n     we determined that there was no factual basis for concluding \n     that the individual should be classified as an enemy \n     combatant. Rear Admiral McGarrah and the Deputy Director \n     immediately questioned the validity of our findings. They \n     directed us to write out the specific questions that we had \n     raised concerning the evidence to allow the Recorder an \n     opportunity to provide further responses. We were then \n     ordered to reopen the hearing to allow the Recorder to \n     present further argument as to why the detainee should be \n     classified as an enemy combatant. Ultimately, in the absence \n     of any substantive response to the questions and no basis for \n     concluding that additional information would be forthcoming, \n     we did not change our determination that the detainee was not \n     properly classified as an enemy combatant. OARDEC's response \n     to the outcome was consistent with the few other instances in \n     which a finding of ``Not an Enemy Combatant'' (NEC) had been \n     reached by CSRT boards. In each of the meetings that I \n     attended with OARDEC leadership following a finding of NEC, \n     the focus of inquiry on the part of the leadership was ``what \n     went wrong.''\n       24. I was not assigned to another CSRT panel.\n       I hereby declare under the penalties of perjury based on my \n     personal knowledge that the foregoing is true and accurate.\n     Stephen Abraham.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                 (Cite as: 542 U.S. 466, 124 S.Ct. 2686\n\n       [1] Congress has granted federal district courts, ``within \n     their respective, jurisdictions,'' the authority to hear \n     applications for habeas corpus by any person who claims to be \n     held ``in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or \n     treaties of the United States.'' 28 U.S.C.

The Court has, for example, entertained \n     the habeas petitions of an American citizen who plotted an \n     attack on military installations during the Civil War, Ex \n     parte *475 Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 18 L.Ed. 281 (1866), and \n     of admitted enemy aliens convicted of war crimes during a \n     declared war and held in the United States, Ex parte \n     Quirin, 317 U.S. 1, 63 S.Ct. 2, 87 L.Ed. 3 (1942), and its \n     insular possessions, In reo Yamashita, 327 U.S. 1, 66 \n     S.Ct. 340, 90 L.Ed. 499 (1946).\n       The question now before us is whether the habeas confers a \n     right to judicial review of the legality of executive \n     detention of aliens in a territory over which the United \n     States exercises plenary and exclusive jurisdiction, but not \n     ``ultimate sovereignty.''\n\n       Application of the habeas statute to persons detained at \n     the base is consistent with the historical reach of the writ \n     of habeas corpus. At common law, courts exercised habeas \n     jurisdiction over the claims of aliens detained within \n     sovereign territory of the realm, [FN11] as well as the \n     claims of **2697 persons *482 detained in the so-called \n     ``exempt jurisdictions,'' where ordinary writs did not run, \n     [FN12] and all other dominions under the sovereign's control. \n     [FN13] As Lord Mansfield wrote in 1759, even if a territory \n     was ``no part of the realm,'' there was ``no doubt'' as to \n     the court's power to issue writs of habeas corpus if the \n     territory was ``under the subjection of the Crown.'' King v. \n     Cowle, 2 Burr. 834, 854-855, 97 Eng. Rep. 587, 598-599 \n     (K.B.). Later cases confirmed that the reach of the writ \n     depended not on formal notions of territorial sovereignty, \n     but rather on the practical question of ``the exact extent \n     and nature of the jurisdiction or dominion exercised in fact \n     by the Crown.'' Ex parte Mwenya, [1960] 1 Q.B. 241, 303 \n     (C.A.) (Lord Evershed, M. R.).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of and as a \ncosponsor of amendment No. 2012. I salute Senator Webb and my \ncolleagues who joined in this effort which would set a standard for how \nmuch time our troops get at home between deployments. We owe it to our \ntroops and to our families to have a rational and reasonable troop \nrotation policy that allows our fighting forces to be at their best.\n  The ever-quickening operational tempo over the last 4 years of combat \nin Iraq and Afghanistan has stretched our military beyond reason and \nendangered our national security. Continuing to shorten the time our \ntroops\n\n[[Page S8913]]\n\nare able to spend at home while extending deployments is simply not a \nsustainable policy. It is bad for operational readiness, it is bad for \nretention, it is bad for morale, and it is bad for the health of our \nmilitary members and their families. We must do better to protect our \nnational security, and this amendment moves us in the right direction.\n  In the time I have spent with our servicemembers in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, at Fort Carson and at the many military installations \naround Colorado, I have always found our servicemembers to be serving \nproudly and honorably. They rarely look at you and talk about the \nsacrifices they are being asked to make or of the effects that failed \npolicies are having on them and on their families. But you can still \nsee in their eyes the evidence of the strain that the operational tempo \nis placing on them and on their families. You see the strain at \ninstallations all around the country.\n  In my State at Fort Carson where I have visited often over the last \nseveral years, the families of the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Infantry \nDivision learned earlier this year that their soldiers' tours of duty \nin Iraq are being extended by 3 months, so that they will stay in the \ntheater for a total of 15 months rather than the 12 months they \nanticipated when they went to Iraq. The 2nd Brigade is currently today \nin a block-by-block battle with insurgents in eastern Baghdad. The 2nd \nBrigade lost 6 soldiers over the Fourth of July week, and they have \nlost 37 since they arrived in Iraq last October. The brigade was \nsupposed to be returning this fall. They were supposed to be returning \nthis fall, but now it will be winter before they might be able to come \nhome.\n  The 3rd Brigade, also at Fort Carson, returned from Iraq late last \nfall after a full year deployment. They could well be sent back to Iraq \nbefore they have the time they need here to recuperate, to train, and \nto prepare for a new deployment. They deserve some consistency and \ncertainty in their deployment cycle.\n  We see the impacts of the current operational tempo in our Guard and \nReserve units as well. We have come to rely on the Guard and Reserve to \nan unprecedented degree in Iraq. At one point in 2005, the Army \nNational Guard contributed nearly half of the combat brigades on the \nground in Iraq. These troops, once thought of as ``weekend warriors,'' \nhave been shouldering burdens similar to their Active-Duty counterparts \nand are facing the same extended deployments and the same shortened \ntime at home.\n  We are quickly learning about the impacts of this operational tempo \non the health and well-being of our troops. The impacts and the facts \nhere are beyond dispute. A study at Fort Carson showed that around 18 \npercent of returning soldiers had traumatic brain injuries. These are \nsoldiers who have come back to Fort Carson after having served in Iraq. \nThey need time to recover from those injuries. A recent service-wide \nreport of the DOD's Task Force on Mental Health showed that 38 percent \nof soldiers, 31 percent of marines, and 49 percent of the National \nGuard report psychological problems following combat deployments. The \nprevalence of psychological problems increases with increased frequency \nof deployment and with longer deployments. Our troops need more time at \nhome to recuperate and readjust with their families.\n  Amendment No. 2012 is a sensible and much needed rotation policy for \nour troops. I can think of no better author for this amendment than \nSenator Jim Webb who has had a long and storied history of service to \nour country and who has an intimate understanding of the military and \nknowing what it takes to have a strong military for the United States \nof America.\n  For our regular forces, the amendment requires that if a unit or a \nmember is deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, they will have equal time at \nhome before being redeployed. That is to say, if they are deployed for \n6 months, they must be at home for at least 6 months before being sent \nback into combat. For the National Guard and Reserve, no unit or member \ncould be redeployed to Iraq or Afghanistan within 3 years of their \nprevious deployment.\n  The amendment includes an important provision that I hope my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle pay attention to. It is an \nimportant provision that allows the President to waive these \nlimitations. The President can waive these limitations if he certifies \nto Congress that the deployment is necessary in response to an \noperational emergency posing a vital threat to the national security of \nthe United States of America. So the President can waive the \nrequirements of this readiness legislation we are proposing in the \nChamber today. Another waiver would authorize the Chief of Staff of \neach branch to approve requests by volunteers to deploy.\n\n  This is an amendment which supports our troops and their families who \nhave been called upon to make ever-increasing sacrifices in the course \nof this war. It is an amendment which I ask my colleagues to support \nand which I hope we will pass on behalf of our troops and their \nfamilies.\n  I wish to conclude by simply stating my appreciation to the leaders \nwho have put together the DOD authorization legislation which is before \nthe Senate. The Senator from Michigan, the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Carl Levin, is often referred to by me and I know \nmany of the Members of this Chamber, as a Senator's Senator because he \nis one of those people who are here for absolutely the right reason--\ntheir devotion to this country. His standing up for our military is \nsomething which is a great example of a Senator who puts purpose above \nthe politics that sometimes typify Washington perhaps too much of the \ntime. He, in his work with the distinguished Senator from Virginia, Mr. \nWarner, who was also the key coauthor of this legislation, exemplifies \nthe best of what there is here in this Senate Chamber. I just wanted to \npublicly state my appreciation to Senator Levin and his staff and to \nSenator Warner and his staff for the great work they have done on this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me thank my dear friend, Senator \nSalazar, for his comments. They are particularly meaningful coming from \nsomebody who as much as anybody in this body strives to bring Members \ntogether in common causes. I want to tell him how grateful I am for his \ncomments but also, even more importantly, how grateful we all are for \nthe effort he makes to cross the aisle and bring Senators together on \nimportant issues of the day.\n  Last night, I was not able to be present when our bill came to the \nfloor. I was chairing a subcommittee meeting which I could not leave. I \nasked a number of colleagues on the Armed Services Committee if they \ncould fill in for me, and very graciously and, as always, very \ncompetently, Senators Ben Nelson and Bill Nelson fulfilled that role \nand responded to that request, and I am very grateful to them for \nhaving done so. I wasn't able then to present the bill, as a bill of \nthis magnitude should be presented, and I will take a few minutes at \nthis time to do that.\n  The Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008 would fully fund \nthe fiscal year 2008 budget request of $648.8 billion for national \nsecurity activities of the Department of Defense and the Department of \nEnergy.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee has a long tradition of setting \naside partisanship and working together in the interest of the national \ndefense. That tradition has been maintained this year. I am pleased \nthat our bill, S. 1547, was reported to the Senate on a unanimous 25-\nto-nothing vote of our committee. Additionally, S. 1606, the Dignified \nTreatment of Wounded Warriors Act, which we will be taking up either as \npart of this bill or as a freestanding measure, was also reported by \nthe committee on a unanimous 25-to-nothing vote. These votes stand as a \ntestament to the common commitment of all of our Members to supporting \nour men and women in uniform.\n  Our bill contains many important provisions that will improve the \nquality of life of our men and women in uniform, provide needed support \nand assistance to our troops on the battlefields of Iraq and \nAfghanistan, make the investments we need to meet the\n\n[[Page S8914]]\n\nchallenges of the 21st century, and require needed reforms in the \nmanagement of the Department of Defense.\n  The bill before us, perhaps most importantly, continues the increases \nin compensation and quality of life that our service men and women and \ntheir families deserve as they face the hardships imposed by continuing \nmilitary operations around the world. For example, the bill contains \nprovisions that would authorize a 3.5-percent across-the-board pay \nincrease for all uniformed military personnel, which is a half a \npercent more than the administration's request. Our bill authorizes \nincreases in the end-strength of the Army and the Marines--13,000 for \nthe Army and 9,000 for the Marines. Our bill authorizes payment of over \n25 types of bonuses and special pay aimed at encouraging the \nenlistment, reenlistment, and continued service by Active-Duty and \nReserve military personnel. Our bill authorizes payment of combat-\nrelated special compensation to servicemembers medically retired for a \ncombat-related disability. We reduce the cost of pharmaceuticals to \nDepartment of Defense personnel by authorizing the use of Federal \npricing for pharmaceuticals dispensed through the TRICARE retail \nprogram.\n  The bill also includes important funding and authorities needed to \nprovide our troops with the equipment and support they will continue to \nneed as long as they remain in Iraq and Afghanistan. For instance, the \nbill contains provisions which would add $4 billion above the amount \nrequested by the administration for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected \nVehicles, so-called MRAPs, which improve protection for our troops \nexposed to improvised explosive devices, or IEDs. Our bill fully funds \nthe budget request of $4.5 billion for the Joint Improvised Explosive \nDevice Defeat Office, while directing that office to invest at least \n$50 million in blast injury research and over $150 million for the \nprocurement of IED jammers for the Army.\n  We invest more than $70 million in research and new technologies to \nenhance the force protection of deployed units, including advanced \nmaterials for vehicle and body armor, active protection systems that \nshoot down incoming rocket-propelled grenades, and sniper detection \nsystems. And we add $2.7 billion for items needed by the Army but not \ncontained in the President's budget, including $775 million for \nreactive armor and other Stryker requirements, $207 million for \naviation survivability equipment, $102 million for combat training \ncenters, and funding for explosive ordnance disposal equipment, night-\nvision devices, and machine guns.\n  The bill would also enhance our national security by aggressively \naddressing the risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In \nthis regard, the bill would increase funding over the administration's \nrequest for Department of Energy nonproliferation programs by $87 \nmillion, increase funding for the Department of Defense Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Program, CTR, by $100 million, eliminate funding \nrestrictions that limit the use of CTR funds, and we expand the CTR \nProgram to countries outside of the former Soviet Union.\n  The bill contains a number of provisions that will help improve the \nmanagement of the Department of Defense and other Federal agencies. For \nexample, the bill contains provisions that would establish a Chief \nManagement Officer, finally, for the Department of Defense to provide \ncontinuous top-level attention to the high-risk management problems of \nthe Department as recommended by the Comptroller General. I note that \nour Presiding Officer is a member of the committee which takes a \nparticular interest in management issues, and the committee on which we \nboth serve, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, \nhas been interested in this subject for years, as long as probably both \nof us, the Presiding Officer and I, have been here together. We need a \nchief management officer for the Department of Defense and we would \nestablish that office.\n\n  We would establish an acquisition workforce development fund to \nenable the Department of Defense to increase the size and quality of \nits acquisition workforce as needed to address systematic deficiencies \nin the Department's purchases of products and services.\n  We would tighten the rules for Department of Defense acquisition of \nmajor weapons systems and subsystems, components, and spare parts to \nreduce the risk of contract overpricing, cost overruns, and failure to \nmeet contract schedules and performance requirements.\n  Our bill also contains a provision that would require increased \ncompetition in large so-called ``umbrella contracts'' awarded by the \nDepartment of Defense. The Armed Services Committee held a hearing in \nApril on the Department of Defense's management of the $20 billion \nLOGCAP contract, under which KBR--until recently a subsidiary of \nHalliburton--has provided services to U.S. troops in the field. There \nis a history of highly favorable treatment of that contractor \nthroughout this contract. For example, the company was given work that \nappears to have far exceeded the scope of the contract. All of this \nadded work was provided to the contractor without competition. There \nwere almost $2 billion of overcharges on the contract, and the \ncontractor received highly favorable settlements on these overcharges.\n  When asked why the Army had waited 5 years to split the LOGCAP \ncontract among multiple contractors so as to allow for the competition \nof individual task orders, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for \nAcquisition, Technology and Logistics responded:\n\n       I don't have a good answer for you.\n\n  The provision in our bill would avoid these kinds of abuses we get in \nsole-source contracts by ensuring that future contracts of this type \nprovide for the competition of task and delivery orders unless there is \na compelling reason not to do so.\n  There are far too many provisions in the bill to describe all of \nthem, but there are a few more I wish to put some focus on.\n  Section 1023 of the bill would protect our troops, uphold our values, \nand help restore our image around the world by providing a fair process \nfor reviewing the status of the Department of Defense detainees at \nGuantanamo and elsewhere. This provision would require for the first \ntime that long-held detainees receive legal representation, provide for \nlegal rulings to be made by military judges, and prohibit the use of \ncoerced statements.\n  Section 871 of the bill would require the Department of Defense to \nprovide much-needed regulation for contractors operating on the \nbattlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan. Over the past 4 years, contractor \nemployees have frequently fired weapons at people and property in \nIraq--including insurgents, civilians and, on occasion, even our own \ncoalition forces. Yet we have no consistent system in place for \nregulating the conduct of these armed contractors, or for enforcing \ncompliance with those regulations that do exist, that are supposed to \ngovern the activities of our contractors we hire. The provision in our \nbill would ensure that commanders on the battlefield have the authority \nthey have long needed to establish rules of engagement--as well as \nsystems for reporting and investigating incidents involving the use of \nforce--for armed contractors of ours in an area of combat operations.\n  Finally, shortfalls in the care and treatment of our wounded warriors \ncame to the attention of the Nation in a series in the Washington Post \nlast February. These articles described deplorable living conditions \nfor some servicemembers in an outpatient status. They described a \nbungled, bureaucratic process for assigning disability ratings that \ndetermine whether a servicemember would be medically retired with \nhealth and other benefits for himself and for his family. A clumsy \nhandoff was described and exists between the Department of Defense and \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs when a military member transitions \nfrom one department to another. The Nation's shock and dismay reflected \nthe American people's support, respect, and gratitude for the men and \nwomen who put on our Nation's uniform. They deserve the best, not \nshoddy medical care and bureaucratic snafus.\n  I am very proud our Armed Services Committee approved S. 1606, the \nDignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors, by a unanimous 20-to-0 vote on \nJune 14. This bill, which we worked on so closely with the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, would address the issues of inconsistent application \nof disability\n\n[[Page S8915]]\n\nstandards, disparate disability ratings, substandard facilities, lack \nof seamless transition from the Department of Defense to the Veterans' \nAdministration, inadequacy of severance pay, care, and treatment for \ntraumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. It addresses \nalso medical care for caregivers not eligible for TRICARE, and the \nsharing of medical records between the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n\n  In consultation with the leadership and with the Committee on \nVeterans Affairs, since there is unlikely to be available floor time to \nbring this critically needed bill to the floor as freestanding \nlegislation, it will be offered instead as an amendment to the bill we \nhave on the floor now. I will be offering this on behalf of a very \nlarge bipartisan group of Senators coming from not only both the Armed \nServices Committee and Veterans' Affairs Committee but from all \nSenators, just about, who will be offering this amendment. We owe it to \nour men and women in uniform to take up and pass this important \nlegislation.\n  As of today, roughly 160,000 U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines are engaged in combat and combat support operations in Iraq. \nAlmost 20,000 are engaged in combat and combat support operations in \nAfghanistan, and tens of thousands more are supporting the war effort \nthrough deployments thousands of miles from home.\n  While many of us believe the time has come to start bringing these \ntroops home, we all know we must provide our troops the support they \nneed as long as they remain in harm's way. We in the Nation are divided \non the administration's war policy, but we are united in our \ndetermination to support our troops. Senate action on the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 will improve the quality \nof life of our men and women in uniform. It will give them the tools \nthey need to remain the most effective fighting force in the world. \nMost important of all, it will send an important message that we, as a \nNation, stand behind them and we appreciate their service.\n  Finally, as I did earlier this morning, I note that this bill--a \nbipartisan bill--would not have been possible without the support and \nleadership of Senator McCain, my ranking member, and each member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. We owe a special debt of gratitude to \nthose who served as subcommittee chairs and ranking members of the \nArmed Services Committee. This bill takes a long time to put together \nand then to mark up. It takes many months to perform those functions \nand many days in the markup process itself.\n  I also give a special thank-you to our former chairman, Senator \nWarner, who again did yeoman service to make it possible for this bill \nto come to the floor in a bipartisan manner, which it has. I look \nforward to working with colleagues to pass this important legislation. \nI hope we can proceed to the prompt consideration of it, and I hope \nthat as soon as we address the amendment of Senator Webb, we are going \nto be able to move on to other amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I feel fortunate that Senator Levin was \nunable to be here yesterday to present the bill from the committee he \nchairs. As the Presiding Officer a few minutes ago, and now listening \nfor 5 minutes or so, I have become better acquainted with some of the \ndetails of a very large and complex piece of legislation. I want to \nstart off by saying a special thanks to him and his staff, to Senator \nMcCain and Senator Warner and their staffs, and other members of the \ncommittee. They have crafted a very difficult bill.\n  As one who likes to work across the aisle, I applaud them for the way \nthey have done that, bringing near unanimity from your committee in \nsupport of this legislation. I especially salute the Senator from \nMichigan and his team for the work they have done in providing for a \nchief management officer within the Department of Defense--God knows we \nneed that--along with many other aspects of the bill.\n  I want to take a moment to talk about the amendment Senator Webb is \noffering and has laid down. I know there are folks who have concerns \nwithin the Senate and outside of the Senate about this legislation. I \nwant to speak in support of his proposal. You may recall he is calling \nfor us to try to ensure that there is some downtime for active-duty \npersonnel serving in Iraq and Afghanistan--that once they have served \nin those theaters, they be able to come home, train, rest up, \nreacquaint with their families, and to prepare to go back, if \nnecessary. He is saying if you are on active duty for 6 months abroad, \nthen they could come home for 6 months. If it is 12 months, there would \nbe a 12-month respite. They would be training and working on readiness \nand trying to reunite themselves with their families. There is plenty \nto do during the time they are not deployed.\n  Also, he would say if they happen to be reservists or National Guard, \nthey should have the opportunity for every year spent abroad to have 3 \nyears downtime. The obvious question that came to mind for me is: What \nif we get into a jam somewhere in another part of the world and we need \nsomebody who has been promised that 6 months back home, or 2, 3 years \nback home, and we need them to come back and serve on active duty? What \nif a member of the Guard or Reserves or active duty wanted to serve \nsooner again in Afghanistan or Iraq, would they be able to? Those are \ngood questions. It was discussed over lunch with Senator Webb. I was \npleased with his response. Regarding the question about the guardsmen, \nreservists, and active-duty personnel who want to come back and serve \nin the theaters again prior to the end of their period of respite, \ntheir time at home, they could go back if they express that they want \nto serve. That request will be honored.\n  Secondly, if we get into a jam as a country in another part of the \nworld and we need a unit to go there, whether you are Army, Navy, Air \nForce, or Marine, there is a Presidential waiver included in the Webb \namendment that says the President can waive the language in the bill, \nin the amendment, and direct those forces to serve back in the theater \nwhere they are needed. I think those are positive and important aspects \nof the Webb amendment. We ought to keep them in mind.\n  Prior to coming to serve in the Senate, I was privileged to be \nGovernor of my State for 8 years. As Governor of Delaware--or of any \nState, whether it is Pennsylvania, Michigan, or Delaware--you serve as \ncommander in chief of your National Guard.\n  We had Army Guard and Air Guard who served, and I was honored to be, \nfor those 8 years, their commander in chief. I felt a great affection, \na great affinity for them, an allegiance to them and to their families.\n  When I was in Iraq 3 or 4 weeks ago, I had the opportunity to meet \nwith members of our 198th Signal Battalion of the Delaware National \nGuard. On the morning I came back from having been in Iraq, I flew into \nDulles and hotfooted it up to a place called Delaware City in time to \nsend off the 153rd unit of the Delaware National Guard, a military \npolice unit, who were going to Fort Dix and then on to Iraq. It is a \nunit we actually created when I was Governor, and I feel a special spot \nfor them in my heart. I wanted to be there when they were sent abroad, \nsent to Fort Dix and then on to Iraq.\n  Having talked with a number of them, having been with them and their \nfamilies literally weeks ago as they prepared to depart, I have a \nspecial sense from being overseas in Baghdad with folks from the 198th \nSignal Battalion for what their concerns are with respect to an \nextended deployment.\n  These are people who did not sign up for one, two, three deployments \nin the war zone. Before I served in the House of Representatives, I was \na naval flight officer. I served during the Vietnam war. I wasn't a \nhero such as Jim Webb, and I wasn't a hero such as John McCain and some \nothers with whom we serve--Danny Inouye. My job in the Vietnam war in \nP-3 airplanes was to hunt for Red October, track Soviet nuclear \nsubmarines. We flew missions off the coast of Vietnam as well.\n  Interestingly enough, we had other Reserve squadrons come out and fly \nmissions with us during the Vietnam war. Almost without exception, we \nnever gave them difficult jobs to do. Almost without exception, they \nwere not given challenging jobs to do because we didn't want them to \nmess it\n\n[[Page S8916]]\n\nup. We would basically take the harder jobs for ourselves. We were not \nconfident in their ability to take on the tougher missions with which \nwe were burdened, were subscribed to carry out.\n  That has changed today. Go over to Iraq or Afghanistan where some of \nus have been recently. Our Guard and Reserve units are doing the \ntoughest work, the most dangerous work, the most demanding work of any \nActive-Duty Force. They are in harm's way. They are getting shot at, in \nsome cases getting wounded, in other cases dying. They leave behind, \nparticularly those on active duty, Active-Duty Guard and Reserve, not \njust families in many cases--spouses, children, in some cases dependent \nparents--in many cases they have businesses they own and run \nthemselves. It is one thing to be away from an employer who would like \nto have you there, who needs you there and to be away for a month, 2, \nor 3 months on active duty. But try leaving your business that you may \nhave started, built, and it depends on you being there, and go away for \n15 months, come back for a little while to the States to try to get it \nstarted again and have to go away again for 15 months.\n  After 5 years active duty, I served another 18 years as a Reserve \nnaval flight officer. I stayed current on my airplane. I flew with a \nsquadron out of the naval air station at Willow Grove. If members of my \nunit--and they were great guys, they were all guys, and they loved the \nNavy, they loved the service, they loved our mission--if you had taken \nmost of us and said: We are putting you on active duty for 15 months, \nlet you come home a little while and put you back for another 15 months \non the other side of the world, I am not sure how many would sign up \nagain, reup, renew our commitment. I guess a lot of people said: No, \nthank you; been there, done that. I served my Nation on active duty and \nin the Reserve, and we wouldn't have taken on that obligation, at least \nnot with great enthusiasm. Some would have; I suspect others would not.\n  What Senator Webb is trying to do is to say: Look, if you have gone \nover there, if you are on active duty, if you serve in the Army, Navy, \nAir Force, Marines in the theater for 6 months, we are going to make \nsure you have a chance to catch your breath, to come back, hopefully, \nwith your unit to retrain here, have downtime to reconnect with your \nfamily, to begin to put your personal life together a little bit before \nwe put you back over there in harm's way. To the extent you happen to \nbe a reservist or a member of the National Guard and you have other \ncommitments, you are not on active duty, have your own job, business, \nfamily with children, we are going to give you a chance to make sure \nyou can get that business going again, stand it up, strengthen it, \nreacquaint yourself with your family, make sure your kids and spouse \nare doing all right, maybe your parents, before we put you back in \nharm's way again.\n  I think that makes a whole lot of sense. It is humane, in terms of \nactually being able to keep people on active duty, Reserve status, and \nGuard status. I think it will increase our ability to recruit and \nretain people, when their term of enlistment expires, to reup. It will \nincrease the likelihood they will stick with us.\n  The other point I wish to make, for those who are not aware of the \nwaiver authority that is granted in this amendment, we say to a \nPresident: You can waive these requirements for Active-Duty personnel \nor for Guard personnel. You can waive them. If we find ourselves in a \nbind in another part of the world and we need those forces, those \nassets to be on active duty again, the President can waive those \nrequirements.\n  Also, if I or any of us happen to be on active duty or in the \nReserves and we have done our time and have a chance to come back and \nwe want to go back, we feel an obligation to go back--and God bless \nthem, some of our troops today are serving second and third tours over \nthere--they would have the opportunity to do that, not be barred from \ndoing that. If they chose to take that course, they could.\n  For those reasons and for others I mentioned today, I believe Senator \nWebb's amendment should be supported. It deserves to be enacted. It is \none of those deals where the more I learned about it, the more \ncomfortable I have become with it. As a number of my colleagues who \nactually served active duty, served in the Reserves and had the \nprivilege of leading a State's National Guard, this is one I thought \nabout. This wasn't a knee-jerk reaction, yep, this is the way to do it. \nI thought it through and put on my hats of earlier roles I played \noutside the Senate, outside the Congress.\n  I think the Webb amendment is the right way to go. My hope is, when \nthe votes are cast, it will be adopted and added to this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I first express my thanks to the Senator \nfrom Delaware for his service and also for his comments on this \namendment.\n  I come to the floor because I heard the other side of the aisle may \nbe deciding to filibuster this amendment. I wish to, first of all, \nexpress my surprise that this filibuster might occur which, as the \nChair knows, would increase the requirement of 60 votes in order for \nthe amendment to proceed.\n  This is a very simple and very fair amendment. I would like to \nexpress my opinions about some of the comments that have been made, as \nI was outside listening to different people from the media telling me \nwhat some of the reservations from the other side have been on this \namendment. The comments that have been made are not accurate.\n  There are people who are saying this amendment is unconstitutional in \nthe sense that only the Commander in Chief should be able to make \ndecisions regarding the deployment of troops during a war.\n  First of all, article I, section 8 of our Constitution is very clear \non this point. It states that ``The Congress shall have the Power . . . \nTo make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval \nForces. . . .''\n  This is well within the Constitution. In fact, there is much \nprecedent when people who are opposed to this amendment discuss that it \nmight be tying the President's hands unnecessarily. We can go back to \nthe dark days of the Korean war, where because of the national \nemergency that was caused from the invasion of South Korea by the \nNorth, we didn't have enough troops available, and the administration \nat the time started sending soldiers into Korea who had not been fully \ntrained and the Congress acted within its constitutional purview and \npassed a law that said no individual who is brought into the U.S. \nmilitary can be sent overseas unless they have been in the military for \n120 days.\n  The reason the Congress acted was to protect the well-being of those \nwho served, and that is exactly what we are proposing to do today. We \nare saying that whatever your beliefs are about this war, whether you \nwant it to end in 5 weeks or whether you want it to go on for the next \n10 years, we have to come to some common agreement among the leadership \nof the United States that we are going to protect the well-being of our \ntroops, the people who step forward to serve in these times.\n  The minimum we can do is to set a floor that basically says: However \nlong you are deployed, you can have that much time back at home. Or if \nyou are in the National Guard or Reserve, if you have been deployed, \nyou deserve to have three times that much time at home.\n  The historical standard is if you have been deployed overseas or if \nyou have been deployed on a deployment, you should have twice as much \ntime at home. The Commandant of the Marine Corps earlier this year, \nwhen he undertook the duties of being Commandant, said that his goal \nwas to bring in a 2-to-1 rotational cycle for the Marine Corps. Given \nthe requirements of Iraq, 2 to 1. We are now at 1 to 1, with a good \nportion of that time back home being spent in workups for these units \nand for these individuals to go back.\n  The Army, as a result of this surge, now has a policy where they are \nsaying you go to Iraq for 15 months, and we will guarantee you 12 \nmonths at home. That is not even 1 to 1.\n  Our amendment establishes a floor. It is reasonable. It doesn't have \nanything to do with political objectives of the war downstream. That \ncan be sorted out later. We are simply saying, if you have been gone \nfor a year, you deserve to be back for a year. If you have been gone \nfor 7 months, you deserve to\n\n[[Page S8917]]\n\nbe back for 7 months, unless you want to go back. If you want to go \nback, fine. You can volunteer to go back. Our amendment does not stop \nthat. Or if there is an operational emergency where the President \ncertifies there is a requirement, then the President can waive this \namendment. We are trying to set a policy of stability so military \nfamilies can predict what their cycle is going to be and have enough \ntime to truly become involved with their families again, have some \ndowntime, then refurbish, retrain, and go back.\n  I suggest to the other side that if they believe this is an amendment \nthat is incompatible with military service, they might want to consider \na letter I received today from the Military Officers Association of \nAmerica. This is the largest and most influential association of \nmilitary officers in the country. It is composed of 360,000 members \nfrom every branch of the military. They wrote me today. I will read \nportions of this letter:\n\n       On behalf of the 368,000 members of the Military Officers \n     Association, I am writing to express our support for your \n     amendment. The MOAA is very concerned that steps must be \n     taken to protect our most precious military asset--the all-\n     volunteer force--from having to bear such a disproportionate \n     share of national wartime sacrifice. If we are not better \n     stewards of our troops--\n\n  This is the president of the MOAA, VADM Norbert Ryan, U.S. Navy \nretired, saying this--\n\n       If we are not better stewards of our troops and their \n     families in the future than we have been in the recent past, \n     we believe strongly that we will be putting the all-volunteer \n     force at unacceptable risk.\n\n  I submit to the President and this body, this is not the kind of \nstatement that would be made from a group of 368,000 military officers \nunless they believed in the constitutionality and the propriety of what \nwe are attempting to do.\n  I say to my colleagues, and particularly to my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, I am very disappointed in the notion that an \namendment with this simplicity that goes to the well-being of our \ntroops might even be considered as a filibuster. I say to my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle that the American people are watching us \ntoday, and they are watching closely, with the expectation that we \nfinally can take some sort of positive action that might stabilize the \noperational environment in which our troops are being sent again and \nagain. The American people are tired of the posturing that is giving \nthe Congress such a bad reputation. They are tired of the procedural \nstrategies designed to protect politicians' accountability and to \nprotect this administration from judgment. They are looking for \nconcrete action that will protect the well-being of our men and women \nin uniform.\n\n  The question on this amendment is not whether one supports the war or \nwhether they do not. It is not whether someone wants to wait until mid-\nJuly or September to see where one particular set of benchmarks or \nsummary might be taking us. The situation is simply this: More than 4 \nyears into the ground operation in Iraq, we owe stability and a \nreasonable cycle of deployment to the men and women who are carrying \nour Nation's burdens. That is the question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Virginia yield for a question?\n  Mr. WEBB. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to commend the Senator from \nVirginia first for offering this amendment. For those who are new to \nthis debate, it is the first amendment on the Defense authorization \nbill, and it is about our troops' readiness to go to battle. There is \nno better author of this amendment than the Senator from Virginia, as \none of only two combat veterans who is here, proud combat veterans, \nserving in the Senate.\n  I would like to ask the Senator, if I understand his amendment \ncorrectly, it says that if we are going to deploy American soldiers \ninto fields of battle, in Iraq and Afghanistan or NATO missions, that \nthey not be deployed any longer than they are given an equal amount of \ntime for rest or dwell time, as they call it, for training and \npreparation for returning to battle. So if a soldier is being sent to \nIraq for 15 months, then he or she should have at least 15 months back \nhome at the end of that period--or reassigned to a peaceful setting--\nbefore they can be deployed again, for Active-Duty soldiers. Is that \nthe gist or substance when it comes to active duty?\n  Mr. WEBB. First, I would say to the Senator from Illinois just for \nfactual clarification that Senator Hagel and I are the only two ground-\ncombat veterans from Vietnam in the Senate, but I certainly do not want \nto in any way reduce my respect for the distinguished Senator from \nHawaii who won the Congressional Medal of Honor during World War II.\n  The question the Senator poses is correct. What this basically says \nis that if you have been gone for a year, you deserve to have a minimum \nof a year back. And a lot of people misunderstand what dwell time is. \nDwell time is not downtime. There is a workup cycle for these units \nbefore they go back, which is considerable. So even if we are giving \nthem a 1-to-1 ratio here, this is not equal time down as compared to an \nequal time deployed. That is why the traditional goal is 2 for 1.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask, if the Senator from Virginia will \nyield further, it is my understanding when it comes to Guard and \nReserve that he also has some protection for the amount of time they \nwill have after they have served. I have been told there is an implicit \nunderstanding, for example, with Guard members that they would serve 1 \nyear, for example, and have 5 years before redeployment. In fact, that \nhas not been the case in my home State of Illinois, where over 80 \npercent of the Illinois Guard units have been deployed into combat \nduring the course of this war, and many have been deployed repeatedly. \nSo, obviously, the promise that was supposed to be kept hasn't been \nkept, and I ask the Senator from Virginia, how do you protect Guard and \nReserve when it comes to redeployment in terms of the time they have?\n  Mr. WEBB. I would say first to the Senator that I had the privilege \nof being the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs for 3 \nyears, where we had oversight of the National Guard and Reserve \nprograms during a very critical time when we were transitioning into \nwhat we called the total force concept, and the President's use of the \nGuard and Reserve is certainly something we were not contemplating in \nthe 1980s.\n  But this amendment sets a floor for the Guard and Reserve of a 3-to-1 \nratio with a goal--a written goal--in the amendment of a 5-to-1 ratio, \nwhich is the traditional standard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Virginia has not covered it in his \nfloor remarks earlier, what has been the impact of these frequent \nredeployments on Active Guard and Reserve with regard to retention and \nrecruitment? In other words, if my Guard unit in Illinois knows they \nare going to be deployed and redeployed within a year or two, it seems \nto me that for some citizen soldiers it would create a hardship which \nthey couldn't impose on their families for a period of time.\n  Can the Senator from Virginia point to any specific information he \nhas about retention and recruitment relating to this redeployment?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, may I ask my friend to yield? Senator \nMcConnell and I need to transact some business.\n  I would ask that the record reflect that we stopped the Senator from \nVirginia but that he maintain the floor and that the record appear as \nhis having not been interrupted. Will that be okay with the Senator \nfrom Virginia?\n  Mr. WEBB. By all means.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last night, the Republican leader indicated \nthat he would have an alternative amendment to Senator Webb's amendment \nand that we would work out an agreement so we would not need cloture, \nand I appreciate that very much. But a problem has developed. We do \nhave a side by side from Senator Graham, but what I didn't understand \nis that there would be a requirement of 60 votes on Senator Webb's \namendment and Senator Graham's amendment. I just don't think it is \nappropriate that there be a filibuster on this amendment, and that is \nwhat it is.\n  I would be happy to enter into an agreement that would provide for a \nmajority vote on both the Graham and Webb amendments. So I now ask \nunanimous consent that amendment No. 2013\n\n[[Page S8918]]\n\nbe withdrawn; that there now be 4 hours equally divided to run \nconcurrently on Senator Webb's amendment and Senator Graham's \namendment, as provided to us this morning--we have that amendment, we \nhave looked at it, we understand it--and that at the conclusion or \nyielding back of time, the Senate vote on Senator Webb's amendment, no. \n2012, followed by a vote on Senator Graham's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, we have \nbeen here before. Every Iraq amendment we have voted on this year--and \nthere have been numerous amendments--in fact, I have sort of lost track \nof how many we have had--every single one of them, as most things in \nthe Senate that are remotely controversial, requires 60 votes. I \nbelieve I am correct in saying that every Iraq amendment we have voted \non this year, no matter what the underlying bill was to which the \namendment was being offered, was in a 60-vote contest.\n  What we have frequently done is simply negotiated an agreement to \nhave the 60 votes we know we are going to have anyway, and the reason \nfor that is--well, there are several reasons. No. 1, if a cloture vote \nwere invoked, it would further delay consideration of the bill because \npotentially 30 more hours could be used postcloture on an amendment. So \nwhat we have done, in a rational response to the nature of the Senate \nin this era, is to negotiate 60-vote votes.\n  We are perfectly happy to enter into an agreement, as I suggested \nyesterday, for a vote on the Webb amendment and the alternative that we \nwould have, the Graham amendment, by consent, two 60-vote requirements. \nThat is not unusual in the Senate; it is just common practice in the \nSenate, certainly for as long as I have been here. So, therefore, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I guess rationality is in the eye of the beholder. The real \nfacts here are that, on Iraq, for example, the bill the President \nvetoed was not filibustered. We sent a measure to the President that he \nvetoed that had 51 or 52 votes. It was in the majority. That is what we \nshould do here.\n  It appears to me we are arriving at a point where, even on the \nDefense authorization bill, amendments leading up to a final vote on \nthe Defense authorization bill, which is so important, are going to be \nfilibustered. It is really wrong. It is too bad. We don't have to have \nthis 60-vote margin on everything we do. That is some recent rule that \nhas just come up in the minds of the minority.\n  Mr. President, we should move forward on this Webb amendment, move \nforward on the Graham amendment. We have confidence that a majority of \nthe Senate supports Senator Webb. I don't know about Senator Graham's \namendment. But why don't we let the body work its will and then move on \nto other things. We have the amendment we are waiting to offer very \nquickly, which is the one that has been worked on for a long time, \nwhich is the Levin-Reed amendment.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On Page S8918, July 10, 2007 the following appears: which is the \nLevin-Reid amendment.\n  \n  The online version has been corrected to: which is the Levin-\nReed amendment.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  So, Mr. President, since there is an objection and based on the \nfilibuster of Senator Webb's troop readiness amendment, I send a \ncloture motion to the desk.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Webb, et \n     al., amendment No. 2012, to H.R. 1585, Department of Defense \n     Authorization, 2008.\n         Jim Webb, Richard Durbin, Daniel K. Akaka, Jack Reed, \n           Carl Levin, H.R. Clinton, Russell Feingold, Jeff \n           Bingaman, Christopher Dodd, Frank R. Lautenberg, John \n           Kerry, Patty Murray, Jon Tester, Sherrod Brown, Ken \n           Salazar, B.A. Mikulski, Joe Biden, Harry Reid.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory live quorum be \nwaived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senator McCain is here and will be \nseeking recognition momentarily, but let me suggest that this is not \nthe most efficient way to move forward with the bill. We have been down \nthis path before on virtually every measure that comes before the \nSenate. The most expeditious way to move forward is by agreement, not \nby the filing of cloture.\n  Having said that, I hope that once it is clear cloture is not going \nto be invoked, we can get back to the normal way we handle debate on \nthese matters and therefore have a better chance of processing this \nvery important bill and moving it toward passage.\n  I don't know if my friend from Arizona wanted to ask a question or \nwanted to get recognition.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to seek recognition, but I \nsee the assistant majority leader is up, and I will be glad to wait on \nhim.\n  Mr. REID. If I could, Mr. President, Mr. Webb has the floor. I asked \nhim to yield to me to do this, and that was the agreement.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would gladly yield the floor, but I don't \nknow to whom I am yielding. Where are we?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to first thank the Senator \nfrom Virginia for his leadership on this amendment, and I am troubled \nby what just occurred on the floor. What the Democratic majority leader \noffered was to allow the Webb amendment, an amendment from the \nDemocratic side--which, incidentally, has bipartisan sponsorship with \nSenator Hagel of Nebraska--that it be an up-or-down vote, a majority \nvote, on whether we will give our troops an opportunity to rest before \nthey are redeployed back into battle. I think the Senator from Virginia \nhas made a compelling argument that it is in the best interest of our \nmilitary--certainly our soldiers and their families--to give them this \nchance for rest and recuperation and retraining before they are \nredeployed.\n  The fact is, we know many of these soldiers are being deployed and \nredeployed repeatedly at great personal hardship. We have reports that \ncome in that trouble us about family difficulties many of these \nsoldiers are going through because of these long periods of separation \nand the fact they are overseas so often.\n  Secondly, we know many of the soldiers who return after the stress of \nbattle need to sit down and talk to some people, go through some \ncounseling to make sure they are dealing with post-traumatic stress \ndisorder and other issues which in previous wars had never been \nmentioned and we know now to be very important.\n  So the Senator from Virginia is saying: For goodness' sakes, don't we \nowe it to our troops to give them a period of rest before we send them \nback into battle? So he wanted a vote on his amendment, a majority \nvote, up or down.\n  We said to the other side, the Republican side: Do you have an \napproach you would like to use on this same issue?\n  They said: Senator Graham of South Carolina has an amendment on the \nsame issue; we would like that to be offered.\n  So the Democratic majority leader said: Fine, we will treat both \namendments exactly the same way--have a limited debate, 4 hours, split \nup, and then we will vote on them, a majority vote, up or down.\n  But there was an objection, an objection because the Republican \nleader now says: For the amendments, even those dealing with the \nreadiness of our troops, we need an extraordinary majority, we want 60 \nvotes, even on an amendment about the readiness of soldiers where we \nhave offered both sides the same opportunity.\n  What it tells us is that when it comes to the issue of the war in \nIraq, I am afraid that the minority--the Republican leader--has made it \nclear that they are going to filibuster every amendment. They are going \nto do their best to slow down and stop this debate on the war in Iraq. \nInstead of coming to the issue in a straightforward and honest way, for \nan up-or-down vote, they prefer to drag this out, drag it out as long \nas they can, try to put off the inevitable. We can't put off the \ninevitable, and the inevitable is this: This is a costly, deadly war. \nAs our debate\n\n[[Page S8919]]\n\nwinds on day after day and week after week, American soldiers are still \nin the line of fire. Some of our best and bravest will be falling in \nbattle as we stand and debate. That really is not acceptable.\n\n  We owe it to our men and women in uniform to do our duty, and our \nduty is fair deliberation, open debate, and then an up-or-down vote, \nand move to the next issue. But according to the Republican side of the \naisle, that is not the way it will be. They want to filibuster this \ndebate on the war in Iraq--everything they can do to slow it down. That \nis unfortunate, and I will tell you something. If they were paying \nattention to the people back in their home States, the people have lost \ntheir patience with Congress caught up in this kind of procedural \nslowdown. They want us to act, and act decisively; make a decision one \nway or the other; decide whether an amendment is good or bad, but don't \ndrag it out in this kind of parliamentary maneuver over an amendment \nwhich on its face is easily understood, which I think is eminently \nreasonable, and where the other side, the Republican side, has ample \nopportunity to put their own idea up for a vote at the same time.\n  It could not be any more fair, and yet the Republican leader objects. \nI hope he will reconsider. Now we are going to move from this \namendment, the Webb amendment, and the Graham amendment, to substantive \nimportant amendments on timetables about bringing American soldiers \nhome--doing it in a reasonable way but to start redeploying our troops \nout of harm's way. It appears now the strategy on the other side of the \naisle is, in every respect, to try to slow this down, delay the \nultimate decision.\n  I think Senator Reid, the majority leader, has made it clear. We are \ngoing to stay here until our job is done. We are committed to making \nthis national debate on Iraq a meaningful debate, and no use of any \nprocedural tool or tactic is going to stop us from the ultimate \ndecision this Senate has to make. It should be done in an open, honest, \ncourteous, and civilized way. When we made that offer, I am afraid to \nsay the Republican leader objected. I hope we can return to the \nsubstance of this debate.\n  I would like to say that Senator Webb's amendment is not about the \npolitics of the Iraq war, and it is not about whether we should be \nthere or not be there. It is not about a Republican or Democratic view \nof the war. It simply is about taking care of our troops. We are going \nto spend a lot of hours in debate over the next several weeks debating \nthe war policy, but one thing we should not debate is the welfare and \nsafety of our troops.\n  I believe I can safely say every Senator in this body would agree \nthat no matter what else we do, our first duty is to ensure the welfare \nand safety of those who are fighting, sacrificing, and even dying in \nthis struggle. This is exactly what the Webb amendment does. Our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines have performed their duties \ngallantly over the past 4-plus years. They have not complained and \nreturned time and time again into battle. We owe them and their \nfamilies gratitude that no single Member of the Senate could properly \nexpress.\n  But as this war stretches on, it takes its toll. All of us have met \nwith Guard units being deployed, other units that are returning. We \nknow what they have been through, just vicariously, by talking with \ntheir families and hearing their stories. Many have returned for \nsecond, third, and fourth deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Our soldiers spend 12 months of time in theater, and now they are \ngoing to be spending 15 months, by the latest decision of the Pentagon. \nIs it unreasonable to allow them to spend at least that much time at \nhome before they again put themselves in harm's way? I don't think so. \nThese short turnaround times affect our men and women in uniform \nprofessionally and personally. After 15 months in battle we ask them to \nturn around and be ready to leave again in less than a year. That is \njust not enough time. Under normal conditions, the preparations and \ntraining for deployment can take up to a year. After 15 months in the \ndesert, there are going to be significant tasks our soldiers will have \nto accomplish to get themselves and their equipment back in fighting \ncondition. After so long away from home base, many individual and unit \nqualifications and training standards have lapsed. It will take time to \ncorrect it, but how can they possibly accomplish these tasks if as soon \nas they get home they have to begin preparing for the next deployment?\n  Without a doubt we have the finest military in the world, capable of \ndoing great things. But are we really being fair to them? Are we really \npreparing them for battle as we should, by squeezing so much into such \na short period of time? Are we shortchanging valuable training that \nwill help to keep them alive?\n  This effect is not limited to their professional performance because, \ncertainly, with this kind of burden at work over such a short amount of \ntime, you can be sure that 12 months at home is really not 12 months at \nhome. Our soldiers don't complain and always put mission accomplishment \nabove all else. So rather than spending time at home with the spouse \nand children, building the strong families necessary to sustain long \nseparations and deployment, they will spend longer and longer hours at \nwork training.\n  All we are asking with the Webb amendment is to remember the \nsacrifices of our soldiers and their families. Soldiers deploy. That is \nwhat they do. They know when they sign up. A soldier's family is \nstrong. They persevere and adapt to ever-changing schedules. But the \nstrain these families have been put under in the past few years and \nwill have to face in the future is too much. We are seeing divorce \nrates skyrocket, and rates of alcohol abuse have been increasing in the \nmilitary. Pressures of these long deployments and short stays at home \nare taking their toll, as they would in most every circumstance. It is \nnot fair to ask them to continue to make this kind of sacrifice.\n  There are many out there who say our Army is near the breaking point. \nI can't answer whether it is or not. But I certainly can speak for \nfamilies from Illinois and the families with whom I have spoken, and \nthey are courageous without a doubt, but they are being pushed to the \nlimit. We hear all the time about supporting our troops. What does it \nmean? Many people say the phrase but do not really know what it means. \nThis amendment is exactly what it means. Our military personnel and \ntheir families have borne almost the entire burden of the struggle our \nNation has undertaken since September 11, 2001. They have done it \nspectacularly.\n  One of the critiques I have heard that I think is fair is, after 9/11 \nour country was ready to move together. I can't recall a period of \ngreater national unity. Had the President made an appeal for shared \nsacrifice to fight this war on terrorism, I am certain he would have \nreceived resounding support from both sides of the aisle all across the \nNation.\n\n  But, sadly, that appeal was not made. He has asked for sacrifice from \nour military and their families, and they have certainly gone above and \nbeyond the call of duty. For the rest of us, life is all but normal \nevery single day. There is hardly any sacrifice because of this war on \nterror or war in Iraq or Afghanistan. Is it too much to ask in the Webb \namendment to at least acknowledge the sacrifices already being made by \nour soldiers before we push them back into the danger of battle?\n  There will be an amendment offered by Senator Graham. I read the \namendment. I have a great deal of respect for Senator Graham, but in \nall fairness there are two obvious omissions. First, there is no \nreference at all in his amendment to the National Guard. I think that \nis an important consideration, not just Active military and Reserve, \nbut the sacrifice being made by our National Guard. Second, taken in \nits entirety, the Graham amendment is just a sense of the Senate. It is \na little note that is being passed around. It has no impact of law, as \nthe Webb amendment would. A sense of the Senate is not enough. We owe \nour fighting men and women so much more.\n  Our soldiers have not asked us to do this, but Senator Webb, Senator \nHagel, and those who have been in battle, as Senator McCain has been, \nunderstand we need to stand up and speak for them even when duty keeps \nthem quiet, when they do not come forward to ask for this helping hand.\n\n[[Page S8920]]\n\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the Webb amendment. I hope the \nRepublican leadership will reconsider its position and allow these \namendments to be voted up or down and get on with this debate after a \nreasonable period so we can complete this important bill on the Senate \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I paid attention to the statement of the Senator from \nIllinois, as well as that of the Senator from Nevada. We may be \napproaching--not a historic moment in the history of the Senate but \ncertainly one worthy of note; that is, according to my staff, that is \nnot always accurate but is well meaning, we are about, maybe, at least \n26 years since we have not had a Defense authorization bill passed by \nthis body. Clearly from this beginning it appears, as on most other \nissues that have come before this body recently, we will be gridlocked.\n  Cloture motions will be filed. Votes will be taken. Time passes and, \nunfortunately, during that period of time, the men and women who are \nserving in our military will be without their pay increase. They will \nbe without the increase in numbers that are called for in this bill, \nfrom 512,000 in the Army to 525,000; from 180,000 in the Marines to \n189,000.\n  The best way, probably, to relieve the stress on the men and women in \nthe military and the overdeployment that, unfortunately, we all regret \nthey have had to bear, their unfair share of sacrifice in defense of \nthis Nation and its security, is to increase the size of the military. \nThat is in this bill.\n  Frankly, the reason we arrived at these numbers is it is just about \nas many as can be recruited additionally; otherwise, I think you would \nsee additional numbers.\n  Instead of the 3.5-percent pay increase, instead of increasing size \nin the Army and Marine Corps, which we all know is badly needed, some \nof us, including my friend from Michigan, have known for many years how \nbadly it was needed. One of the many mistakes made by the previous \nSecretary of Defense was not to call for a dramatic increase in the \nsize of our Marine Corps and Army, for which our military families have \npaid a very heavy price.\n  Here we are, gridlocked in a battle whether we are going to have 60 \nvotes and whether we are going to have to file a cloture motion which \nwill ripen after a couple of days and all the arcane things that very \nfew Americans understand. It took me a number of years to finally \ncomprehend some of the procedures around here.\n  So we are, again, going to probably maintain that historic low in \napproval that was recently, in a recent Gallop Poll that has been taken \nfor many years--I have forgotten the number now. I think it was in the \nteens as the approval rating of the Congress on the part of the \nAmerican people.\n  Anybody who just watched the proceedings that went on and the \nexchanges between the two leaders make that disapproval rating far more \nunderstandable. The average citizen watching these debates really \ndoesn't understand why we don't just go ahead and take care of the men \nand women in the military, to give them the arms and ammunition they \nneed, to give them the much needed equipment we have talked about on \nthis list--the $2.7 billion items on the Army Chief of Staff's unfunded \nrequirements list, things like the $4.1 billion for the MRAP, the Mine \nResistant Ambush Protected vehicles. We all know how bad the situation \nis, as far as IEDs are concerned.\n  What are we going to do? Are we going to sit down and say: Hey, you \nknow what. When the Democrats were in the minority around here they \ninsisted on 60 votes on just about every issue, particularly important \nones. We are now insisting on 60 votes, now that we are in the \nminority. Yet somewhere along the way the issue of c-o-m-i-t-y and the \nnational interest suffers and is abandoned by the wayside of politics.\n  The Senator from Michigan and I will sit here this afternoon and we \nwill have statements made by various Members as they come to the floor. \nThere are, if my past experience with this bill is accurate, probably \n100, maybe more, amendments that will be pending because there are so \nmany issues that are important to Members and important to the defense \nof this Nation. It is very likely, from this scenario I am seeing, that \nwe will for the first time in at least 26 years not pass a Defense \nauthorization bill--certainly not in a timely manner. We are already \ninto the month of July, and, obviously, we will not spend all 4 weeks \non this issue.\n  I think in days gone by--and we all have a tendency to remember the \ngood parts and not the bad parts--there was a tendency for the managers \nof the bill and the majority and whatever party was in the minority \nleaders would sit down and say: OK, we are going to narrow down the \namendments. We are going to have agreement for a certain number of \namendments and votes, and it would take us a while. I can remember \nsometimes it taking 2 weeks. That is why we usually bump it up against \na recess because one thing in the 20 years I have been here we have \nnever missed is a recess. Now we are going to sit here for this \nafternoon. It is Tuesday afternoon, and we are going to have various \nstatements. Members on both sides will display their dedication to the \nmen and women in the military. I appreciate that. I appreciate the \npatriotism of every single Member of this body. But are we really going \nto do anything for them? Are we really going to try to help them? Or \nare we going to be locked in combat on an issue that should not be on \nthis bill?\n  We probably have taken up the issue of the war in Iraq eight or nine \ntimes. I don't know exactly how many times. We have amendments, we have \ndebates, we have 60 votes, and then we move on to something else. \nMeanwhile, we have not done a single appropriations bill, I might add, \nand we are in the month of July.\n  Everybody knows, even though I don't happen to agree with it, that \nSeptember will be a seminal time on the Iraq issue.\n  General Petraeus will be coming back, and he will be issuing his \nreport, which, by the way, I can predict what it is going to be right \nnow; mixed, some success and some frustration. Then, guess what, in \nSeptember, we are going to go through another debate. We are going to \nhave amendments, and we are going to have 60 votes again.\n  Meanwhile, the American people are wondering what in the heck we are \nall about here, and why in the world, in all due respect to the deputy \nmajority leader, do we have to keep taking up the Iraq issue when we \nknow full well that in September there will be a major debate on this \nissue?\n  Meanwhile, the men and women in the military who are serving, to whom \nI see declaration after declaration of our dedication and devotion to \ntheir welfare and benefit, then what is going to equip them? What is \ngoing to train them? What is going to give them the pay raise? What is \ngoing to take care of them is somehow lost in the rhetoric of 60-vote \nrequirements, which again, most Americans do not understand nor should \nthey be required to, because they expect us to come here and act in \ntheir benefit. Certainly they should be asking us to act on an issue, \non a piece of legislation such as the Defense authorization bill which \nhas to do with the defense of this Nation.\n  Well, I could go on for a long time.\n  I do not want in any way my comments to be construed as a lack of \nrespect and appreciation for the chairman of the committee, and the \nmany years we have worked together, because I am convinced he and I \ncould sit down in a very short period of time and work out the number \nof amendments and schedule votes and time agreements. But we are not \ngoing to do that. We are not going to do that. But please do not come \nto the floor, I ask my colleagues, and talk about your dedication to \nthe men and women in the military and how difficult it is for them in \nthese times, when we have before us a bill to increase the size of the \nmilitary, we have before us a bill to give them a pay increase that \nthey deserve, and it probably is not going to be passed by this body, \nat least before we go out for the August recess. Then we get into \nSeptember. Then we will get into another fight on the issue of whether \nwe should withdraw troops in Iraq.\n  I don't think we should be very proud of ourselves. I don't. When the \nmen and women in the military whom we again, as I say, all profess our \ndevotion and dedication to, do not get the equipment they need \nauthorized, do not get the increases in pay, do not get the increases \nin numbers that we are trying to authorize, then do not be too \nsurprised with the cynicism of the American people and voters and, \nindeed, the men and\n\n[[Page S8921]]\n\nwomen who are serving, about the way we do business.\n  I hope the majority leader and the Republican leader can sit down and \nwork this thing out. Look, it is a fact the way the Senate works. It \nhappened when the other side was in the minority, that they required 60 \nvotes on issues of importance. I am sorry they did. I am sorry we did. \nI wish we could have simple up-or-down votes on all of these \namendments. But to claim that somehow we are filibustering, when that \nwas the standard procedure on the other side, I don't think is, \nfrankly, too forceful an argument.\n  As I say, my staff tells me it has been at least 26 years, probably \nmore, since we have not passed a Defense authorization bill. I hope we \nwill not break that record. I hope we can sit down together and work \nthis out. Again, recognizing these votes on Iraq are votes that will be \ntaken again in the month of September, they will be taken again in the \nmonth of September when the President comes, when General Petraeus \ncomes with his report, I would hope we could set the whole issue of \nIraq aside, go ahead with the authorization for equipping and training \nand protection and welfare and benefit of the men and women who are \nserving us in the military. Unfortunately, I think that is not going to \nhappen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while we disagree on a very critical issue, \nI as always look forward to working with Senator McCain to work out \nagreements so we can move this bill forward. I am confident we will \npass the authorization bill this year, the way we have every other \nyear, for the reasons Senator McCain gives, which are the critically \nimportant provisions in here for the men and women in our military and \ntheir families.\n  The difference is apparently as to whether this is an appropriate \nplace to debate Iraq policy. It is an authorization bill, which, it \nseems to me, is a very appropriate place to debate policy; in fact, I \nthink is the most appropriate place to debate a policy issue such as \nIraq.\n  I have not wished this to be debated on an appropriations bill, \nbecause I don't think we ought to try to have a policy debate and \ndecision when it involves the funding of our troops because I think \nhopefully all of us want to fund our troops. This is an issue as to \nwhether we should change course in Iraq. This is a debate which is a \nhealthy debate, it is an essential debate. I look forward actually to \nworking with Senator McCain to see if we cannot come up with time \nagreements on debates on Iraq--on these amendments on Iraq.\n  There is going to be more than one amendment. There are going to be a \nnumber of amendments and hopefully we can come up with time agreements \nso we can have these debates, have votes on the Iraq issue, and then \nmove on, and move forward and adopt an authorization bill with a lot of \nother amendments that are pending as well.\n  I am, as always, an optimist. I am particularly an optimist when I \nlook at Senator McCain, when I realize that we have worked together \nbefore, as I have with Senator Warner, on issues that look intractable \nbut which are not and can be worked out, and hopefully there can be \ntime agreements on these amendments relative to Iraq--which are \nimportant amendments.\n\n  I cannot think of anything that affects the well-being of our troops \nor our Nation, frankly, more at this moment than the question of policy \nin Iraq, as to whether that policy needs to be changed. There are \ndifferences as to whether we ought to change course in Iraq, and there \nare some who feel that apparently the policy is working. There are some \nof us who feel the status quo is not working, we need to change it.\n  It is not the debate we should have or can have at this moment. We \nare in the middle of a discussion on the Webb amendment. But it is \nappropriate that on this bill, the Senate act. If anything, it has been \ntoo long, as far as I am concerned, since the Senate has taken a \nposition on this. The last time we did it 4 months ago, the President \nvetoed it. We were unable to have our will expressed in a way that was \nnot vetoed.\n  Waiting until September is not an answer, because there is no reason \nto believe that an effort in September will not be filibustered. There \nis no reason why in September, the people who oppose the change in \ncourse, the Senators who oppose it, will not get up and say: Well, \nlet's wait until October when there is another report which is due. We \ncannot simply delay carrying out our responsibility. We cannot delay a \ndebate which is on the most critical subject on the minds of the people \nof America. Waiting for September, when a general is going to give us a \nrecommendation, and the President is going to give us a recommendation, \nis a delaying tactic on an issue which is the single most important \nissue on the minds of Americans today. There is no more appropriate \nplace to debate this issue than on the Defense authorization bill, \nbecause it is here where policy issues can and should be debated; a \nbetter place than on an appropriation bill where the message which \nwould be sent to our troops has more to do with whether we are going to \nfund the troops than whether we should continue a policy in Iraq which, \nso far at least, is not working.\n  So I am going to continue to be the optimist. I look forward to \nworking with Senator McCain. I think our leaders can continue to work \ntogether to try to work on time agreements for the Iraq amendments. I \nhope and expect we will adopt an authorization bill this year.\n  There is nothing unique about the Senate having healthy, vigorous \ndebate. That is not unique. Sometimes it looks as though we are not \ngoing to be able to get something done and, lo and behold, we are able \nto get something done because the American people want us--Senator \nMcCain is right--the American people want us to act. We are on the \nverge of acting on the single most important issue on the minds of the \nAmerican people. It was an issue which, more than any other, impacted \nthe last election. It was an issue where the Senate spoke in April, and \nwhere what we did was vetoed by the President. It is an issue where now \nwe must face an historic decision: Is the course in Iraq working or \ndoes it need to be changed? And, if it needs to be changed, what is our \nresponsibility in terms of bringing about that change?\n  Those are issues we cannot duck. Those are issues we should not \navoid. Those are issues which belong on our desks, and require the best \npossible judgment we can bring.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have been blessed in the Armed \nService Committee to have outstanding chairmen. I was pleased to serve \nunder Senator McCain and Senator Levin. A lot of hard work has gone \ninto the Defense authorization bills each year I have been here. It is \nremarkable how much we agree on in committee. We come out with very few \ndifferences, and those are reasonable differences that we sometimes can \nbridge and sometimes we have to vote on and let someone decide. Some of \nthe questions are pretty close questions, whether to fund that system \nor that program or not, and good people can disagree regardless of \ntheir political party.\n  I have been pleased to serve with Senator Bill Nelson on the \nStrategic Subcommittee. I chaired that when the Republicans were in the \nmajority. He chairs it now that the Democrats are in the majority. We \nhave very few differences. I respect his judgment. He is committed to \nserving his country.\n  We have produced a bill that I think, all in all, is a good piece of \nlegislation that will actually strengthen our Department of Defense, \nthe ability of our men and women in uniform to serve their country, and \ntake better care of them. So that is a good thing.\n  But now we get the bill on the floor, and I guess that group I have \nbeen referring to in recent weeks as ``masters of the universe''--\nsomebody up there, up high--decides that this is the time we are \nsupposed to have fights, and we are supposed to utilize this \nopportunity to push and push and push on various different areas.\n  Now, of course, it is legitimate to debate our commitment and \nstrategy in Iraq at this time. But I think what Senator McCain is \ntelling us is this, that this bill fundamentally is a bill to deal with \nand strengthen our military, that we just had debates in April and May \nand great detail about our Iraq policy, and we decided on that policy.\n\n[[Page S8922]]\n\n  We all know that we will expect a report from General Petraeus in \nSeptember. This is not the time to alter the policy we established \nabout 2 months ago. I agree with Senator McCain about that. We can talk \nabout it. We can do those things. But is it the right thing to \njeopardize this bill over other issues--over the issues relating to \nIraq?\n  Let me say a couple of things. The fundamental debate we are having \nhere with regard to our Iraq policy, when you boil it down to basics, \nis whether to reverse the policy we established in May.\n  That was a decision by an 80-to-14 vote to fund the surge in Iraq, \nafter having voted on it in April. We had another vote back in May, and \nwe funded this operation through the fiscal year, through September 30, \nif not longer--at least through September 30. And we affirmed and \nconfirmed General Petraeus as the commander of that surge by a 99-to-0 \nvote. He is a fabulous commander, and he received a bipartisan, \nunanimous vote in the Senate. That is what we decided, after great \ndebate.\n  Now, what I will say to my colleagues is this: A great nation has to \nconduct itself as such. We are not able to flip-flop around week after \nweek and change our minds every few weeks based on this or that event. \nIf a serious situation occurs, we can change our mind at any time. But \ngreat nations are more akin to great battleships. They do not dart \naround similar to a speedboat. They set their course and have to \njustify it carefully before they act. Once they act, they need to stay \nthat course, subject to any changes that occur.\n  So what I would say is this: I am worried we are doing what some \npolitical consultants would like to see Democratic leadership do and \ntalk about the war because they think that is politically beneficial. \nWe ought to be talking about those soldiers we have committed out \nthere, placed in harm's way, who are, this very day, walking the \nstreets of Baghdad and Al Anbar Province and Tikrit and Mosul, \nexecuting the policies we voted 80 to 14, in May, to send them to do. \nWe voted 99 to 0 to send General Petraeus.\n  At that time, we made clear to him we expected a report in September. \nI think that is what we are about here, and we ought to be about, that \nwe would go forward--and always subject to our constitutional \nresponsibilities to make any changes that are required--but go forward \nto allow the general to carry out the surge we told him to carry out.\n  This surge, let me say to my colleagues, has only reached its full \neffort--what?--2 weeks ago when the last brigade reached Iraq. So we \nonly reached full capacity of that surge a few weeks ago.\n  We know it is difficult now. They said: Well, the bombings are \noccurring outside Baghdad now. Why is that? Well, it is a given that it \nis tougher for them in Baghdad, so they have gone outside Baghdad to do \nbombings. What does that suggest? I would suggest that would lead us to \nconclude the work in Iraq, in Baghdad itself, has already made \nprogress. Indeed, if the capital city of Iraq, the biggest city, cannot \nmaintain order, it is difficult to see how we can have a political \nsettlement all of us wish to occur.\n  General Petraeus has taken the case to the enemy. He is moving \nforward aggressively and making military progress. The difficulty--and \nwe all know it--is that the Government of Iraq is not performing at the \nlevel it needs to perform. This is a matter we are not able to deny. I \nknow when I traveled to Iraq with Senator Levin--and when I was there \nmore recently with Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska--we raised the \nimportance with the Iraqi people and the Iraqi leaders of having a \nfunctioning government.\n  Senator Levin has strongly believed and consistently argued that one \nway to get them to perform is to threaten to pull out our troops. I \nhave come to believe their failure to perform cannot be altered by \nthreats to pull out troops. I wish it could be. I wish we could do it \nthat way. But it is more difficult than that.\n  So they are struggling, and I do not know whether they can pull this \nGovernment together. I certainly hope so. But I will tell you one \nthing. Progress is being made in a number of different areas \nmilitarily. This gives me some hope they can pull this Government \ntogether. That is where we are at this point. I do not see any other \nway to analyze it, honestly, to the American people. That is what I say \nto them as best I can.\n  I believe our military is performing magnificently. I believe the \nGovernment in Iraq continues to have serious problems in effectuating \nthe kind of stability and reconciliation they need to effectuate so we \ncan have a better capability of reducing the troop levels we have in \nIraq today.\n  Now, the way this deal went down--and we voted to send General \nPetraeus there. We talk about making reports back to us. I remember \ndistinctly in the Armed Services Committee, when he was up for \nconfirmation, I asked General Petraeus did he believe we could be \nsuccessful in Iraq. He said: Yes, sir, I do. General Petraeus had been \nthere when the initial invasion occurred. He commanded the 101st \nAirborne in Mosul. He came home for, I think, less than a year and went \nback to take over the training of the Iraqi military. He then came \nback, wrote the Department of Defense manual on how to defeat an \ninsurgency operation--the very project he executes--and the President \nhas asked him to go back to Iraq to execute a strategy to defeat the \ninsurgency that is going on in that country at this time.\n  So I asked him, would he tell the American people and the Congress \ntruthfully whatever the situation was when he was there? He previously \nsaid this was a difficult but not impossible task he was taking on. He \nsaid: Senator, you can count on it.\n  I asked Secretary Gates, the Secretary of Defense, at a hearing: \nSecretary Gates, will you tell the American people if this military \neffort in Iraq cannot succeed and we ought to do something else? He \nsaid: Yes, sir, Senator. I feel that is my responsibility as Secretary \nof Defense.\n  I will say to you, my colleagues, let's not flip-flop around here \nevery week with another amendment trying to set another strategy, \nwritten by a group of us sitting in air-conditioned offices, when we \nhave some of the best military minds this Nation has ever produced, \nwith great depth of experience--by the way, General Petraeus has his \nPh.D. from Princeton and was No. 1 in his class at the Command and \nGeneral Staff College. He is over there right now, and we have it set \nfor him to come back and go through a very deep and serious evaluation \nof what has happened, where we are, and where we need to go in the \nfuture.\n\n  So it is all right. I know we are going to have people talk about \nstrategy and alteration in our policy. But I think, in truth, it would \nbe more responsible for us to pass this Defense authorization bill, \nwhich will make the lives of our military men and women far better, \nwill make our Defense Department more effective, and will give us a \nbetter chance of being successful in Iraq. We need to pass this bill. \nWe will be coming back in September, no doubt, for a very serious \ndebate on how we go from here in Iraq. That is where we are, in my \nopinion.\n  I respectfully disagree with some who see it otherwise, who think \nthey have divine strategy--reading a few newspaper articles, I guess, \nand talking to a few folks and going to Iraq once or twice; I have been \nthere six times--and trying to come back and formulate a policy. I do \nnot think that is wise right now. I urge our colleagues not to go in \nthat direction.\n  I will take one brief moment to say I respect my colleague from \nVirginia, Senator Webb. I recognize the goals and the desires reflected \nin that amendment--his belief that soldiers ought to have guaranteed \ntime of deployments passed by statute by the Congress of the United \nStates. But I do not agree. I think this is a very significant \namendment. I believe it is an amendment that alters the traditional \npower of the President as Commander in Chief. I think it could put us \nin very difficult circumstances in the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to remember the amendment is not limited to \nIraq, it covers any military activities we get involved in, in the \nfuture, any war now or series of wars we may find ourselves in, in the \nfuture. War is very difficult, indeed.\n  I remember our former colleague, Senator Strom Thurmond, I think at \nage 40, volunteered to go in the Army.\n\n[[Page S8923]]\n\nHe had to make them take him. He was a sitting judge. He was not \nrequired to go. He was deployed to England. I do not know how long he \nhad been in at the time D-Day occurred. He volunteered to go in on a \nglider behind enemy lines in the nighttime at the time of the D-Day \nlanding to try to protect the soldiers on the beach from \ncounterattacks.\n  I remember asking Strom--former chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, I will note--I asked: Strom, well, how long did you stay in? \nDid you stay in until Germany surrendered? He said: Yes, sir, we stayed \nin until Germany surrendered--there to the day they surrendered. He \nsaid: In fact, after Germany surrendered, I was on a train heading \nacross the United States to the Pacific. They were going to send us to \nJapan when they dropped the bomb on Japan.\n  I wish to say, I do not know what General Eisenhower, General \nMarshall, General MacArthur would think about a policy that says, in a \ntime of war, Congress is going to decide how long people are deployed. \nI do not think it is good policy for a lot of reasons. I would express \nmy objection to the amendment. I know it is well intentioned.\n  I say this: The military understands it. The military is determined \nto reduce deployment times in Iraq. Secretary Gates has made that \nclear. But had he not been able to extend for 3 months those soldiers \nhe extended, it would have required as much as five new brigades to be \nsent over there. Some of them would not have had their full time at \nhome that he wanted them to have at home. He thought it was better to \ndo it that way than the other way. I believe, under the circumstances, \nthat was a correct decision. People could debate that, but I think he \nmade the right decision there. So it is better to do it that way. To \npass a law, sitting here in air-conditioned offices, that is going to \ndirect how the military deploys its troops in times of war is something \nI think we should not do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I also thank the members of the Armed \nServices Committee, the Senators from Michigan and Arizona, for all the \nwork they have done on this Defense authorization bill.\n  I hope the Members of the Senate would have an honest discussion and \ndebate and vote on these amendments and to uphold the 60-vote threshold \non something that is as important as this Defense authorization bill, \nthe many amendments that are going to come before us today, I think, \ntakes away from the process, quite honestly.\n  As far as the air-conditioning goes in this body, I have advocated \nsince I got here, if we shut the air-conditioning down, we would \nprobably be a little more concise and gotten to the point a long time \nago.\n  I rise today in support of an amendment offered by my friend, Senator \nWebb. As many colleagues here in this body know, Senator Webb is a \nhighly decorated marine and Vietnam veteran. I respect his judgment. I \ntrust his counsel enormously on these issues. I am proud to cosponsor \nhis amendment as one part of a strategy to strengthen our military and \nchange course in Iraq.\n  I also rise today to honor those who have served in Iraq, in honor of \nthose who have been hurt there, and in honor of those 3,600 who never \ncame home. Twenty brave men from my State paid the ultimate sacrifice \nin Iraq. They are our friends, our neighbors, our brothers, our \nsisters, our parents, and our children.\n  The war in Iraq has dominated this country's dialog and conscience \nfor 5 long years. It is now costing us more than $2.5 billion every \nweek; some say it is $3 billion. That is over $100,000 every minute of \nevery hour of every day in Iraq.\n  Like many of my colleagues in the Senate, one of the most difficult \nthings for me is the struggle in my heart. I balance two seemingly \ncontradictory ideas: I stand here today proud to support our men and \nwomen in service, and I also stand here today proud to say that I \nadamantly oppose this war. I lie awake trying to think of ways to give \nour troops the resources they need to do their jobs in Iraq but all the \nwhile trying to figure out ways to bring them home to their families, \nfriends, and communities.\n  Let me be clear about this: The men and women fighting this war have \nmy full and unconditional support as a Montanan, as an American, and as \na Senator. This country's service men and women have performed their \njobs with honor and distinction in the most difficult conditions \nimaginable. I have supported them since the beginning, and I will \ncontinue to support them in the field and, just as importantly, after \nthey come home--something our Nation has fallen behind on doing.\n  For more than 2 years, I have been asking the President of this great \ncountry to develop a plan to get us out of Iraq. I am disappointed to \nreport that I no longer believe President Bush will use any of his \nremaining 559 days in office to do so. Think of this. We were told in \n2003 that we were invading Iraq for the following 3 reasons: to find \nand destroy weapons of mass destruction, to topple Saddam Hussein's \nregime, and to give the Iraqi people a chance to establish their own \ngovernment. While certainly no weapons of mass destruction were found, \nany infrastructure that may have been in place to create such weapons \nof mass destruction has been destroyed. Saddam Hussein's government has \nbeen dissolved, and an evil dictator has been captured and put to \ndeath. The Iraqi people have voted on several occasions on their \nGovernment, their Constitution, and their future. I would say our work \nin Iraq is done. It is time for American troops to stop refereeing a \ncenturies old civil war and come home after a job well done.\n  The President has not come up with a plan to bring the troops home. \nInstead, he jeopardized their funding, their equipment, and their \ntraining by vetoing legislation that would have funded those vital \nneeds and begun the process of getting them home. The President uses \nour fighting men and women as pawns in this political game that is \ndividing our own people at home. That is totally unacceptable. \nPresident Bush's intention is clear--to leave our troops in the middle \nof this bloody civil war until he leaves office. That is why I am \nannouncing I can no longer give the President the benefit of the doubt \nthat he will end the Iraq war.\n  I am going to take a moment today to share with my colleagues \nthoughts on a possible three-point plan I hope will bring the Iraq war \ncloser to an end, make our troops safer around the world, and refocus \nour efforts on those terrorists who attacked this Nation on September \n11.\n  First, we must support the Webb amendment that protects the mental \nand physical health of our troops. We all know a neighbor or a friend \nwhose son or daughter has been deployed two, three, or even four times \nwith seemingly no rest at home. That is why I am cosponsoring this \namendment with Senator Webb. It deals with troop readiness. His \namendment basically says that if you are going to send a unit into war, \nmake sure they are well trained, well rested, and ready for the fight. \nIt is very simple. It is common sense.\n  More and longer deployments of units with less time to rest and \nrecuperate between means we are going to see more casualties in Iraq, \nmore cases of post-traumatic stress disorder, and more suicides after \nthey get home. According to the Army's own data, soldiers serving \nrepeated deployments are 50 percent more likely than those with only \none tour to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. Let's think \ntwice before we let the President send a unit to this war or any other \nof the world's hot spots without the proper training and time between \ndeployments. The strength and long-term health of our Armed Forces is \nat stake. This war has taken its toll on our readiness. If we don't \nstart now to rebuild and fortify our troops, we will not be able to \neffectively go after the bad guys who continue to threaten our national \nsecurity. We need to pass this Webb amendment, period. It is the right \nthing to do for our troops.\n\n  Second, we must redouble our efforts in Afghanistan. Afghanistan \nthreatens to slide back from the progress that was made there \nimmediately following the attacks of September 11. But the war in \nAfghanistan is rapidly and dangerously becoming a forgotten war, and \nour lack of effort there helps to explain the rise of al-Qaida in a \nnuclear and highly volatile Pakistan.\n\n[[Page S8924]]\n\n  The link between the 9/11 attacks and the current war in Iraq does \nnot exist, period. It never has. Reports confirm that our invasion of \nIraq has created more terrorists than it has eliminated. Yet the \nterrorist who plotted the most deadly attack on U.S. soil, Osama bin \nLaden, remains at large and ignored by this administration.\n  The recent news out of England and Scotland is a grim reminder that \nthe threat of world terrorism is still very real. While we pour our \nresources into policing violence in Iraq, extremists are busy plotting \nways to target us and our allies. It is that kind of terrorism, that \nkind of extremism we need to set our sights on. We need to do it with \nthe full might and vigilance of our military and other security forces, \nand we must do it while working to regain the trust of so many allies \nwho have become wary of us under the President's leadership. Unlike \nIraq, we must not ask the U.S. military to shoulder this entire burden \nin Afghanistan by themselves. The United States can and should be \nleaders in the war against terrorism, but we cannot go it alone. We \nhave an obligation to our troops and our families to regain the \ndiplomatic footing we have lost and involve our allies in this effort. \nWe have lost the focus on the war on terrorism and we must regain it.\n  Finally, I am proud to announce my support for the amendment authored \nby Senator Byrd deauthorizing the 2002 use-of-force resolution. The \nresolution Congress passed in 2002 is tragically outdated. The mission \nin Iraq is not the mission Congress authorized 5 years ago. The \nPresident needs to ask Congress and the American people for approval to \nprosecute what seems to be a very different mission in Iraq.\n  Proposed legislation to deauthorize the 2002 resolution would make a \nfew things crystal clear. Our current mission in Iraq is over on \nOctober 11, 2007. Let me repeat that. The war in Iraq is over on \nOctober 11 of this year. After that, the President would have to make a \nnew case for a new mission, one that more accurately reflects what the \nU.S. troops are now doing in Iraq. If he cannot make that case to \nCongress and the American people, then our troops need to come home.\n  Now, we understand al-Qaida is going to try to exploit the situation \nin Iraq for their own purposes, and there are measures we can take to \ndeal with that. We must not let Iraqi al-Qaida units get a foothold in \nthe country, especially in the western part of Iraq. So I would support \na no-fly zone in Iraq, which would ensure that the United States and \nour allies can keep reconnaissance eyes on efforts to restart terrorist \ntraining camps there. To fight the growing number of terrorist camps, \nwe will need warships in the area and aircraft that can reach those al-\nQaida targets. We must not hesitate to strike against al-Qaida. The \nsafety of this country and the world depends on that.\n  We need to continue to improve our ability to gather intelligence on \nthe ground in Iraq, but we do not need and I will not support U.S. \ntroops policing a civil war between the Sunnis and the Shiite militias. \nI will not support our military personnel guarding bridges and \ndisarming roadside bombs. It is in our national interest to fight al-\nQaida but not this civil war.\n  The mission in Iraq has changed, and the American people realize it. \nIt is time the President did as well. In February of this year, I said \nthe President must tell the American people what success means and how \nit should be quantified. If success means free elections in Iraq, then \nwe should have been gone 2 years ago. If success means toppling Saddam \nHussein, then we should have been gone 3 years ago. If it means \nsomething else, then the President must identify a clear and achievable \noutcome. At this point, that has not happened, and enough is enough.\n  For 2 years, as a Montana State Senator, a candidate for the U.S. \nSenate, a Senator-elect, and a U.S. Senator, I have given the Commander \nin Chief the benefit of the doubt that he would tell Congress and the \nAmerican people how to define success in Iraq and how he meant to \nachieve it. He has not done so. The President refuses to support our \ntroops by keeping them in the middle of a civil war with no end in \nsight. They fight every day in a war with no plan and no definition of \nsuccess, and, most importantly, they are dying every day in a war the \nAmerican people do not want to be fighting. We and our troops deserve \nbetter. They deserve the truth.\n  Since the President refuses to support the troops by developing a \nplan to bring them home, then we must and we should and we will. But \nabove all, we must stand by our soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen. \nWe support them wholeheartedly while they fight and support them for \nwhat they will endure after they get home from Iraq. It is on behalf of \nthose troops and those who fought before them that I am cosponsoring \nthe Webb amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the chance to talk about the \namendment before us and some of the other amendments. These amendments \ngenerally are intended to change our military policies, our presence in \nIraq, and essentially to begin, one way or the other, a politically \nstaged withdrawal from Iraq. We are talking about how we are concerned \nabout and support the troops. Do you know what I hear from the troops? \nI have been there, I have talked to them, and I have heard from them at \nhome. The one thing they say is: We are over here risking our lives. We \nare fighting a mission which we believe is succeeding. We are making \nprogress. The last thing we want is Congress to declare a military end \nor take over the management of the war from our commanders. Time after \ntime, they have told me: We have made too many contributions and \nsacrifices to walk away now and see all we have done go for naught. I \nwill talk about going for naught later on. But the point is that, yes, \nAmerica has made contributions, large-dollar sums of contributions. But \nfamilies who have lost loved ones, who have had them maimed, and their \ncomrades-in-arms know the sacrifices these men and women have made. The \none thing they implore us to do is not to see these sacrifices be made \nin vain.\n  Well, we have seen a lot of negative stories. The media has more than \nadequately covered those. So people are concerned about what is going \non in Iraq. We ought to be concerned. But we are not hearing the \nstories about what is positive, about the successes of this new \nstrategy, the Petraeus strategy.\n  I was in Ramadi and Al Anbar 2 months ago and traveling elsewhere, \nand I found some amazing things. The new counterinsurgency strategy, \nwith the cooperation of the Sunni sheiks who are now working with our \nmilitary, has really essentially driven al-Qaida out of Ramadi, and \nthey are driving them out of the Al Anbar Province. Make no mistake, \nwhen we heard ``civil war, civil war,'' the people over there--the \nmarines, the soldiers--know they are fighting for and looking for al-\nQaida. Al-Qaida is the driving force that is keeping it stirred up, and \nthey are on the mission to search and destroy al-Qaida. Al-Qaida is \nthere big time.\n  But we have been hearing lots of arguments now in favor of--and they \nare heartfelt arguments and people believe them--it is time for \nretreat; it is time to cut back; it is time to withdraw. The cost of \nlives and treasure is too high. The war has not been properly managed. \nThe war cannot be won.\n  Over the last several weeks on break, when I was traveling, I had the \nopportunity to read ``Team of Rivals'' about Abraham Lincoln and the \nconduct of the Civil War. Over a century and a half ago, many of these \nsame arguments were offered abundantly as reasons for President Lincoln \nto accept defeat of the Civil War, and they are now being made for \nPresident Bush to accept defeat in Iraq. As noted in historian Shelby \nFoote's ``The Civil War: A Narrative,'' Members of Congress playing \ngeneral urged the troops to abandon the cause. That great Ohio \nRepresentative Clement Vallandigham, leader of the Copperhead \nDemocrats, campaigned for office by calling upon soldiers to desert. He \ndeclared the South was invincible.\n\n  As noted in passages in ``The Civil War,'' in late 1862, ``Senate \nRepublicans caucused and, with only a single dissenting vote, demanded \nthat Lincoln dismiss Secretary of State Seward'' because they thought \nhe was responsible for the conduct of the war.\n  Republican Leader Thurlow Weed observed that ``the people are wild \nfor peace. . . . Lincoln's election is an impossibility.'' They were \nafter him in\n\n[[Page S8925]]\n\nfull force. I don't need to elaborate on the enormity of the Civil War, \nand I don't need to explain what would have happened had Lincoln \nrelented to those politically popular sentiments at the time.\n  Lincoln chose to fight a bloody and unpopular war because he believed \nthe enemy had to be defeated. Despite being reviled for staying the \ncourse, President Lincoln did stay the course. Unfortunately, too many \nof my colleagues today don't seem to be willing to see this one \nthrough. Here we are again, barely weeks into the full implementation \nof General Petraeus's surge, and the naysayers continue to argue for \ndefeat. It was only a few months ago this body had been calling for and \nlooking for a new strategy, which I believed we must have, which \nchanged the unsuccessful strategy we had, which argued for the Baker-\nHamilton report, which said in essence you have to have a new strategy, \nyou cannot precipitously withdraw. We came forward and General Petraeus \ndrafted a counterinsurgency strategy. That is what he told us he was \ngoing to do, supported by the surge. Now people want to pull the rug \nout from under him. He said at least give him until September to see if \nthis new counterinsurgency strategy works.\n  They are bringing in American soldiers and marines to go in with \nIraqi security forces, Iraqi Army, Iraqi police, embedded with them in \ncommand centers, barracks; they stay there, live among the people they \nare protecting, and they have cleaned out the areas. They have cleaned \nout Ramadi. Two months ago, four Members of Congress walked through \ndowntown Ramadi, which had been an al-Qaida command center. Al-Qaida \nhas been driven out, but naysayers continue to argue for defeat.\n  Now, there may be some short-term political benefits for those \ncalling for withdrawal. There is popular sentiment for it. Some people \nhonestly believe that. But let me quote 1LT Pete Hegseth, an Iraq war \nveteran and director of Vets for Freedom:\n\n       Iraq today is the front line of global jihad being waged \n     against America and its allies. Both Osama bin Laden and \n     Ayman al-Zawahiri have said so.\n\n  He is correct. Our intelligence services said so. They warned us in \nJanuary in an open intelligence hearing that if we withdrew on a \npolitical timetable and took our troops out without making sure that \nthe Iraqi security forces were adequate, there would be chaos. There \nwould be chaos and greatly increased killings among Sunni and Shia. Al-\nQaida would be able to establish a safe haven in which to launch \nrecruitment, training, command and control, and weapons of mass \ndestruction development. The violence and chaos in Iraq would likely \nbring in coreligionists from other countries of the region as they went \nin to protect their fellow religionists. We could have a regionwide \ncivil war, Shia versus Sunni.\n  That is what will happen if we withdraw. Most of us concede there was \npoor management and costly mistakes were made in the post-invasion \nphase in Iraq. But they are not compelling reasons for why we should \nretreat and, like all mistakes, we should learn from them and not go \nback and commit them again by drawing down forces to the point where we \ndon't have adequate troops to work with the Iraqi security forces.\n  Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson recently pointed out that \nthose who are calling for retreat are not learning from previous \nmistakes but repeating them. Gerson writes:\n\n       History seems to be settling on some criticisms of the \n     early conduct of the Iraq war. On the theory that America \n     could liberate and leave . . . force levels were reduced too \n     early . . . security responsibilities were transferred to \n     Iraqis before they were ready, and planning for future \n     challenges was unrealistic.\n       And now Democrats running for President have thought deeply \n     and produced their own Iraq policy: They want to cut force \n     levels too early and transfer responsibility to Iraqis before \n     they are ready, and they offer no plan to deal with the chaos \n     that would result six months down the road. In essential \n     outline, they have chosen to duplicate the early mistakes of \n     an administration they hold in contempt.\n\n  I agree with Gerson, we should not make those mistakes. We must \nfulfill the mission that over 3,600 brave men and women have made the \nultimate sacrifice for.\n  To quote a Missouri guardsman, COL Bob Leeker, who just returned from \ncommanding the 507th Air Expeditionary Group in Iraq:\n\n       I only hope that the American people will give us the time. \n     The American people must understand that this is not only \n     about Iraq, it is a fight against Muslim fanaticism, Muslim \n     extremists. If we pull out in the near term, or at the wrong \n     time, there will be an incredible amount of blood running \n     throughout Iraq, and the blood and sweat that I and my \n     brethren in arms have already given will be for nought.\n\n  These are compelling words. They ought not to be taken lightly. Not \nonly is the security and safety of our Nation and allies at stake, but \nso too is our credibility.\n  Critics frequently claim the war has damaged the United States image \nand credibility throughout the world. Yet these same critics ignore \nwhat irreparable harm would be done were we to leave this mission \nunfilled. If you think our mission has made our image and reputation \nplummet, wait and watch it nosedive after we leave Iraq before \nfinishing the job. Think about the millions of Iraqi citizens and \nleaders who have taken a stand against terrorism, who have committed to \nwork with us, to rebuild their country, to fight against the forces of \nradical Islamists and terrorists. What are we to say to the millions of \nIraqis who trusted Americans and believed we would stay until the \nmission was completed? We would, regrettably, see them slaughtered by \nterrorists as a result of our abandoning them before they were able to \nstand on their own.\n  What did we say to the hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese or \nmillions of Cambodians who trusted America and were slaughtered after \nCongress dictated that we abandon them?\n  History has taught us when American abandons its commitment to \nspreading liberty and freedom, we are not the only ones who suffer. \nRest assured, it will come back to harm us in our own homeland.\n  Just as our intelligence community has warned and terrorist leaders \nhave stated, Iraq will become a base and safe haven from which to plan \nand launch future attacks.\n  Let me be clear, the enemy in Iraq consists of murderous, barbaric \nterrorists. They are not ``insurgents'' or ``jihadists.'' Let's get \nterms straight because we fall into the trap of taking their terms. \nJihad in the Muslim religion is the individual journey to moral \nimprovement. It has been misrepresented to be a philosophy that permits \nencouraging the killing of innocents, the slaughter of fellow Muslims, \nthe slaughter of women and children. The real Arabic term for that is \nhirabah. The people who commit it are not insurgents or jihadists, but \nmufsidoon. These people are condemned to live with Satan because they \nhave committed blasphemy. These are the people we are fighting. It is \nnot a civil war. They are the people who violate the tenets of Islam. \nThey try to hijack it, try to claim the Islamic banner; but they are \nnot practicing the religion of the Prophet Mohammed.\n  Well, there is another reason these people want to sanitize the \ndescription we use of them. Calling them insurgents implies they have \nthe support of the local population. But the local population is being \nvictimized, killed, evicted from their homes, or beheaded by the so-\ncalled insurgents. That is why the Sunni sheikhs in al-Anbar are \nworking with us. They have lived under al-Qaida. They want an end to \nthe terror. That is why they are helping us to identify who they are, \nwhere the weapons caches are, and where the IEDs are hidden. They are \nsending in young Sunnis to sign up. They want to be free of the \nterrorists.\n  Precipitous withdrawal would be a rallying cry for terrorists and al-\nQaida around the world. It would invite further aggression and attacks \nfrom the barbarians. It would be a total loss of freedom, liberty, and \npeace, and would be a victory for totalitarianism, terrorism, and \ntreachery.\n  In a recent book by J. Michael Waller, a scholar at the Institute of \nWorld Politics, he defined terrorism as:\n\n       A form of political and psychological warfare; it is \n     protracted, high intensity propaganda aimed more at the \n     hearts of the public and the minds of decisionmakers and not \n     at the physical victims.\n\n  By Waller's definition and what I have heard from some people in this \nbody and the media, the terrorists are\n\n[[Page S8926]]\n\ncertainly hitting their targets. Our words should inspire our troops \nand the millions of Iraqi citizens who actually trust that Americans \nwill not embrace defeat and leave them. Instead, the words of the \nretreat-and-defeat crowd inspire al-Qaida and the murderous terrorists \nattempting to ignite sectarian strife.\n  Now is not the time to pull out when we are seeing encouraging signs \nin places where the surge has been implemented. Al-Anbar Province shows \ntremendous signs of progress. Even the New York Times' Michael Gordon \nreported last Friday how young American soldiers are executing General \nPetraeus's new strategy on the ground, and how they are fighting and \ndefeating al-Qaida.\n  Here is a quote from Frederick Kagan, a resident scholar at AEI:\n\n       Al-Qaida's operations in Baghdad--its bombings, \n     kidnappings, resupply activities, movement of foreign \n     fighters, and financing--depend on its ability to move people \n     and goods around the rural outskirts of the capital as well \n     as in the city. Petraeus and Odierno, therefore, are \n     conducting simultaneous operations in many places in the \n     Baghdad belt: Fallujah and Baquba, Mahmudiya, Arab Jabour, \n     Salman Pak, the southern shores of Lake Tharthar, Karma, \n     Tarmiya, and so on. By attacking all of these bases at once, \n     coalition forces will gravely complicate the enemy's movement \n     from place to place, as well as his ability to establish new \n     bases and safe havens. At the same time, U.S. and Iraqi \n     forces have already disrupted al-Qaida's major bases and are \n     working to prevent the enemy from taking refuge in the city. \n     U.S. forces are also aggressively targeting Shia death squad \n     leaders and helping Iraqi forces operating against the Shia \n     militias.\n\n  Why has this Senate chosen to debate timelines, restrictions, and \nretreat despite encouraging signs that the surge is working, despite \nthe fact that this new strategy has only been in place fully for barely \na month, and despite the fact that those who want to withdraw and \nretreat have failed to offer any constructive alternatives on how they \nwould deal with a chaos that would ensue from their retreat? It is a \nhuge disappointment that this debate is not about how we can achieve \nvictory, but how quickly can we cede defeat.\n  This has become a political debate and the focus of our national \nsecurity has been sidetracked. We should not pass legislation that \nprovides our enemy a clear path to victory--a victory which, sadly, \nmany in this body are ready to award al-Qaida, without ever having \ngiven the surge a fighting chance. The surge is indeed the best hope we \nhave for establishing safety and stability in the area, which will \nallow the Iraqi security forces to take over and give the Iraqi \nGovernment the space to develop a workable government that can rule \ntheir country.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  I ask unanimous consent that after completion of the remarks of the \nSenator from Arizona, that Senator Reed of Rhode Island be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the committee, the \nSenator from Michigan, for his courtesy. I rise today to discuss the \npending business, the National Defense Authorization Act for 2008. \nThere was a lot of work done on this important legislation. I wish to \ndiscuss five key areas of the bill--Iraq, our nuclear deterrent, \nmissile defense, space threats, and our approach to the war against \nterrorists.\n  This bill has fundamental flaws and must be improved, not only so it \ncan pass this body, but so it can be signed by the President and not be \nvetoed. Remember, this bill does not need to become law, and failure to \nimprove some critical areas of the bill will ensure that it doesn't. To \nthat end, it is important that the Senate have sufficient time to \ndebate the bill. We have already seen a record number of cloture \nmotions filed this year, by my count over 40. And, as I understand it, \nanother has recently been filed dealing with the so-called Webb \namendment. This is probably not a good way to consider a bill as \nsignificant as the Defense authorization bill.\n  Let me, first of all, address the subject of Iraq, the central front \nin the global war against terrorists. Many Senators will spend a \nsignificant amount of time focusing on Iraq policy, and I welcome the \nopportunity to do that. Iraq, after all, is the central front in the \nglobal war against the terrorists. This is what Osama bin Laden says. \nThis is not my own definition. Our success there is not only important \nto the people of Iraq, but it is critical to the national security of \nthe United States.\n  I mentioned Osama bin Laden. He once referred to Iraq as the capital \nof the caliphate. That is the area he would like to establish over \nwhich he would rule, and Baghdad would actually be the center part of \nthat new area. He has argued that ``the most serious issue today for \nthe whole world is this third world war that is raging in Iraq.''\n  Let there be no doubt that al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden are very much \npresent in Iraq and very intent on defeating the United States there. \nThe junior Senator from Virginia has offered an amendment that will \ncodify what the Pentagon, according to the service chiefs and Secretary \nof Defense, is already attempting to do with so-called dwell time. That \npolicy is for the Commander in Chief to determine, not the Congress.\n  Other Senators will offer other amendments relating to Iraq. Among \nthem are amendments to withdraw our troops or make it harder for the \nadministration to prosecute the war. I look forward to a debate on all \nof these amendments, but I make two points to my colleagues who might \nuse this bill to attempt to prematurely leave Iraq or undercut our \ncurrent strategy there.\n  One, we need to give the plan that is being executed by General \nPetraeus time to succeed. We are already seeing signs of progress in \nthe early stages of the surge, and we need to await his report in \nSeptember before making judgments about what to do next.\n  Second, advocates of withdrawal need to confront the likely \nconsequences of their proposed policies, none of which, in my opinion, \nare good.\n  To the first point, the last of the five combat brigades of the surge \njust became operational a couple weeks ago, June 15. According to the \nU.S. military spokesman, LTC Chris Garver,\n\n       This is the first time we'll be able to do the entire \n     strategy as it was designed.\n\n  So it would be premature, to say the least, to judge the effect of \nthe surge at this point and make important strategic decisions based on \nthat judgment. We are already beginning to see Iraqi forces assuming \nmore responsibility over their security, coalition forces receiving \nmore cooperation from Iraqi civilians, and humanitarian and economic \nconditions improving.\n  The second point. Advocates of withdrawal have the duty to tell the \nAmerican people how they propose to grapple with the consequences of \ntheir withdrawal. What will you do about the likely ethnic cleansing \nand genocide against Iraqi citizens who supported coalition forces? GEN \nAnthony Zinni said:\n\n       This is no Vietnam or Somalia or those places where you can \n     walk away. If we just pull out, we'll find ourselves back in \n     short order.\n\n  What would the proponents of these amendments do when Iraq and al-\nQaida are emboldened by our retreat, and terrorists enjoy a new safe \nhaven from which to plot attacks against the United States and our \nallies?\n  Terrorism expert Peter Bergen said this:\n\n       [A U.S. withdrawal] . . . would fit all too neatly into \n     Osama bin Laden's master narrative about American foreign \n     policy. His theme is that America is a paper tiger that \n     cannot tolerate body bags coming home; to back it up, he \n     cites President Ronald Reagan's 1984 withdrawal of United \n     States troops from Lebanon and President Bill Clinton's \n     decision nearly a decade later to pull troops from Somalia. A \n     unilateral pullout from Iraq would only confirm this analysis \n     of American weakness among his jihadist allies.\n\n  What would proponents of amendments do if violence in Iraq escalates \nand draws in neighboring countries? Here is what a recent Brookings \nInstitution study said about that point:\n\n       Iraq appears to have many of the conditions most conducive \n     to spillover because there is a high degree of foreign \n     ``interest'' in Iraq. Ethnic, tribal, and religious groups \n     within Iraq are equally prevalent in neighboring countries \n     and they share many of the same grievances. Iraq has a \n     history of violence with its neighbors, which has fostered\n\n[[Page S8927]]\n\n     desires for vengeance and fomented constant clashes. Iraq \n     also possesses resources that its neighbors covet--oil being \n     the most obvious, but important religious shrines also figure \n     in the mix. There is a high degree of commerce and \n     communication between Iraq and its neighbors, and its borders \n     are porous. All of this suggests that spillover from an Iraqi \n     civil war would tend toward the most dangerous end of the \n     spillover spectrum.\n\n  What would the proponents of these amendments say to America's \nmoderate allies in the Muslim world, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and \nPakistan, who would justifiably question our commitment to them and to \nthe long war in which we find ourselves?\n  And how would the proponents convince them not to begin hedging their \nbets and cooperate less with the United States, thus further enabling \nand emboldening the terrorists?\n\n  Do the proponents of these amendments believe withdrawing our forces \nwill end our war against the terrorists? Do they believe they would not \nsimply follow us home and attack us on our own soil?\n  The Petraeus plan may not offer an easy way forward, but it is the \nonly plan I have heard that does not promise defeat. But as I said, we \nwill have our debates on Iraq policy, as we should. There are other \ndebates about this bill that we should also have.\n  I respect the work that many have done on the bill, but an outside \nobserver, I suggest, might wonder exactly how this bill is going to \nmake us safer. It is supposed to set the national defense policies for \nthe United States, but it is not enough to simply provide funding \nauthorizations. Leaving threats undefended against will not be excused \nsimply because we have spent more money than last year. In fact, some \nof the biggest flaws in the bill are policy changes, not just funding \nchanges.\n  Let me discuss what some of these flaws are. Our nuclear deterrent, \nthe reliable replacement warhead, our nuclear weapons complex, the \nlanguage regarding stockpile stewardship and nuclear weapons complex, \nand, finally, a recommendation regarding the Comprehensive Test-Ban \nTreaty. First, to the reliable replacement warhead.\n  I am deeply troubled by what appears to be a strategy of slow, \ninconspicuous disarmament of our strategic deterrent in this bill and \nthe other authorization and spending bills of the new majority in the \nSenate.\n  The administration's request for development of the first reliable \nreplacement warhead programs was completely eliminated by the House in \nits appropriations bill, a fate that thankfully was avoided in the \nSenate subcommittee markup. Yet there is a clear signal sent by this \nbill which cut the administration's request by $43 million out of a \ntotal of $195 million, and which handcuffs the administration from \nmoving beyond all but the earliest phases of development of the \nwarhead. This leaves the U.S. nuclear deterrent absolutely reliant on \nweapons designed and built in the 1980s.\n  The stockpile stewardship and nuclear weapons complex: Actions taken \nby the new majority in the House cut approximately $500 million from \nthe upgrade and modernization of facilities in the nuclear weapons \ncomplex. These are responsible for refurbishing deployed bombs and \nwarheads, storing older ones, and dismantling those no longer needed. \nThis, obviously, further erodes the reliability of our current \nstockpile.\n  What signal does this send not only to our enemies but to our allies, \nallies who for over 60 years have relied on the umbrella of protection \nof our nuclear deterrent?\n  I mentioned the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty. Perhaps the most--it \nis hard to find the right word--shall I say irregular part of the bill \nis the language that would attempt to short-circuit what is this body's \nmost serious responsibility: the role of the Senate in treaty \nratification.\n  Tucked away near the end of this bill, very much in the fine print, \nis an unprecedented attempt to preordain the ratification of a treaty--\na treaty already overwhelmingly rejected by this body--the CTBT. Unlike \nthe very reasoned rejection of the CTBT 8 years ago following extensive \ndebate after committee hearings, consideration of intelligence, and the \nlike, this language in the bill presumes to state that the will of the \nCongress, without the benefit of a single hearing or single committee \naction of this body, let alone reference to intelligence and debate in \nthe full Senate, is to ratify the treaty.\n  The solemn responsibility of this body to consider treaties cannot be \nso cavalierly disregarded. How can Senators who were not even in the \nSenate in 1999 be expected to evaluate the CTBT without the kind of \nserious consideration that occurred in 1999? This sense of the Senate \nshould be called just what it is--a sham. The whole section of the bill \nreads as a throwback to the days of the nuclear freeze.\n  Apart from the hortatory verbiage in section 3122, it is clear the \nbill leaves us without the resources needed to develop a smaller and \nsafer next generation nuclear stockpile and without resources needed to \nmaintain our current stockpile.\n  In a fundamental contradiction, the cuts in the nuclear programs will \nactually increase the likelihood of needing to return to testing, the \nvery option that would be permanently denied through the ratification \nof the CTBT.\n  Next, let me turn to missile defense. I am very troubled by what this \nbill does to undermine the substantial progress made in protecting this \ncountry from ballistic missile threats.\n  During the North Korean July 4 demonstration a year ago, which \nincluded firing the Taepodong 2 missile with the capability to reach as \nfar as Alaska, the President of the United States had an operational \ndefense missile system on alert for the first time in history. But this \nbill moves to deny that flexible authority that we have used to \nsimultaneously research, test, and deploy an operational missile \ndefense system in record time.\n  What is more, the bill significantly cuts funding for the \nconstruction of a European missile defense site, which will allow \nbetter defense against the Iranian threat, improved coverage of the \nUnited States, and extension of our missile defense system to provide \ncoverage for Europe. This while we are in the middle of negotiations \nwith Poland and the Czech Republic, while the Russians threaten a new \narms race, and while Iran tests the West's resolve.\n  The subject of space threats. One of the most significant failures of \nthis bill is it does nothing to defend the eyes and ears of this \ncountry's political, cultural, diplomatic, economic, and military \nmight. Since the Chinese antisatellite, or ASAT, test earlier this \nyear, very little has been done to defend our global constellations.\n  Modest requests from the administration to provide defensive \ncapabilities, such as the space test bed, for which only $10 million \nwas requested, have been zeroed out by both the House and Senate Armed \nServices Committee.\n  What is more, the bill inflicts significant cuts, some $55 million, \nto the space tracking and surveillance system, the next generation \nconstellation of satellites that will allow improved tracking and \ntargeting of ASAT weapons and midcourse ballistic missile.\n  Other space programs, for example, space situational awareness, \nreceived increases above the administration's request. And I applaud \nthe committee for this, but I remind the Senate that this program only \nallows us to see a threat approaching our satellite constellation. It \ndoes nothing to enable us to defend against the threat. Have we learned \nnothing from recent experience?\n  Our enemies have proven they know better than to engage our armies \nand navies directly. They have observed our weaknesses and seek to \nexploit them through asymmetrical attacks. Blind us, and the best navy \nin the world can't repel an attack.\n  Who can dispute the fact that the $504 billion that we authorize for \nthe Department of Defense in this bill would be virtually meaningless \nif we can't defend our satellite systems from attack? Our satellite \nsystem is the backbone of our entire national defense.\n  Finally, let me conclude by talking about what this bill does with \nrespect to the terrorists with whom we are engaged in a life-and-death \nstruggle.\n  The bill basically would return us to pre-9/11 days, to the law \nenforcement approach to terrorists.\n  We should think very carefully about the damage that would be wrought \nin a global war against these terrorists if we have to fight it by \nusing the ill-conceived proposals in this bill. One would require us to \ngive trials to every detainee we are holding in combat in\n\n[[Page S8928]]\n\nplaces such as Iraq and Afghanistan. Another would give them access to \nclassified information; allow them to compel testimony of witnesses, \nincluding our own soldiers on the battlefield.\n  Have the authors of these provisions thought about where we will get \nthe military lawyers needed to implement their criminal law ACLU \napproach to warfare? There are barely enough of them to provide legal \nservices to our own troops. Have they thought about what our \nintelligence community will say to the foreign allied intelligence \nagencies, many of which are already concerned about sharing their \nsources and methods of intelligence with us; and who may very well \ncompletely cease sharing important intelligence information, knowing it \nwill be shared with captured terrorist combatants? We know that more \nthan 30 detainees have been released from our custody and have returned \nto waging war against the United States and its allies. What will the \nrelease of potentially thousands of detainees do to our national \nsecurity?\n  The Senate must give very careful consideration to this dangerous \nreturn to the pre-9/11 notion of terrorism as a law enforcement \nproblem. Terrorists have made no secret they are at war against our \ncivilization. We ignore their warnings at our peril, and we will not \nprevail if we must deal with them as criminal defendants in American \ncourts.\n  Madam President, I conclude by asking my colleagues to carefully \nconsider the impact these several policies I have highlighted will have \non our national security. Our first obligation is to provide for the \ncommon defense. Unfortunately, as it is presently written, this bill \nfalls well short of that solemn duty, and it could get worse if some of \nthe amendments proposed are adopted. I urge my colleagues to take very \nseriously our obligation to provide for the common defense. It begins \nby confining the policies in this bill to the traditional areas of \ndefense preparedness. I hope we will be disciplined enough to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I will suggest the absence of a quorum \nfor a brief minute. Senator Jack Reed is scheduled to be next, and he \nis within, I think, 30 seconds of getting here. He delayed, as a \ncourtesy to Senator Kyl, and so I will put in that quorum call for a \nminute so he can get here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, today I wish to speak on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee bill being considered by the Senate, S. 1547, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008. It is, I \nbelieve, a very good bill.\n  I wish to commend the chairman, Senator Levin, and his ranking \nmember, Senator Warner, for their efforts and particularly the staff \nand all the work they have done which has contributed to this product \ntoday. It was reported favorably to the floor of the Senate by a \nunanimous vote of the committee, which shows its bipartisan support.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have had the privilege \nof serving as the chairman of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities \nSubcommittee, and I would like to share with my colleagues the \nhighlights of our bill that originated in the Emerging Threats and \nCapabilities Subcommittee.\n  Before I describe those highlights, I also wish to commend and thank \nSenator Dole, the ranking member of my committee. It was a partnership \nand a pleasure to work together with her. She certainly gave valuable \nservice, along with her staff, and I appreciate very much her personal \ncontribution and her leadership on this issue.\n  I would also like to thank staff for their great contribution and \ntheir great effort.\n  By way of background, the Emerging Threats and Capabilities \nSubcommittee, also known as the ETC subcommittee, is responsible for \nlooking at new and emerging threats and considering appropriate steps \nwe should take to improve our capabilities to enhance our security in \nthe light of these new emerging threats. Two of our committee markup \nobjectives, in preparing the bill, were to improve the ability of the \nArmed Forces to meet nontraditional threats, including terrorism and \nweapons of mass destruction; second, to promote the transformation of \nthe Armed Forces to meet the threats of the 21st century.\n  In a nutshell, that is what the ETC subcommittee should be all about, \nand I hope this legislation represents the sum of all our efforts in \nthat regard.\n  This year, there are a number of issues, or themes, that the ETC \nsubcommittee's portion of the bill addresses based on the emerging \nthreats or challenges facing the United States and on capabilities we \nneed to address these challenges. The first thing is the Defense \nDepartment's need for improved and alternate sources of energy. The \nDepartment is a massive consumer of energy, including for its military \nvehicles and platforms, and advanced technology may offer improved \neffectiveness at a reduced cost for our military in the area of energy \nconservation and energy demands.\n  The second area relates to the language of cultural challenges facing \nour military forces operating overseas. We held a very fine hearing on \nthis subject, and there is clearly a need to improve the language and \ncultural awareness capabilities of the military and to make use of \nimproved technology in this area. This would improve our military \neffectiveness and our mission success.\n  The third issue, or theme, is the threat from the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction and the need to improve U.S. efforts to \nreduce this proliferation risk. We held an excellent hearing with the \nformer Senator Sam Nunn and Senator Richard Lugar, as well as witnesses \nfrom the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy, on these \nnonproliferation programs, and I think we all must recognize the debt \nwe collectively owe, not only ourselves but the Nation, to both \nSenators Nunn and Senator Lugar for their path-breaking work on \nlimiting nuclear proliferation and we commend and thank them for that. \nGiven the potentially catastrophic damage that could result from such \nproliferation, we must always look for ways to strengthen and improve \nour nonproliferation programs.\n\n  The final and related theme and issue that we discussed is the threat \nof a terrorist incident within the United States involving a chemical, \nbiological, radiological, nuclear or high-yield explosive device, which \nis known by the acronym CBRNE, a CBRNE device. The challenge is to be \nprepared to manage the consequences of such a domestic CBRNE incident \nand for the Defense Department to have the right capabilities, plans, \nand equipment to provide support to the civil authorities, if \nrequested.\n  I will address the committee's action on these issues as I describe \nthe highlights of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee's \nportion of the bill being considered by the Senate today. Let me start \nwith the area of science and technology.\n  The bill authorizes increased investment in science and technology \nprograms by over $450 million. These programs perform cutting-edge \nresearch that is developing the capabilities that will ensure the \neffectiveness of our Armed Forces in the future, while strengthening \nthe Nation's high-technology innovation sector.\n  These additional S investments, which reflect military value and \ntechnical merit, are intended to enhance Defense Department activities \nin a number of areas--advanced and alternate energy technologies; new \nmanufacturing capabilities; advanced medical technologies aimed at \nimproving the care of combat casualties; and increased funding for \ndefense-related university research that will provide the foundation \nfor future military capability and, in fact, will probably contribute \nto our overall economy.\n  The Armed Services Committee bill authorizes investments of nearly \n$75 million for advanced energy technologies, including programs to \ndevelop fuel cells, hybrid engines, build hydrogen infrastructure such \nas fueling stations at military bases, and explore the use of biofuels \nfor military systems.\n\n[[Page S8929]]\n\n  These kind of technologies will save money and improve war-fighting \ncapabilities, reduce America's dependency on foreign oil, and help DOD \nlead the way in the widespread droppings of alternative energy \ntechnologies.\n  The bill includes a provision sponsored by Senator Pryor that would \nenhance the Department's nanotechnology research program to reflect the \nmaturation of nanotechnology in industry and in universities. It would \npush the Department to have a greater emphasis on issues such as \nnanomanufacturing, moving nanotechnology into major defense systems, \nand monitoring international capabilities in nanotechnology.\n  Following a recommendation of the Defense Science Board, the bill \nwould require the Defense Department to produce a strategic plan for \nthe development of manufacturing technologies. Advanced manufacturing \nprocesses are the key to ensuring that our defense industrial base can \nrespond to the surge of production needs of our deployed forces for \nitems such as body armor, vehicle armor, and jamming devices that are \nbeing used to defeat Improvised Explosive Devices. Manufacturing is \nalso one of the keys to our overall global competitiveness.\n  I am pleased to note the committee bill authorizes nearly $85 million \nin additional funds for the development of advanced manufacturing \ntechnologies to support critical defense production capabilities.\n  In relation to the threat from proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, the bill authorizes additional funding for important \nnonproliferation programs at the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of Energy. This additional funding includes $100 million for \nthe Cooperative Threat Reduction--CTR--Program and $87 million for \nnonproliferation programs of the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration.\n  The bill also authorizes $50 million to support the International \nAtomic Energy Agency proposal for an international nuclear fuel bank. \nThis promising idea, if successfully implemented, could remove the \nincentive for countries, such as Iran, to develop indigenous uranium \nenrichment programs for nuclear power reactor fuel. This would address \nthe loophole in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty that allows uranium \nenrichment for civilian power purposes to serve as a cover for uranium \nenrichment for weapons purposes.\n  In addition, S. 1547 includes a provision that would finally repeal \nall the precertifications for the CTR Program. These conditions delay \nthe program annually, waste program funds, and have long outlived any \nusefulness. Senator Lugar has worked for several years now to remove \nthese restrictions, and I am pleased we have been able to include this \nprovision in the bill.\n  The additional funding for CTR would allow the program to accelerate \nand expand work into some biological materials and weapons areas that \nhave become an increasing concern, and allow for the first time the CTR \nProgram to address issues outside the former Soviet Union in a planned, \nnonemergency fashion. The National Nuclear Security Agency Program has \na number of challenges with respect to the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons, materials, and technology, and much more needs to be done. The \nNorth Korea nuclear tests last October highlighted an area where we \nneed a lot of additional work. That is the area of nuclear forensics \nand attribution. The bill authorizes additional funding to develop new \ntechnology to detect and identify the sources of nuclear material and \nto support the Department of Energy's Office of Intelligence efforts to \ndevelop a nuclear material forensic library.\n\n  The real challenge we have that faces us, an existential challenge, \nis the threat that someday a terrorist--not a nation state but a \nterrorist--might detonate a nuclear device in the United States or in \nan allied country. They would get that material from some national \nsource. If we can effectively trace materials, and we know and we can \nidentify where such materials come from, that goes a long way in \nhelping remove the incentives for any nation state to provide these \ntypes of materials to terrorists. I think this is important research, \nand I am particularly pleased that we have incorporated this language \nin the legislation.\n  In the area of homeland defense there is a concern about the enormous \nchallenge of dealing with the chemical, biological, radiological, \nnuclear, or high-yield explosives, the CBRNE incident in the United \nStates. Such an incident could quickly overwhelm local and State \nemergency response capabilities. The bill contains a provision \nrequiring an advisory panel to address the capabilities of the \nDepartment of Defense to provide support for civil authorities for \nconsequence management of a domestic CBRNE incident. The panel would \nreport to Congress with any findings and any particular \nrecommendations.\n  I thank particularly Senator Dole and her staff for leading the way \non this issue.\n  In the area of chemical and biological matters, the bill adds nearly \n$70 million for the Defense Department's chemical and biological \ndefense program, including procurement of chemical agent detectives and \nmonitors for the Army National Guard. These systems can be used for \noverseas deployments or for domestic consequence management \ninitiatives.\n  The bill also authorizes the restoration of $36 million for the \nchemical demilitarization program and includes a sense-of-Congress \nresolution that the United States should do everything practicable to \nmeet our chemical weapons destruction obligations under the Chemical \nWeapons Convention deadline of April 2012, or as soon as possible \nthereafter. This sense-of-Congress provision includes a number of \nrecommendations made by the Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell. \nI thank him for his contribution.\n  The sooner we destroy the stockpile, the sooner we will remove the \nrisks to the communities around the stockpile sites throughout the \nUnited States.\n  Let me turn also to the area of special operations forces, and in \nparticular language issues. The bill contains additional funding for \nthe Special Operations Command, SOCOM, to meet critical language and \ncultural awareness training requirements, and for various SOCOM \ntechnology and training programs. All told, the bill authorizes more \nthan $20 million additional funding to improve the foreign language and \ncultural awareness capabilities of our military forces.\n  The bill also contains a provision creating a National Foreign \nLanguage Coordination Council, an initiative proposed by Senator Akaka \nof Hawaii, and I thank him for this contribution. This council will \nensure that the initial steps that the administration has taken will \ndevelop into an organized and concerted effort to improve the Nation's \nforeign language capabilities.\n  S. 1547 includes, in addition, a provision that would require the \nGovernment Accountability Office to review the ongoing reorganization \nof the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. The \ncommittee has expressed strong reservations about this reorganization, \nespecially as it pertains to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of \nDefense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict. The study \nwould examine some of the specific committee concerns.\n  The bill also authorizes an additional $124 million to cover unfunded \nrequirements of the Special Operations Command to procure Mine \nResistant Ambush Protected, or MRAP, vehicles. This is part of a \ncommittee-wide $4 billion increase to ensure that U.S. military \npersonnel in Iraq receive the best protection available against \nimprovised explosive devices, the primary cause of injury and death to \nour personnel.\n  I might add, I just returned yesterday from Iraq. One of the points \nthat was raised by Major General Mixon, Commander of the 25th Division, \nwas the need for these MRAP vehicles. I communicated that directly to \nthe Secretary of Defense. I must commend Secretary Gates for his \naggressive leadership to ensure that these MRAP vehicles are being \nproduced and being sent overseas to our forces, particularly our forces \nin Iraq. His leadership on this point is very much appreciated.\n  Finally, in the area of counterterrorism and counterdrug policy, the \ncommittee took a number of actions. On counterterrorism, the committee \nauthorized the Department of Defense to provide increased rewards for \nassistance in counterterrorist operations. This is intended to provide \nadditional\n\n[[Page S8930]]\n\nincentives for others to help us find and defeat terrorists. The \ncommittee also funded the Department's ``train and equip'' program to \nbuild the capacity of partner nations to conduct counterterrorism \noperations and to operate with U.S. forces in military or stability \noperations. The committee has authorized funding for this program, also \nknown as section 1206, at the level authorized last year for fiscal \nyears 2007 and 2008. Congress has given the Defense Department this \nauthority as a pilot program to the end of this fiscal year, at which \ntime Congress can evaluate the program's effectiveness.\n  On counterdrug policy, the committee authorized the Department to \nprovide counterdrug training and equipping assistance to Mexico and the \nDominican Republic. This would expand a list of countries to which we \nprovide such assistance to these neighbors who are facing serious drug \nchallenges. With regard to funding, the committee authorized an \nadditional $22.5 million to boost drug interdiction efforts, especially \nin the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility.\n  Madam President, that is a summary of the highlights of the Emerging \nThreats and Capabilities Subcommittee portion of the Armed Services \nCommittee bill. I urge the Senate to support the entire bill, as the \nsubcommittee does.\n  Now I would like to turn my attention to the matter pending before \nthe Senate, and that is the amendment proposed by my colleague, Senator \nWebb of Virginia.\n  I rise to commend him. I think this is an important amendment that \nunderscores and highlights the strain that our troops are under, given \nthe operational demands of efforts in both Iraq and Afghanistan and \nmany places in the world. No one in this Senate--and particularly in \nthis caucus, this Democratic caucus--understands on a firsthand basis \nthe strain that soldiers, marines, and airmen and sailors live under \nconstantly more than our colleague from Virginia, Senator Webb, who is \na distinguished and heroic veteran of the conflict in Vietnam and \nsomeone to whom we look for his insight and leadership, particularly \nwith respect to the welfare and the safekeeping of our military \npersonnel.\n  Since 2003, the United States has maintained an average of 138,700 \ntroops in Iraq. Today we know we are at a level approaching 160,000. At \nthe same time, there are approximately 25,500 military personnel in \nAfghanistan and an additional 175,000 military personnel performing \nmissions in 130 countries around the world. Nearly every nondeployed \ncombat brigade in the Active-Duty Army has reported that they are not \nready to complete their assigned war missions.\n  Let me repeat that. Nearly every nondeployed combat brigade, those \nnot in Iraq and Afghanistan, are reporting they are not ready in terms \nof personnel or equipment to complete their assigned war missions. We \nall know if they are ordered to, they will go into the fight and they \nwill do well. But they are not going in with the same level of \npersonnel, equipment, and in many cases training that we expected of \nthem just a few short years ago. This is as a result, a direct \nconsequence of the strategy being pursued by the President in \nAfghanistan and Iraq and the size limitations on our military forces.\n  Such a sustained operational demand has had a significant effect on \nour ground forces' ability to train, deploy, and conduct their missions \neffectively. The way we measure our military's ability to perform \neffectively is called their readiness. Readiness is composed of three \nelements: personnel, equipment, and training.\n  First let's look at the personnel issues. Since 2002, 1.4 million \nmilitary troops have served in Iraq or Afghanistan. The standard ratio \nthe U.S. military likes to use for deployments is 1 to 2--meaning for \nevery year deployed, 2 years back at the home duty station for \nrecuperation, retraining--all those things you need to restore the \nprofessional skill and a high degree of spirit and morale necessary for \nsuccessful military forces.\n  Since the beginning of the Iraq war, however, Army brigade combat \nteams have been on a 1-to-1 ratio: 1 year deployed, 1 year back. That \nputs a huge strain on not only soldiers but the families of those \nsoldiers. This ratio was further strained on April 11, 2007, when the \nPentagon announced that all Active-Duty Army units in the Central \nCommand area of responsibility, principally Iraq and Afghanistan, would \nbe extended to 15-month tours. The Marine Corps has also moved to a 1-\nto-1 ratio: 7 months deployed, 7 months at home station.\n  There is another aspect to this, and that is known as stop-loss. It \nhas been imposed on 50,000 troops. What this means is that an \nindividual is eligible, having served out their enlisted time, to leave \nthe military forces, but they are involuntarily held behind in order to \nmeet the missions of the Army because of this huge personnel crunch.\n  That stop-loss is affecting 50,000 individuals who have served \nhonorably and well, who have made plans to return to civilian life. \nThose plans are on hold now. That is another manifestation of this \nstrain our land forces are under at this moment.\n  The reality of this operational tempo is that many Active-Duty \nsoldiers and marines are on their third or even fourth tour of duty in \nAfghanistan or Iraq. Of the Army's Active 44 combat brigades, all but \nthe 1st Brigade of the Second Infantry Division, which is permanently \nbased in South Korea, have served at least one term in Iraq or \nAfghanistan. Breaking that down further, 12 brigades of Army have had 1 \ntour, 20 have had to 2 tours, 9 have had 3 tours, and 2 brigades are on \ntheir fourth tour. This is an extraordinarily aggressive operational \ntempo to subject any force to.\n  Although the deployment for our special operations forces are \nclassified, it is known that the average weekly deployment for special \noperations forces was 61 percent higher in 2005 than in 2000. Every \naspect of our Active Force and many of our Reserve components are being \nstressed with extraordinary contributions to the operations today that \nare worldwide.\n  This strain extends to our National Guard and Reserve. More than \n417,000 National Guard and Reserve, or about 80 percent of the members \nof the Guard and Reserve, have been deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan \nwith an average of 18 months per mobilization. Of these, more than \n84,200, or 20 percent, have been deployed more than once. Presently, \nthe Army National Guard has 34 brigades; 16 are considered an \n``enhanced brigade,'' which means they are supposed to be fully manned, \nequipped, and able to deploy rapidly.\n  Since 2001, every enhanced brigade has been deployed overseas at \nleast once, and two have already been deployed twice.\n  When the President announced the surge, the Pentagon was forced to \nrecall to active duty several thousand Guard and Reserve personnel who \nhad already served in Iraq and Afghanistan. In order to do this, the \nPentagon had to revise its rules that limited the callup time of Guard \nmembers to no more than 24 months every 5 years.\n  With respect to this decision, the Commission on the National Guard \nand Reserve recently concluded:\n\n       Overall, if the reserve component, including the National \n     Guard, continues its high operational tempo, current \n     indicators cast considerable doubt on the future \n     sustainability of recruiting and retention, even if financial \n     incentives continue to increase. There is a real cost to this \n     operational tempo.\n\n  The cost is not only in the immediate near term but also in the \nlonger one. Our current policies overseas have overstretched our \nmilitary. The burdens of the past few years will have consequences for \nyears to come. We risk rendering our military a weakened force, and we \nwant to do all we can to avoid it.\n  We are already seeing indications of the stress that is being borne \nby our military forces, and they are manifested in many different ways.\n  Yesterday the U.S. Army announced it fell short of its active-duty \nrecruiting goal by 15 percent. It is the second month in a row that the \nArmy's enlistment efforts have fallen short. This is in the context of \na belated attempt, I would argue, by the administration to increase the \noverall end strength in the Army.\n  You have a situation now where the Army is under huge pressure. There \nis an attempt to increase the numbers overall. That attempt is being, \nat least seems to be being frustrated by the inability to recruit new \npersonnel into the Army.\n\n[[Page S8931]]\n\n  The Army expressed concern but repeats the fact that the Army has met \nits recruiting goals for the past 2 years. Technically, that is true. \nBut a closer look shows there are some disturbing trends that may have \nlong-term negative consequences. In order to meet the demands of today, \nthe Army is drawing heavily on its delayed entry program, or pool of \nfuture recruits, which will leave it empty handed in the future as they \ntry to enlist more soldiers.\n  The Army has also begun to lower standards in order to meet \nrecruiting goals. The Army granted approximately 8,500 ``moral \nwaivers'' to recruits in 2006, as compared to 2,260 of these moral \nwaivers given in 1996. These waivers cover misconduct and minor \ncriminal offenses. Again, the trend is not less but more in terms of \ntrying to achieve recruiting goals by waiving some incidents that \notherwise would disqualify a person from joining the Army. Waivers for \nrecruits who committed felonies, for example, were up 30 percent in \n2006 from the year before.\n  Last year, 82 percent of Army recruits had high school diplomas. That \nis the lowest level since 1981. Only 61 percent of Army recruits scored \nabove average on the service's aptitude test last year. That is the \nlowest score since 1985.\n  Last year, the Army would not have met its recruiting goals without \nlowering its weight standards and increasing the acceptable recruiting \nage to 42 years old. Frankly, you know, thinking back, not long ago the \nidea of actually trying to recruit people who were 42 years old, might \nhave physical problems, who might have minor criminal violations, was \nconsidered anathema by the military as they prided themselves on the \nability with each succeeding quarter to indeed try to raise the \nstandards. But the pressure on personnel has produced these results.\n  Despite these lower standards, basic training graduation rates have \nincreased from 82 percent in 2005 to 94 percent in 2006, leaving one to \nwonder whether the training program standards are also being modified \nso that these individuals can get through and get into the brigades \nthat need support. That would have long-term, unfortunate consequences \nfor the overall effectiveness of our military forces.\n  The Army is also using some extraordinary means to maintain retention \nrates. There are problems recruiting, but also they are making special \nefforts to keep those soldiers they have. The biggest incentive, of \ncourse, for retention is providing financial compensation to those who \ndecide to extend. However, the level of funding we are putting toward \nkeeping soldiers simply cannot be sustained. In the past 4 years the \nArmy has increased the amount spent on retention bonuses from $85 \nmillion to $735 million.\n  At the same time, the cost of supporting each soldier has increased \nfrom $75,000 in 2001 to $120,000 in 2006, because of the inducements, \npay benefits that are appropriate but very expensive, and again raise \nthe question of: How long they can be sustained?\n  Despite the increases in pay, the Army is still having difficulties \nwith retention, particularly retaining officers. Last year the active \nArmy was short 3,000 officers and it is projected this shortage will \nincrease to 3,500 officers this year. The Guard and Reserve are facing \na shortfall of almost 7,500 officers.\n  Army reenlistment rates for mid-grade soldiers dropped 12 percent in \nthe past 2 years. According to the New York Times, more than a third of \nthe West Point class of 2000 left active duty at the earliest possible \nmoment, after completing their 5-year obligations.\n  For Special Forces, recruitment and retention are most difficult. For \nthe past 6 years, 82 percent of the active-duty Special Forces \nspecialties were underfilled, many with shortfalls over 10 percent.\n  I had a chance to sit down and have lunch with three soldiers at a \npatrol base which had only been in operation for 3 weeks, just about 2 \ndays ago in Iraq. All three of those soldiers were on their second or \nthird tour. Two had already decided they were getting out, and a third \nhad not yet decided. They have served their country magnificently. They \nhave done it with great dedication, and for many different reasons are \nleaving. That is a very imprecise scientific sample, I would admit, but \nstill it suggests that because of operational stress, because of the \ndemands on soldiers who are performing magnificently, they are also \nthinking about their future and thinking about leaving the force rather \nthan staying on for extended periods of time.\n  The soldiers recruited today define the quality of our Army in the \nfuture. Focusing on filling slots today without regard for maintaining \nhigh standards can have dire consequences down the road. We have \nserious challenges before us as a nation.\n  I have spent time talking about personnel because at the heart of \nSenator Webb's amendment is the recognition that ultimately a military \nforce is about people--the soldiers, the marines, the sailors, the \nairmen, and their families. And if we keep this operational tempo, if \nwe do not provide the respite, time for recuperation, what he is \nsuggesting, at least an equal time out of the war zone as you spend in \na war zone, then these personnel issues become more and more acute and \nbecome more damaging to the overall capability of our military force.\n  There is another aspect, too, of readiness. That is equipment. In \norder to meet the equipment needs in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Army \nrequires that active and reserve units leave behind certain essential \nitems that are in short supply, including up-armored humvees and long-\nrange surveillance and communications systems.\n  This system ensures that incoming soldiers can receive 100 percent of \nthe equipment, and it reduces transportation costs. But there is a \ndownside. As the GAO pointed out, while this equipment approach has \nhelped meet current operational needs, it has continued the cycle of \nreducing the pool of equipment available to nondeployed forces for \nresponding to contingencies and training.\n  Forty percent of the marines' ground equipment has been deployed in \nIraq over the past 3 years and is being used at nine times its planned \nrate. I can recall last year being in Iraq and was told just before we \ngot on the helicopter that it was flying at many more times the number \nof hours that it was planned to fly in a peacetime environment. They \nassured us, of course--and they are right--that it was very well \nmaintained. But the stress on the equipment is just as telling as the \nstress on personnel. We are using this equipment and overusing this \nequipment as we operate in all of those theatres of conflict.\n  According to Lieutenant General Blum, the Army National Guard \npresently has on hand only 30 percent of its essential equipment here \nat home, while 88 percent of the Army National Guard that is in the \nU.S. is very poorly equipped. Nearly 9 out of every 10 Army National \nGuard units in Iraq and Afghanistan have less than half the equipment \nneeded to respond to a domestic crisis, and less than 45 percent of the \nAir National Guard units have the equipment they need. Again, one of \nthe other major missions of the National Guard is responding to \ndomestic contingencies. They are severely constrained in that regard. \nLieutenant General Blum, who is the chief of our National Guard, \nstates:\n\n       This is the first time such a shortfall in equipment \n     readiness has occurred in the past 35 years.\n\n  He estimates that the total cost of the shortfall is about $36 \nbillion. In March 2007, the Commission on the National Guard and \nReserves reported that nearly 90 percent of National Guard units are \nnot ready to respond to crises at home or abroad.\n  The chairman of the Commission on the National Guard summed it up:\n\n       We cannot sustain the National Guard and Reserves on the \n     course we are on.\n\n  Again, the military is doing not only everything they are asked but \nmuch more. But we need to ensure that they have the opportunity to rest \nand to refit. We have to ensure they have equipment that is well \nmaintained and not overly used.\n  There is a huge shortfall in equipment. The Marine Corps has a $12 \nbillion equipment shortfall in 2007. The Army estimates it will need \n$12 billion annually for as long as the Iraq war continues, and for 2 \nyears thereafter. These significant costs will have to be borne, but \nthe biggest cost, I believe, is the one that is being borne today for \nour soldiers, marines particularly, and the fact that they are \noperating in a war zone, coming back, and all too\n\n[[Page S8932]]\n\nshortly thereafter being required to go back.\n  There is another effect. It has an effect on training. We pride \nourselves, as we should, as the best trained military force in the \nworld, perhaps of all time. But that training cannot operate if there \nis insufficient time back at home station to do it. And that, I think, \nalso is the heart of Senator Webb's amendment. He understands that one \nof the great factors that holds a unit together is the sense of skill, \nthe sense that they not only know how to do the job, but they practice \nthat job time and time again. They are ready for any contingency, any \neventuality. That readiness, that sense of confidence does not come \nwithout spending the time at home station training. That, too, is being \nsacrificed.\n  I commend Senator Webb. I think from his heart and from his essence \nas a marine, he understands that our soldiers, marines, airmen deserve \nthe time to prepare, to train, to regroup before they go back again. At \na minimum, his amendment is calling for equal time at home station that \nequates to time deployed in a war zone as the minimum that we should \nprovide these brave young men and women.\n  I hope we can support this amendment. I hope we can do it, get it \nback and send a message to our troops: We know what you are doing for \nus. We appreciate it. After serving with distinction with courage and \ngreat sacrifice, you deserve time to come home, to see family, to \nretrain, to rest, and to prepare again to defend the Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, before my distinguished colleague from \nRhode Island leaves, I thank him for the incredible contributions I \nknow he made to this legislation that is in front of us. He, too, has \nhad a distinguished career serving his country in the armed services as \nwell as in the Senate, and we congratulate him for his service.\n  I also start by congratulating our Michigan senior Senator whom we \nare all so proud of for all of the important work he does, and none is \nmore important for Michigan and for the country than serving as \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n  This National Defense Authorization Act and all that it brings in \nterms of additional tools for our troops, issues that directly relate \nto supporting the troops and their families, the equipment, the new \ntechnology, the new policies for the future that they need, all of \nthese things are incredibly important, and Senator Levin has been the \nleader on these issues for us. We in Michigan are extremely proud of \nall he has done.\n  I specifically today raise my voice in support of the Webb amendment \nto the National Defense Authorization Act. Tonight in Iraq, 1,644 \nmembers of the Michigan National Guard will bed down after a long day \nof working and fighting. They work in 100-degree weather, sand blowing \nin their faces, facing dangers at every turn, in the harshest physical \nconditions imaginable. For every single one of those men and women, \nthere is a family at home in Michigan who will go to bed tonight \nworried and saying a prayer for the safety of their loved one, for the \nsafe return of their son, their daughter, father, mother, sister, \nbrother.\n  The true cost of this war cannot be measured in dollars and cents, \nalthough there is a huge financial cost to what is happening. But the \ntrue cost is measured by the sacrifices of our troops and their \nfamilies; every single day, day in and day out. The cost is more than \njust the possibility and the reality of physical danger; the cost \nincludes the sacrifices that entire families are making, financial \nsacrifices, emotional sacrifices, sacrifices being made because they \nare apart day after day, month after month, and now year after year.\n  It is not right; it is not fair; it is not safe. We need to change \nthis policy. That is what the Webb amendment does. In Michigan, 1,644 \nGuard members, 1,644 families, 1,644 missed birthdays, Father's Day, \nMother's Day, missed high school graduations, baby's first steps, \nanniversaries, family funerals, Christmas, other holidays.\n  It is also 1,644 missed paychecks. It may be the only paycheck in the \nfamily--the paycheck that is paying the mortgage, the paycheck that is \nthere to help send the kids to college, to pay the car payment, to be \nable to have the standard of living we all want for ourselves and our \nfamilies--sidetracked careers, small businesses and farms put in \neconomic danger, 1,644 lives that will never be the same, 1,644 sets of \nmissed opportunities, missed moments that can never be replaced.\n\n  These members of the Michigan National Guard make up only a fraction \nof the 160,000 men and women in uniform currently serving in Iraq and \ncountless others who have served. In too many cases, these men and \nwomen are back in Iraq for their second, third, and now fourth \nredeployment.\n  Our fighting men and women are the greatest resource we have. They \nmake us proud every single day. But, unfortunately, this Government is \nabusing this resource, these people. America puts its trust in our \nmilitary to defend us. When our sons and daughters join the military, \nthey put their trust in us, in the Congress, in the President of the \nUnited States, to give them the tools and the resources they need and \nto treat them with the respect they have earned. Current administration \npolicies on redeployment have violated that trust. These policies have \nlet our troops down. They have let their families down.\n  I am proud to join with my colleague from Virginia in saying: Enough \nis enough--enough is enough--when it comes to abusing our Armed Forces \nby stretching them to the breaking point with redeployment after \nredeployment.\n  Our armed services have traveled a tough road since we invaded Iraq. \nThey have shouldered a heavy burden with pride and confidence and \nhonor. We have asked extraordinary things--extraordinary things--from \nthem at every turn. And at every turn they have delivered. They have \nmade us all proud. They have faced tough situations, made tough \nchoices, and have done their duty.\n  Now we need to do our duty. We need to do what is right for them. It \nis our time to face the tough situations. It is our time to make the \nhard choices. It is our time to make them proud. That is what this \namendment is about. That is what this bill is about. That is what \nfurther discussions we will have about how to end this war will be all \nabout.\n  America's soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines are always \nthere for us when they are called. The question is, Will we be there \nfor them? Will we be there for them today and tomorrow and the next \nday?\n  This legislation Senator Webb has proposed is something that is \nsimply the right thing to do and is a very important piece of \nsupporting our troops.\n  First of all, for our regular forces, the amendment requires that if \na unit or a member deploys for Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation \nIraqi Freedom, they will have the same time at home--what is called \n``dwell time''; down time, as I would say; our forces would call it \ndwell time--before being redeployed. So if someone is deployed for 6 \nmonths, they would have dwell time for 6 months, whether that is being \nhome with the family, whether that is retraining, whether that is time \nto regroup. If they are deployed for 12 months, they would have 12 \nmonths at home; 15 months, 15 months.\n  For the National Guard and Reserve, no unit or member will be \nredeployed to Iraq or Afghanistan within 3 years of their previous \ndeployment. Now, this is strictly a floor, but it will stabilize Guard \nand Reserve deployment cycles in a much more predictable way. It is \ngood for them, it is good for us from a safety standpoint, preparedness \nstandpoint, and it certainly is good for the families we are asking to \nmake such sacrifices.\n  We understand this is a dangerous and unpredictable world we live in, \nso this amendment also includes an important provision, a provision \nenabling the President to waive these limitations if he certifies to \nCongress that deployment is necessary in response to a vital national \nsecurity interest of the United States.\n  Now, why is this down time or dwell time so important? Longer and \nmore predictable dwell time is needed for many reasons. Most \nimportantly, it allows for members to readjust from combat and spend \ntime with their families. It also allows troops the time they need to \nbe ready for the next combat mission. We have to remember that\n\n[[Page S8933]]\n\nwhen our people return from their deployments, the majority of their \ntime is spent retraining, refurbishing, and reequipping prior to being \nredeployed.\n  The bottom line is that the Webb amendment will ensure that our men \nand women in uniform have a more predictable deployment schedule, with \nadequate time between tours. We have a responsibility to prevent \nfurther needless damage to our military, and the Webb amendment does \nthat.\n  Five years ago, I was proud to stand on this floor as one of 23 \nMembers who believed this war was the wrong choice. For the past 5 \nyears, I have been proud to cast vote after vote supporting the troops, \nworking to ensure they have the resources they need so they can get the \njob done as soon as possible and come home safely.\n  Today, I stand on the floor and once again say: Enough is enough. The \nAmerican people are saying: Enough is enough.\n  This administration failed our troops by committing them to this war \nwithout a clear reason or goal. This administration failed our troops \nby not having a clear mission for our Armed Forces in Iraq. They failed \nour troops by not providing the proper equipment, body armor, or \nlogistical support for our forces. They failed our troops with their \npoor planning for the invasion of Iraq and their total lack of planning \nfor how to secure the country, despite the best efforts of our brave \nmen and women. And they have failed our troops by sending them back \ninto harm's way over and over and over again without the proper down \ntime between redeployments. History will judge this administration on \nhow they have handled this war. History will judge us now on what we do \nfor the troops and what we do to end this war.\n  We need a new strategy for Iraq, a strategy that brings our troops \nhome safely and responsibly. We need to treat our troops with respect--\nthe respect they deserve, they have earned--while they are serving us. \nThey put their lives on the line every day for us. The least we can do \nis to make sure they have what they need and they have the time they \nneed between combat deployments to be with their families and to \nprepare for the future. And they need a strategy. They are asking us to \nbe paying attention to what is going on.\n  So many of us have been to Iraq and have seen what is happening on \nthe front lines. They are in the battle every day. They are focusing \non their mission, on staying alive, keeping their buddies alive. They \nare counting on us to have their back. They are counting on the \nPresident to have their back. They are counting on people here getting \nit right, doing the right thing--whether it is making sure they have \nthe time they need, which the Webb amendment does, to focus on their \nneeds and their families' needs or whether it is to make sure there is \na strategy that makes sense. That is what we are now debating on this \nfloor.\n\n  I believe the American people have spoken very loudly and very \nclearly, and it is time for us to listen. It is our job to listen, to \ndo the right thing for the troops, to do the right thing for their \nfamilies, to do the right thing for communities and for our country.\n  When I look around the Senate, I am struck by the fact that we have \nall taken different paths to get here, to this debate right now. It has \nbeen a long 5 years. Some of us have stood up against this war since \nday one. Many have come to understand the tragedies of this war and the \nfailures of this administration and have come at a different time. But \nno matter what path each of us has taken, no matter how we have gotten \nhere today, now we have the opportunity to do the right thing. That is \nwhat this debate is about.\n  I am so grateful to our Senate leader, Harry Reid, for making sure we \nstay focused on what is clearly the most critical issue in front of us, \nwhat is happening in the war in Iraq and with our troops and our \nfamilies, and what we need to do to focus on the real threats--the real \nthreats--here at home, through his leadership, on the 9/11 Commission \nlegislation, as well as focusing on the real threats abroad.\n  So we have seen leadership bringing us back to this issue, creating \nthis opportunity now for us to do the right thing. We need to do the \ncourageous thing. The Webb amendment is an opportunity to do the \ncourageous thing for our troops. We cannot change the past, but we have \nto change the future, and that means acting now.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the Webb amendment for the \nbrave men and women who are serving us and counting on us to understand \nwhat we are expecting of them as they do their duty, with the \nsacrifices they are making, their families are making. They are \ncounting on us to do the right thing. They are counting on us to do the \nright thing on the overall strategy on this war.\n  This legislation, this time, this debate in the next few days is an \nopportunity for us to tell the American people: We hear you. We hear \nyou. Enough is enough. Enough is enough. It is time to get this right \nand to bring our men and women home safely and responsibly.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am going to speak for about 12 minutes. \nWill you let me know when that 12 minutes is up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so advise the Senator. The \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the hope of anybody in politics is to \nserve in a body, such as the Senate, at a time when it matters. Our \nhopes and dreams have come true. We in Government decide what matters. \nWhat we are doing on this Defense authorization bill matters. It \nmatters to the men and women in uniform. It matters to everybody in the \nworld because during these difficult times the world is facing, \nincreasingly the world is turning to the American men and women, our \nfighting men and women, to make things right.\n  Imagine a world without the brave Armed Forces of the United States. \nWhat would that world look like? It would be a very dangerous place, \nmore so than it is now. So I wish to say the one thing we have in \ncommon as Republicans and Democrats is admiration for those who are \ncarrying the burden of fighting a worldwide global struggle called the \nwar on terror.\n  Now to Iraq. We are going to have amendments this week that have one \ncommon theme to them. It would take the current strategy in Iraq and \nchange it. General Petraeus was unanimously approved by this body to go \nto Iraq and do something different. He told us before he left: I need \nmore troops. The reason I need more troops is because the mistakes we \nmade in the past have caught up with us.\n  What is the biggest mistake America made right after the fall of \nBaghdad? Not having enough security to keep the country from spiraling \nout of control, not having enough security to suppress the militias. \nOne thing I have learned in life, where there is lawlessness, people \nfill in the vacuum. If the Government cannot protect you, then you will \nfind groups who will protect you.\n  What happened in Iraq is the security got out of control, and we had \nsectarian violence spawned by al-Qaida. The thing we have to realize as \na nation is this organization called al-Qaida has one common goal. It \nis not about Sunni, Shia, and Kurds; it is about moderation. They hate \nmoderation in any form. It doesn't matter if it is wearing a Sunni \nface, a Shia face, or a Kurdish face. They have come to Iraq to destroy \nthis infant democracy.\n  The report card on the political progress in Iraq: It is about like \nhere at home. I give it a very low grade. Unlike here at home--we do \nhave a stable society, for the most part--in Iraq they have a very \nunstable society, so they need political leadership desperately.\n  After my sixth or seventh visit on the Fourth of July week past, I am \nhere to say there is bad news. The bad news, from my point of view, is \nthe Iraqi political leadership that exists today is paralyzed, very \nmuch like we are here at home. I don't see them anytime soon having a \nbreakout when it comes to political reconciliation, but I do have hope \nfor the future that they will do that, and it is not an unrealistic \nhope.\n  There is some emerging movements in Iraq politically that can bring \nabout\n\n[[Page S8934]]\n\nreconciliation. But here is the good news. The strategy of additional \ncombat power getting out from behind the walls, out of the fortresses, \nout into the hinterlands of Iraq to fight al-Qaida is working.\n  The one thing I can tell my colleagues with certainty is, for 3\\1/2\\ \nyears, I went to Iraq and I came back every time despondent because I \ncould see the security situation spiraling out of control and I was \ntold time and time again: No, the training strategy is working. Our \ngoal is to train the Iraqi Army and police forces, and we are doing a \ngood job.\n  The first time I went to Iraq, I went rug shopping. The last time I \nwent before the change in strategy, I was in a tank. It was clear to \nme, being a military lawyer, not a combat commander, that the situation \non the ground was getting worse. This time around, after the new \nstrategy has been in place, things are getting better on the ground \nwhen it comes to suppressing the No. 1 enemy of this Nation right now \nfor the moment and that is called al-Qaida.\n  Al-Qaida in Iraq flourished under the old strategy. They were able to \ndominate different regions of Iraq. Sunni populations were being \nterrorized, and a lot of bad things happened when we were in Baghdad \ntraining and not fighting.\n  General Petraeus, when he got in charge, when he got in place said we \nare going to change strategy. What he has done is he has sent \nadditional combat power into areas previously held by al-Qaida. He went \nto the tribal leaders in those areas and said: If you are fed up, we \nare here to help.\n  Here is the good news. To a person almost, the people who lived under \nal-Qaida's regime in Iraq said: No, thank you. That is not the life I \nwant for myself or my family or my friends or my group.\n  Al-Qaida overplayed their hand. They were incredibly vicious and \nbrutal and they overplayed their hand. What has happened in the last \nfew months is this additional combat capability that now exists in Iraq \nhas married up with a desire by the Sunnis, who have been oppressed by \nthe al-Qaida elements in Iraq, to join forces.\n  It is undeniable that in Anbar, the situation has changed in the last \n6 months in a dramatic way. The Sunni tribal leaders in Anbar have \nbroken with al-Qaida, they have joined with General Petraeus and Iraqi \nsecurity forces and literally that province has changed. There are \nareas in Anbar Province where you could not go before that you can go \nto now, where there is a new alliance in place. There has been a surge \nin police recruits, Sunnis joining the police force to protect their \nhometown against al-Qaida.\n  So the formula General Petraeus had in mind is not dependent upon \ncentral Government reconciliation. He went out into the troubled areas, \nand he told the people living under al-Qaida: If you choose to, we will \nhelp you, and you need to help yourselves. And they have chosen to help \nthemselves. They have chosen to tell us where al-Qaida is operating. \nThey have given us better intelligence than we have ever had in the \npast. They have joined the fight, and we are winning. Al-Qaida today is \non the run. They are on the run because the Iraqi people have broken \nwith their way of life.\n  The big question for a lot of Americans is: Is everybody in the \nMideast committed to extremism? Is there any hope that people in the \nMideast want a different way of life than bin Laden charted for them? \nThe answer is yes, and the best evidence I can give is what is going on \nin Iraq. Where American combat power has been in place in sufficient \nnumbers and levels, the Iraqis have chosen to side with us and reject \nal-Qaida. That should be heartening news. Given a choice, given the \nopportunity, those who have lived under the al-Qaida regime and \nideology have said: No, thank you.\n\n  The permanent solution is political reconciliation, but if we can \nfocus as a nation on defeating al-Qaida in Iraq, it would be a much \nbetter world. The political reconciliation yet to come in Iraq would be \nenhanced if we could destroy elements of al-Qaida in Iraq. The global \nwar on terror would be enhanced if we destroy al-Qaida in Iraq. The way \nwe do that is, again, by forming alliances with Sunnis who reject their \nideology, and once we defeat al-Qaida in a neighborhood or city, we \nhave gotten the local people to step up to the plate and become \npolicemen.\n  The number of police in Anbar Province has gone up dramatically, and \nthey are providing what was missing before: a stable law-and-order \nregime that is rejecting extremism.\n  The police forces in the Sunni areas in Anbar are doing very well. \nThey have the trust of the people, and they are marrying up with Iraqi \nArmy units, where most of the officers are Shias. But we found the Shia \nIraqi Army leadership and the Sunni police forces have worked well \ntogether in Anbar.\n  What did the enemy do? They moved to Diyala. We are going to the \nDiyala Province, another Sunni area, more mixed than Anbar, and we are \ngetting the same results. Extreme violence is the first thing we get, \nterrorism. This spectacular attack will continue for a long time to \ncome, but the actual situation on the ground has changed dramatically \nin Anbar, and it is beginning to change in Diyala. Why? We never before \nhad combat capability in the Diyala Province. The tribal leaders in \nthat province have joined with us, as they did in Anbar. More people \nare joining the police and, again, al-Qaida is moving down the road.\n  The goal for us as a nation is to sustain this capability until we \ndefeat al-Qaida in Iraq. I don't believe that is going to take much \nlonger because what we have left behind in Anbar in a few months is \ngoing to be mature enough that we will not need that many troops. In a \nfew months from now, we are going to have a mature police force and a \nwell-trained Army to control areas in Anbar Province that previously \nwere in the hands of al-Qaida. It is going to take some time.\n  When General Petraeus comes back in September, I think he will give \nus a mixed report. That will be the honest truth. There are still areas \nin Iraq very much in doubt. But where we go in force and where people \nhave the choice to make, they are making the choice we hoped they would \nmake.\n  Our choice in Congress is whether we change course. Do we, in July, \nadopt amendments that will destroy the Petraeus strategy and replace it \nwith the old strategy? One thing my Democratic and Republican \ncolleagues have in common is they are trying to do what is best for the \ncountry.\n  This is what I think is best. I think it is best not to do anything \nnow that would give al-Qaida a second chance in life. I don't want the \nSenate to be the cavalry for al-Qaida. By that I mean, I don't want us \nto adopt an amendment that will destroy the ability of General Petraeus \nto go after the enemy in an aggressive fashion and continue forming \nthese alliances by undercutting his ability to have the manpower he \nneeds. The old strategy has failed. To go back to the old strategy is a \ngodsend to al-Qaida and is a death blow to those who have come out of \nthe shadows to say: I want a better way; I want a better Iraq.\n  We have a chance to give this general and the troops who have gone as \npart of this surge a chance to do something that I think is in our \nnational security interest: Keep al-Qaida on the run and destroy it. I \nam convinced now more than ever that the ability to destroy al-Qaida in \nIraq is within our grasp, and it is a combination of additional \nAmerican military power and the will and the desire of the Iraqi people \nto reject al-Qaida.\n  Let's not be the cavalry for al-Qaida. Let's not do something \npolitically in Washington that will put them back in the fight. We are \ngoing to be taking casualties as long as al-Qaida exists anywhere on \nthe planet. My goal and the military's goal is to fight them over \nthere, suppress them over there, bring out the best in the people in \nthe Mideast, and we are seeing, slowly but surely, that the people in \nIraq who have lived under al-Qaida are turning away. That is indeed \ngood news. Are they turning to democracy and political unity? No, not \nyet. But the precondition, the forming of a new Iraq is to take those \nwho wish to destroy this new democracy and isolate them and destroy \nthem before they can destroy this idea called moderation.\n  The al-Qaida agenda is not limited to Iraq, but they see it as a \ncentral battlefront in the war on terror. We should see it as the \ncentral battlefront in the war on terror. Any amendment that is adopted \nin July that would undo the Petraeus strategy is shortsighted and, in \nthe long run, very devastating to our national security interests.\n\n[[Page S8935]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to look closely and ask the questions that need \nto be asked, not for the next election but for the next generation of \nyoung Americans and people in the Mideast, and that question is: If we \ndo not stay committed to this fight against an enemy who hates \neverything we stand for now, what are the consequences later? I can \ntell my colleagues, and I will close with this thought, that history \ntells us the answer to that question. Every time extremism has been \nappeased, good people die unnecessarily. We have good people in Iraq. \nThe Iraqi people have good people among their population. Our men and \nwomen in uniform are the best we have to offer. This alliance between \nthe good will defeat the evil, as it always has done, only if we have \ngreater will than our enemy.\n  The votes we are about to take are about political will. I hope we \nwill choose the path that history tells us we should take. Say no to \nextremism and yes to moderation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, lobbying and ethics reform, the most \nsignificant change in the history of the country, has been passed by \nthe House and the Senate. Why is it not signed into law? Because the \nRepublicans are stopping us from going to it.\n  There are all kinds of excuses they are using. The latest excuse is \nthey want the provision dealing with earmarks in this bill--the \namendment passed 98 to nothing--they want that set out separately. But \nthat is a ploy; it is a diversion. They do not want to go to the meat \nof this bill. They have blocked this now for weeks. The Senator from \nSouth Carolina, who was the last to come and block this important \nlegislation from going forward, I know thinks earmarks are important. I \ndo too. Earmark reform is important. But it is in this bill. Earmark \nreform is in it. It is hard to believe that his objection isn't \nanything more than a smokescreen to prevent us from making progress on \nthe rest of the bill.\n  Here are the facts: No one has any intention of taking out the \nearmark disclosure provisions in the bill. It is a fantasy. Second, \nSenate Democrats have already imposed earmark provisions through the \ncommittees. Right now, anyone with an Internet connection can go on \nline to the Senate Web site and find earmarks and earmark sponsors in \nappropriations bills that the press has reported. I repeat: Anyone who \ncan go on the Internet can find out what the earmarks are on any bill \nthat has been reported out of any one of our committees. Every \nsubcommittee that has reported a bill, an appropriations bill, has to \nhave that in it. And we are even doing it with authorizing committees.\n  Right here I have the appropriations bill which is for the Department \nof Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies for 2008. No secret. \nAll the earmarks are herein listed in detail--the amounts, the Senator \nsponsoring the earmark--and they have to sign a disclosure in addition \nto this that they have no financial interest in the earmark. It is \nhere. Every subcommittee in the appropriations process that has \nreported out a bill has the same information I have just presented to \nthe Senate.\n  So it is really hard to believe the earmark complaint is genuine. Let \nus remember all the other provisions in this bill the Senate \nRepublicans are blocking progress on--campaign expenses, campaign \ncontributions. As we have read in the press, they feel it is important \nthat we do something dealing with bundling. That is lobbyists who agree \nto raise money for Senators. There should be some disclosure of that. \nIn this bill we have it--the one they won't let us go to conference on. \nBans on gifts from lobbyists and corporations are in this bill. They \nhave prevented us from going to conference on that. No more corporate \njets.\n  One of the issues around here--and I don't think it was necessarily \ncorrupting anyone, but it was corrupting--flying these beautiful \ncorporate jets and paying first-class airfare, even though it cost 10 \ntimes that to fly on these airplanes. This is eliminated in our bill. \nBut we can't eliminate it because they won't let us go with it. They \nhave obstructed this.\n  The Abramoff situation, brought to the attention of the American \npeople, this is the culture of corruption the Republicans brought to \nWashington, DC, when they controlled the Congress. For the first time \nin 121 years, someone who works in the White House has been indicted. \nThat man has now been convicted, and his sentence has partially been \ncommuted by the President of the United States.\n  In the House of Representatives, the former majority leader of the \nHouse of Representatives, a Republican, was convicted three times of \nethics violations by the ethics committee. He was indicted twice in \nTexas. He still is under indictment. One Member of Congress is even \nserving time now as part of the Abramoff corruption program. Numerous \nstaff people are either in jail or under probation or now being \ninvestigated. The American people think we should improve the \nsituation, and we can do that with this legislation.\n  One of the problems the Abramoff program allowed was people flying \nall over the country. Let's go to Scotland and play golf, and then they \nflew on a corporate jet and played golf in Scotland. Under our \nlegislation, this would not be permitted. We significantly improve \ndisclosure of lobbying activities.\n  We also prevent stealth coalitions. What does that mean? It means \nthere is a company--I will pick this out of the air--Americans for \nHealth Care, and they run these ads. It is a stealth organization. It \nis a phony organization because it is paid for by, let's say the \npharmaceutical industry, someone who has an interest in the health care \nindustry. Pick any name you want. And if you look behind it, it is some \nlarge, usually multilevel corporation that is paying for this.\n  Our legislation would slow the revolving door by former Members of \nCongress. Our legislation would put an end to the pay-to-play K Street \nProject that was also part of the Republicans' culture of corruption.\n  The list goes on and on. They are stopping us from doing these \nthings. I don't want to file cloture in order to appoint conferees, but \nI will if I have to. We cannot let the Senate action on something so \nimportant be held up by the minority. It is wrong. They send one person \nout to do it, but this is reflective upon the Republicans. They do not \nwant us to complete this legislation, but we owe it to the American \npeople to get this bill completed. We need to restore the faith the \nAmerican people want to have in government. They want a government as \ngood and honest as the people it represents.\n  I appreciate very much indeed the Washington Post's writing an \neditorial saying this has to be done, and they said to me in that \neditorial, if they continue to stop us from going to conference, I \nshould make them filibuster so they have to come here and vote against \ncompleting ethics and lobbying reform.\n  Maybe the culture of corruption is something they want to maintain. \nMaybe they are still flying in corporate jets. Maybe they are still \ndoing some of the things we are trying to prevent. I don't know the \nreasons, but it appears very evident that they do not want us--they, \nthe Republicans--to complete this legislation, and that is too bad.\n  I repeat, the earmarking is a guise. Right now every committee \nreports out, under the Democratic leadership, the earmarks in detail. \nWe are complying with this legislation even though it is not law now. \nSo for someone to come here and say we are not going to allow the \nconference to go forward because we want earmarks to be separate and \napart from this is a guise. They are diverting attention from the work \nof the American people and this Congress.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be glad to answer a question of my distinguished \nfriend from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would say to the Senate majority leader \nthat this afternoon, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations \nfor Financial Services, we reported out of subcommittee a bill, and \nthat bill, page by page, specifies every earmark from\n\n[[Page S8936]]\n\nthe White House, earmarks for Members of the Senate, and goes into \ndetail as to each one and the specific name of the Senator or Senators \nrequesting them, which I think complies with everything that has been \nasked for by those who were asking for earmark reform.\n  So I would say to the Senator from Nevada that if the Senator on the \nRepublican side who has been objecting to our conference on this ethics \nbill would take some time to look at the appropriations bills, he would \nunderstand we have already accepted this reform. We already are making \nthis change.\n  I would ask the Senator from Nevada, the majority leader, right now, \nwhat is stopping us from going to conference to pass these changes in \nethics laws, these historic changes in ethics laws, so that once and \nfor all we can have the kind of reform and changes that are needed here \nin Washington?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, it is this. It is the Republicans who \nare stopping us from going to conference on this bill. They may send \none person out, and it could be a rotating person, but they are \nstopping us from going forward. The ploy of the day is they want to \ntake the work we have done in this bill dealing with earmarking out of \nthe bill and set it up as a Senate rule.\n  This is what conferences are all about. We want to do all these \nthings I have enumerated in this legislation. We want disclosure of \nbundling, bans on gifts from lobbyists and corporations, no more \ncorporate jets, major limits on privately paid travel, significantly \nimproved disclosure of lobbying activities, disclosure of stealth \ncoalitions, slow the revolving door of former Members of Congress, put \nan end to the pay-to-play K Street Project. That is what is being held \nup, and it is being held up by the Republicans.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for a further question, today \non this Defense authorization bill, while we are debating the war in \nIraq and good treatment for our soldiers, the Republican leader comes \nto the floor and insists they cannot bring up for a vote the amendment \nthat is pending by Senator Webb of Virginia even though you offered a \nRepublican amendment to be voted on at the same time. The Republican \nleader has said: No, we want to delay this. We want to delay this until \ntomorrow and then perhaps another 2 days beyond and to filibuster it \nduring that period of time.\n  It would seem there is a pattern emerging, a very clear pattern where \nit comes to the important business. Whether it is ethics reform or \nchanging the policy in Iraq, the Republican position is to stop the \nprocess, slow down the process, throw in every obstacle they can find.\n  I ask the majority leader if this pattern has been evidenced in terms \nof, for example, filibusters, delaying tactics on the part of the \nRepublicans?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, everything we have done for the past 7 \nmonths has been in spite of the roadblocks, the obstruction tactics the \nRepublicans have put up. We have done it in spite of that. We have to \nthis point 43 different cloture motions--43. We have never done that \nbefore, 43.\n  I say to my friend, on a Defense authorization bill--the bill that \ntakes care of our troops around the world, in Iraq and Afghanistan, and \nthe work we are doing with NATO forces, to get pay increases, get them \nthe right equipment, the right medical care--this is being held up.\n  I would also, in a way of response, ask my friend, what has happened \nin the past dealing with Defense authorization bills? Has there ever \nbeen anything like this that you can imagine?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the majority leader, for those who are trying to \nfollow this debate and are not familiar with a cloture motion, what a \ncloture motion means is that those who are opposing a vote on an issue \ndelay it as long as possible and then try to create a higher vote total \nthat you need to bring this amendment to passage or defeat. So it is a \ndelay tactic to slow down the Senate, slow down deliberation.\n  Today, when the Democratic majority leader offered to the Republicans \nthat we would call up Senator Webb's amendment to make sure our troops \nare rested and ready before they go into battle and allow Senator \nGraham, a Republican Senator, to have his similar amendment up at the \nsame time with the same vote, it was rejected. The Republicans rejected \nit. Then one of the Senators came to the floor and said that is the way \nit has always been around here. It has always been this way, this is \nnot unusual. It takes 60 votes to agree to these amendments. Now we \nknow what it is going to take.\n  We did a little research, I might say to the majority leader. We \nlooked at the last two Defense authorization bills which were called up \nand considered in this Senate. Not a single amendment required a \ncloture vote, required this delay tactic, required the 60-vote margin, \neven those amendments specifically relating to the war in Iraq. What \nthe Republican leadership is doing now has not happened in the last 2 \nyears on this same bill. They have come up with a new slowdown, a new \ndelay tactic, a new obstacle they have tossed in our path.\n  I think it is very clear. The Senator from Nevada will recall that \nthe last time the Defense authorization bill was up, there were two \nvery important amendments on the war on Iraq, one by Senator Kerry of \nMassachusetts and another by Senators Levin and Reed. Both related to \nwhen the troops would come home. In each instance, cloture was not \nnecessary, 60 votes were not required; the amendments were called on a \nsimple majority vote.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On Page S8936, July 10, 2007 the following appears: another by \nSenators Levin and Reid.\n  \n  The online version has been corrected to: another by Senators \nLevin and Reed.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  So I say to the Senator from Nevada, it is very clear, the strategy \nthe Republicans in the Senate are using. They are trying to avoid \nfacing the tough issues America wants us to face. We were sent here to \ndeal with cleaning up the mess in Washington, the culture of \ncorruption. We were sent here to deal with the war in Iraq. Instead, \nday in and day out, week in and week out, every month for 43 different \ntimes now they have tossed an obstacle in front of us to stop the \ndebate. The American people can see this, and today they can see it \nvery graphically.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate so much my friend from \nIllinois. I have such fond memories of our relationship. It seems now \nonly yesterday, but it was 25 years ago that the Senator from Illinois \nand I came to the House of Representatives together. We were elected in \nthe great class of 1982. At least I thought it was great, and I think, \nlooking back, we have had some good experiences. I appreciate very much \nhis laying out the facts.\n  The facts are that for Defense authorization bills, you should not \nhave to file cloture on amendments. My counterpart, my friend from \nKentucky, says this is the way we do business around here. That is not \nthe way we have done business around here. This is the way we do \nbusiness here because of the envy of the Republican minority, envious \nof our being in the majority, so they are making us jump through every \nprocedural hoop, they are obstructing everything we are trying to do.\n  It is hurting, not the Democrats. It is hurting the American people. \nI say--I want it spread on the record--in spite of all of the obstacles \nwe have had to jump through, we have been able to get things done. We \nhave had to do it. It has been hard. We have had to fight with the \nWhite House. We have been able to get minimum wage passed, we have been \nable to get funding for Katrina, we have been able to get funding for \nhomeland security, which we have never been able to do before, over the \nPresident's objections. We have been able to fund SCHIP through the \nfirst of the year, which was extremely difficult and hard to do. We \nhave been able to do some things for farmers and ranchers. We have been \nable to do some good things. Disaster relief, 3 years overdue--we were \nable to get that done. That money is now out helping those people who \ndesperately need it.\n  As I speak, all over the West, wildfires are burning. In Nevada, we \nhave had 245 square miles burn. A 100-mile stretch of freeway in Utah \nhas been shut down because of fires. We were able to get, over the \nPresident's objection, money for wildfires that burned last year and \nthe year before that we have been trying to get.\n  In spite of all the hurdles we have had to jump through, we have been \nable to accomplish things for the American people. But the shame of it \nis we could be doing so much more but for the obstructions continually \nthrown up in our path by this minority.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S8937]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Alexander\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor CPL \nMatthew L. Alexander, of Gretna, NE.\n  Corporal Alexander, age 21, was a recent graduate of Gretna High \nSchool. He married his high school sweetheart, Kara, on Valentine's Day \nthis year. He is remembered by all who knew him as someone who believed \ndeeply in what he fought for and someone who made it his life's work to \ncare for his loved ones. Kara recalls her husband as ``the most \ngracious man I knew. He was a loving husband, devoted son, caring \nbrother and the best friend you could ever ask for.''\n  Enlisting in the Army in the spring of 2004, Corporal Alexander was \nwell decorated with awards, including the Army Achievement Medal, \nNational Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, \nArmy Service Ribbon, and Expert Infantry Badge. He was stationed to A \nCompany, 5th Batallion, 20th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade, 2nd \nInfantry Division, based out of Fort Lewis, WA. He passed away on May \n6, 2007, in Baqubah, Iraq, due to injuries sustained from an improvised \nexplosive device detonated near his military vehicle. This was the \ncorporal's first deployment.\n  Corporal Alexander is survived by his wife Kara, his parents Melvin \nand Monica, and his brother Marshall, all of Gretna. I offer my sincere \ncondolences to CPL Matthew Alexander's family and friends. Our Nation \nwill remember Corporal Alexander as a true hero for his selflessness \nand his passion as he made the ultimate sacrifice for the good of our \nNation.\n\n\n          Chief Warrant Officer Three Christopher M. Allgaier\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor CWO3 Christopher M. Allgaier, of \nOmaha, NE.\n  Chief Warrant Officer Allgaier loved to fly. His father, Bob Allgaier \nof Omaha, said his son's love of flying arose in early childhood, as he \nwas ``always picking up little model airplanes and aviation books when \nhe was a kid.'' After graduating from Omaha Creighton Preparatory High \nSchool in 1991 with a 4.0 grade-point average, he studied aeronautical \nadministration. In 1995 after graduating from college, he joined the \nArmy to fly helicopters.\n  On May 30, 2007, while serving in support of Operation Enduring \nFreedom as a helicopter pilot with the 3rd Battalion, 82nd General \nSupport Aviation, 82nd Airborne Division, based at Fort Bragg, NC, \nChief Warrant Officer Allgaier passed away when his CH-47 Chinook \ntransport helicopter received rocket-propelled grenade and small arms \nfire and crashed. Four other soldiers were killed in this attack. \nAllgaier's deployment to Afghanistan in January was his second tour of \nduty in the country and came about a year after he returned from a \nmission flying helicopters in Iraq. He had also previously served in \nSouth Korea. He was 33 years old.\n  In addition to his father, Chief Warrant Officer Allgaier is survived \nby his wife Jennie and three daughters, Natalie, Gina, and Joanna, of \nSpring Lake, NC, and his sister Sharon, of Omaha.\n  I would like to offer my sincere condolences to the family and \nfriends of CWO3 Christopher Allgaier. His noble service to the United \nStates of America and his leadership are to be respected and \nappreciated by all. And while the loss of this remarkable Airman is \nfelt by all Nebraskans, his courage to follow his dreams will remain as \nan inspiration for his survivors.\n\n\n                   Specialist William Lee Bailey, III\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor Army National Guard SPC William \nLee Bailey, III, of Bellevue, NE.\n  A valued member of his community, Specialist Bailey served as a \nsoldier, a medical dispatcher, and a volunteer firefighter. As a \nfirefighter, he worked as a medical helicopter dispatcher in the \nmetropolitan area. As a soldier, he served with the Nebraska National \nGuard's 755th Chemical Company based in O'Neill, NE.\n  As part of this chemical company within the Army National Guard, \nSpecialist Bailey was involved in entering areas which may have been \nchemically infected and performing detection and evacuation in those \nareas. He was part of a group providing security convoys for Iraq; and \nhis unit had been trained to perform security missions, according to MG \nRoger Lempke, commander of the Nebraska National Guard.\n  Specialist Bailey is remembered as a kind and caring member of his \ncommunity and as someone who was eager for duty. He was a rugged \noutdoorsman who loved hunting, motorcycles, and firefighting, but loved \nhis wife ``Dee'' the most. His friend and colleague from the fire \ndepartment, Paul Prewitt, remarked, ``He loved his family and worked \nhard for them. He had a lot of integrity and was a real stand-up guy. \nHe would go out of his way for his friends. He will be missed.''\n  Specialist Bailey passed away in Taji, Iraq, on May 25, 2007, due to \ninjuries he sustained from an improvised explosive device. He had been \nserving in Operation Iraqi Freedom since November 2006 and was due for \nleave in June 2007. He was laid to rest with cherished firefighter \nfuneral traditions, complementing his full military honors. There were \nmore than 700 people in attendance at his funeral, including over 100 \nsoldiers. His funeral procession included 35 fire trucks, ambulances, \nand utility trucks representing at least 11 area departments.\n  Specialist Bailey's wife Deanna accepted on his behalf his Purple \nHeart, his Bronze Star, and his Army National Guard meritorious service \nmedal, in addition to other awards. His ``bunker'' gear--the fireproof \nclothing firefighters use as protection--was strapped to the rear of a \nfiretruck in the procession. His coat, pants, and boots faced forward--\nhis helmet, backward.\n  Specialist Bailey is survived by his wife Deanna; their five \nchildren, Cody, Maquala, Katlynn, Billy, and Logan; and his parents \nTerry and Margaret Denike, all of Bellevue. I offer my most sincere \ncondolences to the family and friends of SPC William Bailey. He will be \nremembered as a compassionate member of his community, who had a real \npassion for serving his country. His bravery will inspire future \ngenerations of Americans to live a life of service.\n\n\n                        Specialist David Behrle\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor Army SPC David Behrle of Tipton, \nIA.\n  Specialist Behrle attended Tipton High School where he was elected \nsenior class president and commencement speaker for the class of 2005. \nHe was an active participant in athletics and had made a point to visit \nhis school while he was on recent leave.\n  Teachers and coaches of Specialist Behrle describe him as a soft-\nspoken person who came prepared, asked questions, and worked hard in \nboth athletics and academics. His friends acknowledge his determination \nin succeeding in the Army, that it was something he felt he needed to \ndo.\n  While serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Specialist \nBehrle passed away on May 19, 2007, due to injuries he sustained when \nan improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle in Baghdad, \nIraq. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd \nBrigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, based at Fort Hood, TX.\n  Specialist Behrle is survived by his parents, Dixie Pelzer of Tipton, \nIA, and John Behrle, of Columbus, NE. He is the posthumous recipient of \nthe Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Good Conduct Medal, and the \nCombat Infantryman's Badge. Tipton High School retired his school \nfootball jersey, which carried the number 65.\n  I join all Americans today in grieving the loss of a great soldier. \nSPC David Behrle's bravery and selflessness will undoubtedly inspire \nfuture generations of Americans. The family and friends of Specialist \nBehrle are in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n[[Page S8938]]\n\n                        Specialist Val John Borm\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor Army SPC Val John Borm of \nSidney, NE.\n  Specialist Borm graduated from Sidney High School in 2005. In his \nfree time, his father Larry Borm says he liked to play computer games \nand was an avid paintball competitor. After graduating from high \nschool, Specialist Borm enlisted in the Army. He was serving as an \ninfantryman in B Company, 2nd Battalion with the 35th Infantry \nDivision, based at Fort Shafter, HI.\n  On Thursday, June 14, 2007, Specialist Borm passed away when a \nroadside bomb exploded near his vehicle during operations in Kirkuk \nprovince. Two other soldiers were killed, and one was injured in the \nsame attack. He was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star Medal, the \nPurple Heart, and other military honors. Specialist Borm was 21 years \nold.\n  In addition to his father, Specialist Borm is survived by his mother \nLolita and his sister Kimberly, both of Sidney. I offer my sincere \ncondolences to SPC Val John Borm's family. He made the ultimate and \nmost courageous sacrifice in the name of freedom and hope to defend \nliberty. Specialist Borm was a man of incredible bravery; he will be \nforever remembered as a hero who sacrificed everything for his fellow \ncountrymen and -women.\n\n\n                        Sergeant Adam G. Herold\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor Army SGT Adam G. Herold of \nOmaha, NE.\n  Sergeant Herold attended St. Cecilia Elementary and Omaha Roncalli \nHigh School.

He was 23 years \nold.\n  Sergeant Herold is survived by his parents, Lance and Debra Herold, \nand his brothers, Andy and Kyle Herold, all of Omaha. I offer my \nsincere condolences to the family and friends of SGT Adam Herold. He \nmade the ultimate and most courageous sacrifice for our nation. I join \nall Americans in grieving the loss of this remarkable young man and \nknow that Sergeant Herold's passion for serving, his leadership, and \nhis selflessness will remain a source of inspiration for us all.\n\n\n                      Specialist Josiah Hollopeter\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor SPC Josiah Hollopeter of \nValentine, NE.\n  Specialist Hollopeter was born in Ainsworth and grew up in the \nValentine area. He graduated from Valentine High School in 1998. Before \njoining the service, he worked construction jobs in Omaha, NE, and San \nDiego, CA. He also spent many summers working for a canoe outfitter \nalong Nebraska's Niobrara River. Driven by a desire to join other \ntroops fighting in Iraq after the September 11, 2001, terrorist \nattacks; to further his education; and to follow the example of his \nyounger brother's service, 1LT Tyler Hollopeter, as an Army helicopter \npilot in Iraq, Specialist Hollopeter enlisted in the Army in January \n2006. But simply joining the Army was not all Specialist Hollopeter \nwanted to achieve; he also strived to become an Army sniper. According \nto his father, Ken Hollopeter, of Valentine, his skill as a hunter \nlanded him on a sniper team. ``There's a 60 or 70 percent dropout rate \nin that program. It's a lot of emotional strength, the ability to \nconcentrate and focus on one goal; he'd accomplished most of that in \nlife,'' said his father.\n  Specialist Hollopeter completed basic training at Fort Knox, KY. He \nwas assigned to the 6th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment, 3rd Brigade \nCombat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, based in Fort Hood, TX. On Thursday, \nJune 14, 2007, while serving in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, \nSpecialist Hollopeter passed away in Balad after suffering wounds when \nhis four-man sniper team came under small-arms fire in al-Muqdadiyah. \nHe was 27 years old and had been serving in Iraq since October.\n  In addition to his father and brother, Specialist Hollopeter is \nsurvived by his wife, Heather Hollopeter, of Killeen, Texas; and his \nmother, Kelly Hollopeter, sister, Anna Hollopeter, and nephew, Kalen, \nall of Valentine.\n  I offer my sincere condolences to SPC Josiah Hollopeter's family and \nfriends. He gave his life to save and honor the liberties of America, \nand his selfless passion and relentless determination to achieve this \nend will not be forgotten. Specialist Hollopeter will be forever \nremembered as a hero who sacrificed everything for his fellow \ncountrymen and women.\n\n\n                 Staff Sergeant Kenneth E. Locker. Jr.\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor Army SSG Kenneth E. Locker, Jr., \nof Burwell, NE.\n  Staff Sergeant Locker enlisted for military service while he was \nstill in high school. His father remembers that serving ``was probably \nthe greatest joy in his life.'' He added that Locker viewed his \nmilitary service as part of his responsibility as a father to not only \nhis own children but to all children, remarking that ``I'm fighting for \nthe children, Dad--mine, yours, theirs, everybody's--that they may have \na safer world to grow up in.''\n  In January of this year, Locker made a trip back home after an injury \nhe sustained the prior year when his humvee was struck by a land mine. \nHis father remembered that during that visit, both he and his son felt \nit would be the last time they were together.\n  While serving with the 82nd Airborne Division, Staff Sergeant Locker \npassed away after a suicide bomb exploded on his base, northeast of \nBaghdad, on April 23, 2007. He was 28 years old.\n  Together with his father, Staff Sergeant Locker leaves behind three \nyoung sons, ages 7, 4, and 2; two sisters, a half-brother, and a half-\nsister. My sincere condolences go out to the family and friends of this \nbrave servicemember. I join our Nation in grieving the loss of a true \nNebraska hero and in celebrating his memory, his passion for service, \nhis commitment to our Nation's future, and his love of our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/10/senate-section/article/S8938-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  Early in the morning of June 2, 2007, in Lowell, MA, three men \nseverely beat 22-year-old James Nickola for being gay. Nickola, a \ntranssexual, was walking alone on his way home from a nightclub when \nthe three men began to follow him. When the men started to yell \nhomophobic epithets, Nickola says he quickened his pace, but the men \nwere able to catch up to him about 200 feet from a police substation. \nThe men then attacked, hitting Nickola repeatedly in the face, knocking \nhim down, and continuing to beat him. The assailants, whose attack \npartially severed Nickola's lip, allegedly continued to utter \nhomophobic slurs and told him, ``we don't want your kind in this \nneighborhood.''\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/10/senate-section/article/S8938-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8938-S8939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING CHARLES W. LINDBERG\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to remember a \nNorth Dakota hero who passed away last month.\n  About 3 miles straight west of this Senate Chamber lies the Iwo Jima \nmemorial. Its centerpiece is a statue of six men raising an American \nflag to\n\n[[Page S8939]]\n\nsymbolize the capture of Mount Suribachi and the ensuing U.S. military \nvictory at Iwo Jima.\n  On February 23, 1945, a 24-year-old marine from North Dakota named \nCharles W. Lindberg played a key role in the events immortalized by the \nIwo Jima memorial. On that day, he was part of the group that raised \nthe first American flag to fly over Japanese soil in the Second World \nWar. Many names from that war stand out in our memories: Normandy, \nMidway, the Battle of the Bulge. But perhaps none stands out like Iwo \nJima.\n  The battle for Iwo Jima was one of the fiercest of the entire war. \nThe American attack, planned to capture the two airfields on the island \nand provide a staging area for B-29 bombing runs on the Japanese home \nislands, was the first invasion of traditionally Japanese territory in \nthe war. Fighting on the island lasted over a month. Over 20,000 \nAmericans were injured and 6,825 more heroically made the ultimate \nsacrifice for their country.\n  And on Iwo Jima North Dakota's Marine Cpl. Charles Lindberg made his \nmark on history. The indelible image of the battle for Iwo Jima is of \nsix men raising an American flag atop the island. But those six men \nwere not the first group of men to claim Iwo Jima for the United \nStates. That honor belongs to a patrol that included Corporal Lindberg. \nThe distinction between the two was one he spent a lifetime explaining.\n  On February 23, Corporal Lindberg took his 72-pound flame-thrower to \nenemy pillboxes at the base of Mount Suribachi and set out for the top \nwith five other marines, an old pipe to be used as a flagpole, and the \nAmerican flag. They gained the summit and planted the flag. Lindberg \nrecalled that the flag's raising created such a commotion of cheers and \nwhistles that it brought the enemy back out. That threat drew Lindberg \nback to battle, and so he missed the raising of the second flag, which \nwas captured for history and recreated at the Iwo Jima memorial.\n  Lindberg won a Silver Star for his bravery that day, and a Purple \nHeart for the injury that led to his evacuation from the island less \nthan one week later. Thirty-six members of his 40-man patrol were \nkilled or wounded while fighting on Iwo Jima, which would rage for a \nfull month after the flag-raising. Lindberg was fortunate enough to \nreturn home, to marry, and to live out a somewhat quieter life as an \nelectrician.\n  On June 24, at the age of 83, he passed away. He was the last \nsurviving member of the group of heroes who had the honor of raising \nthe first American flag to fly over Japanese territory.\n  What is it that makes a young man from a simple town like Grand \nForks, ND, risk his life the way Corporal Lindberg did on Iwo Jima? Was \nit the fight for freedom and liberty? Was it his patriotism and his \nlove of country? Was it his bravery and courage? Perhaps it was all \nthose things. In fact, I would say that the story of Charles Lindberg \npresents the best of all that is American. Duty. Honor. Bravery. \nSacrifice. I am proud to say that Corporal Lindberg comes from my home \nState of North Dakota. I am proud to call Corporal Lindberg an \nAmerican.\n  Lindberg's passing serves as a reminder to be thankful for the heroic \nservice of all those who answered the call to serve our country. The \nservice of the millions of young men called to duty in World War II--\nand in all of our nation's wars--can never be forgotten. We are all \ntouched in some way by heroes like Charles Lindberg, whether they are \nour family members, our loved ones, or our neighbors. Let us always \nremember the debt we owe these heroes, and always cherish the freedom \nthey successfully fought to preserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/10/senate-section/article/S8939-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL WAYNE BUTLER\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to retired \nColonel Michael Wayne Butler. On June 12, 2007, South Carolina lost a \ntrue patriot when Colonel Butler was killed while working for a \ncontractor near Tikrit, Iraq. He is survived by his wife Joanne, sons \nMike and Daniel, and grandson Da'Kori.\n  Colonel Butler's career in the Air Force began when he graduated from \nthe U.S. Air Academy in 1976. Upon graduation, Colonel Butler was \ncommissioned an aircraft maintenance officer. Colonel Butler's career \nin the Air Force was nothing less than distinguished. He had the \nopportunity to command the 50th Component Repair Squadron at Hahn AB, \nGermany, and later the 39th Logistics Group at Incirlik AB, Turkey. In \nmany ways, Colonel Butler's final tour was one of his most complicated \nones. Responsible for developing contingency plans and conducting air \noperations in a 25-nation area of responsibility covering a large swath \nof the globe, Colonel Butler served as CENTAF Director of Logistics at \nShaw AFB in South Carolina. After 30 years of distinguished military \nservice, earning a Bronze Star, a Meritorious Service Medal with six \noak leaf clusters, and an Air Force Commendation Medal, Colonel Butler \ntook a much deserved retirement from the Air Force in 2006.\n  Continuing his love of travel, Colonel Butler trekked around the \nworld with his wife after retiring. Though Colonel Butler would soon be \npursuing a new calling, the Butlers established a home in Rembert, SC. \nIn December of 2006, Colonel Butler joined DynCorp International to be \nthe senior deputy program manager for CIVPOL. His new occupation sent \nhim to Iraq. Colonel Butler's experience in the region and his \ndedication to the cause of freedom was surely an asset in his new \nduties. On his final mission to advance our cause in Iraq, Colonel \nButler was transporting prisoners in a five-vehicle convoy with the \nU.S. military and Iraqi police when his vehicle was hit by an IED and \nsmall arms fire. Colonel Butler and one American soldier lost their \nlives.\n  Colonel Butler's love of life extended beyond the battlefield. An \navid runner, Colonel Butler competed in and completed the Marine Corps \nMarathon. Completing the marathon once is quite an accomplishment, but \nColonel Butler embraced the challenge of the marathon and completed it \nmultiple times. I was moved to hear that his family will run the \nmarathon in Colonel Butler's absence this year.\n  Colonel Butler will be buried at Arlington Cemetery on August 22 with \nfull honors. As he departs on his final mission, his memory and legacy \nwill not fade from the hearts and minds of all of the people he came \nacross in his life. He will be missed but this Nation will never \nforget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/10/senate-section/article/S8939-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8939-S8940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n                        2006 SLOAN AWARD WINNERS\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the \n101st anniversary of Follansbee, WV--a great community with great \npeople and an important part of our State.\n  Follansbee is a town whose legacy was forged in steel. Its 3,000 \nresidents are descendants of history and carry with them a proud \ntradition of tenacity and pride. While Follansbee sits in the northern \npanhandle of West Virginia, squeezed between Ohio and Pennsylvania on \nthe banks of the Ohio River, it plays an integral role in West \nVirginia's economy.\n  Follansbee Steel was the first company to locate in this small Brooke \nCounty town, joining steel makers throughout the Ohio River Valley in \nfiring the industrial revolution and feeding the Nation's voracious \nappetite for steel as it grew. Follansbee Steel's state-of-the-art \nroofing products also appeared in the early 19th century and played a \nmajor role in post-Civil War Reconstruction. Later, these materials \nbecame the products of choice for Frank Lloyd Wright, one of the \nworld's most prominent architects.\n  In fact, when brothers John and Robert Follansbee bought the steel \nmill near the turn of the 20th century, not only did they rename the \nmill, they were the catalyst for forming what is now the city of \nFollansbee. Before that anyone traveling north of Wellsburg along the \nriver would refer to Mahan's Junction--the name of the owners of the \nlarge orchard formerly on the site of Follansbee.\n  On this day, the 101st anniversary of its founding, it is appropriate \nto look to the future which, I am happy to note, looks bright for \nFollansbee, WV. As the years have passed, the tradition of Follansbee \nSteel remains through the town's reservoir of high-quality labor. \nWheeling-Pittsburgh Steel, a successor of Follansbee Steel, continues \nto run one of the busiest coke plants in the country, feeding both its \nblast furnace and its electric arc furnace, while Wheeling-Nisshin is \nnow one of the largest hot-dip coating mills in the world.\n  Wheeling Nisshin came to West Virginia in the early 1980s as our very \nfirst Japanese business. Since that time we have seen Japanese \ncompanies embrace West Virginia throughout the State. This joint \nventure between a Japanese steel company and Wheeling Pitt was years \nahead of its time, taking advantage of the increasing globalization of \nthe steel industry and using it to West Virginia's advantage.\n  With its large industry and its small businesses and local \nprofessionals, Follansbee is just the type of small American town we \nthink of and in which we take pride. It is a community with strong \nroots and a tremendous sense of local pride. Each summer its residents \ngather for Follansbee Community Days, bringing residents, their \nfamilies, and former residents together from far and wide to celebrate \ntheir shared sense of community.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in \nmarking this 101st anniversary of the founding of Follansbee. The \nlegacy of that town is long, its history rich--but it is the service it \nhas provided the country that will be felt for a long, long time.\n\n[[Page S8941]]\n\nTo mayor Tony Paesano and the people of Follansbee, may the next 101 \nyears be as successful and peaceful as the first.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/10/senate-section/article/S8941-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8941-S8943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-2433.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 1755. A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct to make permanent the summer food service pilot project for rural \nareas of Pennsylvania and apply the program to rural areas of every \nState; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Summer Food \nService Rural Expansion Act. This bill will provide critical meals to \nchildren living in poverty in rural areas. I am pleased to introduce \nthis bill with Senator Specter. Congressman Platts is introducing \ncompanion legislation in the House of Representatives.\n  During the summer, low-income children lose their access to regular \ndaily school meals. The Summer Food Service Program is intended to help \nfill this nutritional gap by providing summer meals to children from \nlow-income families who receive school meals.\n  For those of my colleagues who do not know much about the Summer Food \nService Program, it was authorized through the National School Lunch \nAct of 1968. The program allows the U.S. Department of Agriculture to \nprovide grants to nonprofit food service programs that in turn provide \nmeals for children from low-income families through sites such as \nnonprofit schools, local governments, and nonprofit summer camps. Yet, \ndespite the best efforts of this program, only 2 in 10 low-income \nchildren who receive school lunch also receive summer food when school \nis out. So where do these children get food? Sadly, the answer is that \nmany of them go hungry.\n  Traditionally, the majority of sponsors and sites participating in \nthe Summer Food Service Program have tended to be located in urban \nareas. As we know, however, hunger is not just an urban issue. Thanks \nto the tremendous effort by Congressman Platts, the Child Nutrition Act \nof 2004 recognized the void of such programs in predominantly rural \nareas and established a 2-year pilot program to increase participation \nrates in rural communities.\n  The existing Summer Food Service Program is available to areas in \nwhich at least 50 percent of the children are eligible for free or \nreduced price school meals. However, to encourage more sponsors and \nmore sites to participate in the program, the pilot allowed that \nthreshold to be reduced to 40 percent in rural communities.\n  The pilot, which ran in my home state during calendar years 2005 and \n2006, was a tremendous success. During the first year of the pilot \nprogram, 20 sponsors offered 40 meal sites in rural areas. Of the \nsponsors, 8 were new sponsors of the program and 12 were sponsors in \nthe prior years who added meal sites. During the first year of the \nprogram, the total numbers of meals served in rural communities \nincreased by 73,000 meals, or 11 percent over the previous year. By the \nsecond year, there were 9 new sponsors, 16 returning sponsors, and 77 \npilot sites; and the number of meals served increased over the previous \nyear by an additional 4.3 percent, or 31,000 meals.\n  Unfortunately, because of the expiration of the pilot program, 37 of \nthe sites established under the pilot will not be able to participate \nthis summer. That means nearly half of the children who participated in \nthis program over the past 2 years will no longer be able to count on \nreceiving nutritious meals during the summer months.\n  For this reason, I am introducing legislation to help not only the \nchildren of Pennsylvania, but also the needy children in rural areas of \nevery single State who deserve access to nutritious lunches during the \nsummer months.\n  Through this bill, the Summer Food Service Pilot Program for rural \nareas would become a permanent program and would apply to rural areas \nof every State beginning in calendar year 2007 and each calendar year \nthereafter. Through this bill, the numbers of children participating in \nthe program will dramatically increase, and needy children in rural \nareas throughout the country will receive nutritious meals they might \nnot otherwise get during the summer months.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join in the effort to combat childhood \nhunger in rural areas by cosponsoring the Summer Food Service Rural \nExpansion Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1755\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Summer Food Service Rural \n     Expansion Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SUMMER FOOD SERVICE PILOT PROGRAM FOR RURAL AREAS OF \n                   PENNSYLVANIA MADE PERMANENT AND APPLIED TO \n                   RURAL AREAS OF EVERY STATE.\n\n       Section 13(a)(9) of the Richard B. Russell National School \n     Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1761(a)(9)) is amended--\n       (1) in the paragraph heading by striking ``Exemption'' and \n     inserting ``Applicability to rural areas''; and\n       (2) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``For each of calendar \n     years 2005 and 2006 in rural areas of the State of \n     Pennsylvania'' and inserting ``For calendar year 2007 and \n     each calendar year thereafter, in rural areas of a State''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Akaka, and Ms. \n        Murkowski) (by request):\n  S. 1756. A bill to provide supplemental ex gratia compensation to the \nRepublic of the Marshall Islands for impacts of the nuclear testing \nprogram of the United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce the \nRepublic of the Marshall Islands Supplemental Nuclear Compensation Act \nat the request of the President of the Republic of the Marshall \nIslands, the Honorable Kessai Note. For over 50 years, the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources, and its predecessor committees, have \nworked with the government of the Marshall Islands to respond to the \ntragic consequences of the U.S. nuclear weapons tests that were \nconducted in the islands from 1946 to 1958, when the islands were a \ndistrict of the U.S.-administered, U.N. Trust Territory of the Pacific \nIslands.\n  The U.S. nuclear testing program raises powerful emotions, and \ndifficult legal and political issues which complicate discussion. Of \nparticular concern to some is that the question of the adequacy of the \ncompensation paid by the U.S. is now before the U.S. Court of Claims. \nOn May 10, I met with President Note during his trip to Washington and \nwe discussed our shared desire to move forward on several issues. We \nagreed that is it important for our nations to continue to work \ntogether on other matters which are not in litigation, such as possible \nadjustments to programs that are important to the communities affected \nby the tests.\n  I compliment President Note for his leadership, and for his \nthoughtful recommendation on how to approach these sensitive issues. \nThe President proposed the introduction of legislation, at his request, \nthat would propose solutions on several issues that are not before the \ncourt. This would allow the\n\n[[Page S8947]]\n\ncommittee to hear formally from the administration and from the RMI \ngovernment on whether the proposals should be adopted, or whether to \nconsider alternatives. I concur in this approach along with several of \nmy colleagues on the committee and we are committed to working with the \nRMI and the administration to seek agreement.\n  It is important to note that any further compensation provided by the \nU.S. under this act would be made on an ex gratia basis. U.S. \nadministration of the RMI ended in 1986 when the RMI gained sovereign \nself-government pursuant to the Compact of Free Association, as \napproved by the Compact Act, P.L. 99-239. The compact provides two \nmethods of compensation, under the legal settlement and under an \nauthorization for ex gratia assistance. Section 177 of the compact \napproved a legal settlement which provided: a $150 million Nuclear \nClaims Trust Fund; the establishment of the Nuclear Claims Tribunal to \nadjudicate claims and pay awards; and it allows the RMI to request \nadditional compensation if there are ``changed circumstances,'' that \nis, if information and injuries come to light after the settlement date \nwhich renders compensation under the settlement inadequate. Congress \nalso included an authorization, under subsection 105(c) of the Compact \nAct, for additional ex gratia compensation to the communities of the \nnorthern atolls of Bikini, Enewetak, Rongelap and Utrik, and for \nsupplemental health care.\n  In 2000, the RMI submitted a petition to Congress contending that \nthere have been ``changed circumstances'' and requesting some $3 \nbillion for payment of the Tribunal's personal injury awards, \nreplenishment of the Trust Fund, payment of the Tribunal's property \ndamage awards, funding for national health care infrastructure and \noperations, and monitoring of Runit Island in Enewetak Atoll by a U.S. \nagency.\n  In 2005, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing \non the petition, S. Hrg. 109-178, and the administration testified in \nopposition to additional compensation on the basis that the requests \ndid not meet the necessary legal tests: that injuries or damage must be \na result of the nuclear tests; that they have arisen or been discovered \nafter the effective date of the settlement; and that they could not \nreasonably have been identified as of the effective date of the \nsettlement. The administration and other witnesses also questioned the \nRMI's contention that radiation affected an area beyond the four \nnorthern atolls of the Marshall Islands, and questioned the policies \nand methodologies used by the Tribunal in determining eligibility for \ncompensation and the amount of awards. Nevertheless, the report by the \nadministration on the RMI petition noted that, while certain requests \ndo not qualify as changed circumstances, ``such programs might be \ndesirable''.\n  The legislation being introduced today has provisions regarding four \nsuch requests for assistance that I agree with President Note should be \ngiven consideration by the Congress.\n  Runit Island: Between 1977 and 1980, the U.S. conducted a cleanup of \nsome of the contaminated areas of Enewetak Atoll where 43 tests were \nconducted. Some of the contaminated soil and debris was relocated to \nRunit Island, mixed with concrete, and placed in Cactus crater that had \nbeen formed by one of the tests. Under the compact's nuclear claims \nsettlement, the Marshall Islands accepted full legal responsibility \nfor, and control over the utilization of areas in the Marshall Islands \naffected by the testing. In addition, however, the 1986 Compact Act, \nP.L. 99-239, reaffirmed the 1980 authorization, under P.L. 96-205, for \na program now operated by the U.S. Department of Energy, DOE, for \nmedical care and environmental monitoring relating to the testing \nprogram. Since then, the people of Enewetak Atoll have from time-to-\ntime asked DOE to include monitoring of conditions at Runit within the \nscope of DOE's environmental monitoring program in order to assure the \npeople living on other islands in Enewetak Atoll that there is no \nhealth risk from the material at Runit. DOE's whole body measurements \nof people living in the atoll shows that there is no increased risk and \nDOE has indicated that additional surveys should be carefully \nconsidered by Congress. Section 2 of this act would direct the \nSecretary of Energy, as a part of the existing monitoring program, to \nperiodically survey radiological conditions regarding Runit and report \nto the Congress.\n  Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program, EEOICPA: \nThis program was enacted in 2001 to provide compensation for DOE and \ncontractor employees associated with the Nation's nuclear weapons \nprogram. During Senate debate, I submitted a list of facilities \nintended to be covered which included ``Marshall Islands Test Sites, \nbut only for the period after December 31, 1958.'' However, the 75 \nMarshall Islands citizens who applied to the program were denied on the \nbasis that Congress did not intend the law to cover those who were not \nU.S. citizens. I believe that this was an incorrect reading of \nCongressional intent and I can find nothing in the statute or \nlegislative history that supports this conclusion. It is important to \nrecognize that during the testing and clean-up period the Marshall \nIslands was a district of the U.S.-administered, U.N. Trust Territory \nof the Pacific Islands, and that the U.S. and its contractors employed \nworkers from the Marshall Islands and from neighboring Districts in the \nTrust Territory.\n  Section 3 of this act would clarify that former Trust Territory \ncitizens are eligible, and it would coordinate benefits with the \nCompact of Free Association so that if a person received compensation \nunder the compact, that amount would be deducted from any award \nreceived under the EEOICPA.\n  Four Atoll Health Care Program: Section 177 of the Compact approved \nthe legal settlement of claims resulting from the nuclear testing \nprogram and provided $150 million to capitalize the Trust Fund. Among \nthe uses for these funds was an allocation of $2 million annually to \nprovide health care for those communities most affected by the tests: \nEnewetak, Bikini, Rongelap and Utrik. However, practical problems \ndeveloped with the program. First, enrollment was expanded beyond those \nmembers of the communities who were likely to have been exposed to \nradiation, so that the funds available for each beneficiary was \nsignificantly reduced. Second, the Fund became depleted and the $2 \nmillion annual payment was terminated in 2003. To continue some level \nof service under the program, the RMI and the U.S. Congress continued \nto contribute funds on a discretionary basis until a longer-term \nsolution could be developed. During a trip to the RMI in the summer of \n2006, Senate staff met with officials of the RMI Ministry of Health and \nof the 177 Healthcare Program and outlined a possible new approach for \nsupplemental health care. Instead of providing benefits to a pool of \nenrolled beneficiaries, the funding would be targeted geographically to \nsupport a primary care clinic in each of the affected communities. This \napproach has the advantage of assuring primary health care in these \nremote outer island communities and of avoiding the problem of over-\nsubscription of the program in the urban centers where hospital \nfacilities are available.\n  Section 4 of the bill would authorize $2 million annually through \n2023 for the continuation of this approach of supporting health care \nclinics in the outer island communities most affected by the tests. I \nbelieve that this proposal is an appropriate place to continue the \ndiscussion with the RMI and U.S. officials on how supplemental health \ncare assistance to the RMI could most effectively be used in the future \nto meet the needs of affected communities.\n  Impact Assessment: Underlying the debate between the U.S. and the RMI \nregarding compensation for injuries resulting from the testing program \nis a fundamental dispute over the extent of the affected area. The U.S. \nbelieves that the effects were practically limited to the four northern \natolls of Rongelap, Utrik, Bikini, and Enewetak. However, the RMI and \nthe Nuclear Claims Tribunal took the position that all 1958 residents \nof the RMI would be eligible to file claims for injuries resulting from \nthe tests. Section 5 of the bill is intended to resolve this dispute by \nhaving the National Academy of Sciences conduct an assessment of the \nhealth impacts of the testing program.\n\n[[Page S8948]]\n\n  It is my intention to hold a hearing on the bill later this year. I \nlook forward to continuing to work with President Note, my colleagues, \nand the administration on these proposals to respond, in part, to the \nlegacy of our Nation's nuclear testing program in the Islands.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1756\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to help \nindividuals with functional impairments and their families pay for \nservices and supports that they need to maximize their functionality \nand independence and have choices about community participation, \neducation, and employment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Community \nLiving Assistance Services and Supports Act, the CLASS Act. This \nimportant piece of legislation builds on the promise and possibilities \nof the Americans with Disabilities Act by helping the large numbers of \nAmericans who struggle every day to live productive lives in their \ncommunities.\n  Too many Americans are perfectly capable of living a life in the \ncommunity, but are denied the supports they need.\n  They languish in needless circumstances with no choice about how or \nwhere to obtain these services.\n  Too often, they have to give up the American Dream, the dignity of a \njob, a home, and a family, so they can qualify for Medicaid, the only \nprogram that will support them.\n  The bill we propose is a long overdue effort to offer greater \ndignity, greater hope, and greater opportunity.\n  It makes a simple pact with all Americans--``If you work hard and \ncontribute, society will take care of you when you fall on hard \ntimes.''\n  The concept is clear, everyone can contribute and everyone can win. \nWe all benefit when no one is left behind.\n  For only $30 a month, a person who pays into the program will receive \neither $50 or $100 a day, based on their ability to carry out basic \ndaily activities.\n  They themselves will decide how this assistance will be spent, on \ntransportation so they can stay employed, or on a ramp to make their \nhome more accessible, or to cover the cost of a personal care attendant \nor a family caregiver.\n  It will help keep families together, instead of being torn apart by \nobstacles that discourage them from staying at home.\n  The bill will strengthen job opportunities for people with \ndisabilities at a time when 70 percent are unemployed. They have so \nmuch to contribute and the bill will help them do it.\n  It will save on the mushrooming health care costs for Medicaid, the \nNation's primary insurer of long-term care services, which also forces \nbeneficiaries to give up their jobs and live in poverty before they \nbecome eligible for assistance.\n  The CLASS Act is a hopeful new approach to restoring independence and \nchoice for millions of these persons and enabling them to take greater \ncontrol of their lives.\n  It is time to respect the rights and dignity of all Americans, and I \nlook\n\n[[Page S8949]]\n\nforward to working with my colleagues to see this bill enacted into \nlaw.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/10/senate-section/article/S8949-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 266--MAKING MINORITY PARTY APPOINTMENTS FOR THE 110TH \n                                CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Iraq Study Group \n     Recommendations Implementation Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 1542. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On March 15, 2006, the Iraq Study Group was created at \n     the request of a bipartisan group of members of Congress.\n       (2) The United States Institute of Peace was designated as \n     the facilitating organization for the Iraq Study Group with \n     the support of the Center for the Study of the Presidency, \n     the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and the \n     James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice \n     University.\n       (3) The Iraq Study Group was composed of a bipartisan group \n     of senior individuals who have had distinguished careers in \n     public service. The Group was co-chaired by former Secretary \n     of State James A. Baker, III and former chairman of the House \n     Foreign Affairs Committee Lee H. Hamilton, and the other \n     members were former Secretary of State Lawrence S. \n     Eagleburger; Vernon E. Jordan, Jr, the Senior Managing \n     Director of Lazard, Freres and Company; former Attorney \n     General Edwin Meese III; former Supreme Court Associate \n     Justice Sandra Day O'Connor; former White House Chief of \n     Staff Leon E. Panetta; former Secretary of Defense William J. \n     Perry; United States Senator Charles S. Robb; and United \n     States Senator Alan K. Simpson.\n       (4) On June 15, 2006, President George W. Bush signed into \n     law the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for \n     Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Hurricane Recovery, \n     2006 (Public Law 109-234), which provided $1,000,000 to the \n     United States Institute of Peace for activities in support of \n     the Iraq Study Group.\n       (5) The Iraq Study Group consulted nearly 200 leading \n     officials and experts, including the senior members of the \n     Government of Iraq, the United States Government, and key \n     coalition partners and received advice from more than 50 \n     distinguished scholars and experts from a variety of fields \n     who conducted working groups in the areas of economy and \n     reconstruction, military and security, political development, \n     and the strategic environment in Iraq and the Middle East.\n       (6) While the Iraq Study Group recommended shifting the \n     primary mission of United States military forces in Iraq from \n     combat to training, and while the Iraq Study Group described \n     actions and conditions that could allow for a redeployment of \n     troops not necessary for force protection out of Iraq by the \n     first quarter of 2008, the Iraq Study Group did not set a \n     fixed timetable for withdrawal and said it could support a \n     short-term redeployment of United States combat forces, \n     complemented by comprehensive political, economic, and \n     diplomatic efforts, to stabilize Baghdad or to speed up the \n     mission of training and equipping Iraqis if the United States \n     commander in Iraq determines that such steps would be \n     effective.\n       (7) The report of the Iraq Study Group includes a letter \n     from the co-chairs of the Iraq Study Group, James A. Baker, \n     III and Lee H. Hamilton, which states, ``Our political \n     leaders must build a bipartisan approach to bring a \n     responsible conclusion to what is now a lengthy and costly \n     war. Our country deserves a debate that prizes substance over \n     rhetoric, and a policy that is adequately funded and \n     sustainable. The President and Congress must work together. \n     Our leaders must be candid and forthright with the American \n     people in order to win their support.''\n       (8) The Republicans and Democrats who comprised the Iraq \n     Study Group reached compromise and consensus and unanimously \n     concluded that their recommendations offer a new way forward \n     for the United States in Iraq and the region, and are \n     comprehensive and need to be implemented in a coordinated \n     fashion.\n\n     SEC. 1543. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF IRAQ STUDY \n                   GROUP RECOMMENDATIONS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the President and Congress \n     should agree that the way forward in Iraq is to implement the \n     comprehensive set of recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, \n     particularly those specifically described in this Act, and \n     the President should formulate a comprehensive plan to do so.\n\n[[Page S8962]]\n\n     SEC. 1544. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS IN IRAQ.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that, consistent with the \n     recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, the United States \n     Government should--\n       (1) establish a ``New Diplomatic Offensive'' to deal with \n     the problems of Iraq and of the region;\n       (2) support the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq;\n       (3) encourage other countries in the region to stop the \n     destabilizing interventions and actions of Iraq's neighbors;\n       (4) secure the borders of Iraq, including through the use \n     of joint patrols with neighboring countries;\n       (5) prevent the expansion of the instability and conflict \n     beyond the borders of Iraq;\n       (6) promote economic assistance, commerce, trade, political \n     support, and, if possible, military assistance for the \n     Government of Iraq from non-neighboring Muslim nations;\n       (7) energize the governments of other countries to support \n     national political reconciliation in Iraq;\n       (8) encourage the governments of other countries to \n     validate the legitimate sovereignty of Iraq by resuming \n     diplomatic relations, where appropriate, and reestablishing \n     embassies in Baghdad;\n       (9) assist the Government of Iraq in establishing active \n     working embassies in key capitals in the region;\n       (10) help the Government of Iraq reach a mutually \n     acceptable agreement on the future of Kirkuk;\n       (11) assist the Government of Iraq in achieving certain \n     security, political, and economic milestones, including \n     better performance on issues such as national reconciliation, \n     equitable distribution of oil revenues, and the dismantling \n     of militias;\n       (12) encourage the holding of a meeting or conference in \n     Baghdad, supported by the United States and the Government of \n     Iraq, of the Organization of the Islamic Conference or the \n     Arab League, both to assist the Government of Iraq in \n     promoting national reconciliation in Iraq and to reestablish \n     their diplomatic presence in Iraq;\n       (13) seek the creation of the Iraq International Support \n     Group to assist Iraq in ways the Government of Iraq would \n     desire, attempting to strengthen Iraq's sovereignty;\n       (14) engage directly with the Governments of Iran and Syria \n     in order to obtain their commitment to constructive policies \n     toward Iraq and other regional issues;\n       (15) provide additional political, economic, and military \n     support for Afghanistan including resources that might become \n     available as United States combat forces are redeployed from \n     Iraq;\n       (16) remain in contact with the Iraqi leadership, conveying \n     the clear message that there must be action by the Government \n     of Iraq to make substantial progress toward the achievement \n     of the milestones described in section 1551, and conveying in \n     as much detail as possible the substance of these exchanges \n     in order to keep the American people, the Iraqi people, and \n     the people of countries in the region well informed of \n     progress in these areas;\n       (17) make clear the willingness of the United States \n     Government to continue training, assistance, and support for \n     Iraq's security forces, and to continue political, military, \n     and economic support for the Government of Iraq until Iraq \n     becomes more capable of governing, defending, and sustaining \n     itself;\n       (18) make clear that, should the Government of Iraq not \n     make substantial progress toward the achievement of the \n     milestones described in section 1551, the United States shall \n     reduce its political, military, or economic support for the \n     Government of Iraq;\n       (19) make clear that the United States Government does not \n     seek to establish permanent military bases in Iraq;\n       (20) restate that the United States Government does not \n     seek to control the oil resources of Iraq;\n       (21) make active efforts to engage all parties in Iraq, \n     with the exception of al Qaeda;\n       (22) encourage dialogue between sectarian communities and \n     press religious leaders inside and outside of Iraq to speak \n     out on behalf of peace and reconciliation;\n       (23) support the presence of neutral international experts \n     as advisors to the Government of Iraq on the processes of \n     disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of militias \n     and other armed groups not under the control of the \n     Government of Iraq; and\n       (24) ensure that reconstruction efforts in Iraq consist of \n     great involvement by and with international partners that \n     actively participate in the design and construction of \n     projects.\n\n     SEC. 1545.
