Mr. President, I rise this morning to recognize the \nReverend Elliot Foss, who is our guest Chaplain this morning. Reverend \nFoss is quite a unique individual. He is currently the national \nchaplain of the American Legion. He was appointed by Commander Martin \nConaster on August 30, 2007, to that position.\n  Reverend Foss is a retired U.S. Navy command master chief and \nhospital corpsman, having served in the Submarine Service. He served in \nthe Navy during Vietnam and through the Persian Gulf war.\n  He attended Candler Seminary and School of Ministry at Emory \nUniversity in Atlanta, GA. He served as a pastor in the States of \nMaine, Virginia, Connecticut, Florida, and Georgia.\n  He currently resides in Kingsland, GA, with his wife Arlene. He is an \nordained Southern Baptist minister. He is a member of American Legion \nPost 317 in the coastal area of Georgia, where he serves as post \ncommander. He also has served as the Eighth District vice commander and \nas Post 9 commander in Brunswick, GA. He has served as the American \nLegion Department of Georgia chaplain for the past 7 years.\n  I think in this difficult time our country is faced with right now, \nwhere we all are very cognizant of the fact that we have a number of \nmen and women in harm's way as well as a number of veterans who have \nserved our country so valiantly in the past, it is\n\n[[Page S2254]]\n\nvery appropriate that we have the current chaplain of the American \nLegion in this great country of ours to stand before us and ask for \nblessings upon all Members of this body as well as the other leadership \nfrom a civilian standpoint as well as a military standpoint.\n  Reverend Foss is a terrific individual. I happened to be with him \nlast week in Kings Bay, GA, which is the home of a submarine fleet. We \nhad the USS Georgia, which is a converted nuclear submarine, return to \nKings Bay, where it is going to be stationed now. We had a very great \nceremony on Friday of last week at Kings Bay, and Reverend Foss was \nvery much involved in the planning for that ceremony.\n  So I say to him, thanks for coming and for extending that great \nblessing to us, and congratulations on serving as the national chaplain \nof the American Legion.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2254-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2254-S2256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HOUSING CRISIS\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as I think we all know, far too many \nfamilies in America are seeing the American dream of owning their own \nhome slip away.\n  Over the Easter break, I toured the State of Missouri. In every \ncommunity around the State I met with people who are struggling under \nthe threat of foreclosure, neighborhood groups concerned about the \nimpact of foreclosure on their families and on their communities, \nmayors, city council leaders who are seeing their communities \nthreatened seriously by this spate of subprime foreclosures, and most \nof all mothers and fathers with children who are facing the loss of \ntheir home.\n  I did not talk with speculators, investors, or the folks on Wall \nStreet, but the people I talked to did have a number of thoughts--\nthoughts they believe would help them keep the promise of keeping their \nhome. They did not want a Federal bailout. But they were looking for \nways to make the system work for them.\n\n  Some of the suggestions they made were at the macro level and, among \nothers, they said there ought to be regulation--probably Federal \nregulation--of those who originate mortgages. Now, many of the bricks-\nand-mortar lending institutions--banks, and savings and loans in the \ncommunity--are regulated, but there are many mortgages, subprime \nmortgages, that were sold over the Internet and by fax. Whenever I go \nhome, my fax machine is filled with 1 percent mortgage teaser rates.\n  They also want to see HUD be able to move more quickly in getting the \nFHA secured loans. That is a good idea--to go in and to help homeowners \nwhose mortgages have reset and caused them to lose their homes--but it \nis too narrow. They think that ought to be reformed.\n  I believe that through FHA, we, as taxpayers, should not be put at \nrisk by insuring loans where there is zero downpayment. Regrettably, \nzero downpayment too often means the homeowner can't afford that \nmortgage and they walk away. The often cited program, the Nehemiah \nProgram, which provides charitable contributions to take care of the \ndownpayment requirements, has an appalling 30 percent default rate. \nThat is a raid on the Federal Treasury. We ought not to be doing that. \nBefore people make a loan, they ought to have counseling and education \nto make sure their finances, their income will support the mortgage \npayments.\n  Also, when you buy a home, you might have to support the replacement \nof a furnace that blows or a leaky roof, things that renters don't have \nto pay. If they can't afford to buy a home, we want to see them in a \ngood home that could be a rental home.\n  But the most important thing they said we could do now is provide \ncounseling, to bring together those homeowners whose homes are in \nforeclosure or who are facing foreclosure, to sit down with the lenders \nand see if they can work out an agreement before they go to \nforeclosure. Everybody says: Well, what interest does a lender have in \navoiding foreclosure? Well, foreclosures are expensive. They drive down \nthe value of the property and potentially put at risk the value behind \nother mortgages they may own in the same community.\n  Last fall, Senator Dodd and I agreed to include $180 million in the \nHousing and Urban Development Appropriations bill to begin counseling. \nThe first $130 million has gone out. We are beginning to see the \nresults of that. Those counseling dollars can help homeowners, if they \nwill go to a counseling entity such as The United Way or local \ngovernments to get counseling, before they wind up on the courthouse \nsteps.\n  In addition, there need to be dollars available to buy down mortgages \nwhere the mortgage rates have skyrocketed because of the subprime \ncrisis. That is why, in the SAFE Act which I have introduced with my \ncolleagues--the Security Against Foreclosure and Education Act--we make \nsure there is money available through the State Housing Finance \nagencies. I know well the Housing Finance Agency in Missouri--the \nMissouri Housing Development Corporation--and they have a great plan. \nIf they can have more money, maybe $160 million to $180 million, \npossibly $200 million in Missouri, they could go in and buy out \nmortgages where the private mortgage holder has had to increase \nsubstantially the rate because of the overall market conditions. If \nthese HFAs can sell paper, tax-exempt paper, they can bring back the \nmortgage rates to the level that was affordable initially.\n  It is very important for fixed-income homeowners to count on a \ncertain mortgage payment. Some have seen it go up 50 percent, and too \nmany of them are being forced to the choice of walking away because \nthey can't meet it. We need to get HFAs to have the ability to go in \nand refinance those mortgages.\n  In addition, with Senator Isakson, we have included in the SAFE Act a \nmeasure to provide a tax credit for families willing to buy a home in \nforeclosure or going into foreclosure. In other words, it would be a \n$5,000 tax credit for each of 3 years for families who would move into \none of these homes either in foreclosure or facing foreclosure. That \nnot only gives a boost to first-time home buyers, but the most \nimportant thing it can do for communities is avoid the problem of \nhaving a community with 20 percent of the homes in foreclosure.\n  This isn't a problem for just the 20 percent of the families who are \nfacing foreclosure; that is a potential disaster for the other 80 \npercent of the homeowners because what it does to the value of their \nhomes and to the value of every house in that community is to drive the \nvalues down significantly, so they may find their home is worth less \nthan the value of the mortgage.\n  Finally, we want loan transparency. As a former lawyer, I have had \nthe dubious pleasure of going through home purchasing documents several \ntimes recently. They give you a stack of paper this high that has all \nbeen written by lawyers, God bless them, and it has every contingency \nspelled out. But most people who go through the purchase process spend \n40 minutes signing the papers without knowing what is in them. What we \nwant is a very simple disclosure on top, which is binding on the lender \nand on the borrower, that says what the rate will be, if it is \nadjustable, how high it can adjust, when it can adjust, if there is a \nprepayment penalty, and what are the other terms that might cause \nsignificant economic distress to the home buyer. They need to know that \nin advance. Also, there ought to be counseling to help those \nprospective home buyers measure their financial ability, their ability, \nthrough their income, to buy a home and to make sure they can afford \nthe mortgage they are seeking.\n  I hope this is the basis on which almost all of us in this body can \nagree. We have heard a lot about what is going on at the macro level. \nThere are important things happening with the Fannie Mae and the \nFreddie Mac, such as getting $200 billion more that they can loan, and \nthe Federal Reserve moving in. All these things are important on a \nlarge national scale.\n  This is not only, however, a national and international problem; most \nof all, it is a community problem. The proposals we have set forth in \nthe SAFE Act are designed to help build up from the community level the \nsolutions we need for home buyers and homeowners, particularly those \nthreatened with foreclosure. We are only going to solve\n\n[[Page S2255]]\n\nthis problem if we work community by community. The SAFE Act is \ndesigned to help homeowners, counselors, and local government officials \ndeal with the problem in their communities and build, community by \ncommunity nationwide, the solutions to the problem that affects not \njust homeowners but affects our entire country.\n  I invite our colleagues to look at this legislation. I hope we can \ndiscuss it, as our leader has said, and come to agreement on some \nthings we can pass, and pass right now, because too many homeowners are \nfacing a crisis and need help.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for \nhis words. I was reminiscing, as I was listening to him, about my work \nas the HUD Secretary, and many times getting good counsel and advice \nfrom my main appropriator, a man who knows a great deal about this \nwhole problem and about this issue, and I thank him for his comments. I \nthink he is exactly right when discussing how the problem we are seeing \ntoday is hurting families.\n  When I had the good fortune to be at HUD, it was in the good times. \nWe were talking about ever-increasing rates of home ownership, \nparticularly among minority families; more and more people getting into \nhome ownership. It was a good thing because as we were doing that, we \nwere building communities. Streets were getting stronger and families \nwere getting stronger and cities and communities were getting stronger. \nNow we are seeing the reverse of that. That is why it is so important \nto take the steps the Senator from Missouri suggested and to move \nforward aggressively on this problem.\n  Let me talk a little bit about what I saw in Florida during the last \nfew days when I was there. I think in Florida it is a microcosm of the \nproblem. The state of the market is one in which we see increasingly, \nat the level of the homeowner, that people are more and more distressed \nand more and more in trouble about holding onto the home they have. You \ndrive around and see signs about a foreclosed home for sale. In \naddition to that, you know people are having a problem making ends \nmeet.\n  The second situation related to that is the fact that many people are \nnow staying away from the market. They are simply not buying homes. The \nreason for that is there is a sense of insecurity about where we are \ntoday in this very difficult moment. So as a result, we find that homes \nare not being purchased. This is having an impact on market prices, \nwhere home prices are in a decline and fewer and fewer buyers are in \nthe marketplace. As a result of all these things, there have been \nsignificant economic impacts on the State of Florida. So what begins as \na problem for a family--and a significant problem, a heartbreaking \nproblem--becomes a compounding problem when it impacts the entire \neconomy of a State such as Florida.\n  The State of Florida is greatly dependent on homebuilding for its \neconomy, and that is a fact. When speaking these past few days to \npeople in the industry, I am hearing from homebuilders who are saying: \nI have had to lay people off. I had to lay off substantial numbers of \nthe workforce. Large homebuilders have laid off hundreds and hundreds \nof people. The impact on the economy is significant.\n  So the Florida situation is somewhat revealing of what is happening \nacross the country, which is why I come back here more determined than \never that we have to act; that this is a time for the Congress to take \nstrong and significant action to try to have an impact on what is a \ndeteriorating situation.\n  Everybody keeps talking about whether we have hit bottom or when the \nhousing market is going to hit bottom. Well, I am not sure if we have \nhit bottom yet. I hope we have, and I hope we are beginning the \nsituation of ascending back. But the bottom line is we have to act, and \nthere are things we can do in certain areas where we must act.\n  I suggest we act in three areas. One is the area that impacts the \nhomeowners themselves. That is what Senator Bond was talking about: \nAbout home counseling, about getting people help, about workouts. The \nfact is, it is in the best interests of a financial institution to work \nout a loan with a hurting homeowner rather than to turn that into \nforeclosure. Nobody wants to have a foreclosed home on their inventory; \nwhat they want is the homeowner continuing to make their payments.\n  We have to work on housing counseling. We also have to do FHA \nmodernization. I see the Senator from Connecticut, my chairman. We have \nworked hard to get FHA done. We have to get that done. That is going to \nhelp families by making the FHA a more active player in this current \nmarketplace. It is going to bring FHA into play by allowing them to do \nlarger loans, by allowing them to be more flexible in the loans they \ndo.\n  FHASecure is a good first step. We need more flexibility in \nFHASecure. We need to make sure families who have already gotten in \ntrouble but who are not desperate yet--who have not gotten yet to \nforeclosure but who have gotten behind--are able to utilize FHASecure. \nWhy do we do that? Because it will allow families to get into an FHA \nmortgage that will allow them to be in a mortgage they can carry and \nkeep out of trouble.\n  We need to stabilize values. We need to make sure the decline in home \nvalues stops, because as that happens, the equity in homes continues to \ndecline, and that is not good for the economy as a whole.\n  How can we help with these ideas? One I like a lot is Senator \nIsakson's idea to provide a tax credit to try to lower the inventory of \nunoccupied homes. If these homes are unoccupied, as has happened in \nFlorida--many were built that are today not being bought. We need to \nget the market going again. We need to get people back into buying \nhomes. We need to make sure they have an opportunity to do so. The \nencouragement of a tax credit I think will go a long way toward doing \nthat.\n  A second related problem is liquidity. I have talked to homebuilders \nwho are telling me they have some buyers who cannot find loans. Banks \nare not lending money. Money has tightened. So as money has tightened, \nwe need to provide those things which will create more liquidity in the \nmarketplace. Which is why I am fearful that cramming down mortgages is \nnot a good idea; in fact, it will work against providing more \nliquidity.\n  I also wish to look at the long-term effects. There is a need for \nregulatory reform. I have talked about the regulation of the \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac home loan \nbanks.\n  We need a stronger, more effective regulator. I have been preaching \nthis since I was at HUD. This is an important concept. We have \nincreased loan limits and lowered capital requirements to 20 percent. \nAs we have done that, it is necessary that we look at a stronger \nregulator. The rules today are not up to par for what we need. These \nare trillion dollar companies of incredible importance that will play a \nsignificant role in getting us out of the market dilemma we are in. In \norder for them to be stronger and for them to have the kind of investor \nconfidence they must have, I think a stronger regulator would be a \ngreat step forward.\n  I commend the Secretary of the Treasury for the proposal he made on a \nbroader regulatory scheme for our financial world. I think some of \nthese ideas that are also being discussed in Congress are important. We \nneed to consider them and many need to be adopted. They may be on a \nsecond tier.\n  I am looking at more immediate things we can do to prop up the \nhousing market and look forward in that regard. I want to touch on the \nimportance of working in a bipartisan fashion. Chairman Dodd and I have \nhad conversations. It is important we work together and come together \nwith something that will help the American people. The people of \nFlorida desperately need help. This is a problem not only relating to \nthe end consumer, the homeowner--the family who tasted that dream of \nhome ownership and got into a loan and is now seeing the nightmare of \nlosing it--but also to those people who have lost a job or are fearful \nof losing one.\n  The economy depends so much on housing. That is what we need to \naddress. I hope we will come to some understanding of how to move \nforward in a bipartisan fashion and work toward a solution that will \nhelp the American\n\n[[Page S2256]]\n\npeople get back to the strong, vibrant economy we have known in recent \nyears, and also continue to grow that dream of homeownership for more \nand more American families.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2256-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2256-S2260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HOUSING CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I say amen to my colleague from Florida. I \ndidn't hear everything he said; I missed the opening few sentences, but \nI think I heard about 99 percent of his comments. We have had good \nconversations privately over the last number of days. What the Senator \nfrom Florida probably didn't tell you is that in a previous life he was \nthe Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the person responsible \nfor a lot of the housing issues in the country. Prior to that, he was \ninvolved in the State of Florida in housing issues. He has had a \nwonderful record of caring deeply about homeownership for those who \nwould not have had the opportunity to acquire homes. So there is a \nhistory in his private life, as well as public life, as well as \nunderstanding and caring about these issues.\n  The last point the Senator made is the one I will address as well. \nThis is not a time for partisan politics. We need to get the job done \nand start working on this immediately. We should have been at this \nweeks ago, in my view. There is nothing I can do about that, but there \nis something we can do about this today. I hope that in the coming \nhours we will do just that. No other issue is as important as this one.\n  The Senator from Florida outlined in a broad way some of the very \nissues that need to be addressed. I agree with him and I thank him for \nhis commitment to this and his willingness to see if we can pull \ntogether a package, and it may not solve every problem.\n  I was talking earlier to some folks, saying that the word missing is \n``confidence''--the confidence of that family in Florida, the \nconfidence of the investment banker, the confidence of the person \ninvolved in the equity markets globally--the word ``confidence.'' How \ndo we restore that and give people a sense of confidence about where we \nare going.\n  While I want to be careful about drawing too tight comparisons there \nis a key period that history has written volumes about, from March of \n1933 to June of 1933--the first 100 days of the Roosevelt \nadministration--and there was nothing orderly about it. It was rather \nchaotic. During the Roosevelt administration, in the midst of a major \neconomic crisis, on the very day of his inaugural, banks were closing \ntheir doors all across the country. We think of that line: ``There is \nnothing to fear but fear itself.'' That administration was trying \neverything they could to restore confidence. While a lot of their ideas \ndidn't work, or were ill-conceived in some cases, there was a sense in \nthe country that their Government was working on their problems, that \nthe people in charge were trying to make a difference in their lives.\n  We are not in a great depression, we are in a recession. We could end \nup in a very similar set of circumstances if we don't begin to act. The \nAmerican people want to know we are acting, that we understand what \nthey are going through, and that their Government, the legislative and \nexecutive branch, is worried about them and doing their best to make a \ndifference in their lives. That is what this is all about.\n  This morning I want to lay out, if I can, as chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, what we are doing and trying to get done. I hope in this \npivotal week we can make a difference in stepping forward. I thank \nSenator Kit Bond of Missouri. He and I have worked together on so many \nissues over the last number of years. We worked together on The Family \nand Medical Leave Act many years ago, and recently we coauthored the \n$180 million of counseling dollars to assist families who got \nthemselves into a bad deal--whether it was their fault or the fault of \na broker. We are trying to work that out so they can stay in their \nhomes. That has made a huge difference. I thank Senator Bond for his \nunderstanding of this very early on, and for the importance of that \nsignificant step. He has pointed out--and I agree--this issue is no \nlonger just a housing issue, a foreclosure issue. You only need to pick \nup this morning's business section to read this headline: ``Worst \nQuarter for Stocks Since '02.'' The first paragraph says:\n\n       U.S. stocks ended the first quarter with the steepest loss \n     in nearly six years as turmoil in the financial markets \n     showed increasing signs of spilling over into the wider \n     economy and debate turned from whether a recession was coming \n     to how deep it would be.\n\n  That is a very accurate statement. This is spilling over. The \ncontagion is no longer limited to housing and foreclosures. It is \nspilling over into every aspect of our economy, spilling over the \nshores of our country and having global implications. The time is now \nto come together and make a difference on this issue.\n  About a month ago, Majority Leader Reid brought a bill to the floor, \nthe Foreclosure Prevention Act. Unfortunately, progress on the bill was \nblocked and we were unable to even debate the bill, let alone vote on \nit. Since then, the challenges facing American homeowners have only \ngrown worse. In the month of February alone, 223,651 more Americans \nentered foreclosure, according to RealtyTrac, a company that collects \nreal estate-related data in the country. That amounts to 7,712 \nforeclosures on a daily basis--over 7,700 today, yesterday, and \ntomorrow. That is roughly 8,000 people who will be in the process of \nlosing their homes in America--8,000 people every single day--unless we \nact to do something about it. We gathered to listen to people, who \nmanaged to get together over the weekend, on the Bear Stearns-JPMorgan \ndeal, where $29 billion of taxpayer money will go to that deal with \nthat issue. I would like to know there is as much concern about these \nordinary people as there is about the shareholders in Bear Stearns. I \nfeel badly that they lost a lot of money, but they are not losing their \nhomes. These people--almost 8,000 every day--are.\n\n  So I am going to come to the floor every single day and recite the \nnumber on a daily basis of people losing their homes, until we do what \nI think we ought to do to step up to the plate and make a difference \nfor them. If that foreclosure rate continues--and all indications are \nthat it is actually increasing--almost 240,000 more Americans will have \nbeen foreclosed on during the month of March. UBS reports that \nforeclosures of this magnitude are on par with the severity of \nforeclosures during the Great Depression.\n  These foreclosure rates are not simply high in relative terms; they \nare at record levels, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. \nThe Mortgage Bankers data shows that more than 1 in every 50 homes with \na mortgage in this country is in foreclosure. Foreclosure rates have \nbeen growing at record levels for some time, unfortunately.\n  Foreclosures are increasing because people are continuing to struggle \nto make their payments. The data tells us that 1 in every 13 homes with \na mortgage has fallen behind on their mortgage. Every day that goes by \nwithout action means more families are losing their homes.\n  Compounding the problem, nationally, home prices continue to fall. \nHome prices are down over 10 percent nationwide over the past 12 \nmonths, and they continue to fall. This is the first time we have \nexperienced such a deep and widespread decline--a national decline--in \nhome prices since the Great Depression.\n  Merrill Lynch is predicting that home prices will fall by 15 percent \nthis year and another 10 percent next year. It is quite possible that \nover the past month, since the Senate last debated this issue, an \nAmerican who owns a $200,000 home has seen the value of that home fall \nby $5,000 in 1 month. I will repeat that. If you have a home worth \n$200,000, in the last month that home has lost $5,000 in value and may \ndo that every month for the coming months. That is $5,000 of wealth \nthat American families have lost while we in this body have been \nwaiting to even discuss potential legislation to address these \nproblems.\n  While we have waited, our country lost more jobs as well. We learned \nin the month of February that the American economy lost over 100,000 \nprivate\n\n[[Page S2257]]\n\nsector jobs. We have lost private sector jobs in each of the last 3 \nmonths. With job losses mounting at the same time mortgage payments are \nrising, families are falling further and further behind in their \nability to pay the mortgage, to make car payments, and to buy groceries \nand educate their children. At the same time, the cost of these \nessentials is rising.\n  Inflation has risen by 4 percent over the past year, far outstripping \ngrowth and wages. American families have to do a lot more with a lot \nless. They have to find a way to pay the bills that keep rising, while \nthe value of their home keeps falling. Their job prospects continue to \ndecline. It is no wonder that consumer confidence continues to fall, \nreaching record lows that have not been seen, by some measures, since \nthe early 1970s.\n  We are clearly in the midst of a recession. It hasn't been called \nthat yet by the professionals, but that is what it is. The only \nquestion we have is how deep it is and how long it will run. The answer \nto that question lies, in part, in what we do in this body to confront \nthe challenges we face.\n  The legislation before us, which our colleagues and the majority \nleader brought to the floor, will help address the problems we are \nfacing in the housing and mortgage markets in a number of ways. Senator \nMartinez outlined the parameters briefly. I will go over them once \nagain. These are not revolutionary or new ideas. Many of them already \nenjoy very broad bipartisan support, at least based on articles written \nby the American Enterprise Institute, comments by the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve, comments by the Secretary of the Treasury, and \ncomments by colleagues here and in the other body as well. So we are \nnot talking about some radical new proposals here, untested, without \nmuch thought going into them.\n  The question is whether we can sit down over the next few hours and \npackage something together and speak with one voice to the American \npeople, saying we hear you. For those 8,000 people, you deserve at \nleast as much of our attention as Bear Stearns and JPMorgan get. If we \ncannot do that, then every day, those numbers go up--8,000 a day, every \nday, people losing homes and falling into foreclosure. That is what I \nhope we will be able to do. These ideas involve counseling services and \nI thank Senator Bond for his efforts. We joined together to provide \nresources that are working.\n  Last week, I spent the week back home in my State. This issue was the \ndominant issue. We have in one city alone in my State, Bridgeport, \nConnecticut, where according to the mayor, there are between 5,000 and \n6,000 foreclosures--in one of the largest cities in my State. I had to \nread the most bizarre headlines on the same day in my State, saying \nthat Connecticut ranks No. 1 in per capita earnings in the country, and \nNo. 2 with 6,000 foreclosures in the city of Bridgeport. There is great \naffluence, on one hand, because some have done very well, and on the \nother hand, some people are struggling to keep their noses above water. \nI listened to people at an event in Bridgeport, with the mayor, talking \nabout how counseling services have been helpful, where they can work \nout a financial arrangement with the lender so they can stay in their \nhomes, pay a mortgage they can afford, and the lender is getting its \nmoney--not as much as they would have liked, but more than getting a \nforeclosed property. So counseling works. It can make a difference for \npeople. That is one of the provisions we are talking about here. I \nthank Senator Martinez for highlighting that important issue. I thank \nSenator Bond for his earlier efforts. We need to do more. That is part \nof the leader's package.\n  We are also dealing with bankruptcy reform, improving disclosures, \nincreasing the availability of mortgage revenue bonds, and \nappropriating emergency funds for local communities struggling with \nforeclosed and abandoned properties.\n  I commend the majority leader for his leadership in putting this kind \nof a package together. But I know there are other ideas out there. In \nfact, some of these ideas need to be moderated or fixed in some way. \nBut that only happens when we work together, when we sit down and try \nto iron out these differences and then step up with our proposals and \nallow others who want to offer some ideas to this to be heard as well. \nIt takes time, it is laborious, but that is the job of this body, not \nto sit there and walk away and do nothing. That is not an option, and \nfailure ought not be an option either. So we need to roll up our \nsleeves and go to work.\n  These provisions can make a real difference for homeowners and the \ncommunities in which they live and our national economy as well. They \nare meaningful proposals, but they are also, I might add, modest, \nparticularly in relation to some of the administration's actions.\n  The administration just took the historic action to support the \ntakeover of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase. This action was a major \ncommitment of taxpayers' money--almost $30 billion. The Senate Banking \nCommittee will conduct a hearing later this week on this particular \narrangement and other recent actions by the Treasury, the Federal \nReserve, and other Federal agencies to address the recent turmoil in \nthe financial markets.\n  Without prejudging the outcome of our oversight and investigation of \nthis unprecedented commitment of taxpayers' money, one thing is clear: \nIt is now time to turn our attention to Main Street. As bold as the \naction was to help Wall Street, we must be bold to help millions of \nAmericans who live on Main Street. Inaction, as I said a moment ago, is \nnot an option, and failure is not either. Every day that passes creates \nnew risks for the financial future of our Nation. We cannot hope this \nproblem is going to go away and solve itself. Our competitors in the \nglobal economy are the only ones who will benefit if we do nothing to \nstem the rising tide of foreclosures that is hurting communities, \nfamilies, the credit markets, and the overall economy.\n  The question is not whether we should act, but how. The majority \nleader has laid out what I believe is a series of responsible policies \nthat will help American families to keep their homes and help \ncommunities throughout our Nation deal with the foreclosure crisis. Let \nme briefly describe several of these critical elements of the package.\n  The legislation increases funding for foreclosure prevention \ncounseling. I have already addressed this issue. Again, we appropriated \n$180 million before. There is $200 million in the proposal before us \nthat can make a huge difference to these nonprofit organizations out \nthere working with lenders and borrowers, bringing them together for \nthese workouts.\n  In addition to effectively fighting foreclosures, we must limit the \ndamaging impact that foreclosures inflict on our communities. That is \nwhy we need to help our local communities cope with the serious \neconomic and social problems that vacant properties create. Every one \nof my colleagues understands this point. I don't need to go through a \nlong description of what happens when we have vacant properties in our \ntowns, communities, and neighborhoods. It is axiomatic what happens. \nEveryone understands. First, we understand the value of the neighbors' \nhouses goes down immediately. As I mentioned earlier, we are watching a \n$5,000 decline on a house worth $200,000 in a month alone, merely \nbecause of what is happening to declining prices. Throw a foreclosed \nproperty into that mix, and obviously you get a further deterioration. \nProperty values for each home located within one-eighth of a square \nmile of one foreclosed house fall significantly. An average city block, \nin most of our cities, is one-eighth of a square mile. That is a rough \ncalculation. If you have one foreclosure in that one city block, even \nthough every other home on the block is current on their mortgage \nobligations, the value of every home on that block declines immediately \nby 1 percent and crime rates go up in that neighborhood by 2 percent. \nThat happens immediately. Property values decline on an average of \n$5,000 with one foreclosure in that neighborhood.\n  We have 44.5 million homes adjacent to subprime foreclosed \nproperties--44 to 50 million adjacent properties next to foreclosed \nproperties. Let me repeat the statistic again. Every day, almost 8,000 \npeople in this country are going into foreclosure--more than 220,000 in \nthe month of February and at least, if not more, that number in the \nmonth of\n\n[[Page S2258]]\n\nMarch. When that happens, other property owners suffer. So it is not \njust the family in the foreclosed property who is affected, it is that \nhard-working family who lives down the block who is also paying a price \nfor this situation because we are not acting to try to come up with a \nway to get people to work out something that allows them to stay in \ntheir homes.\n  Localities are losing close to $4.5 billion in property taxes. Again, \nthis is axiomatic. You end up with foreclosed properties, and you end \nup losing your tax base. Fire protection, police, social services, and \nschools all pay a price as well. There is a domino effect in this \nsituation, and that is what Senator Bond was talking about earlier. \nThis is no longer just a foreclosure problem. It is far deeper, far \nwider, and growing by the day. This is exactly what happens when we end \nup with foreclosures in a neighborhood, what can happen to other \nproperties in that area.\n  That is why the issue of providing some additional assistance makes \nsense. I recommended $4 billion to go out to the community development \nblock grants targeted specifically for restoring abandoned properties, \nmaking them more marketable, providing assistance to the communities. \nThat is a lot of money, $4 billion. It is not $30 billion. That is what \nwe are on the line for in the Bear Stearns-JPMorgan Chase deal. That \ndeal was cut over the weekend. We never voted on it in this body; that \nis just a deal they cut. The Federal Reserve has the authority, \napparently, to do that. I am not asking for $29 billion or $30 billion; \nI am asking for $4 billion to go back to our cities and communities to \nhelp mayors and towns in urban areas and rural areas where this is \nhappening to provide help for them so they can put these properties in \nbetter shape so they can be sold.\n  The leader's bill also includes a Finance Committee provision that \nwould allow State housing finance agencies to use proceeds from \nmortgage revenue bonds to help extend mortgage credit to people now \ntrapped in predatory loans, as well as to new homeowners. It would also \nhelp expand affordable rental housing, helping people who need a place \nto go if they cannot hang on to their homes.\n  This provision, by the way, is one I heard over and over again, and \nyou hear it in every State you go. They reached the max and they need \nrelief, if that housing finance authority is going to be able to \nprovide the kind of relief they need. This is an idea which has broad \nbipartisan support. I am told the Finance Committee--Senator Baucus and \nSenator Grassley care about it. They believe it is the right step to \ntake. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts has talked about this issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask for 5 additional minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and, of \ncourse, I will not object, I just want to make sure that when Senator \nDodd finishes, I be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, others have made this recommendation as \nwell. It has some value.\n  Senator Durbin's banking provision is a controversial provision. \nSimply let me state what it is. Under an agreement reached in the \n1970s, in order to get lending institutions to provide more credit to \nrisky borrowers, there was an agreement struck that would not allow a \nworkout to occur in bankruptcy when the primary residence is involved. \nYou can have a workout where your secondary residence or farm is \ninvolved.\n  Senator Durbin, I believe, rightly says: Why should that be the case? \nIn bankruptcy, shouldn't the courts be able to work out something that \nallows people to stay in their homes or to afford a new mortgage? There \nis a lot of resistance to this issue, and there is an argument on the \nother side. I am not going to suggest there is not. My hope is we can \nwork something out in this area. This cramdown, as it is called, this \none provision has provoked a lot of objection to this bill, but I am \ncommitted to do everything I can to work it out, to allow a vote to \noccur and allow us to do something in this area.\n  Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island has a provision in the legislation \nthat will improve disclosures to borrowers and make those disclosures \navailable sooner in the mortgage shopping process. This provision will \nhelp borrowers avoid the kinds of abusive loans that are leading to so \nmany foreclosures. I commend Senator Reed for this proposal. Again, I \nthink it is a pretty noncontroversial provision.\n  I understand there are other ideas as well. This is not \ncomprehensive.\n  Again, Senator Martinez mentioned one idea that Johnny Isakson has \nargued for, and I think it has value, to incentivize people to move \ninto foreclosed properties by giving some kind of tax credit to lure \npeople in. This is where the property has been foreclosed, the owner \nwho occupied it is out, and we need to get the property owned and \noccupied. I think that idea has some value, and we should be able to \ndebate and include that in a package as well.\n  I wish to mention a few other steps we might consider as well, in \naddition to the Isakson proposal.\n  We need to finish the job and enact legislation to modernize FHA. \nSenator Shelby and I are working on this issue. Barney Frank, a \nCongressman from Massachusetts, the chairman of the House Financial \nServices Committee, has been doing a great job, along with his \ncommittee members. I hope we can resolve the few remaining issues on \nmodernization of FHA. We have 19 States that are high-cost States. We \nwant to make sure FHA can do business in those States as well. I hope \nwe can work out something to the satisfaction of all. That bill passed \nthis body 93 to 1 late last year, and we have been working with the \nHouse to resolve our differences in that area.\n  I believe we need to enact comprehensive reform of the GSEs. Senator \nMartinez mentioned this point, and I agree with it. A strong regulator \nis necessary, and we are going to get that job done to make sure Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac and Federal Home Loan Banks will be well regulated \nand can expand.\n  In addition, I believe we need to establish a new way to deal with \nthe unprecedented wave of foreclosures. This is the legislation I have \noffered called the Hope for Homeowners Act of 2008. The legislation \nclosely mirrors the approach recommended by the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve, Ben Bernanke, and it has been approached by people across the \nideological spectrum, including the American Enterprise Institute and \nthe Center for American Progress. This legislation is not a bailout at \nall. It would provide no windfall to anyone. It says the lender takes a \nhaircut, but you are going to keep people in their homes. The Presiding \nOfficer liked the ``haircut'' analysis, I see. The borrower would end \nup paying a price by paying insurance on the property. They have to \nstay in the home to qualify for this provision. It is not going to be \neasy on them, but nonetheless we believe it allows for a bottom to be \nachieved, a floor. We think this will help some people facing \nforeclosures, but, as importantly, it provides a floor. And until we \nget to a floor of the foreclosure crisis, we are not going to find \ncapital beginning to flow again. This idea of a voluntary program, only \ngoing to owner-occupied residences--not speculators and, frankly, not \npeople who never should have gotten into a mortgage in the first \nplace--it is targeted, designed to keep people in their homes and \nprovide that floor we are looking for.\n  I hope something such as that can be included in this bill as well \nbecause we need to deal with the problem of credit. If we do not \naddress the credit issue, we are not addressing the core of this \nproblem. To only address the effects of the problem is not to address \nthe underlying issue, and that is on seizing, if you will, the capital \nthat needs to flow again. This idea, we believe, could do just that. So \nmy hope is, in the coming days, we can enact something very much like \nthat. It is an idea about which Congressman Frank and I have talked.\n  I raised this idea several months ago, and I am delighted so many \npeople across the spectrum have said this is a good idea. It was tried, \nactually, 40, 50 years ago in a different form than we are suggesting \nbut, nonetheless, could make a difference.\n  There are a number of other ideas we could consider, but more \nimportantly, as Senator Martinez said, we need to get together on this \nissue. We cannot wait another day. There are almost 8,000 foreclosures \na day--8,000 yesterday, 8,000 tomorrow, and every single\n\n[[Page S2259]]\n\nday may be worse if we do not act. That is what this chart points to. \nIt requires our attention and our serious energy to make a difference.\n  I hope in the coming hours we can reach an agreement to go forward to \nallow us to debate these issues and offer some sound ideas that will \noffer the American people and others involved in this issue the word \n``confidence,'' that their Congress, their Senate, their Government is \nnot sitting idly by and hoping the problem miraculously will go away. \nWe are working on their problem. We understand what they are going \nthrough. We care about it, and we want to make a difference for them. \nThat is the challenge for us. I believe we can do this. This is not \nthat heavy a job to get done--a simple amount of will in deciding it is \ndeserving of our time and attention. If we do that, I am confident we \ncan resolve these issues and set a very high standard for the action of \nthis body in helping to step forward and make a difference in people's \nlives.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Dodd so much for his great \nleadership on this issue. The reason I very much wanted to speak this \nmorning is because California is on the front lines of this crisis. We \nhave about 25 percent of all the foreclosures in our State. I want to \nshow Senator Dodd where we rank in terms of the cities.\n  We make up 7 of the top 10 highest foreclosure filing rates \nnationwide. First is Stockton, Modesto, Merced--Merced is No. 4, \nactually. These are very much in the farmland countryside. Riverside-\nSan Bernardino, which is east of Los Angeles and one of the fastest \ngrowing areas--and by the way, the place where all of the freight goes \nthrough to get to the rest of the country as it comes in from Los \nAngeles. Bakersfield is No. 7, Vallejo-Fairfield, 8, and Sacramento, \nright near our capital, 9.\n\n  We have 7 of the top 10 highest foreclosure filing rates nationwide. \nAnd the reason I stress it is because the things I am about to say are \nnot theoretical. I have seen them happening. I held five roundtable \ndiscussions in various parts of my State, in many of these communities, \nand everything Senator Dodd is saying about what occurs in a community \nis right on target because when you start with one foreclosure, and a \nhouse gets boarded up, and then someone else puts their house up for \nsale and it sits, suddenly you have a circumstance where crime is going \nup and properties are going down. It is a vicious cycle. Suddenly \npeople owe more on their home than the home is worth, and it is a very \ndangerous circumstance.\n  The way I would describe it, Senator Dodd, in thanking you so much, \nis this: This crisis keeps getting away from us because while this \nadministration definitely cares about Wall Street--and, by the way, I \nused to work on Wall Street, and I think what they did makes sense--the \nquestion is, where are they when it comes to my communities, to your \ncommunities, to the communities all over the country that are \nstruggling? Why don't they bring that same sense of purpose?\n  Today, we are going to see if our Republican friends have a change of \nheart because, of course, they stopped us the last time we tried to do \nthis. But the commonsense things that are in your bill, and now I guess \nit is the leadership bill as well--and I thank you, Senator, I know you \nneed to rush off--are just so sensible.\n  It provides $200 million in additional funding for housing \ncounselors. And let me tell you anecdotally what I know from having \nspoken to counselors. When the counselors sit down with the mortgage \nlender and they sit down with the homeowner, miracles happen, and \nanecdotally I can tell you about 50 percent of the cases are resolved.\n  Now, times have changed. In the old days--and I would say that is \nwhen I bought my house, the old days--you had the banker down the \nstreet. If you wanted to refinance, you visited the banker down the \nstreet, and you told him the purpose of the refinance. Maybe you wanted \nto borrow on the equity of the home because you wanted to send a child \nto school. Maybe you wanted to add a new bedroom, expand the house, do \nsome landscaping. It was very much a face-to-face situation. But \nbecause of the way the markets have changed, a lot of people don't even \nknow who holds on to their mortgage. That mortgage may have been \nsecuritized, may have been put inside a big package of other things and \nmay be sitting somewhere in a hedge fund. They do not know who actually \nholds their mortgage.\n  So you get a counselor who understands how to go about following this \ntrail, and it makes a huge difference.\n  One would think, and I certainly would, that it is to everybody's \nbenefit to save a home, not only for the lender and the homeowner but \nthe community. So counselors are important.\n  We provide $4 billion in community development block grants for \nlocalities so they can get involved as part of the solution. We are in \nWashington, but the city council people, the mayors, the county \nsupervisors, the Governors and the rest, they are on the ground where \nall this is happening. Give them some tools and give them some \nstandards and let them have a chance to resolve some of this.\n  Allow bankruptcy judges to modify loans on principal residences. \nRight now--and I was struck to find this out, as most of my \nconstituents are--if you declare bankruptcy and go to court, the judge \ncan do a lot of refinancing to straighten you out, but he can't touch \nthe principal home. If you have a second home, a third home, a yacht, a \ncar, all that can be refinanced. But the judges have been blocked.\n  Now, I know there are some on the other side of the aisle who don't \nlike this provision. Well, if you don't like it, please explain why \nbecause it doesn't make sense. They say it will raise interest rates. \nIt is just not true the way this provision has been modified. But if \nyou want to change it, then vote to proceed to this bill and then fix \nthat provision. Don't stop us from going to this bill.\n  We provide an additional $10 billion in tax refunds for housing \nrefinance agencies to refinance subprime loans. This is just another \nvery good way to set up an agency that can help you out of your mess. \nIf you want to stay in your home and you prove that you can stay in it, \nthat you have the financial wherewithal, you can go to this to get \nthese funds.\n  This increases transparency and accountability by simplifying \ndisclosure on mortgage documents. We all know that is key. And we allow \nstruggling companies to apply current losses to tax returns from prior \nprofitable years.\n  This has hit home builders very hard, this downturn, and they need \nthis help with Uncle Sam and the Tax Code.\n  So I want to say to my colleagues who may be listening--maybe there \nis one or two--that to stop us from going to this bill is very hurtful \nto the American people. It is very harmful to the American people. \nExperts are predicting that over 2 million Americans with subprime \nloans, including more than 460,000 Californians, will lose their homes. \nLet's grab this crisis finally by the tail and pull it toward us and \nresolve it. Don't let it get away further.\n  I can tell you, since we are in many ways at ground zero of this \ncrisis, it is a very sad thing to watch what is happening. We have the \nability to do a lot, and this is a modest bill. It is a good bill. It \ncertainly doesn't spend as much as the bailout of Wall Street, which, \nagain, I think was a good idea, but we certainly need to know more \nfacts about it, and we certainly need to give the same attention and \nconcern to the middle class of this great country.\n  From all the meetings I held around my State, I can tell you that \npeople are looking to us, and they are not going to understand it when \na colleague votes no to proceed to a bill because they didn't like one \nout of the six things in it. It just doesn't make any sense.\n  Let me give you from this chart one more look at the crisis in my \nState. This shows you nationwide that there have been 223,000-plus \nfilings for foreclosure. That is 1 in every 557 homes nationwide. That \nis a 60-percent jump from 2007. In my State, which is a huge State, \nabout 37 million, 38 million people now, we saw 53,000-plus filings, or \n1 in every 242 homes, for an increase of 131 percent from 2007 to 2008. \nAnd then we break it down by counties here and we see the desperate \nsituation that some of our counties and cities are going through.\n\n  We have already made some progress, and I want to thank my colleagues \nfor\n\n[[Page S2260]]\n\nthe stimulus package where we did a few things that helped our State. \nOne of them, in particular, was raising the conforming loans by Fannie \nand Freddie. That was very helpful. We also have moved to work to get \nmore counselors out there. But there is not enough counselors out \nthere.\n  So there is no question it is time but for us to act. We have faced, \nI don't know what it is now, 60, 70 filibusters by my Republican \nfriends, and they have every single right to do it, but they also \nknow--I know they know this--they will take the blame for this if \nnothing gets done. So I say to my friends, I understand you don't like \neverything on our list. I totally get it. By the way, there are things \nthat are missing from this list that I would like to add. But I am not \ngoing to vote no to go to solving this crisis because there is \nsomething on here that I feel is missing.\n  In conclusion--the words everybody waits for when a Senator speaks--\nit is our turn to step forward, and if we fail to do so, we are \nirrelevant to this country. If we cannot have the courage to cast a \nvote to go to solving the housing crisis, we are irrelevant to this \ncountry when every leading economist tells us that it is the housing \ncrisis that is at the heart of this recession.\n  I thank the Chair for this chance to speak. We need this bill to help \nour families stay in their homes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am hopeful that we can proceed to a \ndebate on this important Foreclosure Prevention Act without further \ndelay. Homeowners across the country are suffering, and there are a \nnumber of things Congress could do to improve the worsening situation. \nWe need to put aside partisan bickering and work together to keep \nfamilies in their homes and keep this crisis from further weighing down \nour economy.\n  Since we last voted on whether to take up this measure in February, \nit has become even more obvious that the mortgage crisis is triggering \na domino effect that threatens to weaken and undermine substantial \nportions of our financial system.\n  The situation is dire. In Michigan alone, nearly 80,000 homes are \nexpected to be lost to foreclosure by 2009. My State has seen an \nincrease in the number of foreclosure filings of 282 percent since \n2005.\n  Michigan is not alone in this crisis, nor are homeowners facing \nforeclosure and declining housing values the only ones being affected. \nOver the past few weeks we have seen the near collapse of investment \nbank giant Bear Stearns and an unusually active Federal Reserve working \novertime to ease widespread concerns over our financial markets. At the \nroot of these concerns is the fact that there is a long chain of \ninvestors and lenders relying on American homebuyers to pay what, in \nmany instances are, shaky home loans.\n  It is urgent that we move forward on this bill to provide immediate \nhelp. Since we last tried to take up this bill, I have continued my \nseries of roundtable meetings in Michigan communities. I have met with \nleaders from local and State government as well as organizations who \nare in the trenches working with families facing foreclosure to discuss \npractical ways to help homeowners and protect our economy from further \ndamage. When I have asked for their feedback on this bill, they think \nit would help address a number of the problems they highlighted.\n  Across Michigan, everyone recognizes that declining home values \naffect not just those who are being forced into foreclosure or to sell \nat a loss but everyone who owns a home and the neighborhoods in which \nthose homes are located. Many communities would like to rehabilitate \nabandoned and foreclosed properties so that surrounding property values \ndo not continue to fall. But currently there are not funds to meet the \ngrowing demand. This bill provides $4 billion in Federal block grants \nto areas with the highest foreclosure rates and filings to help \nrehabilitate abandoned or foreclosed properties and prevent further \ndamage to local housing values and neighborhoods.\n  I am encouraged by the work of many counseling organizations, such as \nthose I met with during my roundtable meetings in Michigan, that are \ntrying to help families avert foreclosure. But across Michigan, \nforeclosure prevention counselors are overwhelmed, and a lack of funds \nis tying the hands of local groups trying to help keep families on \ntrack. This bill would provide $200 million for this much needed pre-\nforeclosure counseling.\n  Because each new foreclosure affects the value of properties around \nit, in Michigan and across the Nation, there are also many homeowners \nwho are facing the financial pressures of owing more on their mortgages \nthan the current dollar value of their houses, a situation known as \nbeing ``underwater.'' There is a critical need for more affordable \nloans to be made available to help these families refinance and stay in \ntheir current homes. Most homeowners do not want to uproot their \nchildren and leave their community behind, even if the balance of their \nmortgage is greater than the current market value of their home.\n  This bill would help address this problem by authorizing States to \nissue $10 billion in new tax-exempt bonds to help homeowners refinance \nadjustable rate mortgages. Providing refinancing options for homeowners \nin potentially solvent situations is an important component in the \neffort to reverse the current tide of foreclosures.\n  Ending the foreclosure crisis will require a team effort among \nFederal, State, and local governments, community and neighborhood \norganizations and lenders, brokers, and borrowers. This bill recognizes \nthat fact. It provides an opportunity to help keep struggling families \nin their homes. It provides an opportunity to help restore our housing \nmarkets by keeping declining property values stable. It will protect \nneighborhoods from a glut of vacant homes. We need to take up this bill \nnow, debate it, consider amendments, and then pass it. To not do so \nwould be to sit idly by while too many needlessly suffer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I understand I have 30 minutes, and I now \nask unanimous consent that it be formalized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2260-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2260-S2261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         JUDICIAL CONFIRMATIONS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to speak \nabout three subjects: One, judicial confirmations; secondly, the budget \nresolution; and thirdly, the housing situation.\n  First, as to the confirmation of judges, through staff, I have \nnotified the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee that I \nintended to address this subject, and the theme of my comments is that \nwe ought to be moving ahead on judicial confirmations.\n  We have a situation where there has not been one confirmation of a \nFederal judge this year. Since September 25th of last year, there has \nonly been one hearing for a circuit judge, and that was on February 21, \nin the midst of a recess. There have only been two hearings that \nincluded district court judges, the one on February 12 and one other. \nSix nominees have been heard; four are on the agenda for this week's \nexecutive business meeting.\n  The comparison between what has happened with President Bush and \nPresident Clinton shows a decisive imbalance which requires prompt \naction by the Senate on the confirmation of President Bush's judges. \nDuring the last 2 years of President Clinton's administration, 15 \ncircuit judges were confirmed compared to six for the last 2 years, so \nfar, of the Bush Administration. During the last 2 years of President \nClinton's administration, 57 district judges were confirmed compared to \nonly 34 during the Bush Administration.\n  On the 8-year cycle for President Clinton, 65 circuit judges were \nconfirmed and 305 district judges. And so far, during President Bush's \ntwo terms, 57 circuit judges have been confirmed and 237 district \njudges have been confirmed.\n  Now, the statistics can be argued in many ways, but I think it is \nhard to overcome the basic conclusion that it is unacceptable to have \nno confirmations of a Federal judge in the entire year, so far, in \n2008. Three months have expired. It is unsatisfactory to have only one \nhearing for a circuit judge in the past 6 months, and last year only \nfour circuit judges were given hearings.\n\n[[Page S2261]]\n\n  Now, regrettably, this pattern has evolved over the past two decades. \nDuring the last 2 years of President Reagan's administration, the \nSenate was controlled by the opposite party and there was a stall. \nThen, during the last 2 years of President George H.W. Bush, the first \nPresident Bush, again during the last 2 years of his administration, \njudges were stalled. Republicans retaliated with gusto during the last \n6 years of President Clinton's administration and exacerbated the \nwarfare on judges following what the Democrats had done.\n  And, as we have seen in 2005, this Chamber was virtually cast asunder \nby the battle on the Democratic filibusters and the threat of a nuclear \noption or constitutional option to change the filibuster rules. It was \nopen warfare in this Chamber, until it was finally worked out through \nthe so-called Gang of 14. Now we have a desperate situation where \njudicial emergencies exist in many of these courts, and the Senate is \nnot acting to confirm judges to fill those seats.\n  The Washington Post has editorialized on the subject to this effect. \nIn December of 2007, the Post said:\n       [T]he Senate should act in good faith to fill vacancies--\n     not as a favor to the president but out of respect for the \n     residents, businesses, defendants and victims of crime in the \n     region the 4th Circuit covers. Two nominees--Mr. Conrad and \n     Steve A. Matthews--should receive confirmation hearings as \n     soon as possible.\n\n  The Post further editorialized about another Fourth Circuit nominee:\n\n       [B]locking Mr. Rosenstein's confirmation hearing . . . \n     would elevate ideology and ego above substance and merit, and \n     it would unfairly penalize a man who people on both sides of \n     this question agree is well qualified for a judgeship.\n\n  What we are dealing with is not just politics in the Senate. We are \ndealing with the rights of residents--as noted by the Washington Post, \nof businesses, of defendants and victims of crime--who are affected by \nthe failure to move ahead and confirm judges. That, I suggest, is \ntotally unacceptable.\n  I emphasize the blame rests on both parties, as this pattern has \nunfolded over the past two decades. Each time it has been exacerbated, \nit has intensified. I supported qualified judges during the \nadministration of President Clinton because I thought it was \ninappropriate to tie them up. I thought the Democratic President was \ncorrect in seeking confirmation of his judges. Now I believe the \nRepublican caucus is correct in saying it is inappropriate to block the \nconfirmation of Federal judges, especially when no judge has been \nconfirmed yet this year to the Federal courts and only one circuit \ncourt nomination hearing has been held in the past 6 months.\n  It is my hope that we will find a way to declare a truce. We have an \nelection coming up in November. It may well be that there will be a \nchange of parties--or not. It may well be that, unless a truce is \ndeclared, the opposite party will have sufficient votes through \nfilibusters or otherwise to stop judicial nominations. It hurts the \ncountry. It hurts the people who are trying to get their cases decided. \nIt hurts litigants.\n  The judicial process is fundamental in our society, and it is being \nthwarted by the tactics which have become business as usual in the \nSenate. I hope we will be able to resolve this matter. I hope we will \nbe able to declare a truce. There is consideration being given to a \nvariety of responses to this kind of conduct by the majority, and we \nall know any one Senator can tie up this body unilaterally because this \nplace functions on unanimous consent and waivers of a lot of technical \nrules. That would be, perhaps, even more disastrous. But, we have to \nfind a way out of this, I suggest, because it is totally unacceptable \nto continue as it is running today.\n  Mr. President, I now ask that the Congressional Record contain a \nseparate caption for what I am about to say, under a resolution which I \nam about to submit to change the budget process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n493 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent and \nSenate Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2261-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2261-S2262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HOUSING CRISIS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. We are scheduled to have a vote at 2:15 this afternoon \non a motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to legislation \nthat has been filed at the desk by the majority leader. This \nlegislation contains a number of proposals, the most important of which \nis under consideration by the Judiciary Committee at the present time. \nI have filed alternative legislation, captioned S. 2133, which offered \nrelief to homeowners who have so-called variable rate mortgages and who \nare facing bankruptcy.\n  Home buyers who have variable rate mortgages are sometimes surprised \nto find their payments, after a period of time, jump from--\nillustratively--$1,200 a month to $1,900 a month, an enormous change \nthat they had not expected because they have a variable rate mortgage.\n  I believe that in these situations, there is a good basis to give \nbankruptcy courts authority to inquire into the circumstances of such \nmortgages and to roll back or reduce the interest rates. The rate of \nforeclosure for these types of mortgages has more than doubled in the \npast year while foreclosure among homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages \nhas increased only modestly. Frequently, the person taking out a \nmortgage doesn't understand there is a risk that there will be a large \nincrease in the interest rates on variable rate mortgages. Sometimes \nthere is deception on the part of the lender or mortgage broker. \nSometimes it may even constitute fraud. I believe the best policy would \nbe to allow the bankruptcy courts to consider these matters on an \nindividual basis. The lender is still going to receive, ultimately, the \nfull amount of the principle but not with interest rates that put the \nhome buyer in a precarious position, or even foreclosure.\n  Senator Durbin has introduced legislation captioned S. 2136 that goes \nmuch further by authorizing the bankruptcy court to reduce the \nprincipal amount of the mortgage. I am opposed to that approach because \nit will increase the risk associated with mortgage lending and \ndiscourage lenders from providing capital for home mortgages. The \nBankruptcy Code currently does not allow for the modification of \nmortgages because Congress did not want to discourage lenders from \ngiving mortgages to future homebuyers. There is an excellent statement \nby Justice Stevens in Nobelman v. American Savings Bank in which he \ngives that precise reason for the provision barring modification of \nmortgages. Congress must be cautious about making changes to the \nBankruptcy Code that will leave consumers worse off in the long run. I \nbelieve Senator Durbin's proposal would have that effect.\n  I believe we ought to be acting on the issues confronting us on \nhousing, but I am concerned that given the current state of affairs, \nthe procedures to be followed will preclude amendments, such as my \ninterest in offering an amendment with the substance of my bill, S. \n2133. The better practice would be to work through the Judiciary \nCommittee, which is now considering the Durbin legislation, with my \nlegislation offered in Committee as a second-degree amendment. We are \nscheduled to have a markup on that on Thursday. Regular order would \nsuggest that is a better practice to have it come out of the Committee, \nwhere we are in the process of having a markup. We will later have a \ncommittee report, and it would be much more conducive to appropriate \ndeliberation than having a measure filed under Rule XIV, where it is \nlodged at the desk, where there has not been analysis and a markup, and \nthere has not been a committee report.\n  If it is possible to offer amendments, I would consider supporting \nthe cloture motion. However, if the majority leader is going to fill \nthe tree and not allow amendments, then I am opposed to that procedure \nand would oppose cloture. The practice of so-called filling the tree is \nhighly undesirable. The essence of Senate procedures is to allow \nSenators to offer amendments.\n  In February of last year, more than a year ago, I introduced a \nresolution, S. Res. 83, to change the standing rules so the same person \ncould not offer both a first-degree and a second-degree amendment. This \nchange of the rules would preclude the majority leader, who has \npriority of recognition, from so-called filling the tree to prevent \nanyone else from offering amendments.\n\n[[Page S2262]]\n\nThe Rules Committee has not acted on that resolution, but I think that \nis an important piece of business, that our rules ought to be changed \nso the majority leader could not be in a position to fill the tree and \npreclude other Senators from offering amendments.\n  I am open as to what is going to happen on the cloture vote this \nafternoon. But certainly, if there is not an opportunity for me to \noffer my amendment or for others on this side of the aisle to offer \namendments, I will oppose it.\n  I believe I have some time left on my order. How much time do I have \nremaining? I have been asked to yield some time to my distinguished \ncolleague from Utah. I believe this is Republican time at the moment. \nParliamentary inquiry: Are we still on Republican time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is evenly divided until 12:30, a \nlittle less than 23 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I don't wish to step in front of the distinguished \nSenator from Colorado, his having waited on the Senate floor. But at \nany rate, I will not utilize the last 5 minutes of my time so it will \nbe available to the Senator from Utah, either now or after the Senator \nfrom Colorado finishes his time because he has been waiting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after I \nspeak for up to 15 minutes, Senator Hatch be recognized for up to 15 \nminutes, and then following Senator Hatch, Senator Durbin for 15 \nminutes, and then Senator Reed of Rhode Island for the remainder of the \nDemocratic time; if there is a Republican to speak between Senator \nDurbin and Senator Reed, that Republican Senator be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor once again to urge my \ncolleagues to begin serious work that is needed to address the housing \ncrisis. The news keeps getting worse. Home prices continue to decline \nsteeply. Home sales are reaching record lows, and the resulting shock \nto our broader financial system keeps getting worse. In the 2 weeks \nsince we adjourned, we saw the Federal Reserve act to bail out a major \ninvestment bank by facilitating the purchase of Bear Stearns by \nJPMorgan. This marked the first time in history the Fed had acted to \nrescue a financial institution of this kind. It did so because of the \nimpact a Bear Stearns collapse would have had on the entire economy.\n  Last week, it was reported home prices in the 20 largest metropolitan \nstatistical areas suffered their largest drop in history, over 10 \npercent in 1 year. In some cities, such as Miami, Las Vegas, and \nPhoenix, the drop is as high as 18 or 19 percent. Yet because of the \nRepublican filibuster in this Chamber 2 weeks ago, the Senate has \nfailed to act to deliver meaningful solutions to this crisis which is \nat the center of the economic storm pummeling the middle class.\n  When we look at the headlines, they keep coming: From USA Today, \n``Battered Home Prices Keep Toppling;'' from the New York Times, \n``Slump Moves from Wall Street to Main Street;'' from the Wall Street \nJournal, ``Housing, Bank Troubles Deepen;'' from the Washington Post, \n``Mortgage Foreclosures Reach All-Time High.''\n  We voted on the Foreclosure Prevention Act several weeks ago. The bad \nnews since then has, in fact, gotten worse. This is a scene all too \nfamiliar across the States. All across America families are feeling the \npain of the housing crunch. Price-reduced homes are on sale because \nthey have been foreclosed upon. It is not just families who are being \nforeclosed upon; it is their neighbors whose home values have declined \nsteeply as a result of foreclosures in the neighborhood. Again, it was \nreported last week that home prices in the 20 major metropolitan areas \ndeclined over 10 percent between January of 2007 and January of 2008. \nPrice reduced, price reduced, price reduced--that is not a sign any \nhomeowner wants to see on their lawn or on their neighbor's lawn or on \ntheir street. These are not just families who found themselves in \nfinancial situations they could not afford to climb out of; these are \nfamilies who bought houses between 2002 and 2006, stayed current on \ntheir payments, and hoped to see the value of their homes continue to \nappreciate. But through no fault of their own, these families have seen \ntheir homes, their single most valuable asset, decline precipitously in \nvalue.\n  The next chart demonstrates how widespread the problem has become in \nmy own State of Colorado. These are figures from the Center for \nResponsible Lending which has projected that we can expect to see \ntroubles ahead in terms of the continuing tide of foreclosures over the \nnext several years and how these foreclosures will affect not only \nowners of the foreclosed homes but entire neighborhoods and, in fact, \nmost homeowners across the State of Colorado.\n  The Center for Responsible Lending projects that in Colorado we will \nexperience nearly 50,000 additional foreclosed homes in 2008 and 2009, \nas the adjustable rate mortgages reset and as home values continue to \nplummet.\n  As stated on this chart, which is a map of my wonderful State of \nColorado, we see expected foreclosures are going to be right at about \n50,000. The spillover impact for surrounding homes that will suffer \ndecline during that same period is almost 750,000 homes. That is more \nthan a third of the homes of the State of Colorado are going to see \nthis declining spiral. We are going to see a decline in home values in \nthe aggregate of $3.2 billion in my State in the loss of home ownership \nvalue.\n  The situation is clearly getting worse. Many middle-class families \nwhose budgets are already stretched thin cannot afford such a steep \ndecline in the value of their most important asset. Congress has a \nresponsibility to act aggressively to help families stay in their homes \nand to stem the tide of foreclosures that continues to serve as a \nserious drag on our overall economy. That is why we are here again \ntoday, working to move on the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008, \nlegislation introduced by Senator Reid, in consultation with the chairs \nof the committees of jurisdiction. That legislation would take several \nsteps to provide meaningful and immediate assistance to families and \ncommunities affected by foreclosures and to prevent other families and \ncommunities from finding themselves in the same situation in the \nfuture.\n  The legislation does three simple things. First, it seeks to help \nfamilies facing foreclosure to stay in their homes by expanding State \nauthority to issue tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, increasing \nfunding for credit counseling, and allowing bankruptcy judges to \nrestructure mortgages. Second, it provides critical help to communities \nacross the country that have been affected by foreclosure by increasing \nfunding under the Community Development Block Grant program. Third, it \ntakes steps to help families and communities avoid foreclosures in the \nfuture by requiring simplicity and transparency on mortgage documents. \nI am especially glad these provisions are included in the legislation.\n  The two tax-related provisions reported out of the Finance Committee \non a bipartisan basis as part of the bipartisan economic stimulus \nproposal represent important steps that provide low-interest loans to \nhomeowners seeking to refinance their mortgages and to allow ailing \nbusinesses, including those in the home construction industry, to carry \nback their losses a longer period of time to average out their good and \nbad years.\n  I also support funding increases for credit counseling, which will go \na long way toward helping families understand the financial burdens \nassociated with taking out a long-term home loan and to avoid \nforeclosure. In my State of Colorado, we have already seen how \nbeneficial these kinds of services can be. Last fall, a consortium of \ngovernment, private sector, and nonprofit organizations launched the \nColorado foreclosure hotline which connects borrowers with nonprofit \nhousing counselors who can provide information on a borrower's options \nwhen facing foreclosure. Counselors can facilitate communications \nbetween lenders and borrowers. The hotline itself has already\n\n[[Page S2263]]\n\nreceived over 10,000 calls in the last 6 months.\n  This is a sign from the foreclosure hotline in Colorado. Since it was \nfirst formed, this consortium between the government, the private \nsector, and nonprofit organizations, more than 29,000 people in \nColorado have called this hotline.\n  This legislation will go a long way toward helping us implement this \nkind of program all the way across the country. The American dream of \nhome ownership is today a dream which is becoming nebulous for the \npeople of our country because of the huge foreclosure crisis we have \nseen across the country which has caused such a decline in home values \nall across America.\n  I believe it is our responsibility in the Senate to move forward to \nprovide relief to these middle-class families who are in danger of \nlosing value in their homes and in danger of losing their homes. This \nis an economic stimulus program which I think is timely for us to act \nupon. I hope our colleagues will join us in voting aye on the motion to \nproceed to the housing legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2263-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2263-S2268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the American people sent us here to get \nthings done. One of the most important things we do is consider and \nvote on the President's nominations to the Federal bench and the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  I can put it simply: We are failing to do our duty.\n  Let me first address the judicial confirmation process. The \nConstitution gives to the President the authority to nominate and \nappoint Federal judges. The Constitution gives to the Senate the role \nof advice and consent as a check on the President's appointment power.\n  The Senate gives the President advice about whether to appoint his \njudicial nominees by giving or withholding our consent. We are supposed \nto do so through up-or-down votes. That is what the Constitution \nassigns us to do and what the American people expect us to do.\n  That is what we are failing to do.\n  For the record, since I was first elected, I have voted against only \n5 of the more than 1,500 nominees to life-tenured judicial positions \nthe Senate has considered on the floor. Some of my Democratic friends, \nincluding those with far less seniority, have voted against more than \nthree times as many nominees of the current President alone.\n  I have strongly opposed all filibusters against judicial nominees, \nboth Democrats and Republicans. Some of my Democratic friends opposed \nfilibusters of Democratic nominees but heartily supported filibusters \nof Republican nominees.\n  I have not taken a partisan approach to judicial confirmations. But I \nmust say that today this body is failing to do its confirmation duty.\n  At both stages in the confirmation process--in the Judiciary \nCommittee and on the Senate floor--Democrats are failing to meet not \nonly historical standards but their own standards as well. Democrats \nhave vowed not to treat President Bush's nominees the way Republicans \ntreated President Clinton's nominees. Democrats are keeping that \npromise. Let me refer to this chart.\n  In the past 10 months, for example, the Judiciary Committee, under \nDemocratic control, has held a hearing on only three appeals court \nnominees. During the same period under President Clinton, the Judiciary \nCommittee held a hearing on 12 appeals court nominees--four times as \nmany. And by the way, every one of those Clinton nominees was \nconfirmed, 11 of them within an average of only 48 days after their \nhearing, and 9 of them without a single negative vote.\n  When I chaired the Judiciary Committee under President Clinton, we \nheld no less than 10 hearings that included more than 1 appeals court \nnominee--10. While Democrats have controlled this body under President \nBush, the Judiciary Committee has not held a single one--not one. Ten \nto zero. Democrats are certainly not treating Bush nominees the way \nRepublicans treated Clinton nominees.\n  The Democrats are not only failing to meet historical standards in \nthe Judiciary Committee, they are failing to meet even their own \nstandards. When I chaired the committee, Democrats complained about \nevery nomination hearing that did not include an appeals court nominee. \nWith Democrats in charge under President Bush, the Judiciary Committee \nhas held nearly a dozen nomination hearings without a single appeals \ncourt nominee.\n  There has already been one confirmation hearing this year without an \nappeals court nominee, and another one will take place on Thursday.\n  The picture is the same on the Senate floor, where Democrats are \nfailing to meet either historical standards or their own standards.\n  President Bush is the fourth President in a row to face a Senate \ncontrolled by the other party during his last 2 years in office.\n  Under his three predecessors, the Senate confirmed an average of 75 \ndistrict court nominees during their last 2 years in office. More than \nhalf of them were confirmed in the final year.\n  Fifteen months into the current 110th Congress, we have confirmed \nonly 31--only 31--district court nominees for President Bush.\n  Similarly, under the previous three Presidents, the Senate confirmed \nan average of 17 appeals court nominees during the President's final 2 \nyears in office. So far in the 110th Congress, we have confirmed only \nsix appeals court nominees for President Bush.\n  Now, to meet the historical average, we will have to confirm 44 \ndistrict court and 11 appeals court nominees in the next several \nmonths. If anyone believes that will happen, I have some oceanfront \nproperty in the Utah desert I would like to sell them.\n  Even if we did the completely unexpected, President Bush would still \nleave office with a much smaller impact on the Federal bench than his \npredecessor.\n  President Bush has so far appointed 295 life-tenured Federal judges, \nwell behind President Clinton, who appointed 346 at this same point in \nhis presidency.\n  Now, some around here spin a yarn about a supposed Republican \nblockade against President Clinton's judicial nominees. Some blockade. \nIt allowed President Clinton nearly to set the all-time judicial \nappointment record.\n  On the Senate floor, Democrats are not only failing to meet \nhistorical standards, they are also failing to meet even their own \nstandards. Eight years ago, when Democrats were in the minority during \nthe last year of President Clinton's tenure, they were crystal clear \nabout what the judicial confirmation standard should be.\n  One senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, for example, came to \nthis floor often in 2000, insisting over and over that Democrats had \nset the proper standard back in 1992. This is what he said:\n\n       I say let us compare 1992, in which there was a Democrat \n     majority in the Senate and a Republican President. We \n     confirmed 11 court of appeals court nominees . . . and 66 \n     judges in all. In fact, we went out in October of that year. \n     We were having hearings in September. We were having people \n     confirmed in October.\n\n  Today, as in 1992, a President Bush is in the White House.\n  Today, as in 1992, Democrats control the Senate.\n  Today, Democrats do not have to badger the majority to meet their \njudicial confirmation standard. They are in the majority. All they have \nto do is meet their own standard, and thus far they have failed to do \nso.\n  After all, if the Judiciary Committee is not holding hearings on \nappeals court nominees now, if the Senate is not confirming nominees \nnow, what makes anyone think we are going to be doing so in September \nor October as Democrats once said we should?\n  We will no doubt hear any number of rehearsed responses, retorts, and \nrejoinders. We will hear, for example, that the White House has not \nsent us a nominee for every existing judicial vacancy. True, but beside \nthe point. Lacking nominees for vacancies X, Y, and Z is no excuse for \nfailing to hold hearings and votes on nominees to vacancies A, B, and \nC.\n\n[[Page S2264]]\n\n  We have already heard about the so-called Thurmond rule, supposedly \njustifying grinding the confirmation process to a halt in this \nPresidential election year. The Thurmond rule neither is a rule nor can \nit be attributed to the late Senator Strom Thurmond, a former Judiciary \nCommittee chairman.\n  Here is what the Democrats said about the so-called Thurmond rule in \n2000, when a Democrat was in the White House:\n\n       We cannot afford--\n\n  The Democrats said--\n\n     to follow the ``Thurmond Rule'' and stop acting on these \n     nominees now in anticipation of the presidential election in \n     November.\n\n  Well, today is only April, but it already looks as if Democrats are \nstopping action on judicial nominees in anticipation of the \nPresidential election.\n  Now, that same Democratic leader spoke on the Senate floor on October \n3, 2000, a month before the election. He once again rejected the so-\ncalled Thurmond rule and used 1992 as the judicial confirmation \nstandard, even in a Presidential election year. This is what he said:\n\n       Do you know how long the Democrat-controlled Senate was \n     confirming judges for a Republican President [in 1992]? Up to \n     and including the very last day of the session; not up to and \n     including 6 months before the session ended.\n\n  That was then. I wonder how long this Democratic-controlled Senate \nwill be confirming judges for this Republican President.\n  We will no doubt continue to hear the cute but misleading phrase \n``pocket filibuster,'' a blurb created by the Democratic spin machine \nto somehow blame Republicans for unconfirmed Clinton judicial nominees.\n  Our constituents may not know it, but my Democratic colleagues \ncertainly do, that every President has nominees who do get confirmed \nfor a host of different reasons. But why let the facts get in the way \nof a good sound bite?\n  The unconfirmed Clinton nominations include many President Clinton \nhimself withdrew or chose not to renominate. They include others who \nwere nominated too late in a session to even be processed. They include \nothers who did not have the support of their home State Senators.\n  The current Judiciary Committee chairman insists he is not \nresponsible when nominees lacking support from their home State \nSenators do not get hearings. When he follows this policy, he blames it \non Senate tradition and senatorial courtesy. When a Republican chairman \nfollows this policy, he calls it a pocket filibuster.\n  When you sort out the real reasons that Clinton nominees were not \nconfirmed, you find this Democratic sound bite has a margin of error of \nabout 500 percent.\n  One of my Democratic friends was recently quoted as saying that facts \nare stubborn things. They are indeed.\n  None of this explains, let alone excuses, Democrats' refusal to \nholding hearings or votes on judicial nominees who do have their home \nState Senators' support.\n  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, for example, is \none-third empty--one of the most important circuit courts in the \ncountry. President Bush has sent us nominees to four of the five \nvacancies on that court. One of them, Robert Conrad, has the support of \nboth home State Senators, our distinguished colleagues from North \nCarolina. He has been nominated to a position that has been open for 14 \nyears. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has designated it a \njudicial emergency position.\n  This body confirmed Robert Conrad to the U.S. district court a few \nyears ago without even having a rollcall vote. Yet he has been waiting \nfor more than 250 days without a hearing.\n  Steven Matthews, likewise, has the support of his home State \nSenators, our distinguished colleagues from South Carolina. He has been \nwaiting for more than 200 days without a hearing.\n  The American people sent us to do our duty, and that includes giving \na hearing and a vote on these nominees.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter, dated February 13, 2008, signed by more than 50 grassroots \norganizations, urging us to do our judicial confirmation duty.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                February 13, 2008.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n      Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Hon. Sam Brownback,\n     Hon. Benjamin L. Cardin,\n     Hon. Tom Coburn,\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,\n     Hon. Russell D. Feingold,\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hon. Lindsey Graham,\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Hon. Herb Kohl,\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     Hon. Charles E. Schumer,\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,\n     U.S. Senate, U.S. Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: We write both to express our deep concern \n     about the lack of progress in 2007 in reporting judicial \n     nominees--particularly circuit court nominees--out of the \n     Judiciary Committee, and to discuss reasonable expectations \n     for progress on this issue in 2008.\n        The remarkably low approval ratings for the 110th Congress \n     are a testament to Americans' concern that their \n     representatives are more interested in partisan politics than \n     in serving the people. The American people want you to do \n     your job, and among the most important responsibilities of \n     the Judiciary Committee are processing and voting on the \n     President's judicial nominees.\n        The impact of the judges issue on Senate campaigns over \n     the last six years demonstrates that the public is watching. \n     Your constituents may not pay close attention to the details \n     of the confirmation process, but they cannot help but notice \n     the personal attacks on nominees, the emphasis on politics \n     over progress, and the basic unfairness of denying qualified \n     nominees a fair up-or-down vote by the committee and full \n     Senate.\n        A year into the 110th Congress, the Judiciary Committee \n     has held hearings for only four appeals court nominees and \n     has voted on only six. As a result, the full Senate has \n     fallen far short of the confirmation pace necessary to meet \n     the historical average of 17 circuit court confirmations \n     during a president's final two years in office--an average \n     maintained during the Reagan, Bush I, and Clinton \n     presidencies despite opposition control of the Senate.\n        Instead of seeing progress, the American people are \n     watching judicial nominees stack up in the Judiciary \n     Committee. Ten appeals court nominees--seven of them waiting \n     to fill vacancies declared ``judicial emergencies''--and \n     nearly twenty district court nominees languish in committee. \n     Several nominees have been waiting more than a year and a \n     half.\n        Given the long delays in the federal courts, the American \n     people are unsympathetic to the claim that certain nominees \n     cannot even get a hearing because of the Judiciary \n     Committee's arcane ``blue slip'' policy. That policy exposes \n     the Senate at its worst and is rightfully perceived as \n     serving senators rather than the public. Consider the \n     senators whose only reason for blocking two circuit court \n     nominees is a decade-old personal grudge, or the senators who \n     can do no better than argue that the nominee they are \n     blocking is so good at his current job that he should be kept \n     there. In the end, responsibility for the resulting delays \n     lies with the Judiciary Committee, because the ``blue slip'' \n     policy exists entirely at the committee's discretion.\n        Fortunately, the new year presents the Judiciary Committee \n     with the opportunity for a fresh start. If you and your \n     colleagues are willing to eschew partisan politics, focus on \n     your constitutional duty, and treat nominees in a dignified \n     manner, the Senate can meet or come close to the historical \n     average of 17 circuit court confirmations.\n        Specifically, there are four pending circuit nominees--\n     Robert Conrad, Steve Matthews, Catharina Haynes, and Gene \n     Pratter--who have the support of home state senators, which \n     Chairman Leahy has said is key to approval by the Judiciary \n     Committee. Including D.C. Circuit nominee Peter Keisler, that \n     makes five appeals court nominees for whom there is no excuse \n     for denying them a committee vote. And, given the outstanding \n     qualifications of these five nominees, there is no reason why \n     the committee should fail to report them to the full Senate \n     for a fair up-or-down vote.\n        Assuming at least two new nominees to the Fourth and Ninth \n     Circuits in the next several months, that leaves seven \n     circuit nominees in addition to the aforementioned five. Even \n     if the Judiciary Committee meets only a very minimal standard \n     by reporting just four of those seven to the full Senate, the \n     Senate will have an opportunity--contingent on Majority \n     Leader Reid scheduling up-or-down votes--to confirm fifteen \n     appeals court nominees in the 110th Congress. Fifteen \n     confirmations would fall short of the historical average, but \n     would match the number of circuit court confirmations in \n     President Clinton's final two years. Anything less and the \n     members of the Judiciary Committee will be remembered for \n     presiding over historic levels of obstruction.\n        Lest the individual nominees get lost in a discussion of \n     numbers, we want to draw your attention to the truly \n     exceptional qualifications of D.C. Circuit nominee Peter \n     Keisler,\n\n[[Page S2265]]\n\n     who has inexplicably languished in committee without action \n     since his hearing a year and a half ago. Keisler has been \n     given the American Bar Association's highest rating--\n     ``unanimously well-qualified''--and has the enthusiastic \n     support of leading legal scholars and practitioners from \n     across the ideological spectrum, including Yale Law School \n     Dean Anthony Kromnan, Professor Neal Katyal of Georgetown, \n     Professor Akhil Amar of Yale, Carter Phillips of Sidley \n     Austin, former D.C. Bar President George Jones, and several \n     former law clerks of Supreme Court Justices Thurgood Marshall \n     and William Brennan. In addition, both the Washington Post \n     and Los Angeles Times have called for Keisler's confirmation.\n        This impressive array of supporters surprises no one \n     familiar with Keisler's unmatched credentials. A graduate of \n     Yale Law School, Keisler served as Associate Counsel to \n     President Reagan and clerked for Supreme Court Justice \n     Anthony Kennedy before joining Sidley Austin. At Sidley, he \n     was quickly promoted to partner and argued cases at every \n     level of the federal court system, including the Supreme \n     Court. In 2002, he left Sidley to serve his country at the \n     U.S. Department of Justice, where he was promoted to \n     Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division a year \n     later. When Attorney General Alberto Gonzales resigned last \n     year, Keisler postponed his plans to leave government service \n     so that he could see the Department and the nation through a \n     difficult transition period as Acting Attorney General.\n        The least the Judiciary Committee can do to thank Peter \n     for his service to the nation is to report him to the full \n     Senate for an up-or-down vote. There is no rational reason \n     why, after a year and a half of waiting, this exceptional \n     nominee should remain on hold. If his nomination is allowed \n     to die in the Judiciary Committee, it will be a loss to both \n     the federal bench and the reputation of the committee. His \n     confirmation is our highest priority, and it should be yours \n     as well.\n        President Bush fulfilled his constitutional duty by \n     nominating the men and women who await action in the \n     Judiciary Committee. We respectfully request that you fulfill \n     your responsibility as well, by ensuring that each and every \n     judicial nominee is given a hearing and a vote in committee. \n     If you cannot support a particular nominee, vote him or her \n     out of committee without a positive recommendation, or vote \n     against confirmation on the Senate floor. The full Senate \n     must be allowed to carry out its constitutional duty of \n     advice and consent by providing each nominee with a timely \n     up-or-down confirmation vote, and you should not stand in the \n     way. We ask only that you do your job by putting \n     statesmanship above politics and special interests. The \n     American people expect no less.\n        We would be happy to speak with you in person about this \n     critical matter.\n           Respectfully,\n         Curt Levey, Executive Director, Committee for Justice; \n           James L.

Mr. President, let me briefly turn from the judicial to \nthe executive branch and, in particular, to the Department of Justice.\n  My Democratic colleagues have helped drive from office several top \nJustice Department officials and yet are now slow-walking confirmation \nof their replacements.\n  On March 11, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the nomination \nof Grace Chung Becker to be Assistant Attorney General of Civil Rights.\n  Grace served as a counsel on my staff when I chaired the Judiciary \nCommittee and has been a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Civil \nRights Division for the past 2 years. She currently heads the division \nin an acting capacity.\n  My Judiciary Committee colleagues will remember Grace as a talented, \nbrilliant, and dedicated lawyer, a person of the highest character and \nintegrity--one of the most likable people who ever served on the \ncommittee, one who served both sides, I think, graciously and well.\n  She received her law degree magna cum laude from Georgetown, where \nshe was associate editor of the Georgetown Law Journal. That was after \nreceiving her B.A. magna cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania \nand her B.S., once again magna cum laude from the Wharton School of \nFinance.\n  I think I see a pattern here.\n  After clerking for judges on the U.S. District Court and the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals in the District of Columbia, Grace spent a year in \nprivate practice before entering Government service. For the next \ndecade, Grace served in such positions as Special Assistant U.S. \nAttorney, Assistant to General Counsel at the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission, Special Adviser to the Assistant Secretary of the Army, and \nAssociate Deputy General Counsel of the Defense Department.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 15 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent for another 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. At the Justice Department, Grace has been supervising \nhundreds of lawyers in cases regarding civil rights, housing \ndiscrimination, religious land use, education, and fair lending \npractices.\n  Grace is a special person. She is the child of Korean immigrants \nwhose parents and siblings are all entrepreneurs in New York and New \nJersey. She and her husband Brian have been married for 14 years and \nhave 2 wonderful children. Grace is living the American dream and \nmaking the most of the opportunities she has found in this great \ncountry. She is dedicated to making these opportunities available to \nothers.\n  She has served the community on the board of the Korean American \nCoalition and on the Fairfax County School Board's Human Rights \nAdvisory Committee.\n  She has finally had her hearing, but now I hear disturbing reports \nthat she has been given literally hundreds of written questions, many \nabout matters occurring long before her tenure or decisions and \npolicies she had absolutely nothing to do with.\n\n[[Page S2266]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to do the right thing, to do our confirmation \nduty, not only for Grace but also for these qualified judicial nominees \nas well. I ask my colleagues to do what the American people sent us \nhere to do, and that includes giving timely consideration and up-or-\ndown votes to the President's nominees for the judiciary and the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague for allowing me the extra 2 \nminutes, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this Senate is an institution which was \ncentral to the decision to become a Nation. I have been watching this \nJohn Adams documentary on HBO--I recommend it to everybody--talking \nabout the earliest days of America. This great Constitution which \nguides our Nation almost didn't happen but for a compromise which said \nthat even the smallest States would at least have two Senators, the \nsame as the largest States. On the Senate floor that tradition \ncontinued, allowing even minorities, small groups, and even individual \nSenators certain rights which are not afforded to those across the \nRotunda in the House of Representatives.\n  One of these is a filibuster where Senators can take to the floor and \ncan hold the floor, objecting to what is going on. It takes an \nextraordinary vote--a large vote, more than a majority in the Senate--\nto take the floor back from that single Senator or group of Senators \nand to proceed with business. These filibusters have stopped what are \nso-called ``cloture motions,'' closing down the debate and moving on \nwith business. It takes 60 votes for a cloture vote. In other words, 60 \nSenators have to agree to stop a filibuster and move forward.\n  In the history of the Senate, the record number of filibusters for \nany 2-year period of time has been 62--62 filibusters in a 2-year \nperiod. Last year, the Republican minority broke that record, smashed \nthat record by initiating 62 filibusters in 1 year. Sixty-two times the \nRepublican minority stopped our efforts on the floor of the Senate to \nmove forward to try to change things in America--62 times.\n  The Republican Party is known as the Grand Old Party--the GOP. It \nturns out that when it comes to Senate Republicans, GOP stands for \nGraveyard Of Progress. That is what they are trying to make the Senate.\n  On February 28 we brought up a measure here to deal with America's \nhousing crisis. Is it a serious issue? Is it something the Senate \nshould take the time away from our wonderful patriotic speeches and try \nto address? I think it is. More than 2 million Americans face \nforeclosure. In my home State of Illinois, we are facing record numbers \nof foreclosures. In States such as Nevada and California and all over \nthe United States, foreclosures are at record numbers on mortgages of \nhomes.\n  Is it an important issue for more than 2 million families? It is. \nBecause when a home goes into a foreclosure and is sold at lower than \nfair market value, it affects the value of the homes in the \nneighborhood. So when they ask you: What is the value of your home, \nSenator Durbin, in Springfield, IL, you say: Well, let's look and see \nsome of the recent sales in his neighborhood--comparable values, as \nthey call them. If, around the block, one of my neighbors has lost a \nhome in foreclosure, that has a negative impact on the value of my \nhome. So 2 million mortgage foreclosures have a ripple effect across \nthe housing economy and diminish the value of 44 million homes, 22 \nhomes for every home in foreclosure. One says: Well, 44 million homes \nin a nation of 300 million people, it is still not that big a deal, is \nit? It is. Forty-four million private residences reflect one-third of \nall of the private residences owned in America. Two million mortgage \nforeclosures and one out of three homeowners who dutifully make their \nmortgage payments every single month without a problem see the value of \ntheir home go down. In fact, we are seeing a rising number of people in \nAmerica holding a mortgage on their home at a value that is higher than \nthe actual value of their home. They are under water, as we say. They \nhave a debt, a mortgage, which is greater than the value of their home.\n  This has an impact on our overall economy. Over 70 percent of the \npeople in America today, when asked if they will buy a home, say no. \nYou say: Is that because you can't find a mortgage for your home? They \nsay: No, I can find a mortgage. I just don't think it is a good \ninvestment.\n  Think about that statement. For as long as I have been around, a home \nwas always your best investment. I can remember when my wife and I \nstretched and squeezed and sacrificed to get our first home, how proud \nwe were. We weren't sure we could make those monthly payments. It was a \nstretch to do it. But we knew it was the right thing for our kids, for \nour family, for our neighborhood, and for ourselves, because a home is \ngoing to go up in value. At least that was the theory until recently. \nNow homes are going down in value and people are not buying. Homes sit \nvacant, not only foreclosed homes but other homes where people are \ntrying to sell them to move on to a different location or to a better \nplace. You see the signs all over America: For Sale, For Sale. It is a \nreminder that the housing crisis which brought us into this recession \nis still very much an issue today.\n  On February 28, the Democratic majority said to our friends on the \nRepublican side: Let us act as Senators. Let us deal with an issue that \nhas relevance to today's economy and to families all over the Nation. \nWe have a plan. We have a proposal, a housing stimulus package, with \nfour or five key points in it which I will mention in a moment. We want \nto bring that bill to the floor and we want our friends on the \nRepublican side--and even Democratic Senators if they wish--to offer \namendments about housing so their best ideas can be considered.\n\n  What I have described sounds dangerously like the tradition of a \ndeliberative body such as the Senate; we would actually take an \nimportant American issue, bring it to the floor, debate it, open it to \namendment, do our best to come up with something that will pass, match \nwhat the folks do in the House of Representatives, and maybe end up \nwith a law--a law that can strengthen our economy. That is the normal \nway we do business--or at least normal until this Republican minority \ncame to power.\n  What happened on February 28? Well, we needed about nine Republicans \nto join the Democrats so we could move forward in the debate. Only one \nstepped up, so we didn't have enough votes. So the housing stimulus \npackage died on February 28. The Republican minority refused to even \ndebate it. They wouldn't even bring it up on the floor. Nothing was \ngoing to stop them from offering relevant amendments to this housing \npackage. They didn't even want to have an opportunity to offer those \namendments. They didn't want the debate.\n  I think I know why. They are doing their best to make sure that this \nCongress, under the Democrats, ends up in the same position as the \nprevious Congress, under Republicans, of doing nothing about the issues \nthat count for America.\n  But we are not giving up. We are coming back today. In about 20 \nminutes we will break for lunch and after that, we will come back for a \nvote on the floor and we will try to return to this housing stimulus \npackage. We will give the Republicans a chance to join us. I say to my \nfriends on the Republican side who may be watching this on C-SPAN in \ntheir offices or other places: Don't be afraid of a debate. Don't be \nafraid of amendments. Isn't that why we ran for office, to address the \nimportant issues facing America, to debate the merits of a good idea or \na bad idea, and to take a vote to be on record. If we are going to run \naway from an issue as central to the economy as the housing crisis, we \nare becoming irrelevant. It is little wonder that the approval rating \nof Congress is as low as it is when the Republicans continue to \nfilibuster, continue to stop us from even debating something as \ncritical as the housing crisis facing America.\n  So what does the bill do? The basic bill we are talking about here \ndoes several things in an attempt to reduce foreclosures. One of the \nfirst is to make an investment in more counselors. It has to be a scary \nmoment when you receive that letter after you have missed your mortgage \npayment that says you\n\n[[Page S2267]]\n\nare now in default. You are facing foreclosure. We can take your home \naway from you. Some people go through a period of denial. They won't \nlook at the mail. They won't answer the phone. They hope it will all go \naway. But it won't. It gets worse. Others wisely say: I need to talk to \nsomebody. How did I get into this mess? How can I get out of this mess? \nThe people available to talk to them are counselors who sit down and \nsay: OK, don't panic. Do you have an income? How are you doing \notherwise? Do you have a lot of debt? Maybe we can call the bank. Maybe \nwe can find a way to change the terms of your mortgage so you can stay \nthere.\n  These counselors are valuable. In fact, they are invaluable to deal \nwith this mortgage foreclosure crisis. So one of the first things we do \nis to put more funds into counseling so there are people available to \nhelp those facing mortgage foreclosures.\n  We expand refinancing opportunities so that if you can't make it on \nyour old mortgage--let's say you have what is called an ARM, an \nadjustable rate mortgage, and let's say it has hit its reset point--1 \nyear, 3 years, 5 years--and now you have a new interest rate and your \nmonthly payment shot up so high you can't make it. So what are you \ngoing to do? Well, in this bill we set up some refinancing \nopportunities across the Nation so that people who have an income, who \nare responsible, who want to keep their homes, have a chance.\n  We also provide to communities funds through the Community \nDevelopment Block Grant Program to purchase foreclosed properties. \nPeople ought to see what I have seen repeatedly on the west side of \nChicago, over by the United Center where the Chicago Bulls play \nbasketball. There is a great little area on the west side just getting \na start that has been rebuilding neighborhoods that have been kind of \nbeaten up for a long time with nice homes. Smack dab in the middle of \nthese nice homes is this boarded-up home, with trash in what used to be \na nice front yard. It looks awful. Right next door to it live two \nfamilies who clearly care about their homes, and there sits that \nforeclosed home smack dab in the middle. It is up for auction. When it \ngoes up for auction, it is not likely to even get fair market value, \nand it is going to hurt the value of all of the other homes in the \nneighborhood.\n  One of the things we try to do is offer communities some funds to \nstep in on foreclosures before that house is abandoned and run down in \nvalue and hurts the whole community. We also expand a carryback period \nfor businesses, particularly to help those in the housing industry who \nhave had a rough go of it kind of weather the storm so they can \nsurvive.\n  Jack Reed of Rhode Island, my colleague, passed the Truth In Lending \ndisclosure requirement for real estate closings.\n  If you have ever sat through a real estate closing, you know there \nare a stack of papers like this, and they turn the pages and say: Keep \nsigning. And in 20 minutes you walk out the door and say: What the heck \ndid I just sign? Senator Jack Reed wants to have a cover sheet that has \nthe basics on it so everybody initials it and signs it so they know \ntheir interest rate, what the term of the loan is, how much they are \nborrowing, if the interest rate can change, what the monthly payment \nis, what it could be--the high and low points--and is there a penalty \nfor prepayment--basic things, so they don't walk out in a mystery as to \nwhat they just signed.\n  Then there is a provision I have in there which the mortgage bankers \nhate like the devil hates holy water. Why do mortgage bankers hate this \nprovision? First, let me introduce you to this group. The mortgage \nbankers were the industry that brought us this mess of subprime \nmortgages.\n  They were the ones who started peddling mortgages that made no sense, \nconvincing people who were caught off guard, or deceived, saying: Oh, \nof course you can afford this home; these are interest-only payments. \nDon't worry about it. Just look at the monthly payment, don't worry \nabout it. And, listen, when it is supposed to reset and the payment \ngoes up, you come back to me and I will refinance it. You know these \nhomes will keep going up in value forever.\n  A lot of unsuspecting people signed on to these mortgages. Some of \nthem were elderly, and most of them were without advanced degrees in \nfinance, and some were duped into this by come-on deception \nadvertising. But the fact is, they signed on for the so-called subprime \nmortgages.\n  Well, those are the folks who are going through trouble now. There \nare about 2.2 million of them. About one-third of them will end up in \nBankruptcy Court. They will go into chapter 11 where you walk in and \nsay to the judge: I am making an income, I am not out of work, but I \nhave all these debts. Under chapter 11, the bankruptcy judge can start \nrestructuring your debts, try to find a way through the mess so that at \nthe end of the day you can get it back together again. About one-third \nof the people facing foreclosure will be in that position.\n  Now, let's assume you walk into that bankruptcy court and you have a \nnumber of things you own. I will give you some examples; some are \nunusual. You own your home, you own a ranch, a vacation condo, and you \nown a yacht. I know most people don't own yachts, but let's use this \nexample. Maybe it is just a big boat. What can that bankruptcy judge do \nwhen it comes to what you owe? Well, he can take your ranch and modify \nthe terms of the mortgage. He can take your vacation condo in Florida \nand modify the terms of the mortgage. He can take your yacht, or big \nboat, and modify the terms of what you owe on your yacht.\n  What about your home? No way. The law says the bankruptcy court \ncannot modify the terms of your mortgage on your home. It is prohibited \nby law. What is that all about? This is a graphic illustration of a \nyacht--and I don't know any Senator who owns one. But here is a yacht \nand here is a home. The bankruptcy court can renegotiate the terms for \nthe yacht but not for the home. My bill says you will have a chance to \nrenegotiate the terms of your home, but there are strict limitations.\n  First, this doesn't apply to everybody. You have to have an existing \nmortgage, not anything that you could enter into at a future date. \nSecond, it has to be a home, not a property you bought for speculation. \nThird, you have to qualify to go into bankruptcy court. Fourth, when \nthey modify the mortgage, they cannot lower the principal below the \nfair market value of the home. Many foreclosure proceedings don't end \nup at fair market value. Fifth, the interest rate they can impose on \nthe new mortgage cannot be anything less than the prime rate, plus a \npremium for risk. Sixth, if the home you have refinanced goes up in \nvalue in the next 5 years, the bank, the lender, gets the increase in \nvalue. You are protecting the lender on both ends--no lower than fair \nmarket value and any increase in value goes to the lender.\n  Now, the mortgage bankers, God bless them, say this is the end of \nWestern civilization as we know it. If these people are able to stay in \ntheir home under these circumstances, interest rates will go up all \nacross the country. The Georgetown Law Center said this:\n\n       Taken as a whole, our analysis of the current historical \n     data suggests that permitting bankruptcy modification of \n     mortgages would have no or little impact on mortgage markets.\n\n  I have talked to these bankers. This doesn't make sense. Unregulated, \nunsupervised, without oversight, they dragged us into this mortgage \ncrisis with millions of people and their homes on the line, and our \neconomy is teetering on recession, the values of homes across America \nare in peril, and now they will not even allow us to help these \nfamilies who will end up in bankruptcy court.\n  I would like to have a vote on that. I would like to ask my friends \non the Republican side of the aisle to, at 2:15 or 2:30, have a vote on \nthis issue. If you don't want to fight fires, don't be a firefighter. \nIf you don't want to cast a vote on an important issue in America \ntoday, don't run for the Senate. If you want to be in the Senate and be \npart of this national debate, for goodness sakes, vote to proceed to \nthis bill. Let's not litter this graveyard of filibusters with this \nimportant housing stimulus bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the motion to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n\n[[Page S2268]]\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me first recognize the contribution of \nmy colleague from Illinois with respect to the bankruptcy provision. He \nexplained it extremely well. What it does is give homeowners a chance \nto get out from underneath a collapsing housing market in the United \nStates. It has been well tailored and it is responsible and I think we \nshould adopt it quickly in this package that is going forward.\n  The whole housing crisis is a reflection of a much deeper economic \nmalaise that is gripping the country. We are seeing skyrocketing prices \nin terms of energy and foodstuffs. On the recess I visited two Italian \nbakeries in Rhode Island. They have been family-owned companies for \nover 100 years, and they have never seen the runup in prices of wheat \nthey have seen over the last several weeks and months.\n  The final thing is that we are losing jobs now. In the last 2 months, \nwe have lost many jobs. We lost 63,000 jobs last month. That is the \nlargest monthly decline in jobs in 5 years. The national unemployment \nrate is 4.8. In Rhode Island it is 5.8 percent. We are seeing an \neconomy sliding into recession. Key to this, in my view, to reconcile \nand try to stop the erosion of economic opportunity in this country is \nto stabilize the housing market. That is what the package of proposals \nthat we will vote on this afternoon attempts to do.\n  We have a situation in this country where incomes have been flat for \nthe last 8 years for most Americans--unless you were extraordinarily \ncompensated at the highest levels. But if you are a working man or \nwoman, low income, middle income, or even upper middle income, your \nincome has been relatively flat. You have seen accelerated costs. The \nlast thing people had in their tool kit, if you will, was the value of \ntheir homes. They could draw on that in emergencies and use it to help \nchildren go to college. They could use it if there was an unexpected \nexpense.\n  Now, with declining housing values, American families are being \nsqueezed dramatically--job losses, increasing prices, flat incomes, and \nnow declining housing values. In fact, it has been estimated that today \nin the United States the value of homes fell below 50 percent of \nequity--the ratio of equity fell below 50 percent for the first time in \na long time.\n  We are also looking at a situation where there is a record number of \nforeclosures. Just this morning, coming into work and listening to the \nradio, I heard in Montgomery County, MD, there is a huge acceleration \nof foreclosures in that suburb. It is also happening across the \ncountry. In the Providence Journal in Rhode Island, there used to be \nmaybe two, three pages of foreclosures on a high number. Now there is a \nwhole section devoted to foreclosures.\n  This is becoming a problem not just for individual households but for \ncommunities because the value of a foreclosed home brings down the \nvalue of the surrounding homes. It is a cascading effect. It ruins \ncommunities as well as impairs the credit and lives and the \nopportunities of individual families. We have to do much more to stem \nthis decline, particularly with respect to housing values.\n  Yesterday, I noted that Secretary Paulson announced significant \nsteps, he proclaimed, to begin to revise the regulation of financial \ninstitutions, and part of it is prompted by the subprime mortgage \ncrisis, the securitization of these loans. There is nothing in his \nblueprint that dealt with the most important aspect of the problem, and \nthat is home values. The administration has been very keen and quick to \nhelp Wall Street. The reality is we have to help Main Street, \nindividual homeowners across this country. If we do I think that will \nprovide a surge of confidence to the economy, which is the key factor \nin beginning a recovery from what looks like the beginning of a \nrecession, and perhaps a long recession, unless we act promptly.\n  I have joined my colleagues to introduce this legislation, the \nForeclosure Prevention Act of 2008, which builds on the economic \nstimulus package. It is a complement to it. I hope we can move today, \ndespite previous opposition by my colleagues on the Republican side, to \ntake up this legislation and begin the debate and modify it, if \nnecessary, but move forward deliberately and quickly to address the \nissue of housing in the United States.\n  This legislation, if enacted, would help families keep their homes by \nproviding counseling for foreclosures, by expanding refinancing \nopportunities, and by getting the services and the counselors together \nto attempt to allow people to stay in their homes. One aspect of this, \nas mentioned by my colleague from Illinois, is the Bankruptcy Code \nmodification that would allow these residences to be subject to a \nbankruptcy judge's determination of a different workout plan for the \nhome. It also helps communities withstand the impact of foreclosures, \nas there is a cascading effect. If one home is foreclosed, the value of \nother homes begins to decline automatically. This would provide \ncommunity development block grants to cities to purchase some of these \nhomes. We have to move quickly because one of the other aspects is when \nthese homes in urban areas are empty for a matter of weeks, or even, in \nsome cases days, they are stripped--the siding is ripped off, or the \ncopper plumbing is taken out. Unless there is someone to go in there \nand keep it in use or to board it up and protect it, then these homes \nare going to be a loss not just temporarily but for a longer term.\n  This is going to help businesses by expanding the carry-back period \nfrom 2 to 5 years to utilize losses incurred in 2006 and 2007 and 2008. \nIt is going to help, I hope, avoid foreclosure in the future. It will \ndeal with the issue of clear disclosure of a maximum amount of a loan \nand maximum monthly payment legislation that I authored. This will give \na bumper sticker or a big warning label on a mortgage to individual \nborrowers and tell them the maximum amount of money they have liability \nfor. So the introductory teaser rate of $1,000 a month might be \nattractive, but if people realize that within a year or 2 years they \nwill be paying two or three times that, it will give them the \ninformation they need to make a better judgment about signing up for \nthat loan.\n  So this legislation is critical to families, and it is particularly \ncritical, I think, to ensure that we begin to work our way out of the \nlooming recession and an economy that is deeply troubled. I hope all my \ncolleagues will vote to go forward with this measure and, I hope, pass \nthis measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2268-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the motion to reconsider the vote by which cloture was not \ninvoked on the motion to proceed to H.R. 3221. The motion to reconsider \nis agreed to, and there will now be 15 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. \n3221, with the majority leader controlling the second half of that \ntime.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the majority leader and I have had good \nconversations this morning, and a few moments ago, we reached an \nagreement on how to go forward on the housing bill. That agreement is \nas follows: that Senator Dodd, the chairman\n\n[[Page S2269]]\n\nof the Banking Committee, and Senator Shelby, the ranking member, would \ncome together after we invoke cloture on the motion to proceed and come \nup with a bipartisan substitute to be offered as an amendment to the \nbill upon which we are about to invoke cloture to proceed. That would \nbe the underlying bill that would enjoy the confidence and support of \nthe two leaders of the Banking Committee.\n  Most of my conference is very comfortable with that proposal. We \nunderstand fully there will be amendments after that, but that will at \nleast give us an opportunity to get off on a bipartisan footing, \nreminiscent of the good work we were able to do earlier this year not \nonly on the foreign intelligence surveillance bill but also on the \neconomic stimulus package where we were able to come together and, by \nsignificant bipartisan majorities, pass the legislation.\n  We all know we have problems with housing in this country. Most of us \nbelieve we need to enact legislation to try to improve this situation. \nMany of these proposals are supported by people on both sides of the \naisle. So this would give us a chance to begin in a way that is \ncomforting to both sides before we open the process to amendments.\n  The majority leader has also assured me he has no intention of \nfilling up the tree or employing any of the other techniques the \nmajority is certainly free to do but which have a way of locking down \nthe process on the minority side.\n  This has been a very good discussion, leading up to a process by \nwhich I think we can go forward and hopefully get something important \nfor the country--I see my good friend, the leader of the Banking \nCommittee, on the floor--get something important for the country \naccomplished in the Senate this week.\n  I thank the majority leader for his approach to this issue. I think \nit is entirely appropriate and gives us a good opportunity to move \nforward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the smoke is housing crisis foreclosures. \nThe fire is the general economy because the housing crisis has caused \nthe economy to be in a state of distress.\n  The chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Dodd, made such an \noutstanding presentation this morning where he talked about almost \n8,000 homes every day--today, tomorrow, and the foreseeable future--\nwill be foreclosed upon, not the beginning process of foreclosure, but \nthe termination of foreclosure. Someone by the name of Jones, Smith--\nwhatever their name might be--will lose their home, a family home.\n  What does that do to the neighborhood? Every time there is a home \nforeclosed upon, it immediately causes the rest of the neighborhood to \nbe worth less money. What does it do to the government entity where \nthat home is located? The government entity loses the ability to get \ntax money. No one benefits from foreclosures.\n  This is a step in the right direction. In Nevada, for example, 1 out \nof every 165 homes was in foreclosure in February. Can you imagine \nthat, 1 out of every 165 homes. That is the highest rate in Nevada. We \nare fortunate we have a lot of construction that is not housing related \nthat is going to pull us through this situation. It is important that \nwe move forward on this legislation.\n  The underlying bill is a so-called Democratic bill. This bill, if we \nare able to accomplish something, will be a Senate bill. Democrats and \nRepublicans can go home and take credit for doing something to help the \nproblem.\n  Are we going to be able to resolve all the problems in housing? Of \ncourse not. But we can make a tremendous step forward, and that is what \nwe intend to do.\n  I have worked with Senator Shelby from the time we were in the House \ntogether. We shared office space. His office in the Longworth Building \nwas next to mine. I have the highest regard for him. I spoke with him \nthis morning. I believe he and the chairman of the committee, Senator \nDodd, are going to be able to come up with something that I hope I can \nsupport, but it is going to be bipartisan. They are going to agree on \nthis and offer it as the first amendment when we get to this \nlegislation. If something goes wrong, if someone is being mischievous \nabout that legislation, Senator McConnell and I will meet again.\n  The goal is to do something about housing. We are not going to solve \nthe problems of Iraq on this bill. We are not going to solve the tax \npolicy of this country on this bill. We are not going to solve global \nwarming on this housing bill. But we need to do something the American \npeople recognize is bipartisan as it relates to housing, and we are \ngoing to do everything we can.\n  I believe the time has come for us to start legislating and stop \ntalking about the need to legislate.\n  Mr. President, a vote has been called for 2:30. If there is someone \nelse who wishes to speak, they certainly have the opportunity for the \nnext few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader \nand the Republican leader, as well, for their efforts. I thank Senator \nShelby, who is not here. We will do our very best over the next number \nof hours to pull together a package that reflects----\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. One of the points I did not talk about with the \ndistinguished leader is that I think it would be appropriate that we, \nafter the vote is completed, go into a period for morning business \nuntil 12 o'clock noon tomorrow to see, if, in fact, we can get the two \ndistinguished Senators to come up with a substitute. We need some \ndeadline. That is as good as any, unless my friend has a better time \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader, that \nmakes sense. I am convinced we are all operating on good faith and \nSenator Shelby and Senator Dodd will work hard to come up with a \nproposal they will come forward with.\n  Mr. REID. During this afternoon and in the morning, people can talk \nabout housing or anything else they want. We will be in a period for \nmorning business.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the leaders. That will be our goal \nand job, to begin that process immediately. We will keep the leadership \ninformed as it progresses. We all thank the two leaders immensely. I \nthank Senator Reid for his efforts going back months ago. This is a \nproblem that is growing by the hour. It demands our attention. This is \nthe contagion effect we read about now spreading far beyond the housing \nissue, per se. It is now leaching into all aspects of our economy. It \nhas even gone beyond our shores, obviously, to other nations that are \ndeeply affected by what happens here economically. This is a moment \nwhen we have to come together as a body and come up with some \nresponsible answers.\n  I will say in advance that none of us can say with any certainty that \nwhich we offer will solve the problem, but I think we bear an \nobligation to try, to do one thing that is more important than any \nspecific idea we proposed, and that is help restore the confidence of \nthe American people and those directly involved in the financial well-\nbeing of our Nation and that is to restore confidence, which is \nmissing; we need to get that confidence back. The very fact our leaders \nhave called upon us to pull together is going to be a confidence-\nbuilding measure. It will be complemented by what we do, but it begins \nwith the offer made by the distinguished majority leader, accepted by \nthe Republican leader, that we sit down and try to work this situation \nout.\n  I can tell you in advance that the American people will react \nfavorably to this effort, and hopefully we will offer a product that \nwill complement that effort but beginning with the idea we will work on \nthis problem together. That I commend the majority leader for. I thank \nthe Republican leader as well.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, we have just concluded a 2-week recess. We \nhave come back to the Capitol, rested and prepared to get to work on \nthe Nation's business. At the top of the list for most people, at least \nbased on what I heard in my State and likely what Senators have heard \nfrom coast to coast, is the desire for us to get to work on the \neconomy. There are other concerns--the war in Iraq, the cost of health \ncare, the list goes on--but at the top of the list is the economy, \nharking back to the Clinton campaign in 1992: ``It is the economy, \nstupid.'' It has been for a long time, and it certainly is again today.\n  During the time I spent in Delaware, I visited a lot of places, \nincluding a number of schools. One of the questions a group of young \npeople asked me was, what did I like most about my job. There are a \nnumber of things I enjoy about serving in the Senate. I love helping \npeople. We have the opportunity to do that through constituent services \nand other ways every day. That is a source of great satisfaction. I \nknow it is to the Presiding Officer and others of our colleagues. Among \nthe other things that bring me great joy is from time to time we are \nable to take folks who have different views on a particular issue and \nactually pull them together to work as one, to develop consensus around \nissues.\n  We need to develop a consensus on a path forward with respect to the \nhousing situation, the meltdown we have seen, especially with subprime \nmortgages and the threat that meltdown poses to binding together, \ntightening up and bringing to a halt the flow of money through our \neconomy, through the banking system.\n  I am encouraged by the vote we just had where 94 Senators voted to \nproceed to the housing bill. Our Democratic leadership has pulled back \nand said: We will not try to push forward with five or six actually \nvery constructive elements in an earlier version of our proposal but \nprovide time for Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby to work with others on \nthe Banking Committee and other colleagues who are not on the committee \nto put together a broader consensus that builds on the package we voted \nnot to proceed to 2 weeks ago. We can do those but more as well.\n  Let me express my hope that the elements of the package Senators Dodd \nand Shelby bring back to us include the ability for housing authorities \nto issue revenue bonds, the proceeds of which could be used to help \nfolks refinance their mortgages, people in danger of losing their \nhomes. I am not interested in rewarding bad behavior, in rewarding \ninvestors or bankers who made bad decisions or, frankly, individual \nborrowers who made decisions that were inappropriate or wrong, where \nthey misrepresented their financial standing. I don't think we want to \nreward bad behavior. But there are a lot of people in danger. We have \nsome 8,000 people who will have their homes foreclosed on today, \ntomorrow, the next day, and the next. That is a clear signal to me we \nneed to do something.\n  We can do some things that will make a difference without breaking \nthe Treasury. Let me mention a couple elements of what I hope will be \nin the housing package that we might bring back to the floor. One of \nthose is FHA modernization. Some people recall 75 years ago the Federal \nHousing Administration was established.\n  People wonder where the 30-year fixed rate mortgage came from. It \ncame from FHA. A lot of people own a home today because their loan was \nguaranteed by the FHA. My first home loan was guaranteed by the VA for \nthe house I bought when I came back from Southeast Asia at the end of \nthe Vietnam war. Not even 10 years ago, but 5, 10 years ago, almost 20 \npercent of the people in this country got a mortgage that was \nguaranteed by the FHA. As recently as last year, that number is down to \n5 percent. The FHA oftentimes has helped to insure mortgages of people \nwho have a questionable credit rating, people who were maybe a first-\ntime home buyer for whom a lot of banks were reluctant to provide a \nmortgage without the guarantee that maybe an FHA or a VA would offer. \nBut FHA-guaranteed mortgages dropped from almost 20 percent of all \nmortgages a half dozen or more years ago, down to about 5 percent \ntoday.\n  The drop between 20 percent or whatever it is down to 5 percent \nreflects the number of people who used to go to FHA for help, who today \nor in recent months and years have instead taken advantage of these \nadjustable rate mortgages that have low teaser introductory rates that \nreset after a couple years, that have a clause in them that makes it \ndifficult, if not impossible, or at least very expensive, to refinance \nthe mortgage. Those people are stuck.\n\n[[Page S2271]]\n\nThere are a couple of million of them who have been stuck with \nadjustable rate mortgages, high teaser rates that are going up, and \nfinding it difficult to get out of that situation. For those folks who \nhave been in that situation, maybe people with somewhat marginal \ncredit, people who are first-time home buyers, I don't want them to \nlook for adjustable rate mortgages for salvation. I want them to see \nthe FHA as relevant in their lives.\n  What we need to do is bring the FHA into the 21st century to make it \nrelevant to today's borrowers' needs.\n  Senators Dodd and Shelby have been working with Representatives Frank \nand Baucus on legislation we passed in the Senate. The House has passed \nFHA modernization legislation. I think they are close to consensus. My \nhope is we can find consensus. And when we take up later this week, \nhopefully, a bipartisan housing recovery bill, a centerpiece of that \nwill be FHA modernization. We ought to do that. It is something we all \nagree on, Democrats and Republicans, the President, and, frankly, a lot \nof people around the country, borrowers and lenders too.\n  The second piece that ought to be in this package will be the \nauthorization that we would provide for housing authorities throughout \nthe country to issue mortgage revenue bonds, tax exempt revenue bonds, \nthe proceeds of which could be not only used for first-time home \nbuyers, not just for multifamily housing, affordable housing, but also \ncould be used to provide moneys to help people refinance their \nmortgage, people in some jeopardy. The administration supports that \nidea. Secretary Paulson testified before our committee in favor of that \nidea. It is part of the Democratic package that we sought to bring to \nthe floor 2 weeks ago. It ought to be part of the consensus package \nthat we will take up later this week.\n  There are any number of other good ideas that hopefully will be part \nof the package. Senator Jack Reed from Rhode Island has a very good \nidea that seems to be acceptable on a lot of fronts, to provide for \ngreater transparency for borrowers as people go to the credit markets \nto look for mortgages, to make sure they know what they are getting and \nget a good deal, a fair deal.\n  Senator Martinez and Senator Feinstein have a proposal. I believe it \nis one that deals with the appraisals, to make sure the appraisals that \nback up the homes that are being bought or sold are actually real and \nnot just an appraisal put together, pulled out of thin air because \nsomebody drove by a house and slapped a value on it by looking at it \nthrough a windshield.\n  I think Senator Martinez has another good idea with respect to \nlicensing mortgage brokers. It may not be perfect and is something that \ncan be worked on further, but something along those lines should be \npart of this package.\n  Senator Isakson has an idea and is actually something I think was \ndone maybe when President Ford was President. Senator Isakson's idea is \nif you have a home--let's say all 100 desks in the Senate Chamber are \nall homes. There is one for each Senator. Maybe this home right here is \nin foreclosure, and it is blighting the value of this home and that \nhome and those homes all around it. The folks in this neighborhood \nwould love to have somebody come and live in this home, somebody who is \ngoing to take care of that property and maintain that property but also \nhelp to maintain the value of the other properties.\n  What Senator Isakson does is provide a tax credit--I think he is \nsaying $5,000 per year--for somebody who comes in and not just buys \nthat home but lives in that home as the owner and the occupier. To the \nextent they do that, they get a $5,000 tax credit. He suggested we do \nthat over 3 years, which would mean $15,000 for 3 years. That could be \npretty expensive. I have suggested to him we try to find a way to bring \ndown the cost of his proposal. My hope is we can do that and include \nthat in the final bill we come up with.\n  Another idea that has merit is to increase somewhat the appropriation \nfor community development block grants and to say to State and local \ngovernments they can use some of the proceeds from this money to take a \nhome that is in foreclosure and do something to prepare it to be sold \nand to restore the value of that home and to restore the vitality of \nthe neighborhood in which it is now decaying.\n  In short, there is no shortage of good ideas. Some of them are \nauthored by Democrats and offered by Democrats, and in some cases they \nare authored and offered by our Republican colleagues. In some cases \nthey are ideas that enjoy bipartisan support. At the end of the day, \ntogether they fashion a pretty good package that will help make a real \ndifference, and a difference in not a couple years but literally in a \ncouple of months.\n  The last thing I would say is, one of the more controversial \nprovisions in the package that came to us actually last month from our \nDemocratic leaders is a provision dealing with bankruptcy and would \nextend to bankruptcy judges the ability to go in and not only adjust \ninterest rates on mortgages for homes that are in foreclosure or about \nto go into foreclosure but also to adjust the amount of the mortgage \nitself.\n  That has caused a lot of concern about the chilling effect it may \nhave on interest rates for primary homes in the future. I give Senator \nDurbin credit. He has tried to amend his earlier proposal to address \nthe concerns--the legitimate concerns--that have been raised. I think \nhe has acted in good faith. I know Senator Specter has a little \ndifferent proposal on this approach. I think Senator Dodd has been \nworking along with Representative Frank over in the House on kind of a \nvariation of an earlier idea suggested, I think, by the head of the \nOffice of Thrift Supervision--the folks who supervise the savings and \nloan industry--to try to make sure we address the issue of a homeowner \nwhose home is not in foreclosure but whose mortgage is underwater.\n  I will give you an example. You have a home that has been bought for \n$200,000. Today the home is worth $160,000, and the person who owns the \nhome is thinking about literally walking away from their mortgage, \nwalking away from their home. You can do that today for about $1,000, I \nam told, working through a company that will help you walk away from \nyour home mortgage. The person who walks away becomes a renter, and the \nobligation they have to continue to have to pay the mortgage goes away. \nYou end up with a home that is in foreclosure. The banks do not want to \nbe stuck with those properties. The folks in the neighborhood of the \nhome being foreclosed on do not want that to happen in their \nneighborhood.\n  I think Senator Dodd and Representative Frank have a very \nconstructive idea--not a perfect idea but a good idea--that can go \nforth. It requires some sacrifice on the part of the lenders. It \nrequires some sacrifice and give on the part of the borrowers. But it \nalso leaves them a home in the end, at least, where they still have a \nlittle bit of equity and a good reason not to walk away from their \nhome, triggering a foreclosure.\n\n  The last thing I will mention--this is an idea that is not new, but \nwe have been hearing testimony about this for a couple years--we have \nthree major Government-sponsored enterprises, not counting Ginne Mae, \nbut three major Government-sponsored enterprises whose job it is to \nhelp raise money and to provide liquidity and safety for the housing \nmarket in this country. One is Fannie Mae, another is Freddie Mac, and \nthe third is a little bit different kind of an animal called Federal \nhome loan banks. There are about 12 of those throughout our country.\n  The way we buy homes has changed a whole lot over the years. When I \nbought my first home in Delaware, I went to a bank. They agreed to make \nthe mortgage. I borrowed the money. I think it was about $40,000. They \nborrowed the money and they held my mortgage. They held my mortgage, \nand every month they would send me a statement, and I would send them a \ncheck to make my payment. They held the mortgage for years and years \nand years.\n  It does not work that way anymore. Today you go to your local thrift \nor bank, and they make a mortgage to help a person buy a home, and the \nbank may decide to hold the mortgage. They may decide to service the \nmortgage. But in most cases, they don't. In a lot of cases they turn \naround and they sell the mortgage to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac are huge financial institutions. They package these \nhome mortgages together\n\n[[Page S2272]]\n\nfrom all kinds of financial institutions that originally made the \nmortgages from across the country, and they put them together into \ninvestments called mortgage-backed securities, and those mortgage-\nbacked securities are sold to investors all over this country and all \nover the world.\n  The problem with the mortgage-backed securities is when you have a \ndrop in home values, you have a problem with homeowners, borrowers not \nmaking their mortgage payments. When you have a problem with the \nunderlying homes that make up these mortgage-backed securities going \ninto foreclosure and mortgage payments not being collected, the value \nof those mortgage-backed securities drops. The companies, the investors \nwho are holding those mortgage-backed securities are getting into \ntrouble, and we have a situation where liquidity in our banking system \nbegins to dry up.\n  When the liquidity in the banking system dries up, two things can \nhelp start a recession. One of those is that when people think we are \ngoing into a recession, it can be a self-fulfilling prophecy because \npeople stop spending money. They stop spending money and, lo and \nbehold, we have a recession. Another way we have recessions is that the \nbanking system stops working. They stop making loans. Liquidity is sort \nof like the blood in our veins. The liquidity goes away in our \nfinancial systems and our economy. That is part of what we face today.\n  The two entities that do the most in terms of trying to make sure we \ncontinue to have liquidity in our banking system are Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac when they buy these mortgages from banks that have made \nmortgages to individual borrowers. Then they package these mortgages. \nSometimes they sell them around the world. Sometimes they hold those \nmortgage-backed securities in their own portfolio. In some cases, the \nfolks at Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, I guess, actually hold individual \nmortgages for a while. They do some of that as well.\n  The problem with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is, they have run into \ntrouble in the last couple years because they do not have a very strong \nregulator. They do not have a strong, independent regulator. We have \nheld many hearings for a couple years trying to figure out how we \nprovide a strong, independent regulator and at the same time make sure \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac do not repeat the sins and mistakes of their \npast few years. How do we do that in a way and at the same time create \nan affordable housing fund much as we have with the Federal home loan \nbanks?\n  My hope is--if not in this package that is, hopefully, going to \nemerge from these discussions in the next day or two--in the next week \nor two, maybe month or so, the Banking Committee can move together and \nreport out a consensus package on regulatory reform to provide a \nstrong, independent regulator for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the \nFederal home loan banks. That would be another good thing for our \ncountry and for those of us who want to buy homes and sell homes.\n  Let me close with this: Going back to the beginning of the year, as \nour economy started to slip into what may be a recession--and we will \nfind out in another quarter or so if it really has been a recession--as \nwe began to slip, the Federal Reserve, actually starting last fall, \nbegan to use its monetary powers, first of all, to lower the Federal \nfunds rate--the rate at which banks charge one another for lending \nmoney between themselves at the end of every day--they started lowering \nthe Federal funds rate rather dramatically--in fact, more dramatically \nthan I have ever seen in my life.\n\n  The Federal Reserve has made it possible to encourage more banks, \nmore financial institutions, regular financial institutions, and even \ninvestment banks to come to the discount window to borrow money to meet \ntheir problems. The Federal Reserve has gone so far as to even help \nmake possible for JPMorgan Chase to come in and take over Bear Stearns \nso it would not collapse into bankruptcy and trigger maybe an even \nworse situation.\n  While the shareholders of Bear Stearns have taken a shellacking--I \nthink they ended up getting about $2 per share for their stock; Bear \nStearns' stock had been valued at over $100 not long ago--the \nshareholders took a loss, but at least it did not cause sort of a \ndomino effect in a failure of our financial system. The Federal Reserve \nhas been involved in that.\n  The Federal Reserve has been willing to take from financial \ninstitutions their mortgage-backed securities and replace them with \nTreasury securities to put some liquidity back into the banking system. \nThe Federal Reserve has been terrific. It has been very helpful in \nterms of putting liquidity back into the system but also raising the \nconfidence of consumers, the confidence of our constituents, and us \ntoo. So that is one that has happened.\n  The second thing we have done, Congress and the President working \ntogether, is we have agreed, about 2 months ago, upon a stimulus \npackage. Is the stimulus package one I would have written or maybe the \nPresiding Officer would have written? Probably not. But on balance, it \ndoes more good than bad, and we expect to see a boost in our gross \ndomestic product in the second half of this year of maybe 1, 1.5 \npercentage points. That is going to be a nice lift to the economy as we \nstruggle to either shorten a recession or to abridge one altogether.\n  The third piece that is still waiting to be done--after the Federal \nReserve has acted in the variety of ways I just described--after the \neffect of this stimulus package begins to kick in, the third thing that \nneeds to be done is we need to take up and develop and pass and send to \nthe President a consensus housing recovery package.\n  The elements I have described already enjoy support, in most cases, \nfrom Democrats and Republicans, including the administration. A lot of \nthe ideas have merit. My hope is we will have, in the next day or two, \nthe opportunity to debate those individual proposals. For folks who \nwant to amend them, in some cases strike them, in other cases to add \nnew provisions, terrific. That is the way this system is supposed to \nwork. That is the way this place is supposed to work.\n  My hope is in a very short while we will be gathered on this floor \noffering amendments to the package that Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby \nand our staffs are going to be working on to get things going, to get \nthings done. The people of my State did not send me here to just talk \nabout our problems. They sent me here to do something about them. We \nhave a great opportunity to take the next step, I say the third in a \ntrilogy of steps, that will help get our economy out of a ditch and \nhopefully head in the right direction.\n  The best thing that can happen is we can demonstrate to people in \nthis country that Democrats and Republicans, in an election year, can \nset aside our political differences and figure out the right thing to \ndo to help stabilize the housing situation and put us on the road to \nrecovery. That is going to lift the spirits of a lot of people and give \nour friends in the media a different kind of story to report--not the \nstory they report day after day after day, a drumbeat of all the things \ngoing wrong in this county, but to start reporting some things that are \ngoing right in this country. As those more positive, uplifting, \ninspirational stories begin to appear, recessions have a way of turning \ninto recoveries. That is exactly what we need right about now.\n  Mr. President, with that, I do not see anyone else waiting to speak \non the floor, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, a few minutes ago I attended a little \npress briefing with Senators Reid, McConnell, Dodd, Shelby, and other \nmembers of both leadership and the Banking Committee. It was a very \ngood meeting because, at the meeting, Senators Reid and McConnell \nempowered Senators Dodd and Shelby to get together and try to come up \nwith a compromise housing package. That is the best news we have had in \nthis housing crisis in weeks and weeks. The eyes of America are looking \nat the Senate and saying: What are you going to do about the housing \ncrisis?\n\n[[Page S2273]]\n\n  Since we last adjourned, we have had a near meltdown on Wall Street. \nSince we last adjourned, new numbers have come out that show thousands \nmore are losing their homes weekly. Since we adjourned, we have seen \nbuying power is down for the average person and housing values are \ndown.\n  For most people, housing is their piece of the rock.\n  That is their largest asset. When they are worried about their home, \nthey are worried about everything. When the middle-class consumer gets \nworried, the economy catches cold, and that is what has happened.\n  Yet for weeks and weeks the Senate has been paralyzed in terms of \ndoing things about housing. We were very quick--the Fed--to go rescue \nWall Street, and they were looking down the abyss. I don't think they \nhad any choice. I was supportive of that. But I am not supportive of a \nbifurcated policy that says when a major financial company gets in \ntrouble, we rush to their aid, but when John and Jane Smith homeowners \nhave trouble, we say: You learn. You are a moral hazard. If we help \nyou, then everyone else will not repay their mortgages. First, the \nargument is unfair. John and Jane are probably more blameless than many \nof those who undercapitalized Bear Stearns and played it right at the \nedge. Second, this moral hazard argument makes no sense. The statistics \nshow that when a homeowner owns his or her home, when a family owns \ntheir home, they do everything to repay that mortgage. They don't go on \nvacation. They don't buy the new suit of clothes for the kid who is \nstarting school. They cut back on what they eat. That nice Friday night \nout at the local restaurant which the family looks forward to goes, all \nso they can pay their mortgage. So this moral hazard argument that if \nwe help people who are blameless makes no sense.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about a typical person who has suffered \nforeclosure. I met many of them. I actually sat down and talked to some \nof them from New York. So that my colleagues can understand, these \ngreat thinkers up in their ivory towers, the conservative think tanks, \nwho are saying: You better learn your lesson, don't even know what is \ngoing on. Let me tell my colleagues about Frank Ruggiero. He is a \nretired subway motorman. He lives in Ozone Park, Queens. His income \nis--I should say was, because Frank passed away a month ago, but that \ndoesn't have anything to do with the story. Frank had a good pension. \nHis union, TWU, provided him a good pension of $28,000. His Social \nSecurity was $11,000, and he had a nice little house in Ozone Park, a \nworking-class neighborhood in Queens, New York City, that was worth--he \nhad paid 16 years of a 30-year mortgage. He hadn't missed a payment, as \nmost homeowners have not. They pay whenever they can.\n  Frank got diabetes. His health care plan would not pay for the \ntreatment the doctor said he needed, and he was desperate. So Frank saw \nan ad in the newspaper and it said: ``Get quick cash. Refinance your \nhome.'' He called up the number and a mortgage broker came over. This \nmortgage broker is unregulated. He didn't come from a bank. He was an \nindependent operator. That is where most of the trouble was, from these \nunregulated mortgage brokers. We are not dealing with that in this \nbill, but we should in a future bill. A bill I have introduced would \ndeal with this issue. Anyway, he asked the mortgage broker: Could I get \n$50,000? He said: Yes. And Frank asked the right question. He said: How \nmuch will my mortgage go to? The mortgage broker said: It will go from \n$1,100 a month to $1,200 in January. Well, Frank thought, I can afford \nthat, so he signs the mortgage deal.\n  Let me say three things about what happened to Frank. Frank is \ntypical--typical. His mortgage did go up to $1,200 a month the next \nJanuary, but the following January, it went up to $3,900 a month. \nFrank's income was $39,000. A quick calculation will show that $3,900 a \nmonth is more than Frank could pay. If he didn't spend one nickel for \nfood, clothing, health care, and everything went to the mortgage, he \nstill wouldn't have enough.\n  Why? Was Frank defrauded? No. On page 37 of this 50-page mortgage \ndocument, it did say the mortgage would go up, but it didn't say so in \na language you or I would understand, only that certain things would \nhappen after this, that, and the other. I think if you read it--and I \nread it--it was deliberately disguised. So there was no fraud. There \nshould have been, but our laws for mortgage brokers don't say it is \nfraudulent to sell somebody a mortgage that is beyond what they can \npay.\n  The second point: Of the $50,000 Frank was supposed to get, guess how \nmuch he got. He got $5,700. You say: $5,700, how could that be? Because \nin that disguised mortgage document, it said the broker would get a \ncommission. What it didn't say is the broker's commission from a \nmortgage company, also unregulated, also not a bank--the higher the \ninterest rate the agent got Frank to sign for, the greater the \ncommission. If it was a no-document loan, which this was no documents--\nanother story for another day, and I will be back on the floor this \nweek, if we are able to debate this bill, and talk about all these \nthings because I have studied this issue and I have been working on it \nfor a long time. It was a no-doc loan, an absurd concept; how investors \nbought no-doc loans is again something we have to look at. But he got \nan additional commission for that.\n\n  Then there was a prepayment penalty. If somehow Frank would prepay \nthis ludicrous mortgage, there would be a big penalty to prepay. When \nshould that ever happen? Those should be outlawed.\n  So this guy got $22,000, the mortgage company got points of $11,000, \nway beyond what any bank would charge or would be allowed to charge. \nBetween the appraiser, the lawyer, and everyone who came with the \npackage, they all took their piece and Frank got $5,700, all because of \nthe structure of the mortgage company. You say: Well, what about the \nmortgage broker? He is probably off in the sunset on his yacht with all \nthe $22,000 he made from duping the Franks of the world. Where is the \nmortgage company? It is bankrupt. Frank is stuck.\n  The third point: Frank was a prime borrower. He had a FICO score \nsomewhere around 700. He had paid his mortgage payment religiously for \n16 years. He had never missed a credit card bill. Frank was one of \nthose old-fashioned people who believed you pay your bills, so he was a \nprime borrower. Sixty percent of those who have subprime mortgages in \nor about to go into foreclosure are prime borrowers. They pay their \nloans. They are not trying to gyp anybody. It is a disgrace. The sad \nfact is if Frank hadn't answered that ad but had walked into a local \nbank, because they are regulated, they would have said to Frank: You \nneed $50,000? Fine. We will sign you a new 30-year fixed-rate mortgage \nand that will cost you $1,500 or $1,600 a month instead of $1,100. That \nwould have been a stretch for the Ruggiero family, but they would have \nmade it. They would have signed it and he would have gotten his money \nand his treatment.\n  What are we saying, that Frank should be punished for what he did? I \nask some of those ideologues from the think tanks and even from the \nother side of the aisle: What did Frank do wrong? What did Frank do \nwrong? What harsh lesson are we going to impose on the Franks of the \nworld, and what will anyone else have to learn from them? So the moral \nhazard argument makes no sense.\n  We have to do something. Now, what this bill contains is something \nSenator Brown and Senator Casey and myself and, with Senator Murray's \nhelp, have been working on for a long time, where somebody on the \nground today could go to Frank, if Frank were alive, but to people \nsimilar to Frank, and they could help him rewrite a new mortgage that \nhe could repay and he wouldn't lose his home. Now, after 6 months of \nthe administration opposing and opposing and opposing, Senators Brown \nand Casey and I, again with Senator Murray's help, were able to get \n$180 million into the omnibus budget bill at the end of last year. \nGuess how much of that has been used. Mr. President, $160 million \nalready, after about 6 weeks, 7 weeks since it passed. We need more. To \nme, the most important part of this bill, with a lot of good \nprovisions, is the money for the mortgage counselors. Not because it is \na great, heroic thing to do, not because it dramatically restructures \nour economy--these things are needed--but because it saves people's \nhomes. It saves the Franks of\n\n[[Page S2274]]\n\nthe world, their little piece of the rock, which they struggled so hard \nand long to own and to keep. So we proposed another $200 million. To be \nhonest, we need $500 million. To compromise with the other side--they \nhate all Government spending, some of them--we have said $200 million.\n  Then, when the mortgage counselor came around, you would still need \nmoney to refinance the mortgage. That is why there are provisions for \nmortgage revenue bonds in the proposal. There is also a proposal for \nCDBG money. That seems to raise the ire of some: Government money. \nWell, let me say what the CDBG money will do. The houses that are \nalready foreclosed upon and are vacant are cancers on neighborhoods. \nLet's say you are a homeowner anywhere within a tenth of a mile of a \nhome that has suffered foreclosure; a vacant home in your neighborhood \nbrings the home values down 1 percent, each vacant home. So a totally \ninnocent person suffers. No moral hazard here. You could have paid your \nmortgage off and you are hurting because there are foreclosures. What \nthis provision will do is allow the State, the local governments, to \nbuy up that foreclosed home, fix it up, and sell it. Isn't that a good \nthing or are we again going to stay in our ideological ivory tower and \nsay: That is the Government spending money. Of course it is the \nGovernment spending money. We spend money for soldiers. That is an \nexternal cost. Foreclosed homes are also an external cost. So this is a \ngood package.\n  The final provision is a bankruptcy provision which I support and I \nhope will stay in the bill. I know it is controversial. But Senator \nDurbin has wisely modified it. The argument against it is it would \nraise interest rates because people would build in the cost of the \nlower repayment once somebody was in bankruptcy into the original cost \nof the mortgage. So what Senator Durbin did in an effort to compromise \nis actually say it will only apply to existing mortgages, not forward-\nlooking ones, not ones that are going to be signed tomorrow. So it \ncan't affect future mortgages. So these are five good provisions.\n  Now, I wish to say to Senator McConnell and Senator Shelby, and I \nthink I speak for just about every one of us on this side of the aisle: \nWe welcome additions. We welcome discussions. Senator Johnny Isakson, \nof Georgia, has a provision about tax credits for first-time homebuyers \nthat might encourage the housing market to get going again. I think it \nis a good provision. I praised him while we were on break. Senator \nIsakson should get to offer his amendment.\n\n  There are many other amendments. Senator Carper worked diligently to \nsee that FHA reform comes forward. Senators Dodd and Shelby are close. \nThe only disagreement, as I understand it, is over what the limits \nshould be. The administration and some of us, including Senator Dodd, \nsupport $740,000 approximately, and Shelby says $400,000. I cannot \nbelieve we cannot work that out. I say to Senator Shelby that in places \nsuch as Long Island, where the average home costs about $450,000, we \ndon't even cover half of the homes right now. It was always intended \nthat about 80 percent of the homes be covered--not just the very \nwealthy but middle class and down. Hopefully, they can come to a \ncompromise on that.\n  Anyway, this is good news. I know what happened. Two weeks ago, when \nwe proposed the same thing, we were blocked. I talked to some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle who wanted to put a bill \ntogether. They said there were some who said the only debate we should \nhave on this is to reduce the estate tax or make permanent the Bush tax \ncuts. With all due respect, neither of those has anything to do with \nsolving the housing crisis, whatever your view is.\n  Then something happened. We had a meltdown on Wall Street and all \nthese new housing figures I mentioned during the 2 weeks we were away. \nI am glad to see that the minority leader and others have now seen, \nhopefully, the price for inaction, the price for a narrow ideological \ncommitment--no Government, as our economy goes down the drain.\n  I am hopeful, and I pray that the negotiations that are going forward \nright now between the Chair and ranking member of the Banking Committee \nwill bear fruit. Let us hope we can spend the rest of this week far \nmore productively than we spent the last week here in session. Let's \nhope we can debate housing. Let us hope we can help the Franks of the \nworld, who have done nothing wrong and need help. When we help the \nFrank Ruggieros of the world, we help our economy gradually get better.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am delighted to come to the floor today \nto praise the Senate for the most recent action in approving the motion \nto proceed on the issue of the day in America, and that is the housing \ncrisis, the mortgage crisis, and what has been happening to our \nhomeowners, mortgage companies, and our communities.\n  I pay particular attention and thanks to Harry Reid of Nevada, the \nmajority leader; Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader; \nChuck Schumer; Lamar Alexander; John Ensign; Chris Dodd; Richard \nShelby; and a host of Members who came together, and instead of \nagreeing to disagree, agreed to agree and set a platform from which \nthis Senate, in only the way the Senate can do it, can deliberate the \nmost pressing issue of the day.\n  I thank them for incorporating and including me in those discussions, \nand I want to share one of the things I shared with them and what I \nthink should be a key part of any solution we offer on behalf of the \nhousing market and the mortgage crisis.\n  One of the good things about getting older--and I am 63--is that you \nhave had a lot of experience, hopefully all of it good, but it is not \nall good. I was in the real estate business for 33 years before I came \nto the Senate, and I was in it in 1974 when we went through one of the \nworst housing recessions ever. I was also in it, thank goodness, in \n1975 when a Democratic Congress and a Republican President, Gerald \nFord, brought forward a tax credit bill to stimulate the housing \nmarket.\n  In 1975, we had a similar problem. We had gone through a period of \neasy credit and lousy underwriting, except it wasn't on the mortgage \nside, it was on the construction loan side. At banks around the \ncountry, if a guy came into the bank and had a pickup truck and a \nhammer, he qualified as a builder, and he went out and bought a lot and \nstarted building spec houses. Banks made the loans and even advanced \nsome of the development costs. Some A and D lenders would loan 100 \npercent of the cost of the acquisition and 20 percent of the \ndevelopment--crazy underwriting. It led to a plethora of new houses \nbeing built but no buyers for these houses. The United States found \nitself in the position of having a 3-year supply of standing new \ninventory on the market and no buyers.\n  What happened? Values started declining, grass started growing, and \nvandalism started taking hold on the vacant houses. It was a horrible \nsituation. The President and Congress came together and said: Why don't \nwe stimulate the market to absorb these houses, get the buyers back \ninto buying houses. We passed a $2,000 tax credit to any family who \nbought and occupied as their principal residence a single-family new \nhouse that had been built, not a resale or any other house, but a \nsingle-family new house that had been built and standing in inventory.\n  We passed that $2,000 credit which, to give some idea of perspective, \nwas about 8 percent of the value of an average house at that particular \ntime in the marketplace. What happened is overnight, buyers sitting on \nthe sidelines came out. They bought the standing houses that had been \nvacant and unseen for months. Housing values stabilized and began to go \nup, the economy turned around, and we went out of a recession, into \nprosperity, absorbed the inventory, and we did not bail anybody out. We \njust motivated homebuyers to do what they do best, and that is buy the \ndesignated houses which were the problem.\n  Two months ago, I introduced a similar bill based exactly on that \nexperience, except instead of $2,000, it was a\n\n[[Page S2275]]\n\n$15,000 tax credit earned over 3 successive years, the first 3 years \nafter the purchase, of any one of a category of three types of houses:\n  Category No. 1, a new house built unsold, vacant, and permitted prior \nto September of last year. Any builder in America who permitted a house \nbefore September of last year did so when times were good. There was no \nlooming indication we were going to get into the problem we are in now. \nThey got caught like a lot of these homeowners and junk mortgages got \ncaught, subprime mortgages.\n  Second, a house that qualifies is a house that has been foreclosed \nupon, the foreclosure has been adjudicated, and it is owned by the \nlender or the lender's designated agent. That is a standing vacant \nhouse foreclosed on and up for resale.\n  The third category is any house in foreclosure pending adjudication. \nThat means it is being advertised, a foreclosure notice has been \nposted, and the house will be foreclosed on but has not yet.\n  Any one of those three types of houses, which is where the growing \ninventory is, will be eligible for the buyer to earn a $15,000 tax \ncredit allocated over the first 3 years in which they occupy the home. \nIf it is a speculator in foreclosure, it does not qualify. If it is a \nspeculator who is trying to buy, they don't get the tax credit. This is \nto stimulate houses being bought that are in trouble, owner occupied by \nprincipals who bought those houses, and it qualifies for people who \nwill buy those houses, refinance them, pay off the loan, and live in \nthem as their residence.\n  What is going to happen, if the Congress is able to come together and \npass a tax credit proposal such as that, is we will instantly stimulate \nthe housing market and the marketplace, and the consumers will begin \nabsorbing the standing inventory that is in foreclosure or pending \nforeclosure or is new and has been sitting since September of last \nyear. That is precisely where the problem is. That is precisely what \nneeds to be absorbed.\n  There are a few people who said: What about people who have been \nmaking their payments and are not in trouble; why don't you get the \ncredit for buying their house if they want to sell it? That is not \nwhere the problem is, No. 1. No. 2, they are suffering from all these \nvacant houses being out there as well because housing values are \ndeclining, appraised values are declining, equities are shrinking, and \nequity lines of credit are drying up. We need a focused, targeted \nabsorption vehicle to see to it that the buying public solves our \nproblem for us. That is the right way to do it.\n  One other feature of the proposal is the tax credit will only be \navailable and able to be earned on a purchase of a designated property \nmade between April 1, 2008, and March 31, 2009--a 1-year window of \nopportunity. That creates the urgency of the situation, it motivates \npeople to get into the marketplace or lose that opportunity, and it \nwill be a significant catalyst to the marketplace, solving a \nsignificant problem for the United States of America.\n  I encourage my colleagues on the Banking Committee. I appreciate \ntheir consideration of this proposal and this concept. I hope that when \nthe bill comes to the floor either in the base bill or in the amendment \nprocess, we can address a past solution that worked and add it to a \ncontemporary problem that was identical to what the problem was in 1974 \nand 1975.\n  I end where I began. I thank my Democratic friends and my Republican \nfriends who came together and decided to make something work rather \nthan figure out how we can just be against one another. Senator Schumer \nhas been a catalyst in this effort, Senator Ensign, Senator Alexander, \nSenator Reid, obviously, Senator Dodd, and Senator Shelby. I pay \ntribute to Senator Tom Carper who talked with me over weeks about the \nproposal I just discussed and finding some way to bring it to the floor \nof the Senate and get it out there so we can address the problems that \nexist in Delaware, Missouri, Georgia, Nevada, and in all the 50 States \nover the United States of America.\n  I am privileged to be the author of the amendment. I will be proud to \nbe part of a team that does not want to take credit but wants to get \nsomething done, put together a bipartisan bill that addresses the most \ncontemporary problem today in the United States of America, and that is \nthe housing crisis.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask for the regular order. Are we in \nmorning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering a motion to proceed \nto the housing bill.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized for up to 20 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Africa\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, on February 6 of 2007, the \nadministration announced their intention to create a new unified \ncommand, the United States African Command, or AFRICOM. The U.S.-Africa \ncommand is a partnership between military and civilian communities that \nwill focus on existing programs such as the training of peacekeeping \nforces that enable African nations and regional organizations to \nimprove security on the continent. The National Security Adviser, \nStephen Hadley, said:\n\n       AFRICOM is a command that would be established for Africa . \n     . . It would be a partnership, really, between military and \n     civilians, and its principal focus would be to continue some \n     of the activities that we are already doing to try and train \n     peacekeeping forces so that countries in Africa and regional \n     organizations in Africa can take more of a role in dealing \n     with the conflicts and the problems on the continent.\n\n  It is ironic that we have these COMs, these commands all over the \nworld. Yet Africa is divided into three commands: the Pacific Command, \nthe European Command, and the Central Command. Africa has now become, \nin my opinion, the most significant continent that we need to pay more \nattention to.\n  I think I am uniquely qualified to talk about this. Two days ago, I \nmade my 97th African country visit. The last country we were in this \nlast week--there were some five countries--was Ethiopia, a very \nsignificant part of it.\n  I also started my efforts in Africa long before we had a lot of \nmilitary interest in Africa. Mine was more of a mission type of thing. \nI became very familiar with all of Africa. I now have had an \nopportunity to sit down and visit personally and develop intimate \nrelations with the Presidents of some 28 African nations, their \nParliaments and many of the leaders there.\n  As a matter of fact, I was in Ethiopia 7 years ago, when we came upon \na little girl. She had nothing. The little girl was an orphan. She was \n3 days old. She wasn't healthy--didn't look like she would live at all. \nThey put her into an orphanage, where they did the very best with what \nthey had. Like so many orphanages, she was actually put in a bucket. \nThey had this cute little girl in there, feeding her intravenously \nthrough her scalp at the time.\n  Anyway, there is a long story that goes with that, but the short \nversion is my wife and I have been married 48 years and have 20 kids \nand grandkids and one of our daughters, Molly Rapert, had only boys. \nShe wanted a little girl so she adopted this girl. This is my adopted \nAfrican granddaughter.\n  It is kind of funny. She was found abandoned as an orphan in Addis \nAbba, in Ethiopia. Yet this little girl has turned into quite a genius. \nIn fact, 3 weeks ago at the National Prayer Breakfast I was in charge \nof the African dinner. I say to the Presiding Officer, this little \ngranddaughter of mine was the speaker that night--7 years old. I have \nmore than a passing interest in Africa. It is a family interest too.\n  During my time on the continent, I have seen the significant and \nstrategic place in the world that Africa holds because of the sheer \nsize of Africa. People don't realize, if we go from Mauritania to \nEthiopia, east to west, it takes 7 hours flying. If you go from north \nto south, from Cape Town up to Algeria, it is 9 hours. It is a huge \ncontinent.\n\n[[Page S2276]]\n\n  The rest of the world is now realizing its importance. I think our \ntiming is very good. It is only a year ago that we embarked upon this \nidea that we were going to be holding up Africa and supporting it. A \nlot of people don't realize the significance of Africa, that Africa is \nthe area where, as the squeeze takes place in the Middle East on \nterrorism, a lot of it goes down through the Horn of Africa, through \nDjibouti and that area, and spreads out throughout Africa.\n  Other countries are realizing how important it is. They are doing \nsomething about it. The new French President, Sarkozy, said during a \nrecent trip to South Africa that Africa should have at least one \npermanent seat in the U.N. Security Council and that France would no \nlonger accept major world affairs being discussed without a leading \nAfrican country being involved.\n  There are many countries, such as China, expanding influence in \nAfrica. I can tell you that, as you go through Africa, anything that is \nnew and shiny--a bridge, a colosseum, anything such as that that is \ngiven to them by China. China is trying to get a foothold there.\n  China has the same problem in its dependency on outside sources for \noil as we do. They are beating us to some of these areas in Africa. \nHuge reserves are being developed in Africa. All that is very \nsignificant.\n  Currently, over 700 Chinese state companies conduct business in \nAfrica, making China the continent's third largest trading partner. The \nUnited States and France are first and second.\n  I have also seen, in my many travels to Africa, the great strength \nand perseverance in the African people, in their fight to overcome \ngreat obstacles such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, poverty, wars. In order to \nachieve security and stability, we have to work to eliminate the root \ncauses of poverty and poor governance. Fighting terrorism in the region \nhas become critical. Examples of terrorism we remember--it was not too \nlong ago the bombings of our embassies in Tanzania and in Kenya and \nmore recently the bombings in Morocco and Algeria. African countries \nhave become more vulnerable as al-Qaida has infiltrated into the Horn \nof Africa.\n\n  As the surge is working--yesterday after leaving Africa, I went to \nthe European command and looked at the progress we are making. We were, \nyesterday afternoon, in Iraq. Good things are happening there. The \nsurge is clearly working. As the surge works, what happens is, as I \ndescribed, a lot of the terrorist activities go down into the most \nconvenient place and the most vulnerable and that is the continent of \nAfrica.\n  It has been reported terrorist networks in Somalia and Eritrea work \ntogether, increasing their capability. If you go into northern Uganda--\nthis is something very few people know about. Everyone knows about the \nproblems in the Sudan and many of the other areas of Africa. But how \nmany people know the children's Army being developed by a man named \nJoseph Kony. The LRA, the Lord's Resistance Army, for 30 years now they \nhave been taking kids out of villages, little 11-, 12-, 13-, 14-year-\nold kids, teaching them to be soldiers. Once they learn to be soldiers, \nthey have them take an automatic weapon and go back to their villages \nand murder their family. If they don't do this, they maim them, they \ncut their ears and lips off. This has been going on for a long time. \nThese horrible things are going on, and a lot of that is because we, \nthe free world, have not given our attention to Africa that we should \nhave a long time ago. We see the conflicts in Kenya taking place right \nnow, the young democracy that has unfortunately exploded into tribal \nconflict. More than 1,000 people after the December election were \nkilled. Last month, there were 500 European Union troops who were sent \nto protect Chad's capital from being taken over by the rebels; 3,700 EU \ntroops are presently protecting thousands of refugees along Chad's \nborder with Sudan as well as the neighboring Central African Republic. \nIn February, the United Nations ordered its regional force to withdraw \nto Ethiopia after the Eritrean Government cut their field supplies.\n  Let's keep in mind it was Eritrea, when we had the problem in \nSomalia, that went down and sided with the terrorists. It was, of \ncourse, Ethiopia that joined us, as well as other countries such as \nUganda and Burundi.\n  The United States has a long history offering support, helping \nestablish security on the African Continent. Thomas Jefferson was the \nfirst President to send American troops to the coast of Africa to ward \noff the Barbary pirates plaguing the Mediterranean and threatening the \nsecurity of Europe and the new colonies. This is kind of funny. That \nwas Thomas Jefferson. Today the same thing is happening in the Sea of \nGuinea. They have new discoveries of oil so there is pirating going on, \nand we are over there trying to help the surrounding countries defend \nthemselves. This command is going to go a long ways toward doing that.\n  We continue to support African nations in the area for security and \nstability and health and education initiatives. In 2003, the United \nStates helped to bring stability to Liberia. In Djibouti, the Combined \nJoint Task Force for the Horn of Africa has been involved in \ndevelopmental activities, including building schools and digging wells. \nI have had occasion to be in Eritrea several times. It is probably the \nleast known country in Africa. It is becoming better known because of \nall the atrocities that are taking place there. The administration \nrecently pledged $15 billion through the President's emergency plan for \nAIDS relief and significantly is contributing to the fight on AIDS.\n  People complain: Why are we spending money to help Africans on HIV/\nAIDS? That is their problem. They are dealing with their problems \nthemselves.\n  I had occasion last week to be with the First Lady of Zambia. The \nFirst Ladies all throughout Africa are the ones who are doing the most \nto combat HIV/AIDS. The First Lady of Zambia has put together a group \nof First Ladies who are significantly having an impact. President \nGbagbo's wife Simone in Cote d'Ivoire is very actively attacking the \nproblem there. Janet Museveni in Uganda has been honored in the United \nStates for her work on HIV/AIDS. Most recently, the one I think is \nreally doing the best job is the wife of the Prime Minister of \nEthiopia. Prime Minister Zenawi's wife Azeb is heading up a group that \nis having great positive impact on HIV/AIDS. So they are helping \nthemselves.\n  The United States is partnering with African countries in effective \nprograms such as IMET. I am on the Armed Services Committee, and it is \none of the strongest programs we have to develop close relations with \nother countries. It is a military program where we invite the officers \nto come over and get trained with our officers. Once they are trained \nwith our officers, that develops a bond that stays there from then on. \nIf we don't do it, other countries such as China are willing to.\n  We have dramatically improved our train-and-equip sections so that we \ncan help commanders in the field train and equip other countries. \nPrimarily, my concern is in Africa, and that is happening. Those \nprograms are proving to be vital resources by aiding developing \ncountries in the professionalism of their militaries.\n  Africa is an avenue that the United States can use to aid Africa as \nit continues to grow into a secure democratic continent with a growing \neconomy. Africa's challenges, its growing strategic significance, and \nthe potential impact of failing states and ungoverned areas on U.S. \nsecurity will require increased emphasis on interagency cooperation.\n  Currently, the African Continent is divided between three commands. \nYou have the Pacific Command, the Central Command, and the European \nCommand. The division of responsibilities has caused problems in \ncoordinating activities and creating seams between commands, especially \nin key areas of instability or of conflict. One seam creating \ndifficulty lies between Sudan--under the CENTCOM, or the Central \nCommand--and Chad, immediately adjoining it, and the Central African \nRepublic. The last one is under the European Command. They are right \nnext to each other but under two different commands. Bureaucratically, \nit is a nightmare; you can't coordinate activities.\n  The recent conflict in Chad and the continuing conflict in Sudan \nemphasize the need for the United States to respond to these conflicts \nand to be unified. As AFRICOM becomes operational, these divided \nresponsibilities\n\n[[Page S2277]]\n\nwill no longer exist. It is set up to be operational by October of this \nyear.\n  We have a great guy who is going to be commanding general. He has \nalready been confirmed, GEN William ``Kip'' Ward. Kip Ward's military \nservice includes tours all over the world but with a real emphasis and \ninterest in Africa. He was confirmed by the Senate in September. \nGeneral Ward has expressed a vision of hope for Africa and for the role \nthe United States plays in that vision. General Ward believes in the \nneed to address crisis situations before they arise and to address them \nat the microlevel, at the perspective of the individual victim, which \nis critical in bringing about solutions. AFRICOM's aim will be a \npreventative approach on the local level, giving hope in times of \nadversity and a way forward for the future in both security and \ndevelopment. General Ward is the right guy for the job. He has stressed \nthat the purpose of the command is to enable African solutions to \nAfrican challenges, to support African leadership rather than usurping \nor suppressing African leadership and sovereignty. This is very \nimportant.\n  It was the right military decision for us in the United States to \nbecome interested in helping Africans develop five African commands. \nThese would be north, south, east, west, and central. Only two of the \nlocations have been determined right now. But we make it very clear to \nAfrica, we are not doing this. We are not the ones who are putting the \nbrigades in there. We are helping them to put their own brigades there \nso they can take care of their own problems.\n  In Somalia, African countries such as Ethiopia, Burundi, and Uganda \nhave sent in troops to help stabilize the government there. We couldn't \nhave done that without the support of Africans. The African Union \ntroops have recently arrived in the Comoros Islands near Madagascar to \nhelp its military regain control of an island where a renegade leader \nhas declared himself President. The development of the African standby \nbrigades is a good example of how we are helping them to help \nthemselves.\n  So AFRICOM is expected to become fully operational the first of \nOctober 2008. It is going to be at least temporarily located in \nStuttgart, Germany. My personal preference would be to have it \nsomeplace in Africa. Right now, there is some resistance to that, so we \nwill keep it in Stuttgart for the time being.\n\n  In fiscal year 2008, Congress appropriated $75 million to the \ncommand, and in fiscal year 2009, the President has requested $389 \nmillion. I know this sounds like a lot of money, but I can't think of \nanyplace where we can actually save money more than by helping the \nAfricans build up themselves and bring their allegiance in to us. We \nhave to support AFRICOM with adequate funding to enable the command to \nbe fully equipped to face the challenges they have only in Africa.\n  I already introduced a resolution that is S. Res. 480. I am joined by \nabout 12 or 14 Members. I invite my friends from both sides of the \naisle who have a heart for Africa and believe in what we are doing to \njoin in this resolution. The resolution encourages the Department of \nDefense and the State Department and USAID to work cooperatively with \nour African friends to bring hope to the continent. So often, when you \ntry to put together a program such as train and equip, the State \nDepartment seems to think that the Department of Defense is taking away \nsome of its power. It becomes a turf battle. We don't want that to \nhappen. It looks as if it will not happen in this case. The resolution \nemphasizes that AFRICOM is expected to support, not shape, U.S. foreign \npolicy in Africa so that we would be working together.\n  Finally, I encourage my friends in Africa to work together with \nAFRICOM to find solutions to issues facing Africans today. Under \nGeneral Ward's leadership, I believe AFRICOM can provide that hope to \nthe people, and I believe that is going to happen.\n  I was in a Stuttgart meeting, the first official meeting of a Member \nof Congress with the new African Command or the new AFRICOM. I became \nconvinced, looking around the table at all the people, this is the \nfirst time you see many of the bureaucracies sitting around the same \ntable. This didn't happen before because it was not a unified command. \nThis unified command will allow that to happen.\n  There is no place in the world that needs more attention by us right \nnow. When you talk about the war on terror, the next area we will have \nto concentrate on is Africa. By taking these steps now, Africans will \nbe prepared to handle their own problems and not have us do it for \nthem.\n  I am very pleased with the successes we have had. We have been \ntalking about a new African Command now for about 10 years. Finally, it \nwill become a reality this year.\n  We need to encourage a lot of people to start participating, maybe to \nthe same level I am participating with the country of Africa. It is a \nbeautiful thing that is happening right now. I believe we are going to \nmake great progress as a result of the African Command.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                  Staff Sergeant Keith ``Matt'' Maupin\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, this weekend the Department of Defense \nconfirmed the death of SSG Keith ``Matt'' Maupin, an American patriot \nfrom Batavia, OH, near Cincinnati, who bravely served our Nation in \nIraq. Sergeant Maupin had been listed as missing and captured for \nnearly 4 years. He went missing on April 9, 2004, after his fuel \nconvoy, the 724th Transportation Company, was ambushed just west of \nBaghdad. Since that tragic day, Sergeant Maupin's mother and father, \nhis family, have worked tirelessly to locate their son. My prayers are \nwith them, those who have endured years of gut-wrenching uncertainty \nand unfathomable heartache. We owe this family a tremendous debt of \ngratitude, not only for their extreme sacrifice but for their \ndetermination to prevent other parents from experiencing an information \nvacuum when their deployed son or daughter goes missing.\n  There are three other soldiers currently missing and captured in \nIraq. The nightmare is not over for their families. On their behalf and \nin honor of Sergeant Maupin, our Nation must find those soldiers. Time \nmust be perceived as the enemy. There can be no pause in the search, no \nebb in the sense of urgency.\n  Upon finally hearing news of their son a few days ago, Sergeant \nMaupin's father said:\n\n       Matt is coming home. He's completed his mission.\n\n  His words echo those of a grateful nation.\n\n\n                           the housing crisis\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, for months and months almost every \nnewspaper in the country has been filled with stories of the tremendous \ntoll the housing crisis has taken on communities across our Nation. My \nState set an unenviable record for foreclosures last year--more than \n83,000, according to Ohio's Supreme Court. That is more than 200 every \nday of the week--Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, \nSaturday, and Sunday. Every week 1,500 families lose their homes. \nAlmost 4 percent of all home loans in Ohio are in foreclosure, the \nhighest rate in the Nation. The end is nowhere in sight.\n  In Ohio, there are another 120,000 home loans that are delinquent. \nNationally, one rating agency is now predicting a 50-percent default \nrate for subprime loans made in the fourth quarter of 2006, many of \nwhich will reset in the fourth quarter of this year. Think about that. \nOne of every two subprime loans made in the fall of 2006 will go bad. \nThat is not lending, that is gambling with someone else's home.\n  In the face of this crisis, the Bush administration has largely taken \nthe view that prosperity is around the corner; the Government need not \ndo anything; voluntary efforts and market forces will be enough. Last \nsummer and earlier in the year, the Bush administration was still \narguing that the problem was contained. So long as the problem was \ncontained to places such as Ohio and Michigan, to Nevada and \nCalifornia, the administration was content to do almost nothing. But \nwhat a difference an address makes. When the problems moved from \nAmerica's Main Streets to Wall Street, the administration sprung into \naction. In a single weekend, the executive branch jumped to rescue the \ninvestment bank Bear Sterns from bankruptcy. If the Government can leap \ninto action to prevent the bankruptcy of a single bank, how can we turn \nour backs on the tens of\n\n[[Page S2278]]\n\nthousands of Ohio families and the millions of American families who \nneed our help?\n  Congress must act in the face of this crisis. Majority Leader Reid \ntried a month ago to bring legislation before the Senate that would \ntake several steps to help homeowners faced with foreclosures in the \ncommunities in which they live. We are trying again today. We seem to \nbe able to afford to spend $3 billion in 1 week, every week, 52 weeks a \nyear, in Iraq, but the President hasn't been able to find $4 billion in \n1 year to help the towns and cities across the country that are being \ngutted by foreclosures. We are able, it seems, from Chairman Bernanke, \nto spend $30 billion buying a basket of mortgages from Bear Sterns that \nJPMorgan wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole. Why can't we help cities \nrebuild?\n  The needs of communities are critical because this crisis has an \nimpact far beyond just the people who lose their homes, as big as those \nnumbers might be. Whenever a home goes into foreclosure, the value of \nneighboring properties is reduced. In many areas, local vandals move in \nquickly to strip the copper pipe and the aluminum siding from a home. \nCrime goes up just when property tax revenues in these cities are \nplunging and the resources of a city and town are stretched to the \nlimit.\n  Senator Reid's bill would include some $4 billion in funding for the \nCommunity Development Block Grant Program, so communities that have \nbeen the hardest hit could renovate or rebuild or even in some cases \nraze these properties.\n  The bill would provide an additional $10 billion to housing finance \nagencies to be used to refinance mortgages, to help first-time home \nbuyers, and to create more multifamily rental housing.\n  The majority leader's legislation would also provide $200 million on \nsupporting the efforts of nonprofit agencies across the country to \ncounsel homeowners on how to work with a lender to stave off \nforeclosure.\n  We have great neighborhood counseling organizations in Columbus and \nin Toledo and in Dayton and in Cincinnati and all over my State.\n  This is no easy task. Once upon a time, you took out a loan with your \nlocal bank to buy a home. If I borrowed money from a local bank, the \nbanker had just as much interest in my paying down my loan, my staying \nup to date on my loan, he had just as much interest as I did in making \nsure I paid my mortgage. You knew the people at the bank. They knew \nyou. You had that kind of relationship.\n  Today, especially for subprime loans, that is seldom the case. So \nhelp in navigating the mortgage maze is essential. That is why those \nneighborhood counseling organizations are so important.\n  The majority leader's bill would also improve disclosure of the terms \nof a mortgage. In the last year--the last 14, 15 months since I came to \nthe Senate--I have held about 95 roundtables in 60 of Ohio's counties \ntalking to people about what issues matter to them the most in their \ncommunities. I heard from one Ohioan after another, from Marietta to \nLima, from Bryan to Chillicothe, from Zanesville to Youngstown. I have \nheard from one Ohioan after another who never understood the real risks \nand dangers of the mortgages that were sold.\n  Senator Reid's bill also provides bankruptcy judges the ability to \nmodify the mortgage on a primary residence in the same way that a judge \ncan today with a vacation home or investment property or even a boat.\n  We know lenders and their servicers cannot keep up with the flood of \nforeclosures they are facing. Much has been made of the number of loans \nthat have been changed as a result of voluntary efforts. I do not \ndiscount those efforts at all. But tacking late fees and penalties on \nthe back end of a loan does not do much to help a family make their \nmonthly payment.\n  One woman who called me reported a loan modification that reduced the \ninterest rate on her loan from 11 percent to 10 percent. With the late \nfees and penalties folded in, her monthly payment barely budged.\n  Modifications like these are simply not going to help. It is \nessential that we permit the bankruptcy courts to serve as their \nbackstop.\n  My Republican colleagues apparently think it is OK for a bankruptcy \njudge to modify the mortgage on a multimillion-dollar vacation home, \nbut it is not OK to provide the same relief to a family facing \nbankruptcy in their $100,000 home.\n  When lenders are only recovering 35 cents on the dollar in my State--\nit is a little higher nationally; only 35 cents in my State on the \ndollar--on a foreclosed property, I do not think they have anything to \nfear from an alternative process supervised by the bankruptcy courts \nthat may result in avoiding foreclosure.\n  The bankruptcy provisions are a significant change in our law, to be \nsure. But they are a responsible reaction to some extraordinarily \nirresponsible underwriting.\n  I understand the importance of protecting contract rights. But think \nfor a minute about the contracts that are in question. The vast \nmajority of subprime loans went to refinance homes. They were designed \nto do three things--to generate fees, strip out equity, and quickly \nbecome unaffordable.\n  Do we really want to take the position that these contracts should be \nbeyond the reach of a bankruptcy judge? I think not.\n  We have much work to do in dealing with this foreclosure issue. Every \nday we delay more than 200 people--more than twice the membership of \nthis body--lose their home in my State. They deserve more from us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we know Senators Dodd and Shelby are \nworking on, hopefully, a bipartisan piece of legislation that will come \nto the floor this week that will help Congress do what needs to be done \nand, hopefully, what will actually work to try to relieve some of the \ncrisis caused by the subprime lending credit crunch and the slowdown in \nthe housing industry.\n  We have all acknowledged this slowdown we have seen in our economy \nover the last few months, and we have resolved to work together to try \nto give the American people the confidence that if there is something \nwe can do, we will try to do it in a way that actually works and \nrelieves the problem in a bipartisan way. I think, frankly, that is met \nwith some measure of relief by people across the country.\n  I think we got off to a pretty good start when Speaker Pelosi and \nRepublican leader John Boehner and Hank Paulson, the Secretary of the \nTreasury, came up with a stimulus package that passed with strong \nbipartisan majorities.\n  I think as much as anything it demonstrated that we are capable of \nacting together in a bipartisan way rather than just engaging in \ngridlock and finger pointing. I hope we will continue along that trend \nas we consider the legislation that Senator Shelby and Senator Dodd are \nworking on.\n  To me, one of the best parts about the stimulus package we passed was \nthe small business bonus depreciation provisions which gave small \nbusinesses that invested in new equipment an opportunity to write that \noff on an accelerated basis. It provided a great incentive for them to \npurchase that new equipment and hopefully allow them to continue to \ncreate jobs.\n  It is no secret about 70 percent of the jobs created in America are \ncreated by small businesses. We ought to do everything in our power to \ntry to help them continue to generate jobs for hard-working Americans.\n  A little earlier today, I had a colleague come up to me and say, \nbasically: We have to do something to deal with this crisis. Of course, \nI added: Well, I hope we do something. But more than that, I hope we do \nsomething good or something that will actually work and certainly not \nsomething that will actually make things worse.\n  Like the medical profession, we ought to consider in the Senate \ntaking\n\n[[Page S2279]]\n\na Hippocratic oath of our own that first we do no harm because, \nfrankly, on the earlier stimulus package, where we believed it was \nnecessary to act to give the public confidence--that we could on a \nbipartisan basis--basically we ended up spending about $150 billion to \ndo so.\n  I think extraordinary measures were called for, but it was with more \nthan a little trepidation that I voted for that bill which added to the \ndebt, particularly when we are not doing a good job of dealing with the \ndeficit in other areas and unfunded liabilities of the Federal \nGovernment, particularly when it comes to entitlement spending. But for \nthe same reason I voted for tax cuts in 2003--which I think helped \ncontribute to about 50 months of consecutive job growth in this \ncountry, and about 9 million new jobs--I think sometimes extraordinary \nmeasures are called for to help stimulate the economy.\n  But I do think the very best stimulus package we could possibly pass \nwould be to lighten the tax load on small businesses and American \ntaxpayers. It works. We know when people can work hard and keep more of \nwhat they earn, then it generates not only more income from them and a \ngreater incentive to work hard, it also, ironically, generates more \nrevenue for the Federal Treasury because more people are working, more \npeople are paying taxes, and, thus, it helps us deal with the deficit \nin a way that is constructive by putting people to work.\n  But at the end of the day, I think what we need to do this week is to \nmake an immediate, palpable difference in the lives of families with \ndistressed mortgages. The housing market ought to be our focus and \nhelping people with distressed mortgages not have to unload those \nthrough foreclosure and perhaps lose everything they have invested. \nThat is why I would like to see the provisions from something called \nthe SAFE Act become law.\n  The SAFE Act would expedite the delivery of the full $180 million \nappropriated for foreclosure counseling just last December. And to help \nstabilize the housing market itself, the SAFE Act includes a $15,000 \ntax credit over 3 years. This has been proposed by our colleague from \nGeorgia, Senator Isakson. I believe Senator Stabenow on the other side \nof the aisle has something similar. But basically what it would do is \nprovide a tax credit that would give people an incentive to buy \nexisting inventory of new housing or housing that was currently in \nforeclosure proceedings.\n  Obviously, our housing market has a big impact on employment, and it \nhas a ripple effect on the economy generally. I think this $15,000 tax \ncredit over 3 years would provide a powerful incentive for people who \nare in the market to purchase a single family home in foreclosure or a \nnew home from existing inventory which now in many cases just sits \nvacant.\n  This would make it more affordable for families looking to start \nbuying a home and will provide an incentive for people to reenter the \nmarket in the coming year.\n  Finally, to make sure these same problems are avoided in the future, \nwe need to focus on increasing transparency and information for \nprospective borrowers.\n  I agree with Senator McCain who said we should not be about bailing \nout unscrupulous lenders who made bad loans or people who made the \nmistake of borrowing money they could not pay back, perhaps betting on \nthe continuous bubble in housing prices in the housing market. But what \nwe do owe the American taxpayer, the American consumer, is transparency \nand information which will allow them to consider--for example, when \nthey buy an adjustable rate mortgage--and understand what they are \ngetting into. That means letting borrowers know the full details of any \nnew introductory rate and payment and what their new adjustable rate \nwill be and how much they can expect their payments to be.\n\n  We must ensure consumers fully understand their mortgages and that \nthey have a completely free and well-informed choice when it comes to \ntheir loans. That is the only way I believe we can hope to avoid future \nproblems in the housing and banking industries in the future, beyond \nmaking sure that underwriters don't intentionally loan money to people \nthey know can't pay it back. But those have to be resolved on a \ntransaction-by-transaction basis, perhaps by the courts.\n  The Senate should make sure that any proposal does not produce \ninsurmountable challenges to prospective and current homeowners. Too \noften, the work we do in the Senate has the effect of unforeseen and \nunintended consequences. Here again, we should do no harm, and I think \nwe should be careful not to cause problems while we are trying to fix \nproblems.\n  For that reason, I would be hesitant to support any proposal that \nincreases the size of the Government's budget at the expense of the \nfamily budget. I could not support proposals that actually make home \nownership more expensive, encourage costly litigation, or expand \nWashington programs.\n  The Senate should not be making home ownership more expensive for \nworking families. That is what I believe, for example, the bankruptcy \nprovision would do, which would allow bankruptcy judges to actually \ncram down reduced interest rates, thus devaluing that particular \nfinancial instrument, which would actually in the long run have the \nunintended consequence of raising interest rates and the cost of \nmortgages. I think every Member of this body can agree the last thing \nthe Senate should be doing is making things harder on families and \nmaking it more difficult for small businesses to grow and create jobs \nhere at home.\n  When this Senate passed the economic stimulus package, it affirmed \nthe basic principle that economic growth is best served through \ntaxpayers and people who are earning the money being able to keep more \nof it. It would be incomprehensible to me to now turn around and pursue \na mortgage plan that would take that money away through bigger \nGovernment programs or higher costs for homes or mortgages.\n  Let me say that in my home State of Texas, we continue to enjoy \nstrong job creation. Although there has been a downturn in the housing \nmarkets, by and large, we are running in a countercyclical fashion to \nmuch of the rest of the Nation. Our unemployment rate is at a 30-year \nlow, and over the past year, Texas has led the Nation in job creation. \nWe have accomplished this by some things that are pretty obvious, but I \nthink they are worth noting; things such as low taxes, commonsense \nregulation, and an economy based to a large extent on free trade. All \nof these factors give businesses the tools to grow and families the \nstability to live. Not coincident, naturally, it allows or encourages \njob creators and businesses to move to our State, thus creating in the \nlast--well, since 2000 about 3 million people have moved to Texas. I \nthink people tend to vote with their feet where they find opportunity, \nand I think this formula of lower taxes, less regulation, the right to \nwork without having to join a labor union--you can if you want, but you \nshouldn't be forced to do so just to get a job--those, in addition to \ncommonsense tort reform and some medical liability reform, which has \nreduced the cost of medical liability insurance some 17 percent, have \nencouraged a lot of physicians to move to our State and has created a \nlot more access to good quality health care. So from my standpoint, we \nkind of know what works, what helps encourage the economy, what helps \nstimulate the economy, and what provides the incentives for American \nworkers to work hard and businesses to be attracted to a particular \nState or location.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting well-reasoned \nand proven measures such as these, while rejecting other proposals that \nwould increase onerous regulation, drive up housing and loan costs, and \nbuild a barrier between more families and home ownership. We have \nworked well in the past when we have worked together, and I hope this \nweek will be yet another example of good work we can accomplish when we \nput partisan politics aside to work out solutions in a way that \naddresses the real problems that face the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I noticed the Senator from Texas was \ntalking about all of those people recently moving to Texas. There was a\n\n[[Page S2280]]\n\npoint in our history in this country when half of Tennessee moved to \nTexas. In fact, almost every Texan you find has a Tennessee ancestor, \nwhether it is Davy Crockett or Sam Houston or some other person.\n  I wish to follow up on the remarks of the Senator from Texas and his \nfocus on the family budget and his focus on the way this Senate is \nworking. Senator McConnell, our Republican leader, has said often that \nin the Senate that process is often substance.\n  When I was Governor of Tennessee, I didn't understand that very well \nbecause the job of a governor is to see an urgent need, develop a \nstrategy for meeting the need, and then persuading half the people you \nare right. So I left the process to somebody else and probably didn't \nshow as much respect for the process as I should have. When I was a \nuniversity president, I was humbled a great deal and learned a little \nbit more about process. Now that I am in the Senate, I understand even \nmore that the Republican leader is a very wise man when he says process \nis often substance.\n  So first I wish to comment on the process we saw this afternoon when \nthe majority leader, Harry Reid, a Democrat, and the Republican leader, \nMitch McConnell, stood together with others of us and said we are going \nto work together and try to produce a housing bill. That was a very \nimportant event to say we'll come together and try to produce a housing \nbill that helps stabilize home values for American families and helps \nrestart our economy. All it was, was process. Out of this messy \nsituation we have here in the Senate, where 100 of us have a right to \nactually bring the Senate to a halt, we had the two leaders form a \nconsensus about process and assign two of our more respected Members, \nthe Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, and Senator Shelby, the \nSenator from Alabama, the job of coming back to us tomorrow and giving \nus the next step. The leaders did this because the Senate recognizes we \nhave a housing problem in this country. It is one that by and large may \nhave to correct itself because of the huge free market we have, but \nthere are steps we can take in the U.S. Government to help stabilize \nhome values. That would be good for the family budget. It would help to \nrestart the economy. It would be good for the country.\n  I commend Senator Reid and Senator McConnell for their steps and \nthink they are on the right course. I say that as I see the Senator \nfrom Colorado, who has done so much in this body to help us keep our \neye on the ball and do what the American people expect us to do. The \nAmerican people don't expect us not to have differences of opinions; of \ncourse we have differences of opinions. That is why issues are here. If \nthey could be easily solved, they would have been solved at the county \ncommission or at the State government level. But these issues have been \nkicked up to the national level and they are hard, tough issues, and we \nare expected to have differences of opinion. We have Democrats on that \nside and Republicans on this side because we have different principles \nthat we emphasize sometimes. Usually they are the same principles, but \nthey are often in conflict and we have to work those out. So in the \nSenate, we are going to have a big, strong, rousing debate about \nhousing. No one should misunderstand that. But what the leaders have \nsaid is what the leaders ought to say in the Senate, which is that we \nsee a real problem here with housing in the United States of America. \nWe see families who are worried. We see home values that are at risk. \nWe believe there are some steps we can agree on that would be good for \nthe country, are within our budget and that would help stabilize home \nvalues and restart the economy. These are steps that will help the \nfamily budget, and the leaders have said that is what we are going to \ndo.\n  Of all of the things people say to me in Tennessee when we talk about \nissues, they basically say: Why don't you guys--or something less \nflattering--why don't you Senators stop the petty partisan bickering. \nOr, in my words, stop the kindergarten politics and go to work on big \nissues affecting our country and try to get a result. That is what the \nSenator from Colorado spends a lot of his time here in the Senate \ntrying to do. I try to do that. Most of us try to do that. We are all \nhere, I think, to get some result, and the leaders have given us an \nopportunity to try to get one here on housing.\n  There are some good precedents for this. When people see us debating, \nthey shouldn't think there is something wrong with that. We have big \nprincipled debates here. What they don't like is the kindergarten \npolitics when we are here to stick our fingers in each other's eyes. \nThe American people can smell that a mile away, and they hate it. They \ndon't like it.\n  But kindergarten politics is not what we used on the America COMPETES \nAct last year. Senator Reid and Senator McConnell cosponsored it \nbecause so many of us supported the idea. It wasn't so easy to pass. It \nwas $34 billion of authorization to try to help us keep our jobs from \ngoing overseas by keeping our brain power advantage here. We had no \nlimits on the debate. Everybody who wanted to offered an amendment and \nthen we passed the legislation. The COMPETES Act is now in place, and \nwe are working on funding it. It is helping low-income kids who \ncouldn't afford advanced placement tests have them. It is helping \nuniversities train more math and science and physics teachers. It has \nput us on a path to double funding for the physical sciences in the \nOffice of Science and in the National Science Foundation. These are all \nthings we must do as a country if we want to keep our standard of \nliving. So the Senate did that together.\n  At the end of last year, we brought up an energy bill. Senator \nSalazar and I worked together on many energy ideas, but this was an \nespecially important one. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the \nState of Tennessee has said to me repeatedly: The single most important \nthing you could do to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and to stop \nsending dollars overseas to some people who are trying to kill us is to \nreduce the consumption of oil by passing a fuel efficiency standard so \nwe can increase the average mile per gallon of all cars and trucks. We \ndid that. Now, the Senate had an argument about whether to have 20 \nbillion more dollars of taxes, and some of us voted that down. But we \ndidn't stop there and go home, take our football and leave the floor; \nwe came to a result, and we did the most important thing we could do to \ntry to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. And reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil, by the way, is the real way to stabilize and \nbegin to bring down the price of a gallon of gas. So the Senate did \nthat together.\n\n  Then at the beginning of this year, the President and the House of \nRepresentatives got together to propose an economic stimulus package. \nIn fairly record time we approved provisions that will help 2.7 million \nTennesseans receive $600 or $1,200--or in some cases $1,800, if they \nhave a couple of kids--of their own money for the most part, back, so \nthey can spend it. This stimulus package will provide $50 billion in \naid for businesses. In some of our smaller counties there are hundreds \nof small businesses which can take advantage of keeping a little bit \nmore of their own money and maybe add jobs. And that stimulus is coming \nin time to help.\n  We hear on the news today that consumer confidence is a problem. \nWell, the rebate checks and the small business deductions are about to \ngo into effect, and that was something the Senate did together. We had \nprincipled disagreements, but we came to a result.\n  One other example of working together is concerning the foreign \nintelligence surveillance bill. I mentioned a little earlier a very \nwise man, Samuel Huntington, once said that most of our conflicts are \nabout principles with which we all agree. We agree, all of us, the \nSenator from Colorado and the Senator from Tennessee and every \nAmerican, that the principle of liberty is important, and so is the \nprinciple of security. Well, those two principles came in conflict when \nwe began to debate the rules for overhearing a conversation from an al-\nQaida terrorist in the Middle East calling into the United States. For \n6 months we debated that, but the Senate came to a result concerning \nliberty versus security. No one watching the Senate should think there \nwasn't a debate here. There was a vigorous, impassioned debate. It was \nthe kind of debate we ought to be having, but it wasn't about \nkindergarten\n\n[[Page S2281]]\n\npolitics, it was about liberty versus security. Then the Senate came to \na result.\n  So on competitiveness, on energy efficiency, on economic stimulus, \nand on intelligence surveillance the Senate came to a result. What \nSenator Reid and Senator McConnell said today is that we are going to \ntry to do the same thing on housing.\n  Now, the second thing I wish to say is that there are several things \ngoing on within our financial situation today, and there are several \nsolutions, so let's sort them out.\n  First, Secretary Paulson and others have suggested a badly needed \nfresh look at our financial institutions and how they are regulated. \nThat will take a while and isn't easy to do. It is very complex, and it \nought to take a while to discuss. In this country of ours, we produce \nabout 30 percent of all of the wealth in the world every year. We do it \nin this great big free market with many different parts to it. So any \ntime we begin to change things about the regulations, we need to be \ncareful about what we do.\n  What we are talking about now in the Senate--and what the leaders \nannounced today--is not down the road but instead is today and \ntomorrow. What can we do today and tomorrow to help the family budget? \nWhat can we do to stabilize home values, which we hope will help to \nrestart the economy? There are a lot of good ideas out there. There are \nsome that we in the Senate may be able to agree on fairly quickly.\n  The last thing I want to try to do is to do the work of Senator Dodd \nand Senator Shelby for them. They have a big task. Their assignment \nfrom the leaders is to take a day, so they and their staffs will be \nworking most of the night to see if there are a few things that most of \nus can agree on that can form the basis of what the Senate plans to do \non housing. Then, as I understand it, we will begin to have votes, \nhopefully, on issues related to housing. My guess is that if there are \nimportant and controversial issues, in most cases it will require 60 \nvotes. In other words, we will have a bipartisan core that Senator Dodd \nand Senator Shelby will propose, and then we will have a series of \nvotes to try to improve the bill.\n  Senators will have some differences of opinions about what improves \nit and what doesn't. For example, one thing that I think doesn't \nimprove it--and many on this side don't think it improves it--is the \nidea of letting bankruptcy judges rewrite home mortgages for homes in \nforeclosure. It sounds good, and it might help a few people. Here is \nwhat else it would do: It would raise the risk for all of those who buy \nhome mortgages in the future. If the risk is higher, the interest rate \nis higher. If the interest rate is higher, what does that mean for the \nfamily budget? It means higher monthly mortgage payments. The \nCongressional Budget Office says there could be higher interest rates. \nThe Mortgage Bankers Association said there will be higher interest \nrates. They suggest that in the State of Tennessee it might be about \n$120, on the average, a month. I don't think it helps the housing slump \nif we pass legislation that has the effect of raising most home \nmortgages by $120 a month. That is a big raise for most people. So I \nthink that is a bad idea. My guess is that this bankruptcy provision \nwill be offered on the floor, we will debate it, and I hope we defeat \nit. At least we will be here on the Senate floor debating it and \noffering our reasons for and against it.\n  If it comes up in that form, it reminds me of junk bonds--something \nthat was cooked up in the late 1970s and early 1980s. They called them \nthat because they were higher risk bonds. When they were placed into \nthe marketplace, investors said: We will buy them, but we are going to \nrequire more of an interest rate return.\n  There came to be other problems with these high-yield junk bonds, but \nthe other problems are not what I am talking about. I am talking about \nthe simple equation that if we introduce more risks into mortgages, \nthen when people buy the mortgages they are going to require a higher \ninterest rate. If there is a higher interest rate, that is a higher \nmonthly mortgage payment for families in Tennessee, where the estimate \nis approximately $120 more a month. That is not an idea I hope is in \nthe final result.\n  One idea that might be in the final result that has substantial \nDemocratic and Republican support is providing $10 billion in new bond \nauthority for loan refinancing. Senator Bond has that provision in his \nlegislation, for example. That would provide tax-exempt bond authority \nwhich could be used to refinance subprime loans, to provide mortgages \nfor first-time home buyers and for multifamily rental housing. That \nwould mean if you have a subprime loan and suddenly your adjusted rate \njumped up to a level you cannot afford--and that is going to happen \nwith a lot more mortgages in the next few months--then the State \nhousing agency could make a deal with you to refinance that loan. In \neffect, this refinancing would pay off the old loan, and you would have \na new one at a lower interest rate that you are comfortable with. Most \nof the money gets paid back, the house is not in foreclosure, and there \nis more stability in the market. This is an idea I could personally \nvote for, and I know it has support on both sides of the aisle.\n  Another idea that has come from the Republican side but has attracted \nsome interest on the Democratic side is the proposal of the Senator \nfrom Georgia, Mr. Isakson. He may be the junior Senator from Georgia, \nbut he is no spring chicken. He had been in the real estate business \nfor a long time before he came here to the Senate. He has been around \nlong enough to have seen the housing slump in the 1970s. So he said: \nLet's not just invent some idea that might help; let's look back in our \nhistory a little bit and see if there was ever anything that worked in \na similar circumstance that we could use to help preserve home values \ntoday. He pointed this out to us and introduced legislation, which I \nand others are cosponsors of, that would create a $5,000-a-year tax \ncredit for three years for home buyers of homes that are new or in or \nnear foreclosure. This tax credit would only apply for a limited period \nof time. Senator Bond included this provision in his housing \nlegislation as well. Some work would have to be done to make sure this \nwasn't just for speculators. But the idea is a pretty simple one: Let's \ncreate some more home buyers through this incentive because that is \ngood for homeowners. It is not just good for the person who has the \nforeclosed home but for everybody else whose house is not foreclosed, \nbecause if we stabilize the housing market by providing an influx of \nnew home buyers, that will help preserve home values for everybody else \nin the market. And that will bring more confidence to the economy. I \nthink that is a very good idea. It costs some money--about $10 billion \nto $14 billion over five years--in the form that it was originally \nintroduced. Maybe it could be done at a little less of a cost.\n\n  One thing we know is that a similar tax credit was tried before in \nthe 1970s. Senator Isakson says that at that time we had a 3-year \ninventory of unsold homes, and that tax credit--at a lower figure then \nbecause the dollars were a little less then--helped reduce the \ninventory of unsold homes from 3 years to 1 year. That is an idea \nworthy of consideration.\n  There is a lot of talk on both sides of the aisle about counseling \nfor people buying homes. I have bought and sold some homes. I am \ntrained to be a lawyer and I have been in Government. I would not think \nof buying or selling a home without a lawyer's help. I am not sure I \ncould understand all of the forms I signed the most recent time I \nbought a home. We can do much better than that. The basic information \nought to be up front so that people can understand, first, how long \ntheir mortgage lasts, what the interest rate is during the whole time, \nand what the monthly cost is. Those are the basic things. Then there \nare some other things that could also be clarified. Full disclosure--\nthe Senator from Texas talked about that earlier--and loan counseling \nare ideas that the Senate can help with.\n  Senator Martinez, a former Secretary of the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development, was a part of the press conference the Republican \nleader called this morning to discuss several Republican ideas that we \nhave and which we hope are considered in this debate. Senator Martinez \nhas proposals about FHA loans, which are the loans that first-time home \nbuyers often have, and for how to deal with Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac--the agencies that buy mortgages.\n\n[[Page S2282]]\n\n  There is a lot we can do in the Senate to help preserve home buying, \nand the way to find out what we can do is to do exactly what the \nDemocratic leader and the Republican leader have given us the \nopportunity to do.\n  Finally, I would like to say this, as I said in the beginning of my \nremarks. No one should believe, because the Democratic and Republican \nleaders and the rest of us standing behind them put us into a process \nto try to achieve a result, that it will be easy. No one should believe \nthat there won't be a debate, or that there is any guarantee of \nsuccess. Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby said that failure is not an \noption. I believe that, too, but we are going to have to discuss it to \nget there. It may take a few days. We are dealing with a big economy. \nSo process may be a result, process may be substance, but either way, \nthis is the beginning of the process toward a result.\n  Also, at least from my point of view, I would not want anyone to \nthink that I believe the Government by itself can solve this problem. \nWe sometimes forget--particularly at a time when we have an economic \nslowdown, as we do today--what a fortunate country we are and what a \nstrong economy we have. I mentioned earlier that year-in and year-out, \nthis economy in the United States produces 30 percent of all of the \nwealth in the world, measured by GDP, for just 5 percent of the people \nof the world. And we will do it again this year, as we did last year \nand as we will do again next year. Five percent of us Americans live \nhere, and we will produce this year about 30 percent of the wealth in \nthe world, according to the International Monetary Fund. Now we are in \na little bit of a slowdown. It is important to understand that we are \nbeing honest about that. It is a slowdown, and it is a housing slump, \nand we have a problem.\n  We also have a big, strong economy--we have the biggest, strongest \neconomy and the freest market, and our fundamental approach in \nGovernment ought to be to make sure that it stays that way.\n  So, for me and for many on this side of the aisle--and maybe others \non the other side too--there are fundamental long-term propositions to \nreally balance the family budget. We can do this by having low taxes, \nhaving less Government, having 2-year budgets so we could have more \ntime to conduct oversight and review regulations, which means less \nregulation.\n  The way to have a strong economy is to have the right labor-\nmanagement relations. In Tennessee, for example, when we were \nrecruiting automobile plants, it meant the right-to-work law was very \nimportant to us as a State. We also need to have a first-class \neducation system for all Americans, and that means dealing with \ndisagreeable subjects like paying teachers more for teaching well or \ngiving low-income kids more choices of good schools like the wealthy \nhave. We need to also stop runaway lawsuits so that doctors don't move \nout of rural areas and so pregnant women don't have to drive 60 miles \nto Memphis to see a doctor for prenatal health care. That drives up \nhealth care costs. We also have to work together to find a way for \nevery American to have health insurance. This is a long list, but if we \nreally want economic strength, that is what it takes.\n  I learned this in a small way as a Governor of the third poorest \nState in the 1980s. My goal was to raise family income. I kept working \nfor ways to do that. We already had low taxes and we had a right-to-\nwork law. Our good location helped. We had to get rid of the usury \nlimit, and we had to improve the schools. Then I found that we needed \nfour-lane highways.\n  So there are many parts to a strong economy. These temporary measures \nwe are taking, hopefully, in the next few days will help, I hope, \npreserve home values by stabilizing housing and restarting the economy.\n  I see no reason why we cannot create more transparency and counseling \nand make it possible for more mortgages to be refinanced and give tax \ncredits to home buyers to create more homeowners. We can do that, but \nthese are short-term measures. Then we can have other principled \ndebates in the Senate about whether we are going to have lower taxes \nand whether we are going to have less Government and whether we are \ngoing to have fewer runaway lawsuits. And discussions on whether we are \ngoing to be willing to pay teachers more for teaching well or whether \nwe will have a research and development tax credit so our companies \nwon't go overseas or whether we are going to create opportunities for \nskilled researchers and workers to come into the United States so that \nwe can in-source some of the brainpower that creates all this wealth we \nhave enjoyed for so long.\n  I am glad to have the opportunity to come to the floor to \ncongratulate Senators Reid and McConnell. They have done what leaders \nought to do. They have put the Senate in a position to do what we \nshould do, and that is to stand on our principles, offer our best \nideas, work in good faith across party lines, and try to get a result \nand help the American people. The American people like to see the \nSenate acting that way. I am glad to have been a part of the Senate \nthat acted that way on the America COMPETES Act, on the fuel efficiency \nstandards, on economic stimulus, and on the foreign intelligence \nsurveillance bill we passed recently. I am glad to be a part of the \nSenate that is preparing to act on housing slump.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, a month ago I came to the floor to speak \non behalf of America's homeowners. Since then, tens of thousands of \nfamilies have lost their homes. Since then, we have been watching home \nprices fall, we have been watching foreclosure rates skyrocket, and we \nhave been watching tens of thousands of Americans lose their jobs.\n  In my home State of New Jersey, over the next 2 years, we expect more \nthan 57,000 homes to be lost to foreclosure. That means 57,000 families \nwho will have to hand over the keys to their home, 57,000 families who \nwill be forced to say goodbye to the place where they were nurtured and \ncomforted, a place where they lived during good and bad times, places \nthey came home to every night, a place they celebrated birthdays and \nwept over losses.\n  In the words of families, we know what it feels like to lose their \nhome. They will feel as if they have lost everything.\n  Nationwide, the number of foreclosures that is going to happen if we \ndon't act is unfathomable. Two million American families are in line to \nlose their homes over the next 2 years, and everyone stands to lose \nfrom foreclosures. Lenders report losing tens of thousands of dollars \non each foreclosure. Neighbors see the value of their own homes drop. \nWhen we see that 63,000 Americans lost their jobs a month ago, when we \nsee weak earnings reports from businesses, wild swings in the stock \nmarket, and the collapse of a major firm on Wall Street, we can see \nthis housing crisis is truly shaking the entire economy to its core. It \nclearly has a major ripple effect.\n  We all know at the heart of this economic downturn is the housing \ncrisis. So the question is: How long are we going to watch before we \nrealize it is time to take action?\n  I marvel when a year ago this past March I said at a Senate Banking \nCommittee hearing that we are going to have a tsunami of foreclosures \nand the Bush administration said: Oh, no, that is an overdramatization. \nI said then: I hope you are right and I am wrong. The reality is, we \nhave not even seen the crest of that tsunami take place.\n  Not only did they say it was not real, but they refused to act in any \nmeaningful way. But when it was clear that a major investment bank on \nWall Street was in trouble, the Bush administration rushed to the scene \nlike firefighters responding to a five-alarm blaze with $30 billion put \nup to ensure that JP Morgan Chase could buy Bear Stearns.\n  Regardless--and we will be reviewing both the propriety and the way \nand the standards that were used to pursue that, whether that is the \nappropriate standard, the way Bear Stearns ultimately was priced--a \nfull year into the subprime mortgage crisis, they have done nothing but \nhit the snooze button on the alarm as millions of Americans have \nwatched their dream of home ownership go up in smoke.\n  It is time we react with the same urgency and seriousness, no matter \nif the people who are in financial trouble are occupying a suburban \nhome in Madison or a rowhouse in Newark or Camden.\n\n[[Page S2283]]\n\n  I hope today finally there is a glimmer of hope for homeowners who \nhave been left to fight this battle alone. It is clear that Members on \nboth sides of the aisle have gotten the message that it is time to act. \nAnd it is clear what our goal has to be: helping families keep their \nhomes and in doing so helping our economy, which affects all of us.\n  I am pleased that we have made what seems to be an important \nbreakthrough in the Chamber. I have the utmost faith in Chairman Dodd \nand Ranking Member Shelby that they understand the urgency at hand, \nthat they will do their best to put forward a workable solution we can \nall support, and I certainly hope it is one I can support as well.\n  I strongly support Majority Leader Reid's bill as it is. I understand \nthe nature of compromise and negotiation, so I know it will change, but \nI hope that bipartisanship will not mean we will stray far from \nproviding the direct assistance that homeowners need--to stop \nforeclosures.\n  Here are a few key steps the final bill has to take. First, we need \nto provide funding for counseling in order to reach families at risk of \nlosing their homes. Many American families--I saw it during the recess \nwhen we were working back in our States--many American families are \nsitting around their kitchen tables looking through their mortgage \nbills, their finances, and, yes, their bank notices, and they don't \nknow where to turn. They don't know exactly what to do. It is not as if \nthey have a pot of money sitting in the bank. They do not. They are \ntrying to keep it together, keep their families together, keep their \nhopes and dreams and aspirations together. These counselors could offer \nthem real solutions and options to avoid receiving that foreclosure \nnotice or, even worse, foreclosure itself.\n  The Reid bill puts forward $200 million to make sure counseling \nreaches those who need it the most, and I think that is incredibly \nimportant.\n  Secondly, we need to provide funding to allow communities with high \nforeclosure rates to access community development block grants. \nCommunities can use these funds to purchase foreclosed properties for \nrehabilitation, rent, or resale. Having a foreclosed home sit abandoned \nin a community does not benefit anyone. This is one of the key points I \nalways make when I talk about this issue because a lot of people say \nthat is not about me. I got the right mortgage; I am paying for it; \nthis is about some people who made the wrong choices, and I don't want \nto pay for their wrong choices.\n  The problem with that is, first of all--and I will talk about it in a \nmoment--people were led to choices where maybe they did not have \nfinancial literacy, maybe they didn't have the wherewithal to fully \nunderstand the nature of what they, in many cases, were being misled \ninto--a mortgage product in which they should never have been.\n  Even looking at it in that respect, the bottom line is it affects us \nall. Why? Because a foreclosed home that sits abandoned in a community \ndoes not benefit anyone. It decreases surrounding home values and it \ncan attract crime and vandalism. The bottom line is that foreclosures \ndestabilize neighborhoods. The funds in this bill allow communities to \nstop that death spiral before it starts.\n  Some argue that stepping in to help our communities recover from the \nhousing crisis would somehow be a blow to the concept of personal \nresponsibility because some homeowners, as I said, made bad choices in \nsigning up for subprime mortgages.\n  First of all, let me say, don't get me wrong, personal responsibility \nis important, and that is why we need greater support for homeowner \neducation, for foreclosure counseling, and financial literacy so anyone \nthinking about buying a home will be able to understand the terms of \ntheir mortgage, even the fine print, and have the tools to protect \nthemselves.\n  What I have a problem with, as I listen to so many in the Chamber, is \nit seems that personal responsibility is always talked about as it \nrelates to the consumer. Personal responsibility is not just important \nfor homeowners, however. Every participant in the life of a loan needs \nto step up and take real responsibility and action.\n  What got us to where we are today? In my mind, unbridled free market \nextremes, excesses without appropriate regulation or without the \nattention of regulators has brought us to where we are.\n  I believe in the free market, but when it is unbridled, this is what \nhappens. Every broker, lender, realtor, every appraiser, regulator, \ncredit rating agency, and investing firm needs to make changes if we \nhave any hope of quieting the storm and not reliving it. The time for \nblame games is over. The time for action has come.\n  Third, I hope this body looks carefully at a provision that can help \nmore than 600,000 families stuck in bad loans keep their homes. I know \nsome of my colleagues are very concerned about this provision which \nwould give judges in bankruptcy proceedings the discretion to modify \nloan terms. But the fact is, this provision is very narrowly tailored, \nit is a one-time limited fix, and in the end it is a win-win not only \nfor borrowers but lenders alike. This provision alone would help over \n14,000 families in my State of New Jersey avoid foreclosure. That would \nbe a savings of about $5 billion in home values alone. My good friend \nSenator Durbin has done an excellent job at hammering out a compromise, \nand I hope my colleagues will give it careful consideration.\n  It is interesting, under the existing bankruptcy law, if you happen \nto have the good fortune of having a second home, a vacation home, a \nleisure home, guess what. The bankruptcy judge can go ahead and change \nyour financial obligations on that home, but the very essence of the \nAmerican dream, which is the home in which you live, to raise your \nfamily, to go through good and bad times, no, that cannot be \nrenegotiated. What an interesting set of values. For a leisure home, we \ncan go ahead and a bankruptcy judge can change the terms, but for those \nwho were sucked into a subprime mortgage who should never have been in \nthose types of mortgages and for which the regulation was not there to \nensure there was transparency and ensure there was oversight, oh, no, \nwe cannot touch that. In a place that talks so much about values, I \ndon't understand that set of values.\n  As we in the Congress debate how best to help homeowners, how best to \nend the housing crisis and how best to get this economy back on track, \nwe have to see the bigger picture. There is a lot at stake. No matter \nwho you are, no matter whether we have a subprime mortgage, no matter \nwhether we are making our obligations meet or whether we are finding \nourselves in distress, we are all in this together. When the house next \nto ours gets boarded up, it affects the value of our property, too, and \nhow safe we feel walking around our neighborhood at night. When that \nvalue goes down, it reduces the equity we have in our home upon which \nwe can borrow to put our kids through college, to take care of an \nuncovered medical bill or emergency, or even for the resources we will \nhave for our retirement. No one is immune.\n  So this sense of personal responsibility, yes, but understand that we \nall have a stake. When a neighbor of ours has to declare bankruptcy and \nis forever saddled with debt they cannot pay, they shop less at our \nstores, purchase fewer of the services our community offers, and, \nobviously, the more foreclosures we see in a neighborhood, property \nvalues decline. When those property values decline, rateable bases go \ndown--and that is the way municipalities ultimately receive their \nresources which means, what? Either taxes have to go up to cover \nexisting services of police, firefighters, education, whatever, or we \ncut the services. We are all in this together.\n  When a nonprofit organization in Jersey City is close to finishing \nthe building of its new arts center so it can give kids an opportunity \nto do something productive after school and stay away from gangs and \nthey cannot get the last bit of money they need because of this credit \ncrunch and housing crisis, it affects us all.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King reminded us that ``we are all tied in a single \ngarment of destiny'' and that ``we cannot walk alone.'' This is a \ncrisis we are all in together as a nation. And there is no reason we \ncan't all work together to end it. It is in America's interest to do \nso, and I hope the Senate, which has shown a moment of a possibility of \nwhat can be done, seizes that moment\n\n[[Page S2284]]\n\non behalf of our fellow citizens but also on behalf of our collective \ninterest, on behalf of our economy, and, in doing so, on behalf of our \nNation.\n\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           The Right to Vote\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to speak to an issue \nthat is all too familiar to my State of Florida but has now taken on \nsuch importance that it is a subject that is all too familiar to the \nentire country, joined by our sister State, Michigan; it is an issue \nthat is sacred to our democracy. It is the issue of the right to vote \nand to have that vote counted as it was intended.\n  A year ago, the Florida legislature passed a bill to move Florida's \nPresidential primary to an early date on the national election \ncalendar. Their thinking was to give our large and diverse State, which \nis a microcosm of the entire country, more of a say in the selection of \nPresidential nominees. This violated the two national parties' rules, \nand the threat was made that if Florida moved ahead, both the \nRepublican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee \nwould take away half of Florida's delegates. The Florida legislature, \ndespite that, changed the date of Florida's election by law, moving it \n1 week earlier than the imposed deadline by the two national parties.\n  The Florida legislature is controlled by the Republican Party, and \nthe Democrats in the legislature, through their Democratic leader in \nthe Florida House as well as the Florida Senate, offered an amendment \nto put the date of the Florida primary back to February 5 so it did not \nviolate the two national party rules. That amendment was defeated. The \nbill went on to final passage.\n  In addition to the January 29 date for the Presidential primary, it \nwas primarily a bill about election machines and accountability. So on \nfinal passage it was clearly going to be a near unanimous vote. \nTherefore, the Florida legislature passed and the Republican Governor \nsigned into law the new election date.\n  I repeat that story because people who want to penalize Florida often \nmiss the fact that it was not Florida Democrats who changed the date. \nWell, we all know what happened after that. Both national parties \ndecided to punish Florida because those parties' rules reserved the \nearly Presidential contest to a handful of other States.\n  The Republican National Committee, pursuant to their rules, took away \nhalf of Florida's delegation. The Democratic National Committee decided \nto extract an extra pound of flesh and took away all of the delegates \nof Florida's delegation.\n  For 8 months now, I have been immersed in a fight to get the chairman \nof my party to end the stalemate and to seek Florida's delegates and to \nhonor the January 29 primary vote because on that date we had a \nhistoric turnout. Some 3.6 million citizens headed to the polls and \ncast ballots in Florida's Democratic and Republican Presidential \nprimaries.\n  For me, it is pretty simple. It is a case of fundamental rights \nversus party rules. So when there could not be a compromise worked out \nlast August, September, and into October, I sued my own party in \nFederal district court. In December, the Federal judge ruled against my \nmotion, and at that late date it was too late to appeal.\n  I have continued to push for my party to find a way to seat a \ndelegation from Florida, while giving Floridians a meaningful voice in \nthe selection of their party's nominee. This fight has been based on \nthe principle that, in America, every citizen has an equal right to \nvote, it is based on a premise that Floridians are entitled to have \ntheir votes count as intended, and it is based on a belief that we all \ndeserve a say in picking our Presidential nominees.\n  More recently, I, along with others, asked the national Democratic \nParty to look into paying for a mail-in revote. The party declined. The \nState party proposed it, few people could agree on the specifics, and \ncertainly the candidates themselves couldn't agree on the specifics. \nNow we are at a point where reaching a solution is critical. And so \nwhen we were last in session, about 2\\1/2\\ weeks ago, I asked the two \nDemocratic candidates, who happened to be on the floor that day when we \nhad the session that lasted most of the night, to consider a proposal \nwhereby they would go back to the original rules of the Democratic \nParty and seat the delegation with half its vote but still based on the \nJanuary 29 results. This is allowed by the Democratic rules, as it was \ndone by the GOP.\n  If nothing else, all this brouhaha we now find ourselves in for this \nelection has certainly provided further evidence our system is broken. \nYet as to our right to vote and to have that vote count, there can be \nno debate. The goal is simple. The principle is very simple: It is one \nperson, one vote.\n  Last fall, I filed legislation in the Senate to require that no vote \nbe cast for Federal office on a touch-screen voting machine starting in \nthe next Presidential election 4 years from now. I also joined the \nsenior Senator from Michigan, Senator Levin, to propose a system of six \nrotating interregional primaries, from March to June, in each \nPresidential election year. Very soon, I am filing a broader based \nelection reform bill, and this new legislation will abolish the \nelectoral college.\n\n  It will be a proposed constitutional amendment and will, therefore, \ngive citizens direct election of their President by the popular vote. \nWe have seen in the history of this country a few times when one \ncandidate gets the most votes, but it is the other candidate that wins \nbecause of the archaic electoral college process provided in the \nConstitution. In this new package, it will have the six rotating \ninterregional primaries that will give both large States and small \nStates a fair say in the nomination process.\n  This legislation will establish early voting in each State to make it \neasier for the voter to vote, instead of going on 1 day. It will \neliminate machines that don't produce a voting paper trail, so if you \nhave to recount, you don't have just a piece of software, you have the \nactual paper trail in order to be able to do the recount in an accurate \nway.\n  This package will allow every qualified voter in every State to cast \nan absentee ballot on demand. In some States, you can't cast an \nabsentee ballot unless you fill out some affidavit that says you are \nnot going to be in your city on the day of the election, or that you \nare sick and you can't get to the election. We ought to make it easy \nfor the voter to vote.\n  The package will also give grants to States that develop mail-in \nballoting and grants for pilot studies to study secure Internet voting.\n  We have had too many of these questions arise in my State of Florida \nover the years, and perhaps this is why Floridians are so sensitive \nabout this. So I am reaching out to my colleagues. I respectfully ask \neach of the Senators to make suggestions to make this a better bill. \nLet's remember it was more than 230 years ago that our Founding Fathers \ndeclared all men are created equal, but the country still had to wait \nanother 87 years before President Lincoln signed a proclamation freeing \nthe slaves. It took another 57 years before women in America were \nallowed to vote.\n  In 1872, Susan B. Anthony was arrested for voting. After that, she \ndelivered a speech on women's right to vote. ``The ballot,'' she said, \n``is the only means of securing the blessings of liberty provided by \nthis government.'' Let me repeat those profound words. ``The ballot,'' \nSusan B. Anthony said, ``is the only means of securing the blessings of \nliberty provided by this government.'' Even still, it took another 93 \nyears before our Nation belatedly enacted a law guaranteeing every U.S. \ncitizen an equal right to vote--the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  This country cannot afford to wait another 93 years before we fix the \nflaws we still see in our election system. The blessings of liberty \ncannot wait. With what we have seen thus far in this election cycle, \nthe time for election reform is now.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2285]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, as I listened yesterday to the partisan \nrhetoric we continue to hear from Senate Republicans on nominations, I \nam disappointed that the Republican leader is ignoring the majority \nleader's statement from last May 10.\n  Today is April Fools' Day. I do not think the American people are \nfooled or amused by continued partisan bickering over nominations. \nIndeed, with a massive subprime mortgage crisis that has left so many \nAmericans in dire straights, fearful of losing their homes, the \nRepublican efforts to create an issue over judicial nominees is \nmisplaced. In fact, I have been working hard to make progress and have \ntreated this President's nominees more fairly than Republicans treated \nthose of President Clinton. Judicial nominations are not the most \npressing problem facing the country. Indeed, we have worked hard to \nlower vacancies to the lowest levels in decades. We have cut circuit \nvacancies in half.\n  It should be no surprise that the administration would rather focus \non having a partisan political fight than the news that, in February, \nthe United States lost 63,000 jobs. To make up for those and other job \nlosses in recent months thanks to this President's policies, this \ncountry would need to create 200,000 jobs every month. This \nadministration is apparently more worried about the jobs of a handful \nof controversial nominees, many without the necessary support of their \nhome State senators, than the loss of jobs by thousands of American \nworkers.\n  Unemployment is up over 20 percent, the price of gas has more than \ndoubled and is now at a record high average of over $3.20, trillions of \ndollars in budget surplus have been turned into trillions of dollars of \ndebt with an annual budget deficit of hundreds of millions of dollars, \nand the trade deficit has nearly doubled to almost $1 trillion. Indeed, \njust to pay down the interest on the national debt and the massive \ncosts generated by the disastrous war in Iraq--the fifth anniversary of \nwhich we tragically marked 2 weeks ago--costs more than $1 billion a \nday. That is $365 billion each year that would be better spent on \npriorities like health care for all Americans, better schools, and \nfighting crime and treating diseases at home and abroad.\n  Perhaps the only thing that has gone down during the Bush Presidency \nis judicial vacancies. After the Republican Senate chose to stall \nconsideration of circuit nominees and maintain vacancies during the \nClinton administration in anticipation of a Republican Presidency, \njudicial vacancies rose to over 100. Circuit vacancies doubled during \nthe Clinton years. Since I became Judiciary chairman in 2001, we have \nworked to cut those vacancies in half.\n  In the Clinton years, Senator Hatch justified the slow progress by \npointing to the judicial vacancy rate. When the vacancy rate stood at \n7.2 percent, Senator Hatch declared that ``there is and has been no \njudicial vacancy crisis'' and that this was a ``rather low percentage \nof vacancies that shows the judiciary is not suffering from an \noverwhelming number of vacancies.'' Because of Republican inaction, the \nvacancy rate continued to rise, reaching nearly 10 percent at the end \nof President Clinton's term. The number of circuit court vacancies rose \nto 32 with retirements of Republican appointed circuit judges \nimmediately after President Bush took office.\n\n  Then, as soon as a Republican President was elected they sought to \nturn the tables and take full advantage of the vacancies they prevented \nfrom being filled during the Clinton Presidency. They have been \nextraordinarily successful over the past dozen years. Currently, more \nthan 60 percent of active judges on the Federal circuit courts were \nappointed by Republican Presidents, and more than 35 percent have been \nappointed by this President. The Senate has already confirmed three-\nquarters of this President's circuit court nominees, compared to only \nhalf of President Clinton's.\n  I was here in 1999 when the Republican chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee would not hold a hearing for a single judicial nominee until \nJune. In contrast, we have scheduled 3 hearings on 11 nominees so far \nthis year. We have a circuit nominee from Texas listed on the Judiciary \nCommittee agenda this week. I wrote to the President during the last \nrecess commending him for nominating someone for a Virginia vacancy to \nthe Fourth Circuit who is supported by Senator Warner and Senator Webb, \na Republican and a Democrat, and indicated that I would use my best \nefforts to proceed to that nomination as soon as the paperwork is \nsubmitted. I will ask that a copy of that letter be printed in the \nRecord at the end of my statement. In that letter, I also informed the \nPresident that an anonymous Republican hold had prevented Senate \nconfirmation of the President's nominees to be the Associate Attorney \nGeneral, the No. 3 position at DOJ, and the Assistant Attorney General \nfor the Civil Division.\n  Since the resignations of the entire top leadership at the Department \nof Justice last year in the wake of the scandals of the Gonzales era, I \nhave made restoring the leadership ranks at the Department a priority. \nSince September, the committee has held seven hearings on executive \nnominations, including a 2-day hearing for the Attorney General. The \nAttorney General and the new Deputy Attorney General have been \nconfirmed. But for Republican delays in refusing to cooperate and make \na quorum in February, and now the anonymous hold, the Senate would have \nconfirmed two more high-level DOJ nominees.\n  The partisan rhetoric on nominations rings especially hollow in light \nof the progress we have made. Last year, the Senate confirmed 40 \njudges, including 6 circuit judges. The 40 confirmations were more than \nduring any of the 3 preceding years with Republicans in charge. The \nSenate has now confirmed 140 judges in the almost 3 years it has been \nrun by Democrats and only 158 judges in the more than 4 years it was \nrun by Republicans.\n  We continue to make progress. Four district court nominations are \npending on the Senate's Executive Calendar. I have mentioned the \nnomination to the Fifth Circuit that is pending on the Judiciary \nCommittee's agenda this week. I have already announced and noticed \nanother hearing this Thursday for four more judicial nominees, two from \nVirginia and two from Missouri, and for the nominee to be the Assistant \nAttorney General for the Office of Legal Policy. This will be the \nJudiciary Committee's fifth confirmation hearing this year.\n  With respect to the recent nomination of Steven Agee to a Virginia \nseat in the Fourth Circuit, it is regrettable that Justice Agee's \nnomination only comes after months of delay when the White House \ninsisted on sending to the Senate the nomination of Duncan Getchell. \nThat nomination did not have the support of either of the Virginia \nSenators and was withdrawn after the Virginia Senators objected \npublicly. In fact, the delay in filling that vacancy has lasted years \nbecause this President insisted on sending forward highly controversial \nnominations like William Haynes, Claude Allen, and Duncan Getchell.\n  In my letter to the President, I wrote that I expect the Judiciary \nCommittee and the Senate to proceed promptly to consider and confirm \nJustice Agee's nomination with the support of Senator Warner and \nSenator Webb, just as we proceeded last year to confirm the nomination \nof Judge Randy Smith to the Ninth Circuit, once the President had \nwithdrawn his nomination for a California seat and resubmitted it for a \nvacancy from Idaho. I urged the President to use the Agee nomination as \na model for working with home State senators and Senators from both \nsides of the aisle. Time is running short.\n  Senate Democrats should not and have not acted the way Republicans \ndid by pocket filibustering more than 60 of\n\n[[Page S2286]]\n\nPresident Clinton's nominees. I would rather see us work with the \nPresident on the selection of nominees that the Senate can proceed to \nconfirm than waste precious time fighting about controversial nominees \nwho he selects in order to score political points. I would also rather \nsee the Senate focus on addressing the real priorities of the country \nrather than catering only to an extreme wing of the Republican base \nwith controversial nominees.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 2008.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I write again, as I did last November, \n     to demonstrate my willingness to work constructively with you \n     in accordance with the Senate's important role in the \n     consideration of your nominees to high-ranking positions in \n     the executive branch and to lifetime appointments on our \n     Federal courts.\n       Since last September, the Senate Judiciary Committee has \n     been hard at work seeking to help restore the Department of \n     Justice. The leadership ranks at the Department of Justice \n     were decimated by the scandals of the Gonzales era. The \n     Judiciary Committee's hearing last week was the seventh \n     hearing we have held since September on executive \n     nominations. The Senate has proceeded to confirm a new \n     Attorney General, a new Deputy Attorney General, and numerous \n     other nominations to fill high-ranking positions at the \n     Justice Department.\n       I regret to inform you that we were stalled last week in \n     our efforts to fill two other critical positions at the \n     Department, when an anonymous Republican hold blocked \n     confirmation of Kevin O'Connor to be the Associate Attorney \n     General, and Gregory Katsas to be the Assistant Attorney \n     General in charge of the Civil Division. I was particularly \n     disappointed with this unexpected development. We had worked \n     hard to expedite these nominations, holding a hearing on the \n     first day of this session of Congress. After a nearly month-\n     long delay, when Republican Members of the Judiciary \n     Committee effectively boycotted our business meetings in \n     February, we were able to report these nominations to the \n     Senate in early March. They were set for confirmation before \n     the Easter recess, until the last-minute Republican objection \n     stalled them. They join your nomination of Michael Sullivan \n     to be the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \n     Firearms and Explosives as among those stymied by Republican \n     objections. I trust at any future White House event on the \n     status of nominations you will point out that several of your \n     high-level executive nominations are being stalled by \n     Republican objections.\n       With respect to judicial nominations, I want to commend you \n     for working with Senators Warner and Webb to identify a \n     nominee from those they recommended to you to fill a Virginia \n     Fourth Circuit vacancy.\n       Your previous nominations from Virginia, William Haynes, \n     Claude Allen and Duncan Getchell, were controversial and did \n     not proceed. Following your withdrawal of the Getchell \n     nomination earlier this year, I urged you to work with the \n     Virginia Senators. I now thank you for doing so.\n       I expect your nomination of Steven Agee to be considered \n     promptly following completion of the necessary paperwork. I \n     want to encourage meaningful consultation with Senators of \n     both parties. Just as we proceeded last year to confirm your \n     nomination of Judge Randy Smith to the Ninth Circuit, once \n     you had withdrawn his nomination for a California seat and \n     resubmitted it for a vacancy from Idaho, I expect the \n     Judiciary Committee and the Senate to proceed to confirm \n     Justice Agee with the support of Senator Warner and Senator \n     Webb. I urge you to work with Senators from other states, as \n     well, so that we might make progress before time runs out on \n     your Presidency and the Thurmond Rule precludes additional \n     confirmations.\n       Your judicial nominations have fared far better than those \n     of your Democratic predecessor. Nearly 90 percent of your \n     nominations have been confirmed to lifetime appointments. \n     Approximately three-quarters of your circuit nominations, \n     compared to little more than half of President Clinton's \n     circuit court nominations, have been confirmed. We have \n     succeeded in reducing overall vacancies and circuit court \n     vacancies to as few as half as many as during President \n     Clinton's term. With four more judicial nominations on the \n     Senate's Executive Calendar and another pending on the Senate \n     Judiciary agenda, I am proceeding to notice another hearing \n     for judicial nominees for the week immediately following the \n     Easter recess. That will be our fifth nominations hearing so \n     far this year.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2286-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2286-S2287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING WALTER F. MONDALE\n\n   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this weekend, Marcelle and I will attend \nan event at the University of Minnesota Law School to honor the life \nand career of Vice President Walter Mondale on the occasion of his 80th \nbirthday which he reached in January.\n   Vice President Mondale is a valued friend whom I proudly consider \none of my mentors in the Senate. As I reviewed materials for this \nweekend, I came across an editorial by Vice President Mondale that \nappeared in the Washington Post on July 27, 2007 entitled ``Answering \nto No One.'' The editorial provides an excellent perspective on the \nOffice of the Vice President and how that office evolved in recent \nhistory.\n   In order to remind all Senators and their staffs about this \ninsightful article, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                           Answering to No One\n\n                         (By Walter F. Mondale)\n\n        The Post's recent series on Dick Cheney's vice presidency \n     certainly got my attention. Having held that office myself \n     over a quarter-century ago, I have more than a passing \n     interest in its evolution from the backwater of American \n     politics to the second most powerful position in our \n     government. Almost all of that evolution, under presidents \n     and vice presidents of both parties, has been positive--until \n     now. Under George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, it has gone \n     seriously off track.\n        The Founders created the vice presidency as a \n     constitutional afterthought, solely to provide a president-\n     in-reserve should the need arise. The only duty they \n     specified was that the vice president should preside over the \n     Senate. The office languished in obscurity and irrelevance \n     for more than 150 years until Richard Nixon saw it as a \n     platform from which to seek the Republican presidential \n     nomination in 1960. That worked, and the office has been an \n     effective launching pad for aspiring candidates since.\n        But it wasn't until Jimmy Carter assumed the presidency \n     that the vice presidency took on a substantive role. Carter \n     saw the office as an underused asset and set out to make the \n     most of it. He gave me an office in the West Wing, unimpeded \n     access to him and to the flow of information, and specific \n     assignments at home and abroad. He asked me, as the only \n     other nationally elected official, to be his adviser and \n     partner on a range of issues.\n        Our relationship depended on trust, mutual respect and an \n     acknowledgement that there was only one agenda to be served--\n     the president's. Every Monday the two of us met privately for \n     lunch; we could, and did, talk candidly about virtually \n     anything. By the end of four years we had completed the \n     ``executivization'' of the vice presidency, ending two \n     centuries of confusion, derision and irrelevance surrounding \n     the office.\n        Subsequent administrations followed this pattern. George \n     H.W. Bush, Dan Quayle and Al Gore built their vice \n     presidencies after this model, allowing for their different \n     interests, experiences and capabilities as well as the needs \n     of the presidents they served.\n        This all changed in 2001, and especially after Sept. 11, \n     when Cheney set out to create a largely independent power \n     center in the office of the vice president. His was an \n     unprecedented attempt not only to shape administration policy \n     but, alarmingly, to limit the policy options sent to the \n     president. It is essential that a president know all the \n     relevant facts and viable options before making decisions, \n     yet Cheney has discarded the ``honest broker'' role he played \n     as President Gerald Ford's chief of staff.\n        Through his vast government experience, through the \n     friends he had been able to place in key positions and \n     through his considerable political skills, he has been \n     increasingly able to determine the answers to questions put \n     to the president--because he has been able to determine the \n     questions. It was Cheney who persuaded President Bush to sign \n     an order that denied access to any court by foreign terrorism \n     suspects and Cheney who determined that the Geneva \n     Conventions did not apply to enemy combatants captured in \n     Afghanistan and Iraq.\n        Rather than subject his views to an established (and \n     rational) vetting process, his practice has been to trust \n     only his immediate staff before taking ideas directly to the \n     president. Many of the ideas that Bush has subsequently \n     bought into have proved offensive to the values of the \n     Constitution and have been embarrassingly overturned by the \n     courts.\n        The corollary to Cheney's zealous embrace of secrecy is \n     his near total aversion to the notion of accountability. I've \n     never seen a former member of the House of Representatives \n     demonstrate such contempt for Congress--even when it was \n     controlled by his own party. His insistence on invoking \n     executive privilege to block virtually every congressional \n     request for information has been stupefying--it's almost as \n     if he denies the legitimacy of an equal branch of government. \n     Nor does he exhibit much respect for public opinion, which \n     amounts to indifference toward being held accountable by the \n     people who elected him.\n        Whatever authority a vice president has is derived from \n     the president under whom he\n\n[[Page S2287]]\n\n     serves. There are no powers inherent in the office; they must \n     be delegated by the president. Somehow, not only has Cheney \n     been given vast authority by President Bush--including, \n     apparently, the entire intelligence portfolio--but he also \n     pursues his own agenda. The real question is why the \n     president allows this to happen.\n        Three decades ago we lived through another painful example \n     of a White House exceeding its authority, lying to the \n     American people, breaking the law and shrouding everything it \n     did in secrecy. Watergate wrenched the country, and our \n     constitutional system, like nothing before. We spent years \n     trying to identify and absorb the lessons of this great \n     excess. But here we are again.\n        Since the Carter administration left office, we have been \n     criticized for many things. Yet I remain enormously proud of \n     what we did in those four years, especially that we told the \n     truth, obeyed the law and kept the peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2287-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2287-S2288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMERICA'S WOUNDED WARRIORS ACT\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss S. 2674, a bill I \nintroduced to improve and modernize the disability system of the \nDepartment of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs so that it \nmeets the needs of both our older generations of veterans and our \nwounded warriors coming home today.\n  One of the most sacred trusts we make is the one with our veterans. \nTheir sacrifices, and the sacrifices of their families, are inspiring. \nThe desire to provide these heroes with the benefits and services they \nneed and deserve is certainly something we can all agree on.\n  With this sacred trust in mind, I recently introduced legislation to \nensure veterans have a disability system that we can all be proud of--a \nsystem that is updated to reflect the modern day, is consistent, is not \noverly bureaucratic, and meets the needs of all generations of \nveterans.\n  The challenges facing our newer veterans are apparent. Over the past \nfew years, I have met with many young servicemembers, some from my home \nState of North Carolina, who have suffered devastating injuries while \nserving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Almost as remarkable as their courage \nand their can-do attitudes, is their outlook about the future.\n  These wounded warriors rightfully expect that serious injuries should \nnot prevent them from living productive and fulfilling lives. In fact, \nmany want nothing less than to return to their units, and with modern \nmedicine and technology, many are doing just that.\n  But for those who are not able to continue serving, like Ted Wade \nfrom my home State, they deserve a disability system that meets their \nneeds and expectations. We should be giving them--in a quick, hassle \nfree, and effective way--the benefits and services they need to return \nto their full and productive lives.\n  But, the need for an improved system became very clear last year, \nwhen news reports detailed how some seriously injured servicemembers at \nWalter Reed endured a lengthy, hard-to-understand, bureaucratic process \nto try to get their disability benefits. This left many injured \nservicemembers and their families frustrated, confused, and \ndisappointed. It left our Nation angry and ashamed.\n  Let me give you a brief idea of what an injured servicemember may \nhave to go through. Consider a young soldier who is injured in Iraq and \nis no longer fit for duty because of his injuries. Before he can be \ndischarged from the military, he may go through a lengthy, complex \nprocess with the Department of Defense to be assigned a disability \nrating between 0 percent and 100 percent.\n  If the rating is high enough--30 percent or more--he will get a \nlifetime annuity, health care for his entire family, exchange and \ncommissary privileges, and other benefits. If it is below 30 percent, \nhe will get only a lump-sum severance payment. But there have been no \nbright-line rules on how these ratings are assigned. Each branch of the \nmilitary has used different procedures, so servicemembers in various \nbranches often receive different ratings even for the same injuries.\n  After going through that confusing process, the injured soldier may \nthen go through a similar bureaucratic process with the Department of \nVeterans Affairs to get a VA rating. That rating will determine not \nonly the level of monthly disability compensation he will receive from \nVA, but eligibility for other benefits and services such as vocational \nrehabilitation and priority access to VA health care.\n  As if all of that isn't confusing enough, both DOD and VA assign \nthose disability ratings based on the same VA rating schedule, but the \nratings are often different. And, there are complicated rules over how \nmuch of the benefits from DOD and VA the veteran may receive at the \nsame time. If those watching today are as confused by that description \nof the process as I am, imagine what our veterans have to endure.\n  On top of all that, the rating schedule used by both VA and DOD to \ndetermine who gets these critical benefits is completely outdated. This \nschedule was developed in the early 1900s and about 35 percent of it \nhas not been updated since 1945.\n  The schedule is also riddled with outdated criteria that do not track \nwith modern medicine. Take for example traumatic arthritis. The rating \nschedule requires a veteran to show proof of this condition through x-\nray evidence. But doctors today would generally diagnose the condition \nusing more modern technology, like an MRI.\n  Even worse, experts are telling us the schedule is not adequate for \nrating conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic \nbrain injury, which are afflicting so many of our veterans from the war \non terror. Also, experts have told us that the schedule does not \nadequately compensate young, severely disabled veterans; veterans with \nmental disabilities; and veterans who are unemployable.\n  So, it's completely understandable why so many veterans are \nfrustrated and confused by this system. The question is:\n  How do we fix it?\n  To help answer that question, two distinguished commissions issued \nreports last year laying out the problems with the system and giving us \na road map to a modern, more consistent, and simpler system. One \ncommission, the President's Commission on Care for America's Returning \nWounded Warriors, was chaired by former Senator Bob Dole and former \nSecretary Donna Shalala. The other, the Veterans' Disability Benefits \nCommission, was chaired by General James Terry Scott.\n  Here are just a few examples of what these commissions found:\n\n       Despite their disability systems' different intents, \n     processes, and outcomes, DOD and VA use the same outdated \n     rating sched-\n     ule . . . . [which] has not been completely revised since \n     1945.\n       [T]he policies and procedures used by VA and DOD are not \n     consistent and the resulting dual systems are not in the best \n     interest of the injured servicemember nor the nation.\n       The purpose of the current veterans disability compensation \n     program . . . is to compensate for average impairment in \n     earning capacity . . . This is an unduly restrictive \n     rationale for the program and is inconsistent with current \n     models of disability.\n       The goal of disability benefits should be rehabilitation \n     and reintegration into civilian life'' but that goal ``is not \n     being met.\n\n  These two commissions strongly recommended that we need to: get rid \nof the overlapping, confusing roles of VA and DOD in the disability \nrating process; completely update the VA disability rating schedule; \ncompensate veterans for any loss of quality of life, while also \ncompensating them for any loss in their earnings capacity; and place \nmore emphasis on the treatment and rehabilitation of injured veterans.\n  As the Dole-Shalala Commission cautioned, ``We don't recommend merely \npatching the system, as has been done in the past. Instead, the \nexperiences of these young men and women have highlighted the need for \nfundamental changes.''\n  What's interesting to note here is that similar changes to the system \nwere recommended in 1956 by a commission led by General Omar Bradley. \nBack in the 1950s, the Bradley Commission wrote in its report: ``Our \nphilosophy of veterans' benefits must . . . be modernized and the whole \nstructure of traditional veterans' programs brought up to date.'' If my \nmath is right that was over 50 years ago. Clearly, we are long overdue \nfor some improvements.\n  I believe the bill I introduced will start us on the right path to \nmaking this system more straight-forward, consistent, and modern. Let \nme give you an idea of what America's Wounded Warriors Act would do.\n\n[[Page S2288]]\n\n  First, the bill would simplify the DOD process and make it more \nconsistent. Any servicemember found unfit for duty--regardless of the \nseverity of the disability--would receive a lifetime annuity based on \nrank and years of service and would receive other retirement benefits, \nsuch as commissary and exchange privileges. Eligibility for TRICARE \nwould be determined by Congress or DOD, after further studies on that \nissue.\n  These changes would get DOD out of the business of assigning \ndisability ratings, ending the duplicative system that now makes \ninjured veterans get rated by both DOD and VA. It would also create a \nbright line rule on what benefits a medically discharged servicemember \nwould receive. Different branches of the military would no longer \nprovide different levels of benefits to servicemembers with the same \ninjuries.\n  Under my bill, veterans would receive both their entire DOD annuity \nplus any VA disability benefits they are eligible for. This would put \nan end to the confusing practice of offsetting some DOD and VA \nbenefits.\n  This bill would also help modernize the VA disability system. The \nVA's outdated disability rating schedule would be entirely replaced by \na new schedule that is based on modern science and medicine. It will \nalso take into account the impact that a disability has on both a \nveteran's average loss of earning capacity and loss of quality of life. \nAs we now know, quality of life--time spent with family, community and \nnonwork activities--is also affected by disability. Shouldn't our \ndisability system reflect the impact service-related disabilities have \non those important aspects of life, too?\n  Also, this bill would provide more emphasis on treatment and \nrehabilitation. Veterans discharged from service because of disability \nwould be eligible for transition payments, either during the three \nmonth period following their separation or during a period of \nrehabilitation. These payments would help cover family living expenses, \nso an injured veteran would be better able to focus on rehabilitation, \ntraining, and getting back into the workforce. These are commonsense \noptions and solutions for today's veterans living in the modern world.\n  Lastly, I want all veterans, whether having served in World War II, \nVietnam, or Afghanistan, to have access to an improved system. My bill \ndoes not distinguish between combat and non-combat injuries; does not \nleave the outdated rating schedule in place; and does not prevent \nveterans of any generation from choosing to join the new, improved \nsystem. Also, as recommended by veterans' organizations, my efforts \nwere guided by the work of both the Dole-Shalala Commission and the \nVeterans' Disability Benefits Commission.\n  How will we actually accomplish the goals of making the system \nsimpler, consistent and more modern? Under this bill, the Department of \nVeterans Affairs would conduct a series of studies and would send to \nCongress a proposal outlining a new rating schedule and the amount and \nduration of transition payments. To make sure these recommendations \ndon't get put on a shelf to collect dust--as has happened in the past--\nthe entire VA proposal would be subject to an up-or-down vote by \nCongress.\n  If these changes are enacted, it would eliminate the confusion and \ndelay now caused by the overlapping VA and DOD functions and put a \ngreater emphasis on the recovery of our wounded servicemembers. It \nwould update the rating system to take into account modern concepts of \ndisability and make sure that veterans are compensated for any loss in \ntheir quality of life.\n  As a final note, I want to acknowledge that reforming the disability \nsystem may require a large, upfront cost. But, if we do it right, we \nwill be making a real investment in the future of our nation's \nveterans. Given the character of the men and women of our Armed Forces, \nthis investment will come with little risk and great reward.\n  We cannot put this off for another 50 years and hope another \ngeneration will fix the disability system later. We have young men and \nwomen returning home from war with devastating injuries that most of us \ncould not fathom enduring, let alone at such young ages.\n  The sad truth is that, even though the disability system was already \noutdated more than five decades ago, Congress and past administrations \nhave not made the necessary changes to keep pace with modern society, a \nchanging economy, and new attitudes towards disability. I believe I \nhave an idea why: This is really hard stuff. This is a complicated \nsystem and it is often easier to use band-aids and quick fixes to get \nus through times of crisis. But, the Walter Reed stories showed all of \nus last year that wounded warriors--those injured while fighting in \nIraq and Afghanistan--are the ones who pay the price for our inaction. \nAnd every day we continue to wait is another day they continue to pay \nthat price. They deserve better.\n  We need to listen to the wake-up call that the Walter Reed stories \nsent all of us. We must act now, and that is why I have introduced a \nbill that will update the system to meet the needs and expectations of \ntoday's veterans and does not leave tomorrow's veterans with a system \nthat was already outdated before they were even born. Our veterans \ndeserve a system that is more straightforward, up-to-date, and \nconsistent and that is open to all.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to remember the ``call to \naction'' we received last year when serious problems were publicly \nexposed at Walter Reed, and I ask them to join me in improving the \nlives of our veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2288-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2288-S2289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF DR. MICHAEL DAVID FREED\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute \non the occasion of his retirement to Dr. Michael David Freed of \nChildren's Hospital Boston for his service to the hospital and the \nthousands of children and young adults from Massachusetts and beyond \nwho have benefited from his care.\n  Dr. Freed has had a long and distinguished career at the hospital and \nHarvard Medical School, beginning in 1970, when he arrived to complete \nhis fellowship training. At Children's Hospital, he rose to become \nsenior associate in cardiology in 1976 and chief of the Division of \nInpatient Cardiology in 1996.\n  Dr. Freed is a physician's physician. His commitment to providing the \nbest possible care for children with heart disease is unwavering. He \nhas used his breadth and depth of knowledge, his clarity of thought, \nhis empathy, and his sense of humor to train more than 200 pediatric \ncardiology fellows and innumerable pediatric residents in the \nfundamentals of congenital heart disease. As a member of the Sub-board \nof Pediatric Cardiology, he ensured the highest quality of care by \nsetting standards for board certification for young pediatric \ncardiologists.\n  At Children's Hospital, Dr. Freed has chaired or served on more than \ntwo dozen committees, projects, and task forces, ranging from quality \nimprovement and patient care to graduate medical education and \ngovernance. His contributions extend well beyond Boston. He has served \non the executive committees of all three major national organizations \nin his field--the American Heart Association, the American Academy of \nPediatrics, and the American College of Cardiology, where he currently \nserves on the board of trustees. He is also a member of editorial \nboards in the field of cardiology, and regularly has been included on \nlists of ``top physicians'' ranging from the book ``Best Doctors in \nAmerica'' to Good Housekeeping and Boston Magazine. He is consulted by \nother pediatric cardiologists from around the world who seek his \nopinion on the care of their patients.\n  Dr. Freed has also written extensively in the field of pediatric \ncardiology and cardiac surgery and is particularly recognized for his \nwork in the newborn physiology of congenital heart disease, infective \nendocarditis, and valvular heart disease. He has authored more than 60 \noriginal articles, contributed more than 40 reviews, chapters, and \neditorials, and developed more than 25 clinical communications and \ninstructive CD ROMs. His leadership in establishing clinical practice \nguidelines for early postoperative management of children in Boston \nundergoing open-heart surgery was a model for the development of such \nguidelines nationally. In addition, he has been a member of national \nworking groups to develop guidelines on optimal care of individuals \nwith heart disease.\n\n[[Page S2289]]\n\n  I commend Dr. Freed for his outstanding career and his achievements \nin improving the quality of care for children and young people with \ncongenital heart disease in Boston and throughout the world, and I wish \nhim well in retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2289-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   Staff Sergeant Michael D. Elledge\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of SSG \nMichael Elledge of Fort Carson, CO. On March 17, a bomb exploded near \nthe humvee Sergeant Elledge was driving, killing him and SPC \nChristopher C. Simpson, of Hampton, VA. Sergeant Elledge was assigned \nto C Company, 1st Battalion, 68th Armored Regiment, 4th Infantry \nDivision, out of Fort Carson, CO. He was 41 years old.\n  Those who knew Mike Elledge describe him as a man committed to his \nfamily, faith, and duty to his country. He first donned a uniform after \ngraduating from high school in Michigan in 1985. He served 4 years with \nthe Marines. After discharging, he became a licensed aircraft mechanic \nand moved to Indiana, where he took a job with United Airlines. For 14 \nyears he worked for United, lived in Brownsburg, and raised three \nchildren--Christopher, Caleb, and Cassidy--with his wife Carleen.\n  But Mike's life changed after the attacks of September 11, 2001. We \ncannot forget that the tragedies of that day were not confined to New \nYork, Washington, and Pennsylvania. The ripples quickly spread to all \ncorners of the country as people learned of friends and family members \nwho were hurt or killed and as the economic impacts hit home with job \nlosses and dislocations.\n  Mike was among the tens of thousands of Americans who lost their job \nin the wake of the September 11 attacks. United Airlines, struggling to \nrecover after the disaster, closed the doors on its Brownsburg \nfacility, leaving Mike without a job.\n  We each have our own way of confronting adversity in our lives. For \nMichael Elledge, the terror and tragedy of September 11 was a call to \nservice--a call to reenlist. So, at age 38, Sergeant Elledge joined the \nArmy. In 2005, he deployed to Iraq for a 1-year rotation. Last \nDecember, he and the Third Brigade Combat Team out of Fort Carson \ndeployed again, this time for a projected 15-month tour.\n  Sergeant Elledge carried his deeply rooted faith into battle with \nhim. His friends say he was passionately committed to helping Iraqis \nbuild a country where they could enjoy freedom and security. For this, \nSergeant Elledge embodied the best of a soldier--he was devoted to his \nduty with the knowledge that his service could make others' lives \nbetter.\n  This is the type of citizen that Americans have celebrated for \ngenerations. President Theodore Roosevelt, in a speech at the Sorbonne \nin Paris in 1910, praised the values that Sergeant Elledge embodied and \nclaimed that it is the ``man in the arena'' who makes history.\n  ``It is not the critic who counts,'' said President Roosevelt, ``not \nthe man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer \nof deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who \nis actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and \nblood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and \nagain, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but \nwho does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, \nthe great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the \nbest knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the \nworst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his \nplace shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know \nvictory nor defeat.''\n  Mr. President, Sergeant Elledge knew what a difference he could make \nand was not afraid to make it. He was the ``man in the arena'' for whom \nPresident Roosevelt had such high praise.\n  No words or ceremony, of course, can properly honor the life and loss \nof a soldier like Sergeant Elledge, but we wish to console his friends \nand family and remember his contributions. That is why scores of \nfirefighters lined the overpasses of Sacramento, CA, to honor his \nreturn; that is why flags are flying in his hometown of Placerville, \nMI; and that is why the bugles will sound at Fort Carson in Colorado \nSprings.\n  To Sergeant Elledge's wife, Carleen, his sons, Christopher and Caleb, \nhis daughter, Cassidy, his parents, Marion and Christopher, and to all \nhis friends and family, our thoughts and prayers are with you. No words \ncan lessen the pain and grief that you feel, but I hope that in time \nyour sorrow will be salved by the knowledge that Mike served his \ncountry with honor and that we are all grateful for his courage, his \nsacrifice, and his heroism. He will never be forgotten.\n\n\n                     Staff Sergeant David D. Julian\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to express our Nation's \ndeepest thanks and gratitude to a special young man and his family. I \nwas saddened to receive word that on March 10, 2008, SSG David Julian \nof Evanston, WY, was killed in the line of duty while serving our \ncountry in the war on terrorism. Along with four of his fellow \nsoldiers, Staff Sergeant Julian died from injuries he sustained in a \nsuicide bomber attack in Baghdad, Iraq.\n  Staff Sergeant Julian was assigned to D Company, 1st Battalion, 64th \nArmor Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, Fort Stewart, GA. He joined the \nArmy right after his graduation from Evanston High School in 1994. He \nloved the Army and his country and was serving his fourth tour of duty \nin Iraq. Following his first tour, he laid the wreath for the \ndedication of the Fallen Comrade Memorial in downtown Evanston. He was \nlaid to rest in his hometown, where he was remembered by family and \nfriends as a determined and courageous warrior, an honorable soldier, \nand a loving husband and father.\n  It is because of David Julian that we continue to live safe and free. \nAmerica's men and women who answer the call to service and wear our \nNation's uniform deserve respect and recognition for the enormous \nburden that they willingly bear. They put everything on the line every \nday, and because of them and their families, our Nation remains free \nand strong in the face of danger.\n  In the Book of John, Jesus said that, ``Greater love has no man than \nthis, that he lay his life down for his friend.'' SSG David Julian gave \nhis life, that last full measure of devotion, for you, me, and every \nsingle American. He gave his life defending his country and its people, \nand we honor him for this selfless sacrifice.\n  Staff Sergeant Julian is survived by his wife Erin and baby daughter \nElizabeth, his mother Bonnie and father Wally, brothers Eric, Chris, \nand Mark, and sisters Misty, Becky, and Kellee. He is also survived by \nhis brothers and sisters in arms of the U.S. Army. We say goodbye to a \nhusband, a father, a son, a brother, and an American soldier. Our \nNation pays its deepest respect to SSG David D. Julian for his courage, \nhis love of country, and his sacrifice, so that we may remain free. He \nwas a hero in life and he remains a hero in death. All of Wyoming, and \nindeed the entire Nation, is proud of him. May God bless him and his \nfamily and welcome him with open arms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2289-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2289-S2290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                       SECOND CHANCE ACT OF 2007\n\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I wish to speak in favor of the \nSecond Chance Act of 2007, a bill to strengthen community safety by \nimproving the reintegration of people returning from prison. The Senate \nrecently passed this measure, and I am proud to have worked over the \npast few years with Senators Biden, Brownback, and Specter to see this \nimportant bill reach this point. Having passed in the House as well, \nthe Second Chance Act is now ready for President Bush's signature, and \nI urge him to sign this bill into law as soon as possible.\n  We have a broken criminal justice system and too many people are \ncaught in its web, especially African-American men, nearly a third of \nwhom will enter State or Federal prison during their lives. What is \nequally tragic is that nearly two-thirds of the 1,800 people released \nfrom prison every day return to jail within 3 years.\n  The stark reality is that most communities where prisoners go upon \nrelease already struggle with highly concentrated poverty, \nunemployment,\n\n[[Page S2290]]\n\nfragile families, and a dearth of jobs. And even if released prisoners \ndo find a promising job opportunity, they often face employer \nresistance to hiring people with criminal backgrounds. In many cases, \nthey will fail to become fully rehabilitated and go on to commit more \ncrimes.\n  We must end this revolving door of failure. We must create a pathway \nfor people coming out of jail to get the jobs, skills, and education \nthey need to reject a life of crime in favor of honest contributions to \ntheir communities.\n  There is no question that breaking the law should have consequences. \nAnd it is true that we have to do more as parents to teach our children \nthat violence is always wrong. But if convicted offenders are not given \nthe tools they need to become constructive members of our communities \nafter they serve their time, we all suffer the consequences.\n  That is why the passage of the Second Chance Act is so important. \nThis measure will support faith- and community-based organizations \nworking with State and local authorities to give former prisoners a \nsecond chance at a meaningful life. It makes funding available for \ntransitional jobs programs and housing, for support health services, \nand educational needs. Moreover, priority is given to projects that \nserve communities with large ex-prisoner populations and to those that \ndo a good job of reintegrating their participants.\n  Again, I commend my colleagues in the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives, Democrats and Republicans, who supported the Second \nChance Act. I urge the President of the United States to act quickly to \nenact this bill into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2290-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n             VISIT OF AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER KEVIN RUDD\n\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I would like to extend my sincere \nwelcome to the Honorable Kevin Rudd, who is making his first trip to \nthe United States as the newly elected Prime Minister of Australia. \nThis is a historic visit during a time of transition for both our \nnations.\n  Yesterday, I spoke with Prime Minister Rudd and congratulated him on \nhis election as the first Labor Party Prime Minister in 11 years. I \nassured him of my personal commitment to maintaining a strong bilateral \nrelationship between our nations in the years to come and discussed our \ncommon interest in advancing peace and prosperity for the people of the \nUnited States, Australia, and the world.\n  The alliance between the United States and Australia is deep and \nstrong and has stood the test of changing times. Labor Party leader \nJohn Curtain, along with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, established \nthe United States-Australia alliance in 1942. Prime Minister Rudd's \ntrip affirms the strategic value of this relationship and the \nfriendship between our people, which has endured across generations and \nadministrations.\n  The United States-Australia alliance is a cornerstone of security and \nprosperity both in the Asia-Pacific region and globally. Our two \nnations are bound by shared interests, shared values, and a common \nheritage--bonds that were forged in all major wars the United States \nwas involved in during the 20th century, a distinction unique to \nAustralia. And, as a new century dawns, we are beginning to write a new \nand important chapter in the bilateral relationship.\n  Indeed, during his first press conference the day after his election, \nPrime Minister Rudd reiterated his strong commitment to the United \nStates-Australia alliance, a deep commitment to a partnership of equals \nthat I share.\n  Like the United States, Australia is trans-Pacific in orientation, \nand for this reason our perspectives and perceptions about regional and \nglobal affairs are often tightly aligned. The United States benefits \nfrom an Australia that can act as a regional leader in East Asia but \none with global interests and capabilities as well.\n  The Prime Minister's visit provides an opportunity for the people of \nAmerica to express our deep appreciation for Australia's contributions \nin combating al-Qaida. We will never forget that following the attacks \non September 11, 2001, Australia invoked the ANZUS treaty in support of \nthe United States.\n  Australia has deployed some 1,000 troops in Afghanistan to the \nInternational Security Assistance Force, as well as about 1,500 combat \nand support troops in Iraq. Prime Minister Rudd has also demonstrated \nreal leadership in tackling the critical global challenge of climate \nchange. Within a few weeks of assuming office, the Prime Minister \nsuccessfully pushed for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol as one \nof the first official acts of his administration. He personally led \nAustralia's delegation to Bali, Indonesia, to participate in \ninternational negotiations on a post-Kyoto protocol.\n  In Asia, the quality of our alliance and scope of our diplomatic \npartnership shine brightly. We both face a rapidly evolving security \norder defined by traditional and nontraditional security problems. \nThese include changing regional power dynamics and rivalries, \nterritorial disputes, resource competition, terrorism, proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction, failed states, environmental degradation, \nand pandemic diseases. Managing this complex blend of security \nchallenges requires leveraging both bilateral and multilateral \nmechanisms.\n  The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC, organization, in which \nAustralia took the lead in creating in 1989, has advanced economic \nliberalization and integration throughout the Asia-Pacific. Australia's \ninvolvement in the East Asia Summit since its inception is a welcome \ndevelopment. The Trilateral Security Dialogue among the United States, \nAustralia, and Japan has become an important channel for coordinating \npolicy and combining capabilities in addressing emerging security \nchallenges in the Asia-Pacific.\n  As the security order in Asia evolves, Australian participation, \nleadership, and defense of our common values and interests are critical \nto building open, inclusive, transparent, and flexible regional \nstructures and arrangements. The new arrangements cannot replace \nAmerica's bilateral alliances--alliances which are not directed at any \none nation but which have served as the foundation for peace and \nstability in Asia for nearly half a century. But these new mechanisms, \nbuilding on our traditional alliances, can help sustain the conditions \nfor Asia's peace and prosperity to continue.\n  Prime Minister Rudd brings special skills and experiences to this new \nchapter in United States-Australia relations. His progressive domestic \npolicy agenda, innovative and realistic diplomacy, and optimistic \nvision enrich the already solid base of our bilateral dialogue, \nreminding us that we can accomplish more when we listen to our friends \nand allies than when we lecture them.\n  Prime Minister Rudd's visit is an opportunity to rededicate ourselves \nto the United States-Australia alliance and to our broader bilateral \nrelationship. America's foreign policy, national security and economic \ninterests gain greatly from the deep ties with our friends down \nunder.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2290-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2290-S2291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               RECOGNIZING THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CENTER\n\n Mr. BOND.

In \naddition, Mr. Dooley has brought together over 150 parents and \nvolunteers to bolster the Fine Arts Booster Organization in Clark \nCounty, which has fundraised, supported, and made possible the fine \narts department in Clark County.\n  Clark County R-1 School has one of the finest music and band programs \nin the State of Missouri. In 2006 Mr. Dooley was named Kiwanis Club \nTeacher of the Year and received the Missouri Association of Rural \nEducation Outstanding Rural Secondary Teacher of the Year Award.

Mr. President, I wish to honor and share with my \ncolleagues the memory of a very special man, Arthur Lyons of Palm \nSprings, who died March 21, 2008. He was 62 years old.\n  Arthur Lyons was a man of many talents and will be fondly remembered \nfor his groundbreaking work with film noir cinema, his success as an \nauthor, his dedication to the city of Palm Springs, and his love for \nthe environment.\n  Arthur was born on January 5, 1946, in Los Angeles, CA. His family \nmoved to Palm Springs when Arthur was 11. After graduating from the \nUniversity of California at Santa Barbara in 1967, Arthur tapped into \nhis lifelong passion for film noir and began writing as a novelist, a \nscreenwriter for Universal Studios, and as a cofounder of the Writers \nConference, among other projects.\n  Arthur wrote his first novel, ``The Dead Are Discreet'', in 1974 and \nwent on to author 23 more books, many of them mystery novels, including \nthe successful Jacob Ashe detective series. His nonfiction sensation, \n``Death on the Cheap: The Lost B Movies of Film Noir'', reflected his \ninterest in film noir cinema, the traditional Hollywood crime dramas of \nthe 1940s and 1950s. After writing crime novels for over 25 years, \nArthur partnered with Craig Prater in 2001 to launch the Palm Springs \nFilm Noir Festival--one of the first such festivals in the Nation. A \nman of unbridled enthusiasm for the film noir style, Arthur would \nencourage attendees to dress up in mobster-style clothing that was \ntypical of that Hollywood era.\n  A member of the Palm Springs City Council from 1992 to 1995, Arthur \nwas an advocate of energy deregulation in California and helped create \nPalm Springs Energy Services. During his time on the city council, \nArthur also helped to create Palm Springs Villagefest, a street fair \nheld every Thursday that hosts food booths, a certified farmer's \nmarket, and craft and artisan booths. In recognition of his positive \ncontributions to the Palm Springs community, Arthur was honored with \nthe 287th Golden Palm Star on May 30, 2007.\n  Those who knew Arthur Lyons recognized him as a uniquely passionate \nand brilliant man. He took pride in promoting causes that he held close \nto his heart. His work as an author, screenwriter, director, and \nelected official will be remembered fondly by all those whose lives he \ntouched. He will be deeply missed.\n  Arthur is survived by his wife Barbara Lyons and his uncle David \nLyons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2291-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING THE BAY AREA GREEN BUSINESS PROGRAM\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 10th anniversary of the Bay Area Green Business Program \nin Contra Costa County, the Contra Costa Green Business Program.\n  Founded in 1998, the Contra Costa Green Business Program was one of \nthe first green business programs to be established in the nine-county \nBay area region. Composed of a partnership between local, regional, \nState, and Federal Government agencies and utilities, the Bay Area's \nGreen Business Programs help local businesses throughout the Bay area \nproactively conserve resources, prevent pollution, and minimize waste.\n  Californians have always led the way in fighting for a clean \nenvironment. I applaud the Contra Costa Green Business Program for \nstrengthening and sustaining the quality of the environment in the \ncounty through a collaborative partnership of public and private \norganizations that encourages, enables, and recognizes businesses \ntaking action to prevent pollution and conserve resources.\n  Breaking with the tradition of environmental initiatives targeting \nbig businesses, the Contra Costa Green Business Program offers small- \nto medium-sized businesses a complete environmental guide, scaled to \ntheir operations, for conserving energy and water, reducing waste, \npreventing pollution, and complying with environmental regulations. It \nalso certifies and recognizes businesses of all types for meeting these \nrigorous environmental standards.\n  The Contra Costa Green Business Program has certified over 300 \nbusinesses throughout the county in the last 10 years. I commend the \nprogram's dedicated staff and volunteers who work diligently to show \nlocal businesses how they can be both green and profitable at the same \ntime. By recommending a wide range of measures that help lessen \ngreenhouse gas emissions and conserve resources, the Contra Costa Green \nBusiness Program is helping smaller businesses protect the climate in \nvery meaningful ways.\n  I congratulate the Contra Costa Green Business Program for its \ndedicated work on this special occasion, and I send my best wishes for \nmany future successes over the next 10 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2291-4", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2291-S2292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO REBBECA WOOD WATKIN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to salute \nmy dear friend Rebecca ``Becky'' Wood Watkin as she celebrates her 95th \nbirthday.\n  Born on April 4, 1913, in Portland, OR, Becky graduated from Bryn \nMawr College in 1933 and went on to the University of Pennsylvania to \nstudy architecture. Undeterred by the fact that the Architecture \nDepartment did not accept female students at that time, Becky completed \nall required courses and became the first woman graduate in \narchitecture from the University of Pennsylvania in 1937. That same \nyear, Becky relocated to San Francisco and applied at a variety of \narchitectural firms, none of which wanted a woman in the drafting room. \nDespite her difficulties with finding employment in the male-dominated \nworkforce, Becky persevered, earning her California architectural \nlicense in 1944.\n\n[[Page S2292]]\n\n  A vanguard for aspiring women professionals everywhere, Becky opened \nher own architectural practice in Marin County in 1951. In the midst of \nthese professional milestones, Becky also gave birth to three wonderful \nchildren. As a working mother, Becky looked for ways to use her \npersonal and professional talents to help those in need, becoming a \ntremendous source of support and energy to causes that she believed \nhelped the community, including the Ecumenical Housing Association and \nPlanned Parenthood.\n  Mr. President, 1948 saw Becky enter the political realm for the first \ntime, by fundraising for Roger Kent, a local Democratic candidate for \nCongress. This initial political activity 60 years ago spearheaded a \nlifelong involvement with Democratic politics, a passion of Becky's \nthat allowed her to work on the presidential campaigns for Adlai \nStevenson, John Kennedy, Eugene McCarthy, George McGovern, and Jimmy \nCarter.\n  Inspired by Becky's trailblazing story and her fervent belief in good \ngovernment, I first met Becky in the late 1970s when she helped me get \nreelected to the Marin County Board of Supervisors in 1980. As a young \nworking mother myself, Becky quickly became a deeply admired mentor. As \nthe years passed and our friendship grew, she was instrumental in \nhelping me move up the political ladder to the House of Representatives \nand then to the U.S. Senate.\n  As we celebrate the 95th year of her remarkably courageous and \npassionate life, I remain in admiration of Becky's strong sense of \ncivic duty, honesty, integrity, and perseverance. Along with hundreds \nof her family, friends, and admirers, I wish her many more years of \ncontinued happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2292-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN RECOGNITION OF JAMES H. ADAMS\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, on February 29, 2008, James H. Adams \nof Pittsfield, NH, retired as manager of the New Hampshire/Vermont \nDistrict of the U.S. Postal Service after 35 years of service. I wish \nto thank Jim for all he has done for the people of New Hampshire over \nthat time and for his efforts which have resulted in New Hampshire's \noutstanding reputation for mail operations, customer service, and \nworker safety.\n  Starting as a letter carrier in Manchester in 1973, Jim's career \nbegan when the price of a stamp cost a whopping 3 cents for a first \nclass letter. His determination and drive for self-improvement soon led \nto night school classes and a degree in business management, and his \ntalents were recognized with promotion to delivery supervisor, then \nsuperintendent of postal operations, in Concord, NH. He left our State \nfor a time, tackling the duties of director of marketing for the Post \nOffice in Syracuse, NY, then in a number of positions of increasing \nresponsibility with the Postmaster General's Office in Washington, DC.\n  During his time in Washington, Jim worked with five U.S. Presidents \nand helped to develop several commemorative stamps, including those \nhonoring our troops of Desert Storm, POW/MIAs, and even Elvis. He \nunveiled five World War II commemorative stamps to President George H. \nW. Bush in the Oval Office and was relied upon in Washington for his \nprofessional and personal knowledge of all facets of postal operations, \nhis competent advice, and for the personal integrity with which he \nalways conducted himself.\n  His return to New Hampshire to head the district in 1997 led to \ndramatic improvements in its operations. Overseeing a $500 million \nbudget and 7,000 employees, Jim turned the district into one of the top \n10 safest in the Nation. Similarly, with 6 million pieces of mail \ndelivered each day in New Hampshire and Vermont, Jim's efforts led to a \n96-percent on-time mail delivery record and the establishment of \ncustomer service that has been recognized as Best in the Nation for \neach of the past 6 years.\n  Beyond his professional accomplishments, which are many, Jim has \nremained true to his small-town roots and the honesty and decency of \nhis upbringing. Pittsfield and all of New Hampshire can be proud of him \nand his success, and I am especially glad to have had the opportunity \nto work with Jim to serve the people of New Hampshire. Whether helping \nobtain a sought-after ZIP Code number to serve an entire community or \nmaking a personal commitment to ensuring an elderly or disabled \ncustomer off the beaten track received their mail at home, Jim \ndedicated himself to meeting the needs of those who counted on the U.S. \nmail coming through.\n  He can take great pride in his record of service. I want to take this \nopportunity to thank him, to recognize his contributions, and to wish \nhim well in all his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2292-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  The President pro tempore (Mr. Byrd) reported that he had signed the \nfollowing enrolled bill, which was previously signed by the Speaker of \nthe House:\n\n       H.R. 1593.

A bill to protect older Americans from misleading and \nfraudulent marketing practices, with the goal of increasing retirement \nsecurity; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, many of America's seniors are discovering \nthat their life savings may not be enough to sufficiently provide for \ntheir retirement needs. To bridge the gap, some seniors are turning to \ninvestments to increase their retirement income and frequently rely on \nfinancial advisors to help them invest wisely. Unfortunately, we have \nlearned that seniors are placing their trust in so-called ``senior \ninvestment advisors'' who in many cases may not deserve it. More and \nmore, individuals are representing themselves as certified ``senior \ninvestment specialists'' when often they have limited or no education \nand experience in extremely complicated financial matters. It is \nestimated that there are hundreds of different designations for senior \nfinancial advisors that all sound very official, and that there are \nthousands of unscrupulous individuals marketing themselves out as such \n``senior'' specialists.\n  You would be surprised to know that in order to obtain some of them, \nall it takes is a weekend and as many cracks at an open-book, multiple-\nchoice exam as is needed? It is almost impossible for seniors to tell \nthe difference between the more legitimate titles and those with less \nrigorous standards.\n  Today, Senator Vitter and I are introducing the Senior Investor \nProtection Act of 2008 to help ensure there are rules to separate \nreputable designations, like Certified Financial Planners, from less \nrigorous designations and clarifications that are meant to confuse and \nmislead seniors. This bill would encourage states to improve their own \nrules regulating the use of designations by encouraging them to adopt \nprovisions outlined in the North American Securities Administrators \nAssociation's, NASAA, new model rule on the use of senior designations. \nIt would create a grant to help States protect senior investors from \nunscrupulous individuals who use misleading designations to sell \nseniors inappropriate financial products.\n  We know that an attorney must go to school for 3 years and pass a \nState bar exam. A CPA must have a college degree, an additional year of \nstudy and must pass a national exam. Neither can offer their \nprofessional services without those credentials. Seniors should be able \nto trust the people who invest their money. They should not be worried \nthat the title after their advisor's name is scarcely more than a \nmarketing ploy, and that it was not earned through sufficiently \nrigorous financial education or training.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2297-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2297-S2299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 493--TO LIMIT CONSIDERATION OF AMENDMENTS UNDER A \n                           BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Budget:\n\n                              S.

An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be \n     required in the Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of \n     the Chair on a point of order raised under section 1.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I submit a resolution which would modify \nthe budget process to bring some sanity to the Senate as we consider \nthe budget resolution.\n  On March 13, less than a month ago, we took up the budget resolution. \nFrom 11:15 a.m. until 2 a.m, on March 14, this body was bedlam. May the \nrecord show the distinguished presiding Senator from Montana was \nnodding in the affirmative. If he wishes to have a disclaimer on that--\nhe has just signaled it is OK with him.\n  There are two Senators on the floor of the Senate now, one presiding \nand one speaking, who can attest to an extraordinary event. The Senate \nis billed as the world's greatest deliberative body. During the time \nfrom 11:15 a.m. on the 13th, until 2 a.m. on the 14th, the place was \nbedlam--absolute bedlam. We were considering amendments which had not \nbeen available for examination by Senators or their staffs. We were \nconsidering them in a context of 2 minutes equally divided, so the \nproponent had a full minute. That may be a little long for speeches in \nthe House of Representatives, but it is not in the Senate. The opposite \nside had 1 minute.\n  It was impossible to hear what was going on in the Chamber. If you \ntried to listen to get the gravamen of what was going on, it simply \ncould not be heard. During the course of the deliberations after \nmidnight I had occasion to talk to the distinguished majority leader, \nSenator Reid, and the chair of the Rules Committee, Senator Feinstein, \nabout doing something about it. My staff and I have done some research. \nWe found that a resolution had been submitted, a proposal had been \nsubmitted by Senator Byrd in the past. I have taken Senator Byrd's \napproach, having my staff consult with his staff. We do not yet have it \nworked out as to whether he will cosponsor because we have been in the \nperiod of recess for the past 2 weeks, but Senator Byrd is renowned for \nhis expertise on parliamentary matters. The essence of the resolution \nwould provide that first-degree amendments would have to be filed prior \nto the 10th hour of debate. Then, second-degree amendments would have \nto be filed prior to the 20th hour of debate. Then the resolution would \nbe set aside for 1 day prior to the 40th hour of debate so that the \namendments could be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  For those who may be watching on C-SPAN, it is impossible to deal \nwith an amendment which has not been filed and printed so that staff \nand Senators can review it. When the amendments are offered--as there \nis a right to offer them, under the existing procedures, on the spur of \nthe moment--nobody can follow them. One minute of explanation is \ntotally insufficient.\n  There was one complex amendment which was offered with respect to the \ncity of Berkeley, to take away their earmarks and their grants. I \nhappened to be on the other end of the Chamber at the time and actually \ncould not hear; the bedlam, the noise just precluded hearing. I later \nfound out that there was a lot more to the consideration of the issue \nthan I could digest in the course of that time.\n  The procedures that have been used on the budget resolution have \ntaken two forms which have subverted the process. One is the sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution, and the second is the resolution on deficit-\nneutral reserve funds to try to bring it within the confines of the \nbudget resolution. Through those two artifices there are efforts made \nto legislate, put legislative proposals in the budget resolution.\n  I will ask unanimous consent my full statement be printed in the \nRecord at the close of my comments. The full statement has a reference \nto amendment No. 4299, which was offered, which was on prescription \ndrugs. It doesn't have anything to do with the budget resolution, but \nit was a sense of the Senate. This is just illustrative of substantive \nmatters which are offered which have no place on the budget resolution.\n  My prepared statement also refers to amendment No. 4231, which refers \nto immigration, a detailed proposal.\n  Many of these, if not most of these amendments, are ``gotcha'' \namendments. I am getting a lot of agreement from the distinguished \nPresiding Officer. If anyone is watching on C-SPAN II, a ``gotcha'' \namendment is an amendment that compels people to vote on complex \nquestions which can be used on a 30-second commercial.\n  One of the difficulties of campaign practice is to be able to defend \nyour votes. It is sometimes hard to defend a vote on a complex matter \nwhere you have no advance notice of the issue and no opportunity to \nhear it debated. The procedures of the Senate, worth just a momentary \ncomment, are, somebody proposes legislation and files it at the desk. \nIt is referred to a committee. The committee has hearings. Then there \nis a markup where the bill is considered. Then the committee files a \nreport, analyzing it. Then it comes to the Senate floor for \nconsideration.\n  That is the way the Senate is supposed to function. That is what \nmakes the Senate, arguably, the world's greatest deliberative body. But \nnot when you have amendments which are offered on the spur of the \nmoment with no opportunity to know what is in the amendment and all of \nthese votes are recorded. Try to explain a ``gotcha'' amendment as to \nwhy you voted a certain way in answering on a commercial. It just \ncannot be done.\n  It is my hope the Senate will take up this issue. I think the \nproposal by Senator Byrd on the scheduling is a good approach. I am not \nwedded to this approach. There are other approaches which could be \nundertaken which would be satisfactory to this Senator. We had some \ndiscussions on the Senate floor about perhaps limiting the number of \namendments with a certification by the two leaders that you had germane \namendments. But one way or another, we ought not to again next year \nundertake a process which has 44 votes. That established a new record--\nalthough on prior years we came close to that with votes numbering in \nthe thirties. We ought to avoid this kind of process and redo our \nprocedures under the budget resolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent my full statement be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Bill Introduction\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to \n     introduce legislation to provide greater efficiencies to what \n     I believe is a broken process for consideration of the budget \n     resolution. The need for reform is based on the most recent \n     consideration of the budget resolution on March 13, 2008, \n     when the Senate conducted 44 stacked roll call votes in one \n     day--the so-called ``vote-a-rama.'' With the 44 stacked \n     votes, the frequent unavailability of amendment text in \n     advance so there could be no analysis and preparation, the \n     chamber full of senators, the unusual noise level, the \n     constant banging of the gavel by the presiding officer, the \n     near impossibility of hearing even just the two minutes \n     allotted for discussion, and consideration of matters \n     entirely unrelated to the budget, I believe the process needs \n     reform. The resolution I am introducing today is based on a \n     proposal previously submitted by Senator Robert Byrd, whom \n     most would agree is our most-knowledgeable Senator on \n     parliamentary procedure. The Byrd proposal seeks to correct \n     these problems I have cited by imposing several new rules \n     designed to foster greater transparency and efficiency on a \n     budget resolution.\n\n[[Page S2299]]\n\n       Under the budget rules, once all debate time has been used \n     or yielded back, the Senate must take action to agree to or \n     to dispose of pending amendments before considering final \n     passage. This scenario creates a dizzying process of voting \n     on numerous amendments in a stacked sequence, often referred \n     to as a ``vote-a-rama.'' During the course of the ``vote-a-\n     rama'', dozens of votes may occur with little or no \n     explanation, often leaving Senators with insufficient \n     information or time to deliberate and evaluate the merits of \n     an issue prior to casting a vote. By consent, the Senate has \n     typically allowed two minutes of debate, equally divided, \n     prior to votes. However, the budget process does not require \n     Senators to file their amendments prior to their \n     consideration. In many instances, members are voting on \n     amendments on which the text has never been made available. \n     This difficult working environment is further compounded by a \n     Chamber full of Senators and the constant banging of the \n     gavel by the presiding officer to maintain order. This \n     unusual noise level makes it nearly impossible to hear the \n     one minute of debate per side.\n       The Budget Act of 1974 outlines the many clearly defined \n     rules for consideration of a budget resolution, including \n     debate time and germaneness. Despite these rules, the Senate \n     has often set aside these rules and found clever ways to \n     circumvent the rules. To restore some order to the process, \n     the resolution I am offering today would require first-degree \n     amendments to be filed at the desk with the Journal Clerk \n     prior to the 10th hour of debate. Accordingly, second-degree \n     amendments must be filed prior to the 20th hour of debate. \n     This legislation would require a budget resolution to be set \n     aside for one calendar day prior to the 40th hour of debate. \n     Doing so would allow all filed amendments to be printed in \n     the Record allowing Senators, and their staff, an opportunity \n     for review before debate on the resolution continues. To \n     preserve the integrity of these new rules, debate time may \n     only be yielded back by consent, instead of the current \n     procedure whereby time may be yielded at the discretion of \n     either side.\n       Another problem has been the subversion with the budget's \n     germaneness rules by offering amendments to deal with \n     authorization and substantive policy changes. It is important \n     to remember that the Federal budget has two distinct but \n     equally important purposes: the first is to provide a \n     financial measure of federal expenditures, receipts, \n     deficits, and debt levels; and the second is to provide the \n     means for the Federal Government to efficiently collect and \n     allocate resources. To keep the debate focused, amendments to \n     the budget resolution must be germane, meaning those which \n     strike, increase or decrease numbers, or add language that \n     restricts some power in the resolution. Otherwise, a point of \n     order lies against the amendment, and 60 votes are required \n     to waive the point of order. Yet, to circumvent this \n     germaneness requirement and inject debate on substantive \n     policy changes, Senators have offered Sense of the Senate \n     amendments and Deficit-Neutral Reserve Fund amendments that \n     include exorbitant programmatic detail.\n       A sense of the Senate amendment allows a Senator to force \n     members to either support or oppose any policy position they \n     seek to propose. An excerpt of an amendment to the FY09 \n     Budget Resolution follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4299\n\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--(1) the leadership of the Senate should bring to the \n     floor for full debate in 2008 comprehensive legislation that \n     legalizes the importation of prescription drugs from highly \n     industrialized countries with safe pharmaceutical \n     infrastructures and creates a regulatory pathway to ensure \n     that such drugs are safe; (2) such legislation should be \n     given an up or down vote on the floor of the Senate; and (3) \n     previous Senate approval of 3 amendments in support of \n     prescription drug importation shows the Senate's strong \n     support for passage of comprehensive importation legislation.\n\n       The use of sense of the Senate amendments on the budget \n     resolution has been discouraged in recent years because they \n     have little relevance to the intended purpose of the budget \n     resolution. As a result, it has become increasingly popular \n     to offer deficit-neutral reserve fund amendments. Prior to \n     the FY06 Budget Resolution, reserve funds were used \n     sparingly. In in FY07, 22 were included in the Senate \n     resolution and 8 in the House resolution; in FY08, 38 were \n     included in the Senate resolution and 23 in the conference \n     report; and in FY09, 31 were included in the Senate \n     resolution.\n       Deficit-neutral reserve funds--which are specifically \n     permitted by section 301(b)(7) of the Budget Act of 1974--\n     have an important functional use in the budget process, but \n     do not require extensive programmatic detail to be useful. On \n     the speculation that Congress may enact legislation on a \n     particular issue--perhaps ``immigration,'' ``energy,'' or \n     ``health care''--a reserve fund acts as a ``placeholder'' to \n     allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to later revise \n     the spending and revenue levels in the budget so that the \n     future deficit-neutral legislation would not be vulnerable to \n     budgetary points of order. Absent a reserve fund, legislation \n     which increases revenues to offset increases in direct \n     spending would be subject to a Budget Act point of order \n     because certain overall budget levels (total revenues, total \n     new budget authority, total outlays, or total revenues and \n     outlays of Social Security) or budgetary levels specific to \n     authorizing committees and the appropriations committee \n     (committee allocations) would be breached.\n       However, it is unnecessary to include extensive \n     programmatic detail into the language of a deficit-neutral \n     reserve fund for it to be useful at a later date. An excerpt \n     of an amendment to the FY09 Budget Resolution demonstrates \n     the unnecessary level of programmatic detail that I refer to:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4231\n\n     DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR BORDER SECURITY, IMMIGRATION \n                   ENFORCEMENT, AND CRIMINAL ALIEN REMOVAL \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Chairman of the Committee on the \n     Budget of the Senate may revise the allocations of 1 or more \n     committees, aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this \n     resolution by the amounts authorized to be appropriated for \n     the programs described in paragraphs (1) through (6) in 1 or \n     more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, motions, or \n     conference reports that funds border security, immigration \n     enforcement, and criminal alien removal programs, including \n     programs that--(1) expand the zero tolerance prosecution \n     policy for illegal entry (commonly known as ``Operation \n     Streamline'') to all 20 border sectors; (2) complete the 700 \n     miles of pedestrian fencing required under section 102(b)(1) \n     of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n     Responsibility Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1103 note); (3) deploy \n     up to 6,000 National Guard members to the southern border of \n     the United States; (4) evaluate the 27 percent of the \n     Federal, State, and local prison populations who are \n     noncitizens in order to identify removable criminal aliens; \n     (5) train and reimburse State and local law enforcement \n     officers under Memorandums of Understanding entered into \n     under section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)); or (6) implement the exit data portion of \n     the US-VISIT entry and exit data system at airports, \n     seaports, and land ports of entry.\n\n       Voting on amendments that advocate substantive policy \n     changes in the context of a budget debate are a subversion of \n     the budget's germaneness requirements and clearly fall \n     outside the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee. In many \n     instances, the programmatic detail is of a controversial \n     nature, such as a recent amendment to ``provide for a \n     deficit-neutral reserve fund for transferring funding for \n     Berkeley, CA earmarks to the Marine Corps'' (Coburn Amendment \n     No. 4380).\n       To bring the focus back to the budget, my legislation \n     states that ``provisions contained in a budget resolution, or \n     amendments thereto, shall not include programmatic detail not \n     within the jurisdiction of the Senate Committee on the \n     Budget.'' It is my hope that this language will bring about a \n     change in practice in the Senate whereby Senators will avoid \n     including excessive programmatic detail in their reserve fund \n     amendments. Doing so will put the focus back on the important \n     purposes of a budget resolution.\n       The provisions in my legislation may be waived or suspended \n     in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of \n     the Members. Also, an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members of the Senate is required in the Senate to sustain an \n     appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised \n     under this section.\n       I commend the chairman and ranking member of the Senate \n     Budget Committee for their hard work in processing amendments \n     to the budget resolution. Unfortunately, the process needs \n     reforms to provide structure and to increase transparency and \n     efficiency. The 44 rollcall votes conducted in relation to S. \n     Con. Res. 70 are the largest number of votes held in one \n     session dating back to 1964, according to records maintained \n     by the Senate Historical Office. The Senate cast more votes \n     on the budget in one day than it had previously cast all year \n     on various other issues. It is my hope that this resolution, \n     modeled in part on a previous proposal by Senator Byrd, will \n     lead us to a more constructive debate on the budget \n     resolution.\n       I urge the support of my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2299-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2299-S2300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 494--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE NEED \nFOR IRAQ'S NEIGHBORS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS TO FULFILL THEIR \n          PLEDGES TO PROVIDE RECONSTRUCTION ASSISTANCE TO IRAQ\n\n  Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. Corker) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 494\n\n       Whereas a sustained flow of international economic \n     reconstruction assistance to the Government of Iraq and \n     provincial and regional authorities in Iraq is essential to \n     the restoration of basic services in Iraq, job creation, and \n     the future stabilization of that country;\n       Whereas reconstruction assistance should be administered in \n     a transparent, accountable, and equitable manner in order to \n     help alleviate sectarian grievances and facilitate national \n     political reconciliation;\n       Whereas the United States has already spent approximately \n     $29,000,000,000 on reconstruction assistance and Congress has \n     authorized the expenditure of an additional $16,500,000,000 \n     for reconstruction assistance;\n\n[[Page S2300]]\n\n       Whereas, on December 18, 2007, the Government \n     Accountability Office (GAO) reported that, as of October \n     2007, international donors had pledged a total of \n     approximately $16,400,000,000 in support of Iraq's \n     reconstruction since 2003, of which roughly $13,600,000,000 \n     was pledged at an October 2003 donor conference in Madrid, \n     Spain;\n       Whereas the GAO reported that international donors have \n     provided only approximately $7,000,000,000 for reconstruction \n     assistance, or less than half of the original pledged amount;\n       Whereas the conclusion reached by the Iraq Study Group \n     (ISG) in December 2006 that ``[i]nternational support for \n     Iraqi reconstruction has been tepid'' remains true and \n     reinforces the ISG's subsequent recommendation that ``[a]n \n     essential part of reconstruction efforts in Iraq should be \n     greater involvement by and with international partners, who \n     should do more than just contribute money. . . . [t]hey \n     should also actively participate in the design and \n     construction of projects'';\n       Whereas Iraq's regional neighbors, in particular, carry a \n     special imperative to bolster reconstruction assistance \n     efforts to Iraq, given the vital importance of a peaceful and \n     secure Iraq to their security interests and overall regional \n     stability; and\n       Whereas those countries have prospered in recent years due \n     to the rising price of their oil exports and enjoy expanded \n     government revenue from which funds could be allocated for \n     reconstruction assistance to Iraq: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Iraq's neighbors and other key international partners \n     should fully carry through on previous pledges of \n     reconstruction assistance to the Government of Iraq, working \n     to mitigate and circumvent, where necessary, potential \n     obstacles to the effective implementation of those pledges; \n     and\n       (2) the United States should consider a recommendation \n     proposed by the Iraq Study Group to merge reconstruction \n     assistance funds provided by the United States with funds \n     from international donors and Iraqi participants to help \n     ensure that assistance projects in Iraq are carried out in \n     the most rapid and efficient manner possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2300-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 495--DESIGNATING APRIL 2008 AS ``FINANCIAL LITERACY \n                                MONTH''\n\n  Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Enzi, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Levin, \nMr. Schumer, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \nCardin, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Martinez, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nAllard, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Baucus, and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 72\n\n       Whereas, at the 55th Session of the United Nations General \n     Assembly in 2000, the United States, along with other world \n     leaders, committed to achieving the Millennium Development \n     Goals (MDGs), which provide a framework for countries and \n     international organizations to combat such global social ills \n     as poverty, hunger, and disease;\n       Whereas one target of the Millennium Development Goals is \n     to halve by 2015 the proportion of people without access to \n     safe drinking water and basic sanitation, the only target to \n     be codified into United States law, in the Paul Simon Water \n     for the Poor Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-121);\n       Whereas the lack of access to safe water and sanitation is \n     one of the most pressing environmental public health issues \n     in the world;\n       Whereas over 1,000,000,000 people live without potable \n     water, and an estimated 2,600,000,000 people, including \n     980,000,000 children, do not have access to basic sanitation \n     facilities;\n       Whereas, every 20 seconds, a child dies as a direct result \n     of a lack of access to basic sanitation facilities;\n       Whereas only 36 percent of people in sub-Saharan Africa and \n     37 percent of people in South Asia have access to safe \n     drinking water and sanitation, the lowest rates in the world;\n       Whereas, at any one time, almost half of the people in the \n     developing world are suffering from diseases associated with \n     lack of water, sanitation, and hygiene;\n       Whereas improved sanitation decreases the incidences of \n     debilitating and deadly maladies such as cholera, intestinal \n     worms, diarrhea, pneumonia, dysentery, and skin infections;\n       Whereas sanitation is the foundation of health, dignity, \n     and development;\n       Whereas increased sanitation is fundamental for reaching \n     all of the Millennium Development Goals;\n       Whereas access to basic sanitation helps economic and \n     social development in countries where poor sanitation is a \n     major cause of lost work and school days because of illness;\n       Whereas sanitation in schools enables children, \n     particularly girls reaching puberty, to remain in the \n     educational system;\n       Whereas, according to the World Health Organization, every \n     dollar spent on proper sanitation by governments generates an \n     average $7 in economic benefit;\n       Whereas improved disposal of human waste protects the \n     quality of water sources used for drinking, preparation of \n     food, agriculture, and bathing;\n       Whereas, at the 61st Session of the United Nations General \n     Assembly in 2006, the United Nations declared 2008 as the \n     International Year of Sanitation to recognize the progress \n     made in achieving the global sanitation target detailed in \n     the Millennium Development Goals, as well as to call upon all \n     member states, United Nations agencies, regional and \n     international organizations, civil society organizations, and \n     other relevant stakeholders to renew their commitment to \n     attaining that target;\n\n[[Page S2301]]\n\n       Whereas the official launching of the International Year of \n     Sanitation at the United Nations was on November 21, 2007; \n     and\n       Whereas the thrust of the International Year of Sanitation \n     has three parts, including raising awareness of the \n     importance of sanitation and its impact on reaching other \n     Millennium Development Goals, encouraging governments and its \n     partners to promote and implement policies and actions for \n     meeting the sanitation target, and mobilizing communities, \n     particularly women's groups, towards changing sanitation and \n     hygiene practices through sanitation health-education \n     campaigns: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of the International Year \n     of Sanitation;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of sanitation on public \n     health, poverty reduction, economic and social development, \n     and the environment; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the International Year of Sanitation with appropriate \n     recognition, ceremonies, activities, and programs to \n     demonstrate the importance of sanitation, hygiene, and access \n     to safe drinking water in achieving the Millennium \n     Development Goals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2301-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4381.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 495, \nsubmitted earlier today by Senator Akaka.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 495) designating April 2008 as \n     ``Financial Literacy Month.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it pleases me to once again sponsor a \nresolution designating April as Financial Literacy Month. I thank the \ncosponsors of this resolution, Senators Enzi, Dodd, Stabenow, Levin, \nSchumer, Inouye, Menendez, Crapo, Johnson, Cardin, Lincoln, Cochran, \nMartinez, Murray, Allard, Durbin, Baucus, and Feinstein.\n  Without a sufficient understanding of economics and personal finance, \nindividuals will not be able to appropriately manage their finances, \nevaluate credit opportunities, and successfully invest for long-term \nfinancial goals in an increasingly complex marketplace. It is essential \nthat we work toward improving education and consumer protection, and \nempowering individuals through economic and financial literacy in order \nto build stronger families, businesses, and communities. Now more than \never, it is imperative that education in economics, credit, and \npersonal finance takes center stage. During the past year, we have seen \nthe unscrupulous nature of predatory lenders as they enticed millions \nof families into complicated loans they could not afford nor \nunderstand, and we are now witnessing the results of a faltering \nhousing market that has begun to impact other sectors of the U.S. \neconomy. Rapidly increasing access to credit for Americans was not \nmatched by efforts to ensure they could make sense of the complex \nagreements they were entering into.\n  As recent statistics released by the Federal Reserve and the \nDepartment of Commerce have shown, consumer debt in America continues \nto rise. Last year, the total amount of consumer debt topped $2.5 \ntrillion, of which credit card balances comprise a major portion. Hard-\nworking Americans now spend a record 14 percent of their income just to \npay the interest on their accumulated consumer debt. Personal savings \nrates have been negative for 2 out of the last 3 years, a situation not \nseen in this country since the Great Depression. In a time of rising \ncosts of energy, higher education, and health care, it is even more \nchallenging for working families to navigate their difficult financial \nsituations.\n  Furthermore, a study conducted last year by the National Council on \nEconomic Education found that, compared with 2004, even fewer States \nnow require testing knowledge of economics as a requirement for high \nschool graduation. We need to do more to invest in financial literacy \nnow for our young men and women in order to ensure a knowledgeable, \nprosperous generation of future American leaders who will be able to \nmake decisions that will benefit both their families and our nation.\n  I thank those organizations and individuals who do their part to \nensure the education of personal finance reaches as many Americans as \npossible, and I applaud their efforts in these times of economic \ndistress.\n  Taking the month of April to focus our attention on financial \nliteracy will allow us to make steady progress in helping to make \nAmericans more competent with their limited financial resources. I urge \nmy colleagues to join with me in the swift passage of this resolution, \nand together we can work toward a future where all Americans enjoy the \nbenefits of a financially literate society.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and that any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 495) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 495\n\n       Whereas the personal savings rate of people in the United \n     States declined from negative 0.5 percent in 2005 to negative \n     1.0 percent in 2006, making 2005 and 2006 the only years \n     since the Great Depression years of 1932 and 1933 when the \n     savings rate has been negative, and the decline continued in \n     the first month of 2008;\n       Whereas, in April 2007, a survey on personal finances \n     reported that 25 percent of workers in the United States \n     responded as having ``no savings'';\n       Whereas the 2007 Retirement Confidence Survey conducted by \n     the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that only 43 \n     percent of workers or their spouses calculated how much they \n     need to save for retirement, down from 53 percent in 2000;\n       Whereas consumer debt exceeded $2,500,000,000,000 in 2007, \n     an increase of 33 percent since 2001;\n       Whereas household debt reached a record $13,750,000,000,000 \n     in 2007;\n       Whereas, during 2007, a near-record high of more than 14 \n     percent of disposable personal income went to paying the \n     interest on personal debt;\n       Whereas people in the United States are now facing record \n     numbers of homes in foreclosure, and for the first time in \n     history,\n\n[[Page S2307]]\n\n     they have more total debt than equity in their homes;\n       Whereas approximately 800,000 families filed for bankruptcy \n     in 2007;\n       Whereas nearly half of adults in the United States are not \n     aware that they can access their credit reports for free, and \n     1 in 4 reported having never checked their credit score;\n       Whereas, in a 2006 survey, the Jump$tart Coalition for \n     Personal Financial Literacy found that high school seniors \n     scored an average of only 52.4 percent on an exam testing \n     knowledge of basic personal finance;\n       Whereas approximately 10,000,000 households in the United \n     States do not have accounts at mainstream financial \n     institutions such as banks or credit unions;\n       Whereas expanding access to the mainstream financial system \n     will provide individuals with less expensive and more secure \n     options for managing their finances and building wealth;\n       Whereas the 2007 Survey of the States compiled by the \n     National Council on Economic Education found that only 22 \n     States require testing of economics as a high school \n     graduation requirement, 3 fewer States than did so in 2004;\n       Whereas quality personal financial education is essential \n     to ensure that individuals are prepared to manage money, \n     credit, and debt, and to become responsible workers, heads of \n     households, investors, entrepreneurs, business leaders, and \n     citizens;\n       Whereas increased financial literacy empowers individuals \n     to make wise financial decisions and reduces the confusion \n     caused by the increasingly complex economy of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas a greater understanding of, and familiarity with, \n     financial markets and institutions will lead to increased \n     economic activity and growth;\n       Whereas, in 2003, Congress found it important to coordinate \n     Federal financial literacy efforts and formulate a national \n     strategy; and\n       Whereas, in light of that finding, Congress passed the \n     Financial Literacy and Education Improvement Act of 2003 \n     (Public Law 108-159; 117 Stat. 2003) establishing the \n     Financial Literacy and Education Commission and designating \n     the Office of Financial Education of the Department of the \n     Treasury to provide support for the Commission: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2008 as ``Financial Literacy Month'' \n     to raise public awareness about--\n       (A) the importance of personal financial education in the \n     United States; and\n       (B) the serious consequences that may result from a lack of \n     understanding about personal finances; and\n       (2) calls on the Federal Government, States, localities, \n     schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, and the people \n     of the United States to observe the month with appropriate \n     programs and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2307-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2307-S2310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RYAN HAIGHT ONLINE PHARMACY CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, today the Senate will pass by unanimous \nconsent S. 980, the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection \nAct. This is an important bill that would create potent new tools for \nlaw enforcement to prosecute those who illegally sell drugs online, and \nallow State authorities to shut down online pharmacies even before they \nget started.\n  I thank Senator Feinstein and Senator Sessions for their commitment \nto combating illicit drug trafficking by online predators. Their hard \nwork and diligent efforts, have put together a strong bipartisan bill \nthat includes important modifications and clarifications that will \nprotect our children and grandchildren from purchasing illegal \ndangerous drugs online and reducing the prevalence of rogue online \npharmacies in our society.\n  As the longtime cochair of the Congressional Internet Caucus, I \nunderstand full well the growing danger that illegitimate online \npharmacies pose to youth. I am pleased to join the bill's sponsors in \nsupport of this legislation. I am also very pleased that several of my \nrecommendations to improve the bill are included in this legislation.\n  This bill could not come at a more urgent time for our Nation. In the \ndigital age, the Internet has enabled all Americans better access to \nconvenient and more affordable medicine. Unfortunately, the prevalence \nof rogue online pharmacies has also made the Internet an increasing \nsource for the sale of dangerous controlled substances without a \nlicensed medical practitioner's valid prescription. Online drug \ntraffickers have used evolving tactics to evade detection by law \nenforcement and circumvent the proper constraints of doctors and \npharmacists.\n  The check and security provided by our local pharmacists in local \npharmacies--those who have served Americans for generations and helped \nus get well and keep us well--is not always replicated online. As a \nresult, dangerous and addictive prescription drugs are too often only a \nclick away.\n  Last May, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on this issue. We \nheard compelling testimony from Francine Haight, a mother whose teenage \nson died from an overdose of painkillers he purchased online from a \nrogue pharmacy. We also heard from Joseph\n\n[[Page S2310]]\n\nCalifano, the former Secretary of the Department of Health, Education \nand Welfare. Both strongly supported legislation to fill a gap in \nexisting law and help protect young people from illicit drugs online.\n  Following our hearing, the Internet Drug Advisory Committee held a \nbriefing for the Judiciary Committee on this matter. We heard from \nvarious members of the Internet community on how the private sector may \neffectively collaborate with the public sector to combat the sales of \ndangerous drugs online. These private sector groups will be vital in \nthat effort, and we were happy to receive the benefit of their \ninsights.\n  The administration supports this bill, and that is the right thing to \ndo. I know that our hard working men and women at the Drug Enforcement \nAgency need the added tools this bill would offer to assist their \nefforts to combat rogue online pharmacies. Even more, our children and \ngrandchildren need the safety and security of operating online free \nfrom drug dealers seeking to trick them into purchasing dangerous \ncontrolled substances.\n  The Judiciary Committee reported an amendment in the form of a \nsubstitute which includes several recommendations I have made to \nimprove the bill and make it more effective. These changes were later \nperfected and improved upon after the bill was reported out of \nCommittee.\n  I am pleased that the amendment includes my suggestion that the Drug \nEnforcement Administration report to Congress on recommendations to \ncombat the online sale of controlled substances from foreign countries \nvia the Internet and on ways that the private sector can assist in this \neffort. A key ingredient in diminishing the impact of rogue Web sites \non American citizens is combating the international aspect of this \nproblem, and strengthening the public-private sector collaboration can \nhelp provide a solution.\n  The amendment narrows the U.S. Sentencing Commission directive to \nensure that the most dangerous prescription drugs abused online are \ntreated more severely than less harmful prescription drugs. This \naddition will ensure that the commission has clear guidance to issue \nthe guidelines necessary to hold those individuals who peddle dangerous \nprescription drugs to minors online accountable.\n  The amendment also protects legitimate retail drug chains with online \nwebsites for customers seeking refills on prescriptions, by exempting \nthem from the bill's requirements. This ensures that the bill does not \ntarget legitimate pharmacies that provide Vermonters and other \nAmericans with access to needed medicines nor does it burden legitimate \npharmacies with additional registration and reporting requirements.\n  I believe this measure will be better with these changes. I am \nconfident that this legislation will strengthen our Nation's ability to \neffectively combat online drug trafficking. It furthers the goals of \ndrug enforcement and deterrence, while also providing Congress with \nadditional oversight tools. I support its passage.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank my colleagues for passing S. 980, the Ryan \nHaight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act.\n  With Senator Sessions, I introduced this bill to protect the safety \nof consumers who wish to fill legitimate prescriptions for controlled \nsubstances over the Internet, while holding accountable those who \noperate unregistered pharmacies.\n  Tonight, the Senate took the first important step in stemming the \ntide of online drug trafficking. Perhaps more importantly, the Senate \ntook the first steps in ensuring that children and teens no longer \noverdose, or worse die, after purchasing controlled substances without \na prescription from rogue Internet pharmacies.\n  I would like to clarify that the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer \nProtection Act of 2008 regulates practices related to the delivery, \ndistribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance by means of the \nInternet. The act does not address the delivery, distribution, or \ndispensing of any noncontrolled substance by the Internet or any other \nmeans.\n  This bill does not infringe upon the powers of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services and its Secretary with respect to \nnoncontrolled substances. Nor does it infringe upon the traditional \npower of the States to regulate the practices of medicine and pharmacy \nwith respect to the prescription of non controlled substances. \nDelivery, distribution, or dispensing of noncontrolled substances, \napproved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the \nregulatory bodies of the States, are not affected by the act.\n  This bill would do the following:\n  Bar the sale or distribution of all controlled substances over the \nInternet without a valid prescription; Require online pharmacies to \ndisplay on their Web site a statement of compliance with U.S. law and \nDEA regulations--allowing consumers to know which pharmacies are safe \nand which are not; clarify that rogue pharmacies that sell drugs over \nthe Internet will face the same penalties as people who illegally sell \nthe same drugs on the street; increase the Federal penalties for \nillegally distributing controlled substances; create a new Federal \ncause of action that would allow a State attorney general to shut down \na rogue Web site selling controlled substances.\n\n  This legislation is a critical first step in stemming the tide of \nonline drug trafficking and prescription drug abuse.\n  In closing, I want to share the story of this bill's namesake, Ryan \nT. Haight. Ryan was an 18-year-old honor student from La Mesa, \nCalifornia, when he died in his home on February 12, 2001. His parents \nfound a bottle of Vicodin in his room with a label from an out-of-State \npharmacy.\n  It turns out that Ryan had been ordering addictive drugs online and \npaying with a debit card his parents gave him to buy baseball cards on \neBay.\n  Without a physical exam or his parents' consent, Ryan had been \nobtaining controlled substances, some from an Internet site in \nOklahoma. It only took a few months before Ryan's life was ended by an \noverdose on a cocktail of painkillers.\n  Ryan's story is just one of many. Rogue Internet pharmacies are \nmaking it increasingly easy for teens like Ryan to access deadly \nprescription drugs. This bill is the first step to stem that terrible \ntide. It creates sensible requirements for Internet pharmacy Web sites \nthat will not impact access to convenient, oftentimes cost-saving \ndrugs.\n  I thank my colleagues for rising up and passing this important bill.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a \nFeinstein substitute amendment at the desk be agreed to, the committee \nsubstitute amendment as amended be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be \nread three times and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid on the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

O'Connor, of Connecticut, to be Associate Attorney \n     General.\n\n[[Page S2311]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have finally completed our consideration \nof the nomination of Kevin O'Connor to be Associate Attorney General, \nthe number three position at the Department of Justice. This nomination \nwas cleared by the Democrats and set to be confirmed before our Easter \nRecess but was blocked by a last-minute, anonymous Republican hold. \nAlso blocked at that time and still held is the nomination of Gregory \nKatsas to be the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil \nDivision.\n  I was particularly disappointed with that unexpected development in \nMarch. We had worked hard to expedite these nominations, holding a \nhearing on the first day of this session of Congress. After a nearly \nmonth-long delay, when Republican Members of the Judiciary Committee \neffectively boycotted our business meetings in February, we were able \nto report these nominations to the Senate in early March. They were set \nfor confirmation before the Easter recess, until the last-minute \nRepublican objection stalled them. They joined the President's \nnomination of Michael Sullivan to be the Director of the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives as among those stymied by \nRepublican objections.\n  I thank Senator Whitehouse for chairing the hearing on the O'Connor \nnomination. We continued our work in connection with high-ranking \nDepartment of Justice nominees the week before recess when Senator \nKennedy chaired our hearing on the nomination of Grace Chung Becker to \nbe Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division. \nThe Civil Rights Division is entrusted with protecting precious rights \nof Americans, including our fundamental right to vote. That hearing was \nthe seventh the Committee has held since last September on executive \nnominations, as we continue to work to restock and restore the \nleadership of the Department of Justice in the wake of the scandals of \nthe Gonzales era.\n  A little more than a year ago, the Judiciary Committee began its \noversight efforts for the 110th Congress. Over the next 9 months, our \nefforts revealed a Department of Justice gone awry. The leadership \ncrisis came more and more into view as Senator Specter and I led a \nbipartisan group of concerned Senators to consider the United States \nAttorney firing scandal, a confrontation over the legality of the \nadministration's warrantless wiretapping program, the untoward \npolitical influence of the White House at the Department of Justice, \nand the secret legal memos excusing all manner of excess.\n  This crisis of leadership has taken a heavy toll on the tradition of \nindependence that has long guided the Justice Department and provided \nit with safe harbor from political interference. It shook the \nconfidence of the American people. Through bipartisan efforts among \nthose from both sides of the aisle who care about Federal law \nenforcement and the Department of Justice, we joined together to press \nfor accountability. That resulted in a change in leadership at the \nDepartment, with the resignations of the Attorney General and many \nhigh-ranking Department officials.\n  The partisan accusations of ``slow walking'' nominations that the \nPresident engaged in at the White House recently, and repeated even \ntoday by Republican Senators, are belied by the facts. They are about \nas accurate as when President Bush ascribed Attorney General Gonzales' \nresignation to supposed ``unfair treatment'' and having ``his good name \n. . . dragged through the mud for political reasons.'' The U.S. \nAttorney firing scandal was of the administration's own making. It \ndecimated morale at the Department of Justice. A good way to help \nrestore the Justice Department would be for this administration to \nacknowledge its wrongdoing.\n  What those who say we are ``slow-walking'' nominations do not say is \nthat as a result of the mass resignations at the Justice Department in \nthe wake of the scandals of the Gonzales era, the Committee has held \nseven hearings on high-ranking nominations to restore the leadership of \nthe Department of Justice between September of last year and this \nmonth, including confirmation hearings for the new Attorney General, \nthe new Deputy Attorney General, the new Associate Attorney General, \nand so many others. Of course those months also include the December \nand January holiday period and break between sessions.\n  What is being ignored by the President and Senate Republicans as they \nplay to a vocal segment of their Republican base is that we have worked \nhard to make progress and restore the leadership of the Department of \nJustice. In the last 6 months, we have confirmed a new Attorney \nGeneral, a new Deputy Attorney General, held hearings for several other \nhigh-ranking Justice Department positions, and voted those nominations \nout of the Judiciary Committee. Today we continue that progress with \nthe confirmation of the Associate Attorney General.\n  It is vital that we ensure that we have a functioning, independent \nJustice Department. In January, the Judiciary Committee held our first \noversight hearing of the new session and the first with new Attorney \nGeneral Michael Mukasey. We held another oversight hearing last month \nwith FBI Director Mueller and tomorrow we are holding an oversight \nhearing with Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff to explore that \nDepartment's handling of issues within the Judiciary Committee's \njurisdiction related to the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, the \nso-called REAL ID Act, naturalization backlogs, the resettlement of \nIraqi refugees and asylum seekers and the shameful, continuing \naftermath from Katrina. These are more steps forward in our efforts to \nrestore checks and balances to our Government and begin to repair the \ndamage this administration inflicted on our Constitution and \nfundamental American values.\n  We continue to press for accountability even as we learn startling \nnew revelations about the extent to which some will go to avoid \naccountability, undermine oversight, and stonewall the American \npeople's right to the truth. We find shifting answers on issues \nincluding the admission that the CIA used waterboarding on detainees in \nreliance on the advice of the Department of Justice; the destruction of \nWhite House e-mails required by law to be preserved; and the CIA's \ndestruction of videotapes of detainee interrogations not shared with \nthe 9/11 Commission, Congress or the courts. The only constant is the \ndemand for immunity and unaccountability among those in the \nadministration. This White House continues to stonewall the legitimate \nneeds for information articulated by the Judiciary Committee and others \nin the Congress, and contemptuously refuse to appear when summoned by \ncongressional subpoena.\n  In spite of the administration's lack of cooperation, the Senate is \nmoving forward with the confirmation of executive nominations. With the \nconfirmation today, we will have confirmed 27 executive nominations, \nincluding the confirmations of nine U.S. Attorneys, five U.S. Marshals, \nand the top three positions at the Justice Department so far this \nCongress.\n  Of course, we could have made even more progress had the White House \nsent us timely nominations to fill the remaining executive branch \nvacancies with nominees who will restore the independence of federal \nlaw enforcement. There are now 19 districts across the country with \nacting or interim U.S. Attorneys instead of Senate-confirmed, \npresidentially-appointed U.S. Attorneys. For more than a year I have \nbeen talking publicly about the need to name U.S. Attorneys to fill \nthese vacancies to no avail.\n  We have seen what happens when the rule of law plays second fiddle to \na President's agenda and the partisan desires of political operatives. \nIt is a disaster for the American people. Both the President and the \nNation are best served by a Justice Department that provides sound \nadvice and takes responsible action, without regard to political \nconsiderations--not one that develops legalistic loopholes to serve the \nends of a particular administration.\n  I congratulate the nominee and his family on his confirmation today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/01/senate-section/article/S2311-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
