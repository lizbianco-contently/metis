Mr. President, my goal as a boy was to be a baseball \nplayer. I loved to listen to those baseball games, and I could see \nmyself in my mature years chasing balls down in the outfield and \nhitting doubles to bring in the winning run. That didn't happen in my \nlife, but I have had the wonderful experience here in the Senate of \nbeing able to talk, as I was for a few minutes this morning, to a \nmember of the Baseball Hall of Fame, Jim Bunning.\n  I hope these pages here understand that they have a rare opportunity, \nto be able to be in the same room, to shake someone's hand who is a \nmember of the Hall of Fame. It was my first time, during Thanksgiving, \nto visit the Baseball Hall of Fame, and I came away with the \nrealization of how few people are in that Baseball Hall of Fame. Jim \nBunning is one of them. We talked a few minutes this morning, and I \nasked him questions, such as: Who are the good catchers who caught you? \nAnd he said: Lots of them. And we talked today about Clay Dalrymple, \nthe man who caught his perfect game, and Gus Triandos.\n  So just a little offshoot, Mr. President. We are so fortunate to be \nMembers of the Senate for lots of reasons, not the least of which is \nthat we are able to serve with a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1469-7", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1469-S1470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period \nof morning business until 11:45 a.m. The first 30 minutes will be \ncontrolled by the Republicans, and the next 30 minutes will be \ncontrolled by the majority. There is additional time for Members to \nspeak in morning business until the hour of 11:45, if they wish. At \nthat time, the Senate will proceed into executive session to consider \nthree judicial nominations. The debate time on the three nominations is \nlimited to 10 minutes; therefore, Members can expect rollcall votes as \nearly as 11:55 this morning.\n\n[[Page S1470]]\n\n  The distinguished Republican leader and I have had a number of \nconversations about judicial nominations, which, in the past, have been \na real dustup. We are going to try to avoid that this year. We hope to \nhave the first circuit court nomination approved before the Presidents \nDay recess and will continue to work on district court trial judges and \ncircuit court judges as soon as we can.\n  I personally want the record to reflect that I appreciate the \nPresident not sending back four names that were really controversial, \nand I think it is better for the body that the President did not send \nup those names. I think we have to reciprocate in a way that is \nappropriate, and we are going to try to do that by looking at these \nnominations as quickly as we can. We are hopeful and somewhat confident \nthe President will send us some good circuit court nominees.\n  Once we have disposed of the nominations, we will resume debate, \npostcloture, on H.R. 2, the minimum wage bill. A vote on this matter \nshould occur this afternoon. I will discuss that with the Republican \nleader so that Members will have notice as to when that vote will \noccur.\n\n  After we complete action on the minimum wage bill, there will be an \nimmediate cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. Con. Res. 2, the \nbipartisan Iraq resolution. Last night, I asked consent that we vitiate \nthat cloture vote. We are still working on that to see if we can work \nsomething out with the Republicans as to whether we have that vote. \nMost Democrats will vote against going forward on that since there is \nnow another matter that will come before the Senate, at the latest on \nMonday. But we are working on that. I acknowledged last night, as did \nthe Republican leader, that the final language of the new matter, which \nSenator Levin introduced last night, was just finalized at 8:30 p.m., 9 \np.m. last night, so I understand why we can't get anything definitely \nfrom the minority leader at this time.\n  I would also say that we have now in the Senate a continuing \nresolution which passed the House by approximately 290 votes. We are \nready to move forward on that. We have to complete that legislation by \nFebruary 15, the Presidents Day recess, or the Federal Government is \nclosed, and no one wants that to happen. So we are going to move \nforward on that. What we would like to do is move forward on it by \nunanimous consent. I understand that is not something that is going to \nhappen, or at least at this stage, but at least we are ready to move \nforward as quickly as possible. The more quickly we dispose of that, \nthe more time we can spend on Iraq, if, in fact, we want to spend more \ntime on Iraq. At the least, next week is set aside so that we can \ndebate Iraq. What we hope is that we can have a number of competing \nresolutions, whether it is two, three, four, whatever it is, and to get \nconsent that we would use these vehicles for debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1470-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.J.

He has 9 \nwonderful children, 35 grandchildren, maybe even some beyond that. So \nit is an extraordinary Kentucky family, and I wish to acknowledge with \ngratitude the observations the majority leader made of my colleague, \nSenator Bunning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1470-4", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOMINATIONS AND IRAQ\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I also wish to thank the majority \nleader for his remarks about circuit court judges. We all know the \nconfirmation of circuit court judges became unnecessarily, it seems to \nme and I think seems to him, contentious at various times in recent \nyears. I think we are off to a good start this year.\n  Each of the last three Presidents ended his term with the U.S. Senate \nin the hands of the opposition party. Each of these last three \nPresidents received an average of 17 circuit court judicial \nconfirmations during those last 2 years even though the Senate was in \nthe hands of the opposition party.\n  As Senator Reid has indicated, the President has not forwarded \nseveral nominations that were contentious in the last session, and I \nthank the majority leader for his indication that we will move forward \nwith Randy Smith, who is the nominee for the Ninth Circuit, before the \nLincoln recess. That is an indication of good faith on his part, which \nis greatly appreciated by me and others on our side.\n  With regard to Iraq, as the majority leader indicated, we continue to \nbe in discussions about how to craft that debate. We certainly agree \nthe debate will occur next week, and we are trying to reach a consent \nagreement that would allow us to have several different options that \nwould reflect the sentiment of most Members of the Senate about the \ncurrent situation in Iraq and the decision to go forward and try to \nquiet the capital city of Baghdad. So those discussions will continue \nthroughout the day.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1470-5", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and the \nminority leader for their nice words. They might disagree on certain \nissues, but I am glad they agree on one thing--that I finally made it \nto the U.S. Senate after spending 12 years in the House and did have a \nprivate and professional life prior to service here in the Federal \nGovernment. I thank both Senators.\n  As we prepare to discuss the war in Iraq, I would like to take a \ncouple of minutes to discuss the issue of personal responsibility, \ncivility, and the role of American diplomacy.\n  Since the founding of our great Nation, we have had a long and proud \ntradition of international diplomacy. Our diplomacy has taken many \nforms, whether it is through official state visits or through less \nformal channels, such as congressional delegations traveling to \nindividual countries. What we all need to remember is that when we are \non a trip to a foreign country, we act as American diplomats. This is \nsomething which I would like my colleagues to remember, especially when\n\n[[Page S1471]]\n\nthey speak on American foreign policy in public international forums \nand settings. Most of our colleagues take this role seriously and act \nin a manner that is consistent with the advancements of our Nation's \nforeign policy. We should not use the international stage as an \nopportunity to denounce our own country by making irresponsible \ncomments that endanger our foreign policy by sending the wrong messages \nto our enemies.\n  We currently face a critical turning point in our Nation's foreign \npolicy.\n  As representatives of this Government, we need to be responsible with \nour remarks on foreign soil and to show some form of civility when \nairing our grievances about our President, our country's stand on \ndiplomatic issues, and the war in Iraq.\n  While we do have our disagreements on how this country should \nproceed, I believe we need to iron out these problems at home rather \nthan taking them to an international stage and using that opportunity \nto make politically offensive comments towards our country.\n  Saying our country is shameful at an international forum only hurts \nour standing among world leaders we are trying to negotiate with on \nimportant trade deals and other foreign policy issues such as \npreventing further international conflict.\n  We need to help build up America on the international stage, not \nshoot ourselves in the foot by tearing ourselves down with statements \nused for political gain.\n  Most Americans do not belong to the ``Blame America First'' crowd. \nMost Americans don't support bashing our country on the international \nstage. Most Americans agree that politics ends at the water's edge.\n  The ``Blame America First'' crowd spreads negative sentiment about \nthe United States, and then wonders why the rest of the world has a low \nopinion of America. They are feeding the very beast they claim they are \ntrying to tame.\n  Most Americans are proud of what this country stands for.\n  The United States is one of the largest contributors in economic aid \nto developing countries.\n  We continually work as a Nation to extend a helping hand to those in \nneed.\n  Funding for bilateral and economic assistance has increased \nconsecutively over the past 6 years, reaching unprecedented levels in \nthe international community.\n  We have also taken the lead in the fight against the spread of HIV \nand AIDS.\n  We recognize that this pandemic is destroying lives, undermining \neconomies, and threatening to destabilize entire regions.\n  The President's emergency plan for AIDS relief is the largest \ncommitment ever made by any nation to combat HIV and AIDS.\n  The number of people benefiting from this program has grown from \n50,000 to 800,000 in 3 years.\n  It is an extremely successful program and continues to grow in \nsupport every year.\n  We also continue to provide lifesaving drugs to fight malaria to \nthose in need in Africa.\n  Through the President's malaria initiative we have been able to \nprovide millions of lifesaving treatments in order to prevent the \nspread of this debilitating disease.\n  These international successes often go largely unnoticed and are \novershadowed by the current debate on the war in Iraq.\n  I ask my colleagues to take a moment this week to reflect upon our \nforeign policy successes as well as our current challenges.\n  I believe that we can build upon our mistakes and learn from them.\n  We must work collectively on advancing our national interests instead \nof splintering off and playing into the hands of our enemies.\n  Some of the proposed resolutions on Iraq send a terrible message to \nboth our troops and allies and only hurt our national interests.\n  Even more importantly, I believe they send a dangerous message to our \nenemies.\n  I do not support these kinds of nonbinding resolutions that criticize \nour plans for Iraq and I plan to oppose them.\n  They are counterproductive and will not make our problems in Iraq go \naway now or in the near future.\n  I support working to find real solutions to the problem at hand, not \npolitically motivated attempts that offer little or no alternative.\n  I will not participate in this empty political posturing.\n  My main focus is on providing moral and material support for our \ntroops.\n  We must not forget our commitment to our troops and in turn the \ncommitment they made to our country and the mission in Iraq.\n  I believe they deserve our full support, not criticism and idle \nthreats to cut their funding.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I was initially skeptical of sending \nadditional reinforcement troops to Iraq, but I believe that we must \ngive the President's new strategy a chance to succeed.\n  Abruptly cutting and running is not a viable option.\n  This would only further hinder our efforts in the war on terror and \nendanger our regional allies in the Middle East.\n  I will support our commander and chief in his new way forward in Iraq \nand will support General Petraeus, our new commander of the \nmultinational forces in Iraq, in his efforts to carry out this plan.\n  I believe that General Petraeus is a key component in this new \nstrategy.\n  He is a friend.\n  He has spent many years of his fine career stationed at Fort \nCampbell, KY.\n  I have the utmost respect for him and confidence in his leadership \nskills and judgment.\n  His service in Iraq has equipped him with an expertise in irregular \nwarfare and operations and a true understanding of the enemy we face.\n  In his 27 months in Iraq, he led a division into battle, oversaw the \nreconstruction and governance of Iraq's third-largest city, and built \nup from virtually nothing Iraq's army and police force.\n  He managed to do this all by earning the respect of the Iraqis--all \nIraqis--the Kurds, Sunnis and the Shias.\n  General Petraeus and I talked, just the two of us, for nearly an hour \nin my office this week.\n  I asked tough questions. And he responded with realistic answers \nabout what it takes for us to succeed in Iraq.\n  He knows that Iraqis have to live up to their end of the bargain.\n  Now we must show General Petraeus that we will live up to our end of \nthe bargain and give him the opportunity to carry out his mission.\n  Some of our colleagues support General Petraeus but do not support \nhis mission.\n  Many of our colleagues that unanimously voted to give General \nPetraeus his fourth star last week will likely vote in favor of \nproposed resolutions that question the very mission that General \nPetraeus testified in support of before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  This does not make sense to me. Right now we cannot afford to \ndistinguish between the two.\n  I am not asking my colleagues for an open-ended commitment, just a \nlittle more patience--patience to see if this new strategy works, \npatience to see if Iraqis will hold up their end of the bargain and \nmeet the benchmarks set by both our countries, and finally, patience to \nallow our troops to complete their mission.\n  Our troops are committed to their mission. Now we owe them our \ncommitment.\n  This is our last best hope for progress in Iraq.\n  In his confirmation hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nGeneral Petraeus offered to provide Congress with regular reports on \nthe progress of his mission and on the performance and cooperation of \nIraqis.\n  I plan on taking him up on this offer.\n  We must keep up to date on the situation in Iraq as it changes so \nthat we can best help our new commander address the situation at hand.\n  I wish General Petraeus the best of luck in this mission.\n  It is a daunting task but I have faith in him and his leadership \ncapabilities.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support.\n  We must show a united front and give this plan a chance to succeed.\n  The cost of failure is too great. We cannot afford failure in Iraq \nand the international community cannot either, so I ask my colleagues \nto reflect on these serious issues before we begin debating the \nresolutions concerning the war in Iraq next week.\n\n[[Page S1472]]\n\n  Let us show both our allies and our enemies that we can be united \nbehind our Nation's foreign policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first let me compliment my colleague, Senator \nBunning, for a fine statement. I endorse his call for unity. In a time \nof war, a country needs to be unified, especially when we send our \nyoung men and women into harm's way. They need to know we support the \nmission that we put them in harm's way to try to achieve.\n  I remember years ago I used to see bumper stickers that said, ``Give \npeace a chance.'' Today we need to dust off some of those bumper \nstickers, write a couple of extra words in, and give the President's \nplan for peace a chance. We are going to have a debate next week among \nthose who believe the President's plan deserves a chance to succeed and \nthose who disagree. I believe the latter position is dangerous, and it \nwould be dangerous to express that point of view with a vote of the \nSenate in support of a resolution to that effect, especially since it \nappears people whom we have relied on in the past for advice are also \nnow saying give the President's plan a chance and because events on the \nground are beginning to suggest that his plan is already beginning to \nwork.\n  There has been a great deal of discussion about the Baker-Hamilton \nreport. Critics of the President's plan have frequently held that \nreport up as evidence that we need to take a different course of \naction. But yesterday, appearing before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, former Secretary of State James Baker and former Member of \nthe House of Representatives Lee Hamilton both argued that the \nPresident's plan should be given a chance to succeed.\n  Maybe that surprised the chairman, but here is what they testified. \nRepresentative Hamilton:\n\n       So I guess my bottom line on the surge is, look, the \n     President's plan ought to be given a chance. Give it a \n     chance, because we heard all of this. The general that you \n     confirmed 80-to-nothing the day before yesterday, this is his \n     idea. He's the supporter of it. Give it a chance.\n\n  That is Lee Hamilton.\n  Former Senator and Secretary of State Baker said:\n\n       . . . the study group set no timetables and we set no \n     deadlines. We believe that military commanders must have the \n     flexibility to respond to events on the ground.\n\n  And he said, in response to a Senator:\n\n       Senator, one of the purposes of the surge, as I'm sure you \n     have heard from General Petraeus, when you confirmed him, is \n     to give the Iraqi government a little more running room in \n     order to help it achieve national reconciliation by tamping \n     down the violence or pacifying, if you will, Baghdad.\n\n  That is the purpose of this strategy.\n  As I said, there is already evidence, even though the strategy has \ncertainly not been implemented in full, that even the prospect of its \nimplementation is beginning to have an effect. It is clear the Iraqi \nGovernment, in its pronouncements, has already begun to sound a lot \ndifferent to these terrorists than they did in the past, when the Iraqi \nGovernment didn't always back up the U.S. efforts. When we would go \ninto an area, we would capture these killers, and a couple of days \nlater they would be back on the street because somebody with political \ninfluence in Iraq would see that it happened.\n  The idea is the Iraqis are now going to take charge and not allow \nthat to happen. And in addition to U.S. troops, there will be twice as \nmany new Iraqi troops helping to make sure it does not happen. Here are \na few excerpts from the news media.\n  From the Washington Post, February 1, 2007:\n\n       Shiite militia leaders already appear to be leaving their \n     strongholds in Baghdad in anticipation of the U.S. and Iraqi \n     plan to increase the troop presence in the Iraqi capital, \n     according to the top U.S. commander in the country.\n\n  He said:\n\n       We have seen numerous indications Shia militia leaders will \n     leave, or already have left, Sadr City to avoid capture by \n     Iraqi and coalition security forces,'' Army Gen. George W. \n     Casey Jr. said in a written statement submitted to the Senate \n     Armed Services Committee as part of his confirmation hearing \n     today to be the Army chief of staff.\n\n  Already beginning to work. The article continues:\n\n       Radical Shiite cleric Moqtada Sadr has ordered his militia \n     not to confront U.S. forces and has endorsed negotiations \n     aimed at easing the deployment of American troops in his \n     strongholds, according to Sadrist and other Shiite \n     officials. This is the idea. In Anbar Province, where the \n     pressure from al-Qaida has been very strong, there is now \n     news that the sheiks in Anbar Province are beginning to \n     work with us. Just one report from the Washington Post of \n     January 27:\n       With the help of a confederation of about 50 Sunni Muslim \n     tribal sheiks, the U.S. military recruited more than 800 \n     police officers in December and is on track to do the same \n     this month. Officers credit the sheiks' cooperation for the \n     diminishing violence in Ramadi, the capital of Anbar \n     province.\n\n  We have just mounted a big offensive with the Iraqi military in \nNajaf, and I quote from a Washington Post story of January 29:\n\n       Iraqi soldiers, backed by U.S. helicopters, stormed an \n     encampment of hundreds of insurgents hiding among date palm \n     orchards in southern Iraq in an operation Sunday and set off \n     fierce, day-long gun battles during the holiest week for the \n     country's Shiite Muslims. Iraqi security officials said that \n     the troops killed scores of insurgents while foiling a plot \n     to annihilate the Shiite religious leadership in the revered \n     city of Najaf.\n\n  There is also political movement in the country. Let me quote from a \nstory from the Los Angeles Times of February 1:\n\n       Sunni and Shiite Arab lawmakers announced plans Wednesday \n     to form two new blocs in Iraq's parliament they hope will \n     break away from the ethnic and religious mold of current \n     alliances and ease sectarian strife.\n\n  There has also been a lot of talk about whether the mission of our \nforces should be one of which is to help secure the borders. This is \nsomething else that the Iraqis have pledged that they need to do, \nparticularly in their relationships with Syria and Iran. Quoting from \nthe same Los Angeles Times story:\n\n       Iraq indefinitely halted all flights to and from Syria and \n     closed a border crossing with Iran as the government prepares \n     for a security crackdown, a parliament member and an airport \n     official said Wednesday, the Associated Press reported. The \n     airport official said that flights to and from Syria would be \n     cancelled for at least two weeks and that service had been \n     interrupted on Tuesday. Hassan al-Sunneid, a member of the \n     parliament's defense and security committee, told the AP that \n     ``the move was in preparation for the security plan. The \n     State will decide when the flights will resume.''\n\n  So it is already beginning. No resolution passed here in the Senate \nis going to stop this new strategy. It appears to already be having \nsome success. My only concern is the disagreement of some of our \ncolleagues that it can't succeed will become a self-fulfilling \nprophecy, merely because it could embolden our enemies and cause our \nallies to wonder whether we still have the will to continue until we \nhave achieved our mission in Iraq. But perhaps the message I am most \nconcerned about that these resolutions would send is not only to the \nenemy and to our allies, but to our own troops and to their families.\n  There has been quite a bit of discussion of a news report on the NBC \nNightly News last Friday, Brian Williams reporting, who specifically \ncalled upon Richard Engel, who was in Iraq, to report on what he had \nfound there. I will work through his report, but here is what Engel \nsaid:\n\n       It's not just the new mission the soldiers are adjusting \n     to. They have something else on their minds: The growing \n     debate at home about the war. Troops here say they are \n     increasingly frustrated by American criticism of the war. \n     Many take it personally, believing it is also criticism of \n     what they have been fighting for. Twenty-one year-old SP \n     Tyler Johnson is on his first tour in Iraq. He thinks \n     skeptics should come over and see what it is like firsthand \n     before criticizing.\n\n  Here is what SP Tyler Johnson then said on the TV news.\n\n       Those people are dying. You know what I'm saying? You may \n     support--``Oh, we support the troops,'' but you're not \n     supporting what they do, what they share and sweat for, what \n     they believe for, and what we die for. It just don't make \n     sense to me.\n\n  Richard Engel then said:\n\n       Staff SGT Manuel Sahagun has served in Afghanistan and is \n     now on his second tour in Iraq. He says people back home \n     can't have it both ways.\n\n  And now Staff SGT Manuel Sahagun is on the camera and says:\n\n       One thing I don't like is when people back home say they \n     support the troops, but they don't support the war. If \n     they're going to support us, support us all the way.\n\n  And then Engel says:\n\n       SP Peter Manna thinks people have forgotten the toll the \n     war has taken.\n\n\n[[Page S1473]]\n\n\n  And SP Peter Manna says:\n\n       If they don't think what we are doing is a good job, \n     everything that we have done here is all in vain.\n\n  Engel concludes:\n\n       Apache Company has lost two soldiers and now worries their \n     country may be abandoning the mission they died for.\n\n  We cannot send that message to our troops and to their families, that \nwe disagree with the mission we are putting them in harm's way to try \nto achieve. As these three young men, our finest, have said, speaking \nto the American people: You can't say you support the troops if you \ndon't support what we are trying to do here, what we might die trying \nto accomplish.\n  That is why we have to be careful about resolutions in the Senate. \nEvery Senator has an immense capability of expressing his or her point \nof view. We have all done that. We all continue to do it. We can get \nbefore the cameras any time we want to. We can let our folks back home \nknow what we feel. And I dare say there are probably 100 different \nopinions in this body of 100 people. We all have a little different \nview of it. And we can tell our constituents what we think.\n  We certainly can communicate that to the President and people in the \nmilitary. What we don't have to do is to go the next step and pass a \nresolution that first of all is nonbinding and has no effect on the \nimplementation of the strategy, which is already beginning and will go \nforward, but can have a very detrimental effect on our enemies, on our \nallies, and on our own troops.\n  When General Petraeus was here testifying before his confirmation, he \nwas asked a question about the resolutions to the effect of would it be \nhelpful, and he said: No, it would not be helpful. Then he went on to \ntalk about the object of war being to break the will of the enemy. He \nsaid: This would not help us--it would hurt us--break the will of the \nenemy, especially in a war like the one we are fighting with terrorists \naround the globe today--a war of wills.\n\n  It is important for us not to send the signal that our will is \nflagging, that there is great disagreement in our country about the \ndesire to continue. In this war of wills, we should be unified and in \nsupport of the mission we are sending our troops to try to accomplish, \nand in support of the general whom we have confirmed to carry out that \nmission.\n  So I hope my colleagues will think very carefully about the words \nthey speak, the actions they take, and reflect on what others will \nthink of what we do here in this body. We are not simply speaking to \nthe President, trying to send him a message. Everyone else in the world \nwill get that message. And as much as we might manipulate the words in \na resolution to try to bring 60 Senators all in consensus to what the \nresolution says, we all know what the headlines the next morning are \ngoing to say all around the world if a resolution like this were to \npass: ``Senate Declares No Confidence in President's Strategy.'' ``U.S. \nSenate Goes on Record as Opposing Bush Plan.'' You can write the \nheadline. Those are the words that will resonate around the world.\n  Let's not make any criticism of the President or his plan become a \nself-fulfilling prophecy. Let's be as united as we can in supporting \nour troops by supporting the mission we are sending them on, hoping it \nwill succeed; if we want, expressing concerns we have about that, but \ndoing so in a way that doesn't undercut the message. We can do both of \nthese things in this great open society. People expect us to have \ndebate about important issues such as matters of war and peace, and we \ncan do that without undercutting the mission here.\n  I go back to where I started in quoting former Representative Lee \nHamilton, cochairman of the Hamilton-Baker commission in his testimony \nyesterday here in the Senate:\n\n       So I guess my bottom line on the surge is, look, the \n     President's plan ought to be given a chance. Give it a \n     chance, because we have heard all of this. The general that \n     you confirmed 80 to nothing the day before yesterday, this is \n     his idea. He's the supporter of it. Give it a chance.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1473-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1473-S1474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to make a few brief comments \nthis morning on the Warner resolution and the negotiations that went on \nyesterday, led by Senator Levin, to deal with Iraq.\n  Three weeks ago before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \nSecretary Rice presented the President's plan for Iraq. The Presiding \nOfficer, among others, was there. Its main feature was to send more \nAmerican troops into Baghdad, in the middle of a sectarian war, in the \nmiddle of a city of over 6 million people.\n  The reaction to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from \nRepublicans and Democrats alike ranged from profound skepticism to \noutright opposition. That pretty much reflected the reaction across the \ncountry.\n  Consequently, Senators Hagel, Levin, Snowe, and I wrote a resolution \nto give Senators a way to vote their voices, vote what they had said. \nWe believe, the four of us, and I know the Presiding Officer does, as \nwell, that the quickest, most effective way to get the President to \nchange his course is to demonstrate to him that his policy has little \nor no support in this Senate, in our committee, or, quite frankly, \nacross the country.\n  After we introduced our resolution, Senator Warner came forward with \nhis resolution. The bottom line of the resolution is essentially the \nsame, and it was: Don't send more American troops into the middle of a \ncivil war.\n  There was one critical difference between the Biden-Levin and the \nWarner amendment. Senator Warner's resolution, in one paragraph, left \nopen, I think unintentionally, the possibility of increasing the \noverall number of American troops in Iraq--just not in Baghdad. So from \nour perspective it wasn't enough to say don't go into Baghdad with more \ntroops; we wanted to say don't raise the number of troops, as well.\n  The provision in the Warner amendment that allowed for that, if read \nby the President the way he would want to read it, I believe, would \nhave allowed an increase in troops. We believe very strongly--Senator \nLevin, myself, Hagel, Snowe--that would send the wrong message. We \nought to be drawing down in Iraq, not ramping up. We ought to be \nredeploying, not deploying into Baghdad. We should make it clear to the \nIraqi leaders that they have to begin to make the hard compromises \nnecessary for a political solution.\n  A political solution everyone virtually agrees on is the precondition \nfor anything positive happening in Iraq. Now, I make it clear, I and \neveryone else in this Senate knows that it is not an easy thing for the \nIraqi leadership to do, but it is absolutely essential.\n  So we approached Senator Warner several times to try to work out the \ndifference between the Biden and the Warner resolutions. I am very \npleased that last night, through the leadership of Senator Warner and \nSenator Levin, we succeeded in doing just that. The language Senator \nWarner removed from his resolution removed the possibility that it can \nbe read as calling for more troops in Iraq.\n  With that change, I am very pleased to join Senator Levin, now known \nas the Levin-Warner resolution, as a cosponsor of that resolution. For \nmy intent, at the outset when I first spoke out about the President's \nplanned surge of American forces in Iraq, when I spoke out before the \nnew year, I made it clear that my purpose was to build bipartisan \nopposition to his plan because that was the best way to get him to \nreconsider. That is exactly what this compromise does.\n  Now we have a real opportunity for the Senate to speak clearly. Every \nSenator will have a chance to vote on whether he or she supports or \ndisagrees with the President's plan to send more troops into the middle \nof a civil war. If the President does not listen to the majority of the \nCongress--and I expect the majority of Congress will vote for our \nresolution--if he does not respond to a majority of the Congress and a\n\n[[Page S1474]]\n\nmajority of the American people, we will have to look for other ways to \nchange his policy. But this is a very important first step.\n  Also, I would like to take a moment to present what I believe are the \nprincipal findings of our 4 weeks of hearings, over 50 hours, if I am \nnot mistaken, of hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee. While no \nunanimous prescription has emerged, there is remarkably broad consensus \non three main points: First, American troops cannot stop sectarian \nwarfare in Iraq, only a political settlement can do that; the second \npoint of consensus, we must engage in intensive regional diplomacy to \nsupport the settlement among Iraqis; third, the U.S. military should \nfocus on combatting terrorists, keeping Iraq's neighbors honest, \ntraining Iraq's troops--not on policing a civil war. Indeed, combat \ntroops should start to redeploy as soon as our mission is narrowed.\n  Those three points were overwhelmingly agreed upon by an array of the \nmost well informed foreign policy experts, both military and civilian, \nthat we have arrayed before that committee in a long time.\n  Since a political settlement is so critical, we have examined this \nissue in detail. We have looked at the benchmarks the President has \nproposed--on oil law, debaathification reform, constitutional reform, \nand provincial elections--but the divisions are so deep and passions \nrun so high now in Iraq we may be beyond the point where such modest \nmeasures can stabilize Iraq.\n  I believe, and have believed for some time, something much broader is \nnecessary, something much bolder is necessary. Les Gelb, the chairman \nemeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former Defense \nDepartment official, and I put forward just such a proposal 9 months \nago. It is premised upon our conviction that the heart of the \nadministration's strategy--building a strong central government--will, \nin fact, not succeed. As a matter of fact, in the testimony we heard, \nmost pointed out where countries have been drawn by the slip of a pen \nby world leaders after World War I and World War II--the Balkans, Iraq, \nand many other places we could name--there have basically only been two \nmodels that have brought stability: A straw plan, a la Saddam, or a \nFederal system, a la the Iraqi Constitution.\n  The reason a strong central government will not work, although \ndesirable, is there is no trust within the Government, no trust of the \nGovernment by the people of Iraq, no capacity of the Government to \ndeliver services, no capacity of this new Government to deliver \nsecurity.\n  In a sense, it is understandable. Indeed, we must bring Iraqis' \nproblems and the responsibility of managing those problems down to \nlocal and regional levels where we can help the Iraqis build trust and \ncapacity much more quickly and much more effectively.\n  We have proposed that the Iraqis create what their constitution calls \nfor: three or more ``regions'' they call them--not republics--three or \nfour more regions consistent with their constitution. We call for \nIraq's oil to be shared equally with a guarantee that the Sunnis get \ntheir share and have some international oversight to guarantee it. We \ncall for aggressive diplomacy--which, again, most every witness called \nfor, including the Iraq Study Group--we call for aggressive diplomacy \nin the creation of a contact group consisting of Iraq's neighbors and \nthe major powers in the world, including large Islamic countries to \nsupport a political settlement.\n  We believe we can redeploy most, if not all, of America's troops from \nIraq within 18 months under this plan, leaving behind a small force in \nIraq or in the region to strike at terrorists, the jihadists, the al-\nQaidaists, keeping the neighbors honest, and training Iraqi forces. The \ntime has demonstrated this plan is more relevant and inevitable than it \nwas even the day we put pen to paper and set it out 9 months ago. It \ntakes into account the harsh reality of self-sustaining sectarian \nviolence; it is consistent with Iraq's Constitution; and it can produce \na phrase used by a New York Times columnist in describing our plan. It \ncan produce ``a soft landing'' for Iraq and prevent a full-blown civil \nwar that tears the country apart and spreads beyond its borders.\n  I might also add, as people have come to understand, what I am \ncalling for is not partitioning, not three separate republics; what I \nam calling for is what the Iraqi Constitution calls for: \ndecentralization of control over security and local laws with the \ncentral government having responsibility for the Army, distribution of \nresources and currency and other things that a central government must \ndo.\n  As that has become clearer and clearer, some of the most powerful \nvoices in the American foreign policy establishment have come forward \nto suggest it makes sense.\n  Secretary Kissinger told our committee yesterday:\n\n       I'm sympathetic to an outcome that permits large regional \n     autonomy. In fact, I think it is very likely this will emerge \n     out of the conflict that we are now witnessing.\n\n  Former Secretary of State Albright said:\n\n       . . . the idea of the . . . constitution of Iraq as \n     written, which allows for and mandates, in fact, a great deal \n     of regional autonomy, is appropriate.\n\n  James Baker, former Secretary of State, coauthor of the Baker-\nHamilton commission report told us that there are indications that Iraq \nmay be moving toward three autonomous regions, and ``if it is, we ought \nto be prepared to try and manage the situation.''\n  Time is running out. We are going to have as a consequence of the \ncompromise reached between the Biden-Levin resolution and the Warner \nresolution, now known as the ``Levin-Warner whoever else is attached to \nit'' resolution--we are going to have for the first time a full-blown \ndebate in the Senate.\n  I hope the administration will be listening.

Mr. President, I would like to make a few brief comments \nthis morning on the Warner resolution and the negotiations that went on \nyesterday, led by Senator Levin, to deal with Iraq.\n  Three weeks ago before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \nSecretary Rice presented the President's plan for Iraq. The Presiding \nOfficer, among others, was there. Its main feature was to send more \nAmerican troops into Baghdad, in the middle of a sectarian war, in the \nmiddle of a city of over 6 million people.\n  The reaction to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from \nRepublicans and Democrats alike ranged from profound skepticism to \noutright opposition. That pretty much reflected the reaction across the \ncountry.\n  Consequently, Senators Hagel, Levin, Snowe, and I wrote a resolution \nto give Senators a way to vote their voices, vote what they had said. \nWe believe, the four of us, and I know the Presiding Officer does, as \nwell, that the quickest, most effective way to get the President to \nchange his course is to demonstrate to him that his policy has little \nor no support in this Senate, in our committee, or, quite frankly, \nacross the country.\n  After we introduced our resolution, Senator Warner came forward with \nhis resolution. The bottom line of the resolution is essentially the \nsame, and it was: Don't send more American troops into the middle of a \ncivil war.\n  There was one critical difference between the Biden-Levin and the \nWarner amendment. Senator Warner's resolution, in one paragraph, left \nopen, I think unintentionally, the possibility of increasing the \noverall number of American troops in Iraq--just not in Baghdad. So from \nour perspective it wasn't enough to say don't go into Baghdad with more \ntroops; we wanted to say don't raise the number of troops, as well.\n  The provision in the Warner amendment that allowed for that, if read \nby the President the way he would want to read it, I believe, would \nhave allowed an increase in troops. We believe very strongly--Senator \nLevin, myself, Hagel, Snowe--that would send the wrong message. We \nought to be drawing down in Iraq, not ramping up. We ought to be \nredeploying, not deploying into Baghdad. We should make it clear to the \nIraqi leaders that they have to begin to make the hard compromises \nnecessary for a political solution.\n  A political solution everyone virtually agrees on is the precondition \nfor anything positive happening in Iraq. Now, I make it clear, I and \neveryone else in this Senate knows that it is not an easy thing for the \nIraqi leadership to do, but it is absolutely essential.\n  So we approached Senator Warner several times to try to work out the \ndifference between the Biden and the Warner resolutions. I am very \npleased that last night, through the leadership of Senator Warner and \nSenator Levin, we succeeded in doing just that. The language Senator \nWarner removed from his resolution removed the possibility that it can \nbe read as calling for more troops in Iraq.\n  With that change, I am very pleased to join Senator Levin, now known \nas the Levin-Warner resolution, as a cosponsor of that resolution. For \nmy intent, at the outset when I first spoke out about the President's \nplanned surge of American forces in Iraq, when I spoke out before the \nnew year, I made it clear that my purpose was to build bipartisan \nopposition to his plan because that was the best way to get him to \nreconsider. That is exactly what this compromise does.\n  Now we have a real opportunity for the Senate to speak clearly. Every \nSenator will have a chance to vote on whether he or she supports or \ndisagrees with the President's plan to send more troops into the middle \nof a civil war. If the President does not listen to the majority of the \nCongress--and I expect the majority of Congress will vote for our \nresolution--if he does not respond to a majority of the Congress and a\n\n[[Page S1474]]\n\nmajority of the American people, we will have to look for other ways to \nchange his policy. But this is a very important first step.\n  Also, I would like to take a moment to present what I believe are the \nprincipal findings of our 4 weeks of hearings, over 50 hours, if I am \nnot mistaken, of hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to talk about the \nhealth care proposals President Bush mentioned in his State of the \nUnion Address last Tuesday. For too long, our working families and our \nbusinesses have really struggled with rising costs and shrinking \naccess, and Washington, DC, has virtually ignored that health care \ncrisis.\n  Now, with Democrats in control of Congress, the President is finally \nbringing some ideas to the table and saying he wants to be part of the \nsolution. Well, I want to thank him for joining the debate, and I hope \nhe is serious about working with us to address the challenges that have \nonly gotten worse over the past 7 years. There may well be valuable \nideas in his proposals. I want to get more details than we heard in \njust the State of the Union Address because there may be areas on which \nwe can agree.\n  However, I have to say, from what I have seen of the President's plan \nso far, I do have some serious concerns that his initiatives will \nundermine the employer-based health insurance system; may push people \ninto the risky and expensive individual insurance market; may fail to \nprovide coverage for our most vulnerable; and may divert funds for the \nhealth care safety net to experimental programs.\n  My first concern is that the President's proposal will jeopardize the \nemployer-based health insurance system. The most stable form of health \ninsurance for America's working families today is through their \nemployers. Mr. President, 155 million Americans receive health \ninsurance today from their employers.\n  One of the primary reasons why employers offer health insurance to \ntheir workers is because those benefits are\n\n[[Page S1475]]\n\nexcluded from taxable income. But the President's proposal, as I hear \nit, would take away that incentive by putting all forms of health \ninsurance on an equal playing field. Even if employers choose not to \ndrop health care coverage, they may be forced to do so in the future as \nthe healthiest employees drop out of their employers' plans. If \ninsurance becomes unaffordable, employers may be forced to stop \noffering health care benefits. I think many of my colleagues agree with \nme that we should be strengthening the employer-based health insurance \nsystem, not taking steps that will jeopardize it.\n  Secondly, I am very concerned that the President's proposal will push \npeople into the individual insurance market. Today, when workers cannot \nget coverage through their employer, they need to purchase health \ninsurance in the individual insurance market. But as any small \nbusinessman or self-employed woman will tell you, the individual \ninsurance market today is not a good alternative to employer-provided \ncoverage. In many States, insurers can cherry-pick applicants to avoid \nenrolling those with high health needs, or insurance companies can sell \ndifferent policies to high- or low-risk individuals. If you have a \nchronic disease such as diabetes--or even any health problem--good luck \ngetting reasonably priced, comprehensive coverage in the individual \nmarket today. Any proposal to increase access to health insurance \nshould support the ability of Americans to receive affordable and \ncomprehensive coverage, not force people into expensive, barebones \ninsurance plans.\n  Third, I am troubled that the President's proposal will not increase \naccess to health insurance for the uninsured. We have 46 million \nuninsured men, women, and children in this country today. That is a \nstaggeringly high number, and those people face daily challenges trying \nto avoid getting sick and going into debt when something unexpected \nhappens. Every day, I hear from people in my home State of Washington \nwho struggle to pay for their health care costs. Unfortunately, the \nPresident's proposal will not help those people because they do not pay \nenough money in taxes to benefit from this tax deduction he is \nproposing. That really makes me question whether the President's plan \nwill actually reduce the number of uninsured Americans.\n  Finally, I am very concerned that the President's plan will further \nchip away at our health care safety net because it would divert \ncritical Medicaid dollars into an experimental grant program. Now, we \ndo not have a lot of details yet, but it appears he is proposing to use \nMedicaid disproportionate share hospital payments to give States the \nability to experiment with health care reform. Those DSH payments keep \nthe doors of our public hospitals open. Public hospitals are the \nfoundations of our communities. They not only provide emergency care, \nbut they train our doctors, they support rural health care, and they \nare the first lines of defense against pandemic flu or bioterror \nattacks. I am very concerned that his proposal could seriously \njeopardize my State's Medicaid funds and, therefore, undermine those \ncritical services.\n  I want to give an example of how these proposals could exacerbate the \nworst parts of our health insurance system.\n  Last week, I received a letter from my constituents Alice and Michael \nCounts. They live in Vancouver, WA. Their son Wesley was diagnosed with \na kidney condition at age 16. Their family's personal health insurance \ninsisted that his kidney disease was preexisting, and the insurer \nrefused to pay for the medical tests that diagnosed his condition. His \nparents appealed to our insurance commissioner, and they won, but the \ninsurer raised its rates far beyond the reach of a self-employed \nindividual. So later, when Wesley was going through dialysis and a \nkidney transplant, his employer dropped insurance coverage because it \nhad become too costly.\n  Throughout all these medical and financial ups and downs, Wesley has \nworked and has now graduated from Clark College. Thankfully, his \nparents have been able to help him navigate a health care system that \nfailed him.\n  Wesley's parents wrote to me, and they said:\n\n       We would rather pay higher taxes that give everyone \n     affordable health care than live with the fear of losing \n     everything through catastrophic illness.\n\n  Wesley's story shows just how risky the individual market is and how \npeople with serious health problems can be severely affected when an \nemployer is forced to drop coverage. No patient--no one--should have to \nlive in fear that their next dialysis treatment will not be covered by \ninsurance.\n\n  What Wesley deserves--and what all Americans deserve--is access to \naffordable, dependable, comprehensive health care. The President's plan \ndoes not guarantee that. It does not even come close. It just makes the \nhealth insurance market more unstable and more risky and leaves more \npeople like Wesley vulnerable. He deserves better than that. I think \nall Americans do.\n  So, as I said at the beginning of my statement, I welcome the \nPresident's attention to the health care crisis we are facing in this \ncountry. Last year, on the Senate floor we devoted 3 days--3 days--to \nhealth care. The President probably spent even less time talking about \nhealth care. So this is an improvement. We desperately need a serious \nand a very thoughtful debate about how we increase access to health \ninsurance.\n  My colleagues and I have put forward a number of good ideas about how \nto increase access to health care. One of the first things we can do is \nreauthorize and strengthen the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram--that is the SCHIP program--that provides quality health care \nto millions of uninsured children. Congress should give States the \nfunding and the flexibility to cover more of our kids.\n  Secondly, we have to fund community health centers so they can \ncontinue to provide quality health care to our uninsured.\n  Third, I agree with the President, we should help States devise new \nways to increase access to health care. My home State of Washington, \nlike a lot of States, is working on innovative initiatives to expand \ncoverage. But we can accomplish this in ways that do not chip away at \nthe foundation of our public hospitals.\n  Finally, we can expand health insurance for small businesses and the \nself-employed by creating Federal and State catastrophic cost pools in \nways that will help us lower costs and still protect our patients.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Kennedy and Chairman Baucus \nand my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and the President on real \nhealth care reform. There are people like Wesley across the country in \nevery one of our States who are crying out for change, and we owe it to \nthem, in this body, to finally make the progress that is long overdue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thankfully, his \nparents have been able to help him navigate a health care system that \nfailed him.\n  Wesley's parents wrote to me, and they said:\n\n       We would rather pay higher taxes that give everyone \n     affordable health care than live with the fear of losing \n     everything through catastrophic illness.\n\n  Wesley's story shows just how risky the individual market is and how \npeople with serious health problems can be severely affected when an \nemployer is forced to drop coverage. No patient--no one--should have to \nlive in fear that their next dialysis treatment will not be covered by \ninsurance.\n\n  What Wesley deserves--and what all Americans deserve--is access to \naffordable, dependable, comprehensive health care. The President's plan \ndoes not guarantee that. It does not even come close. It just makes the \nhealth insurance market more unstable and more risky and leaves more \npeople like Wesley vulnerable. He deserves better than that. I think \nall Americans do.\n  So, as I said at the beginning of my statement, I welcome the \nPresident's attention to the health care crisis we are facing in this \ncountry. Last year, on the Senate floor we devoted 3 days--3 days--to \nhealth care. The President probably spent even less time talking about \nhealth care. So this is an improvement. We desperately need a serious \nand a very thoughtful debate about how we increase access to health \ninsurance.\n  My colleagues and I have put forward a number of good ideas about how \nto increase access to health care. One of the first things we can do is \nreauthorize and strengthen the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram--that is the SCHIP program--that provides quality health care \nto millions of uninsured children. Congress should give States the \nfunding and the flexibility to cover more of our kids.\n  Secondly, we have to fund community health centers so they can \ncontinue to provide quality health care to our uninsured.\n  Third, I agree with the President, we should help States devise new \nways to increase access to health care. My home State of Washington, \nlike a lot of States, is working on innovative initiatives to expand \ncoverage. But we can accomplish this in ways that do not chip away at \nthe foundation of our public hospitals.\n  Finally, we can expand health insurance for small businesses and the \nself-employed by creating Federal and State catastrophic cost pools in \nways that will help us lower costs and still protect our patients.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Kennedy and Chairman Baucus \nand my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and the President on real \nhealth care reform. There are people like Wesley across the country in \nevery one of our States who are crying out for change, and we owe it to \nthem, in this body, to finally make the progress that is long overdue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss the \npowers of Congress under the Constitution to impose conditions on the \nfunds appropriated by Congress, conditions on the President of the \nUnited States in carrying out his responsibilities as Commander in \nChief. This, of course, is a major subject confronting the United \nStates at this time as to what our continuing policy should be in Iraq, \nand there is considerable controversy as to what that policy should be.\n  The President has come forward with the proposal to add 21,500 troops \nin Iraq.\n  That has been questioned in many quarters in the Congress of the \nUnited States, both the Senate and the House of Representatives, and by \nthe American people. The election results last November were generally \nregarded as a repudiation of our activities in Iraq. The military \npersonnel who have come forward to testify in recent days before the \nArmed Services Committee and the witnesses before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee have a similar view that major mistakes have been made in \nIraq. But there is also a generalized consensus that once there, even \nthough we found no weapons of mass destruction--had we known Saddam did \nnot have weapons of mass destruction, it is doubtful Congress would \nhave authorized the use of force--we cannot pull out and leave Iraq \ndestabilized. The question is, how to do it.\n\n[[Page S1476]]\n\n  The day before yesterday, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on \nthe power of Congress to stop war. The title of the hearing was \n``Exercising Congress's Constitutional Power to End a War.'' At that \ntime I raised the question, respectfully, with the President, who has \nstated that he is the decider--he stated that quite a number of times--\nI raised the contention that he is not the sole decider, that the \nCongress of the United States has considerable authority on what will \nbe done in the conduct of the war. There is no doubt that Congress \ncannot micromanage the war. But it is worth noting historically the \nmany occasions where Congress has appropriated funds or taken action \nconditioned on the President following the instructions, following the \nwill of the Congress. There was not sufficient time at the hearing the \nday before yesterday to go into detail on these subjects. That is why I \nhave decided to come to the floor at the present time and amplify the \nviews which I expressed at that time, to review the long line of \nprecedents where the Congress has imposed conditions on how the \nPresident spends appropriated funds for military purposes under his \nCommander in Chief responsibilities and the many situations where the \nCongress has cut off funding.\n  When the Congress acceded to the request of President Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt, in 1940, for a peacetime draft, it was on the condition that \nno draftees be stationed outside of the Western Hemisphere. When the \nCongress appropriated funds for reconstruction following the Civil War, \nthe Congress limited the Presidential authority saying that the orders \nof the President and the Secretary of War to the army should be given \nonly through General Grant and that General Grant should not be \nrelieved, removed, or transferred from Washington without the previous \napproval of the Senate. That is going fairly far in the management of a \nmilitary operation and might even be characterized as micromanagement, \nbut that is what was done.\n  During the administration of Theodore Roosevelt, Congress conditioned \nappropriations on a minimum of 8 percent of the detachments aboard \nnaval vessels, being Marines. There, again, a fairly extensive \nincursion into what you would call command responsibilities. Again, it \nmight be characterized as micromanagement.\n  The United States fought what has been characterized as a Quasi-War \nwith France in the latter part of the 18th century. In that war, \nCongress limited both the kind of force the President could use--only \nthe Navy, nothing more--and the areas in which he could use it, our \ncoastal waters first and then on the high seas. The Congress authorized \nthe seizure of French vessels traveling to French ports, and then the \nmilitary seized French vessels coming out of French ports. And that \ncase went to the Supreme Court of the United States. And in an 1804 \ndecision in the case captioned Little v. Barreme, the Supreme Court \nfound that Congress had authorized only seizure of vessels traveling to \nFrench courts, not from French ports. As I review that 200 years later, \nit seems like a very curious limitation, that the power would be to \nseize vessels going to France but not coming from France, but that was \nthe specificity of the authorization of the Congress, which was upheld \nin the legal challenge by the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  There is unanimity that Congress would not cut off funds which could \nin any way threaten the security or safety of U.S. troops. No doubt \nabout that. And there has been very careful articulation that where \nthere has been disagreement with administration policy, there has \nalways been unanimous support for our troops. But it is worth noting \nthe many historical precedents where Congress has cut off funding for \nmilitary operations.\n  In Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos in 1973, at the close of the Vietnam \nwar, Congress, with a veto-proof supermajority, cut off all funds, \nincluding preexisting appropriations, for combat activities in \nCambodia, Laos, North Vietnam, and South Vietnam after August 15 of \n1973. Then in 1974, Congress set a personnel ceiling of 4,000 Americans \nin Vietnam, 6 months after enactment, and 3,000 Americans within 1 \nyear, which is a precedent for congressional conditions on a reduction \nin force so that there is advance notice to the administration what the \ncongressional direction is, so many troops out by such-and-such a date, \nso many by another date, so there is no doubt that the troops which \nremain will be adequately taken care of in terms of the necessities for \ncarrying out their function in a safe way.\n  In 1976, Congress, with respect to Angola, provided that there would \nbe no assistance of any kind provided to conduct military or \nparamilitary actions in Angola unless expressly authorized by Congress. \nIn Nicaragua in 1984, Congress provided that there would be no funds \navailable to support military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua.\n  In Somalia in 1993, Congress provided that no funds appropriated may \nbe used for the continued presence in Somalia of United States military \npersonnel after September 30, 1994. And in Rwanda in 1994, Congress \nprovided that no funds are available for U.S. military participation in \nor around Rwanda after October 7, 1994 except to protect the lives of \nU.S. citizens. In 2000, with respect to Colombia, Congress capped at \n500 the number of troops in Colombia. During the Barbary wars, Congress \nenacted legislation authorizing only limited military action against \nthe Barbary powers. In the slave trade in 1819, Congress legislated \nthat even there, there were specific descriptions as to location and \nmission. In 1878, Congress passed, as part of an appropriations bill, \nthe Posse Comitatus Act, which restricted the President's ability to \nuse the military for police action of the United States, and they went \nso far as to impose criminal penalties on the troops themselves.\n\n  There are substantial limitations present in congressional action \nwith Vietnam in the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. The war powers imposed \nlimitations on the President. It should be noted that the President has \nnever agreed to the limitations, but the reporting requirements under \nthe War Powers Act have been complied with. And both in the first Iraq \nwar in 1991 and the so-called second Iraq war of 2002, and in the \nauthorization as to Afghanistan in 2001, there are restrictions.\n  It continues to be my hope that there will be an accommodation \nbetween the President and the plans he proposes to undertake and the \nCongress. It has been very healthy to have the kind of analysis and \ndebate which has taken place in committee and on the floor of the \nSenate and beyond, in the cloakrooms and in the hallways. That is the \ntopic of the day. As we have taken a look at other issues which we are \nfacing, there is very little oxygen in Washington for anything but what \nwe are going to be doing in Iraq. And those who say it is unhealthy or \nit weakens the United States in the world view or it undercuts the \nmorale of the troops in Iraq, I believe the conventional wisdom is, the \nconsensus is that notwithstanding those kind of concerns, that that is \nthe democratic process. That is the price we pay in a democracy.\n  At the hearing the day before yesterday in the Judiciary Committee, I \ncited polls where the military themselves, those participating in Iraq, \nhave substantial questions about the wisdom of what is going on, I \nthink it was 42 percent, disagree with the conduct of the war in Iraq. \nSo it is a healthy sign that it is a part of the price of democracy.\n  I was interested to note the testimony of former Secretary of State \nKissinger yesterday before the Foreign Relations Committee, saying he \nbelieved a consensus would emerge. And certainly, the United States is \nstronger when we do have unity between the Congress, under Article I, \nand the President, under Article II. I have been pleased to see the \nPresident consult with the Congress. I attended one meeting a few weeks \nago, presided over by the President, which was bipartisan, about a \ndozen Senators, both Democrats and Republicans, and a second meeting \nwith the National Security Council, Stephen Hadley, 10 Senators, all of \nwhom on that occasion were Republicans. And the President has scheduled \na meeting with Republican Senators tomorrow afternoon, where obviously \nIraq will be the topic of the day. I have said publicly that the \nproposal that makes a lot of sense to me is the one that has been \ndiscussed by quite a number of military experts, which would set a time \nschedule, give notice to the Iraqis that at some point\n\n[[Page S1477]]\n\nthe U.S. forces would retreat to the perimeters of Baghdad, and that \nthe Iraqis would be called upon to meet the two conditions as specified \nvery forcefully by the President in the State of the Union speech: that \nthe Iraqis would be responsible for ending sectarian violence and \nresponsible for securing Baghdad, and that American troops would \nremain.\n\n  My view is that those are the two conditions the President set down. \nThen the plan which has been considered very broadly would leave the \nAmerican troops in Iraq to guard the infrastructure, protect the \noilfields, and give training and support to the Iraqis. But even the \nparade of military witnesses who testified before Congress has said \nthat the Iraqis are much more likely to take action to protect \nthemselves when they don't rely upon the United States to do so. It is \na matter of human nature. If we are going to undertake the burdens for \nthe Iraqis, why should they undertake those burdens?\n  In considering the deployment of 21,500 additional personnel, I have \nbeen very skeptical and have said on the record that I could not \nsupport that because the Iraqis do not appear, from all indications, to \nhave either the capacity or the will to carry out their commitments if \nthose additional forces are to be committed. But I have said, also, \nthat I am going to await the debate on the floor of the Senate. I am \nnot sure we deserve the title of the ``world's greatest deliberative \nbody,'' but that is the standard we strive to meet. Before I am \nprepared to decide which way to vote, yea or nay, on any of the \nresolutions, I want to be part of that deliberative process, join in \nthe discussion, and raise questions.\n  It is my hope that before that time comes, there will be further \ndiscussions, such as the one tomorrow afternoon with the President with \nRepublican Senators. There are discussions going on all the time. I \nwould like to see us meet the standard that former Secretary Kissinger \ntalked about yesterday and come to a consensus. But in the meantime, I \nbelieve the analysis that is being undertaken is very healthy. If there \nis a price to pay, it is a small price to pay for a democracy.\n  I believe in this discussion taking place in the United States we \nshow the world the strength of our institutions, not the weakness in \nthe United States by whatever disagreements there may be between the \nPresident and the Congress of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a memorandum of law be \nprinted in the Record which details the actions taken in the past by \nthe Congress to limit funding and the actions taken by the Congress to \ncondition funding and limit executive action.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  I. Utilizing the Power of the Purse\n\n       Congress has on several occasions used the power of the \n     purse in declining to fund certain military forces (thereby \n     preventing, reducing, or ending the U.S. military presence in \n     a given area) or in otherwise attaching strings to military \n     appropriations. See CRS Report, Congressional Restriction on \n     U.S. Military Operations in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Somalia, \n     and Kosovo: Funding and Non-Funding Approaches (2007); CRS \n     Report, Congressional Use of Funding Cutoffs Since 1970 \n     Involving U.S. Military Forces and Overseas Deployments 1-3, \n     5-6 (2001) (hereafter ``CRS Report 2001''). Several examples \n     follow:\n       Marines on Naval Vessels. During Teddy Roosevelt's \n     administration, ``Congress conditioned appropriations on a \n     minimum of eight percent of detachments aboard naval vessels \n     being marines.''

In 1973, at the close of the \n     Vietnam War, Congress--with a veto-proof supermajority--cut \n     off all funds (including preexisting appropriations) for \n     combat activities in Cambodia, Laos, North Vietnam, and South \n     Vietnam after August 15, 1973. Pub. L. 93-50 (Jul. 1, 1973). \n     Then, in 1974, Congress set a ``personnel ceiling of 4,000 \n     Americans in Vietnam 6 months after enactment and 3,000 \n     Americans within one year.'' CRS Report 2001 at 2; see Pub. \n     L. 93-559, Sec. 38(f)(1) (Dec. 30, 1974).\n       Angola. In 1976, Congress prohibited intervention in \n     Angola: ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no \n     assistance of any kind may be provided . . . to conduct \n     military or paramilitary operations in Angola unless and \n     until the Congress expressly authorizes such assistance[.]'' \n     Clark Amendment, Pub. L. 94-329, Sec. 404, 90 Stat. 729, 757-\n     58 (1976).\n       Nicaragua. In 1984, Congress provided that, during FY1985, \n     ``no funds available to . . . any . . . agency or entity of \n     the United States involved in intelligence activities'' may \n     be used to support ``military or paramilitary operations in \n     Nicaragua.'' Pub. L. 98-473, Sec. 8066(a).\n       Somalia. In 1993, although Congress ``approved the use of \n     U.S. Armed Forces for certain purposes, including combat \n     forces in a security role to protect United Nations units in \n     Somalia,'' it cut off funding after March 31, 1994, except \n     for limited personnel. CRS Report 2001, at 2-3; see Pub. L. \n     103-139; see also Pub. L. 103-335 (Sept. 30, 1994) (``None of \n     the funds appropriated by this Act may be used for the \n     continuous presence in Somalia of United States military \n     personnel after September 30, 1994.'').\n       Rwanda. In 1994, Congress limited an appropriations bill \n     with the proviso that ``no funds provided in this Act are \n     available for United States military participation to \n     continue Operation Support Hope in or around Rwanda after \n     October 7, 1994, expect for any action that is necessary to \n     protect the lives of United States citizens.'' Pub. L. 103-\n     335, tit. X.\n       Colombia. In 2000, Congress capped at 500 the number of \n     troops in Colombia: ``[N]one of the funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by this or any other Act . . . may \n     be available for . . . the assignment of any United States \n     military personnel for temporary or permanent duty in \n     Colombia in connection with support of Plan Colombia if that \n     assignment would cause the number of United States military \n     personnel so assigned in Colombia to exceed 500.'' Pub. L. \n     106-246, 3204(b)(1)(A).\n       These examples represent congressional action to ``re-\n     deploy'' or to prevent troops from being dispatched in the \n     first place.\n\n      II. Non-Spending Methods of Limiting or Defining Involvement\n\n       On other occasions, Congress has utilized non-spending \n     means to limit and define U.S. military action--e.g., by \n     authorizing military involvement only for specified purposes \n     or places, by rescinding a prior authorization, or by \n     prospectively curtailing authorization.\n       Quasi-War With France. At the end of the 18th Century, \n     Congress passed a number of statutes authorizing limited \n     military engagement with France in the so-called ``Quasi \n     War.'' See Louis Fisher, Presidential War Power 24 (2d ed. \n     2004). In 1798, for example, Congress authorized the \n     President ``to instruct and direct the commanders of the \n     armed vessels belonging to the United States'' to seize \n     French vessels that were disrupting United States commerce. 1 \n     Stat. 561 (May 28, 1798). In particular, ``in the war with \n     France, Congress limited both the kind of force the President \n     could use (the navy only) and the areas where he could use it \n     (our coastal waters, at first, and then the high seas).'' The \n     Constitution Project, Deciding to Use Force Abroad: War \n     Powers in a System of Checks and Balances 15 (2005). Indeed, \n     in Little v. Barreme, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 170, 179 (1804), the \n     Supreme Court found that Congress had only authorized seizure \n     of vessels traveling to French ports, not from French ports.\n       Barbary Wars. During the Barbary Wars, Congress enacted \n     several measures authorizing limited military action against \n     the Barbary powers. See, e.g., 3 Stat. 230 (1815) (U.S. \n     vessels authorized to seize ``vessels, goods and effects of \n     or belonging to the Dey of Algiers''); 2 Stat. 291 (1804) \n     (expressing support for ``warlike operations against the \n     regency of Tripoli, or any other of the Barbary powers''); \n     see also Fisher, supra at 35-36 & n.92.\n       Slave Trade. In 1819, Congress authorized the President to \n     use the Navy to intercept slave ships along the coasts of the \n     United States and Africa. 3 Stat. 532. In this case, Congress \n     provided a relatively specific description of location and \n     mission.\n       Reconstruction. According to one scholar, ``by the use of . \n     . . riders on military appropriations, congressional \n     influence predominated in Reconstruction; occupation armies \n     implementing Reconstruction policies in the Southern states \n     got their directions from such riders.'' Tiefer, supra at \n     302. For example, in 1867, Congress attached a rider on \n     military appropriations providing that the ``orders of the \n     president and secretary of war to the army should only be \n     given through the general of the army (Gen. Grant); [and] \n     that the latter should not be relieved, removed or \n     transferred from Washington without the previous approval of \n     the senate.''

Lalor ed., \n     1899), available at http://oll.libertyfund.org/ToC/0216-\n03.php.\n       In 1878, Congress passed, as part of an appropriations \n     bill, the Posse Comitatus Act, ch. 263, Sec. 15, 20 Stat 145, \n     152 (codified at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1385), which restricted the \n     President's ability to use the military for police actions in \n     the United States by imposing criminal penalties on the \n     troops themselves. (It is also in part a spending \n     restriction, providing that ``no money appropriated by this \n     act shall be used to pay any of the expenses incurred in the \n     employment of any troops in violation of this section.'' Id.) \n     The PCA was largely aimed at preventing the federal military \n     from overseeing elections in the former Confederacy.\n       FDR's Peacetime Draft. In 1940, Congress assented to FDR's \n     desire for a peacetime draft, but only on the condition that \n     no draftees be stationed outside the Western hemisphere. \n     Selective Training and Service\n\n[[Page S1478]]\n\n     Act, Pub. L. 76-783, ch. 720, Sec. 3(e); see Tiefer, supra at \n     303.\n       Vietnam. In 1964, with the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, Congress \n     authorized the President ``to take all necessary steps, \n     including the use of armed force, to assist any member or \n     protocol state of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense \n     Treaty requesting assistance in defense of its freedom.'' \n     Pub. L. 88-408, Sec. 2, 78 Stat. 384, 384. However, in 1971, \n     Congress repealed the Tonkin Gulf Resolution. Pub. L. 91-672, \n     Sec. 12, 84 Stat. 2055 (Jan. 12, 1971). Later that year \n     Congress called for a ``prompt and orderly withdrawal'' from \n     Indochina at the ``earliest practicable date.'' Pub. L. 92-\n     129, Sec. 401 (Sept. 28, 1971).\n       War Powers Resolution. In 1973, in response to the Vietnam \n     War and over President Nixon's veto, Congress passed the War \n     Powers Resolution (WPR), Pub. L. 93-148, 87 Stat. 555 \n     (1973), 50 U.S.C. Sec. 1541, et seq. The WPR requires the \n     President to consult with Congress before sending troops \n     into hostilities (and within 48 hours after commencing \n     hostilities, entering another nation equipped for combat, \n     or increasing substantially the number of troops in a \n     foreign nation). Also the WPR requires the President to \n     pull out after 60 days--absent a congressional \n     authorization of hostilities, congressional extension, or \n     inability of Congress to meet due to attack. Further, the \n     WPR ``permits Congress to terminate an unauthorized \n     presidential use of military force at any time by \n     concurrent resolution.'' John C. Yoo, The Continuation of \n     Politics By Other Means: The Original Understanding of War \n     Powers, 84 Cal. L. Rev. 167, 181 (1996).\n       First Iraq War. In 1991, Congress gave the President \n     authority to ``use United States Armed Forces pursuant to \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 678 (1990) in \n     order to achieve implementation of Security Counsel \n     Resolutions [regarding the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait],'' but \n     must first attempt diplomatic measures.

Although \n     this example is far more open-ended than the others, there \n     are still restrictions imposed on the use of force.\n       Second Iraq War. In 2002, Congress authorized the President \n     to ``use the Armed Forces of the United States as he \n     determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to . . . \n     (1) defend the national security of the United States against \n     the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and (2) enforce all \n     relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions \n     regarding Iraq.''

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1475-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1475-S1478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      POWER OF CONGRESS TO IMPOSE CONDITIONS ON APPROPRIATED FUNDS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss the \npowers of Congress under the Constitution to impose conditions on the \nfunds appropriated by Congress, conditions on the President of the \nUnited States in carrying out his responsibilities as Commander in \nChief. This, of course, is a major subject confronting the United \nStates at this time as to what our continuing policy should be in Iraq, \nand there is considerable controversy as to what that policy should be.\n  The President has come forward with the proposal to add 21,500 troops \nin Iraq.\n  That has been questioned in many quarters in the Congress of the \nUnited States, both the Senate and the House of Representatives, and by \nthe American people. The election results last November were generally \nregarded as a repudiation of our activities in Iraq. The military \npersonnel who have come forward to testify in recent days before the \nArmed Services Committee and the witnesses before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee have a similar view that major mistakes have been made in \nIraq. But there is also a generalized consensus that once there, even \nthough we found no weapons of mass destruction--had we known Saddam did \nnot have weapons of mass destruction, it is doubtful Congress would \nhave authorized the use of force--we cannot pull out and leave Iraq \ndestabilized. The question is, how to do it.\n\n[[Page S1476]]\n\n  The day before yesterday, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on \nthe power of Congress to stop war. The title of the hearing was \n``Exercising Congress's Constitutional Power to End a War.'' At that \ntime I raised the question, respectfully, with the President, who has \nstated that he is the decider--he stated that quite a number of times--\nI raised the contention that he is not the sole decider, that the \nCongress of the United States has considerable authority on what will \nbe done in the conduct of the war. There is no doubt that Congress \ncannot micromanage the war. But it is worth noting historically the \nmany occasions where Congress has appropriated funds or taken action \nconditioned on the President following the instructions, following the \nwill of the Congress. There was not sufficient time at the hearing the \nday before yesterday to go into detail on these subjects. That is why I \nhave decided to come to the floor at the present time and amplify the \nviews which I expressed at that time, to review the long line of \nprecedents where the Congress has imposed conditions on how the \nPresident spends appropriated funds for military purposes under his \nCommander in Chief responsibilities and the many situations where the \nCongress has cut off funding.\n  When the Congress acceded to the request of President Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt, in 1940, for a peacetime draft, it was on the condition that \nno draftees be stationed outside of the Western Hemisphere. When the \nCongress appropriated funds for reconstruction following the Civil War, \nthe Congress limited the Presidential authority saying that the orders \nof the President and the Secretary of War to the army should be given \nonly through General Grant and that General Grant should not be \nrelieved, removed, or transferred from Washington without the previous \napproval of the Senate. That is going fairly far in the management of a \nmilitary operation and might even be characterized as micromanagement, \nbut that is what was done.\n  During the administration of Theodore Roosevelt, Congress conditioned \nappropriations on a minimum of 8 percent of the detachments aboard \nnaval vessels, being Marines. There, again, a fairly extensive \nincursion into what you would call command responsibilities. Again, it \nmight be characterized as micromanagement.\n  The United States fought what has been characterized as a Quasi-War \nwith France in the latter part of the 18th century. In that war, \nCongress limited both the kind of force the President could use--only \nthe Navy, nothing more--and the areas in which he could use it, our \ncoastal waters first and then on the high seas. The Congress authorized \nthe seizure of French vessels traveling to French ports, and then the \nmilitary seized French vessels coming out of French ports. And that \ncase went to the Supreme Court of the United States. And in an 1804 \ndecision in the case captioned Little v. Barreme, the Supreme Court \nfound that Congress had authorized only seizure of vessels traveling to \nFrench courts, not from French ports. As I review that 200 years later, \nit seems like a very curious limitation, that the power would be to \nseize vessels going to France but not coming from France, but that was \nthe specificity of the authorization of the Congress, which was upheld \nin the legal challenge by the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  There is unanimity that Congress would not cut off funds which could \nin any way threaten the security or safety of U.S. troops. No doubt \nabout that. And there has been very careful articulation that where \nthere has been disagreement with administration policy, there has \nalways been unanimous support for our troops. But it is worth noting \nthe many historical precedents where Congress has cut off funding for \nmilitary operations.\n  In Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos in 1973, at the close of the Vietnam \nwar, Congress, with a veto-proof supermajority, cut off all funds, \nincluding preexisting appropriations, for combat activities in \nCambodia, Laos, North Vietnam, and South Vietnam after August 15 of \n1973. Then in 1974, Congress set a personnel ceiling of 4,000 Americans \nin Vietnam, 6 months after enactment, and 3,000 Americans within 1 \nyear, which is a precedent for congressional conditions on a reduction \nin force so that there is advance notice to the administration what the \ncongressional direction is, so many troops out by such-and-such a date, \nso many by another date, so there is no doubt that the troops which \nremain will be adequately taken care of in terms of the necessities for \ncarrying out their function in a safe way.\n  In 1976, Congress, with respect to Angola, provided that there would \nbe no assistance of any kind provided to conduct military or \nparamilitary actions in Angola unless expressly authorized by Congress. \nIn Nicaragua in 1984, Congress provided that there would be no funds \navailable to support military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua.\n  In Somalia in 1993, Congress provided that no funds appropriated may \nbe used for the continued presence in Somalia of United States military \npersonnel after September 30, 1994. And in Rwanda in 1994, Congress \nprovided that no funds are available for U.S. military participation in \nor around Rwanda after October 7, 1994 except to protect the lives of \nU.S. citizens. In 2000, with respect to Colombia, Congress capped at \n500 the number of troops in Colombia. During the Barbary wars, Congress \nenacted legislation authorizing only limited military action against \nthe Barbary powers. In the slave trade in 1819, Congress legislated \nthat even there, there were specific descriptions as to location and \nmission. In 1878, Congress passed, as part of an appropriations bill, \nthe Posse Comitatus Act, which restricted the President's ability to \nuse the military for police action of the United States, and they went \nso far as to impose criminal penalties on the troops themselves.\n\n  There are substantial limitations present in congressional action \nwith Vietnam in the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. The war powers imposed \nlimitations on the President. It should be noted that the President has \nnever agreed to the limitations, but the reporting requirements under \nthe War Powers Act have been complied with. And both in the first Iraq \nwar in 1991 and the so-called second Iraq war of 2002, and in the \nauthorization as to Afghanistan in 2001, there are restrictions.\n  It continues to be my hope that there will be an accommodation \nbetween the President and the plans he proposes to undertake and the \nCongress. It has been very healthy to have the kind of analysis and \ndebate which has taken place in committee and on the floor of the \nSenate and beyond, in the cloakrooms and in the hallways. That is the \ntopic of the day. As we have taken a look at other issues which we are \nfacing, there is very little oxygen in Washington for anything but what \nwe are going to be doing in Iraq. And those who say it is unhealthy or \nit weakens the United States in the world view or it undercuts the \nmorale of the troops in Iraq, I believe the conventional wisdom is, the \nconsensus is that notwithstanding those kind of concerns, that that is \nthe democratic process. That is the price we pay in a democracy.\n  At the hearing the day before yesterday in the Judiciary Committee, I \ncited polls where the military themselves, those participating in Iraq, \nhave substantial questions about the wisdom of what is going on, I \nthink it was 42 percent, disagree with the conduct of the war in Iraq. \nSo it is a healthy sign that it is a part of the price of democracy.\n  I was interested to note the testimony of former Secretary of State \nKissinger yesterday before the Foreign Relations Committee, saying he \nbelieved a consensus would emerge. And certainly, the United States is \nstronger when we do have unity between the Congress, under Article I, \nand the President, under Article II. I have been pleased to see the \nPresident consult with the Congress. I attended one meeting a few weeks \nago, presided over by the President, which was bipartisan, about a \ndozen Senators, both Democrats and Republicans, and a second meeting \nwith the National Security Council, Stephen Hadley, 10 Senators, all of \nwhom on that occasion were Republicans. And the President has scheduled \na meeting with Republican Senators tomorrow afternoon, where obviously \nIraq will be the topic of the day. I have said publicly that the \nproposal that makes a lot of sense to me is the one that has been \ndiscussed by quite a number of military experts, which would set a time \nschedule, give notice to the Iraqis that at some point\n\n[[Page S1477]]\n\nthe U.S. forces would retreat to the perimeters of Baghdad, and that \nthe Iraqis would be called upon to meet the two conditions as specified \nvery forcefully by the President in the State of the Union speech: that \nthe Iraqis would be responsible for ending sectarian violence and \nresponsible for securing Baghdad, and that American troops would \nremain.\n\n  My view is that those are the two conditions the President set down. \nThen the plan which has been considered very broadly would leave the \nAmerican troops in Iraq to guard the infrastructure, protect the \noilfields, and give training and support to the Iraqis. But even the \nparade of military witnesses who testified before Congress has said \nthat the Iraqis are much more likely to take action to protect \nthemselves when they don't rely upon the United States to do so. It is \na matter of human nature. If we are going to undertake the burdens for \nthe Iraqis, why should they undertake those burdens?\n  In considering the deployment of 21,500 additional personnel, I have \nbeen very skeptical and have said on the record that I could not \nsupport that because the Iraqis do not appear, from all indications, to \nhave either the capacity or the will to carry out their commitments if \nthose additional forces are to be committed. But I have said, also, \nthat I am going to await the debate on the floor of the Senate. I am \nnot sure we deserve the title of the ``world's greatest deliberative \nbody,'' but that is the standard we strive to meet. Before I am \nprepared to decide which way to vote, yea or nay, on any of the \nresolutions, I want to be part of that deliberative process, join in \nthe discussion, and raise questions.\n  It is my hope that before that time comes, there will be further \ndiscussions, such as the one tomorrow afternoon with the President with \nRepublican Senators. There are discussions going on all the time. I \nwould like to see us meet the standard that former Secretary Kissinger \ntalked about yesterday and come to a consensus. But in the meantime, I \nbelieve the analysis that is being undertaken is very healthy. If there \nis a price to pay, it is a small price to pay for a democracy.\n  I believe in this discussion taking place in the United States we \nshow the world the strength of our institutions, not the weakness in \nthe United States by whatever disagreements there may be between the \nPresident and the Congress of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a memorandum of law be \nprinted in the Record which details the actions taken in the past by \nthe Congress to limit funding and the actions taken by the Congress to \ncondition funding and limit executive action.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  I. Utilizing the Power of the Purse\n\n       Congress has on several occasions used the power of the \n     purse in declining to fund certain military forces (thereby \n     preventing, reducing, or ending the U.S. military presence in \n     a given area) or in otherwise attaching strings to military \n     appropriations. See CRS Report, Congressional Restriction on \n     U.S. Military Operations in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Somalia, \n     and Kosovo: Funding and Non-Funding Approaches (2007); CRS \n     Report, Congressional Use of Funding Cutoffs Since 1970 \n     Involving U.S. Military Forces and Overseas Deployments 1-3, \n     5-6 (2001) (hereafter ``CRS Report 2001''). Several examples \n     follow:\n       Marines on Naval Vessels. During Teddy Roosevelt's \n     administration, ``Congress conditioned appropriations on a \n     minimum of eight percent of detachments aboard naval vessels \n     being marines.''

In 1973, at the close of the \n     Vietnam War, Congress--with a veto-proof supermajority--cut \n     off all funds (including preexisting appropriations) for \n     combat activities in Cambodia, Laos, North Vietnam, and South \n     Vietnam after August 15, 1973. Pub. L. 93-50 (Jul. 1, 1973). \n     Then, in 1974, Congress set a ``personnel ceiling of 4,000 \n     Americans in Vietnam 6 months after enactment and 3,000 \n     Americans within one year.'' CRS Report 2001 at 2; see Pub. \n     L. 93-559, Sec. 38(f)(1) (Dec. 30, 1974).\n       Angola. In 1976, Congress prohibited intervention in \n     Angola: ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no \n     assistance of any kind may be provided . . . to conduct \n     military or paramilitary operations in Angola unless and \n     until the Congress expressly authorizes such assistance[.]'' \n     Clark Amendment, Pub. L. 94-329, Sec. 404, 90 Stat. 729, 757-\n     58 (1976).\n       Nicaragua. In 1984, Congress provided that, during FY1985, \n     ``no funds available to . . . any . . . agency or entity of \n     the United States involved in intelligence activities'' may \n     be used to support ``military or paramilitary operations in \n     Nicaragua.'' Pub. L. 98-473, Sec. 8066(a).\n       Somalia. In 1993, although Congress ``approved the use of \n     U.S. Armed Forces for certain purposes, including combat \n     forces in a security role to protect United Nations units in \n     Somalia,'' it cut off funding after March 31, 1994, except \n     for limited personnel. CRS Report 2001, at 2-3; see Pub. L. \n     103-139; see also Pub. L. 103-335 (Sept. 30, 1994) (``None of \n     the funds appropriated by this Act may be used for the \n     continuous presence in Somalia of United States military \n     personnel after September 30, 1994.'').\n       Rwanda. In 1994, Congress limited an appropriations bill \n     with the proviso that ``no funds provided in this Act are \n     available for United States military participation to \n     continue Operation Support Hope in or around Rwanda after \n     October 7, 1994, expect for any action that is necessary to \n     protect the lives of United States citizens.'' Pub. L. 103-\n     335, tit. X.\n       Colombia. In 2000, Congress capped at 500 the number of \n     troops in Colombia: ``[N]one of the funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by this or any other Act . . . may \n     be available for . . . the assignment of any United States \n     military personnel for temporary or permanent duty in \n     Colombia in connection with support of Plan Colombia if that \n     assignment would cause the number of United States military \n     personnel so assigned in Colombia to exceed 500.'' Pub. L. \n     106-246, 3204(b)(1)(A).\n       These examples represent congressional action to ``re-\n     deploy'' or to prevent troops from being dispatched in the \n     first place.\n\n      II. Non-Spending Methods of Limiting or Defining Involvement\n\n       On other occasions, Congress has utilized non-spending \n     means to limit and define U.S. military action--e.g., by \n     authorizing military involvement only for specified purposes \n     or places, by rescinding a prior authorization, or by \n     prospectively curtailing authorization.\n       Quasi-War With France. At the end of the 18th Century, \n     Congress passed a number of statutes authorizing limited \n     military engagement with France in the so-called ``Quasi \n     War.'' See Louis Fisher, Presidential War Power 24 (2d ed. \n     2004). In 1798, for example, Congress authorized the \n     President ``to instruct and direct the commanders of the \n     armed vessels belonging to the United States'' to seize \n     French vessels that were disrupting United States commerce. 1 \n     Stat. 561 (May 28, 1798). In particular, ``in the war with \n     France, Congress limited both the kind of force the President \n     could use (the navy only) and the areas where he could use it \n     (our coastal waters, at first, and then the high seas).'' The \n     Constitution Project, Deciding to Use Force Abroad: War \n     Powers in a System of Checks and Balances 15 (2005). Indeed, \n     in Little v. Barreme, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 170, 179 (1804), the \n     Supreme Court found that Congress had only authorized seizure \n     of vessels traveling to French ports, not from French ports.\n       Barbary Wars. During the Barbary Wars, Congress enacted \n     several measures authorizing limited military action against \n     the Barbary powers. See, e.g., 3 Stat. 230 (1815) (U.S. \n     vessels authorized to seize ``vessels, goods and effects of \n     or belonging to the Dey of Algiers''); 2 Stat. 291 (1804) \n     (expressing support for ``warlike operations against the \n     regency of Tripoli, or any other of the Barbary powers''); \n     see also Fisher, supra at 35-36 & n.92.\n       Slave Trade. In 1819, Congress authorized the President to \n     use the Navy to intercept slave ships along the coasts of the \n     United States and Africa. 3 Stat. 532. In this case, Congress \n     provided a relatively specific description of location and \n     mission.\n       Reconstruction. According to one scholar, ``by the use of . \n     . . riders on military appropriations, congressional \n     influence predominated in Reconstruction; occupation armies \n     implementing Reconstruction policies in the Southern states \n     got their directions from such riders.'' Tiefer, supra at \n     302. For example, in 1867, Congress attached a rider on \n     military appropriations providing that the ``orders of the \n     president and secretary of war to the army should only be \n     given through the general of the army (Gen. Grant); [and] \n     that the latter should not be relieved, removed or \n     transferred from Washington without the previous approval of \n     the senate.'' Alexander Johnston, Riders (in U.S. History), \n     in III Cyclopedia of Political Science, Political Economy, \n     and of the Political History of the United States By the Best \n     American and European Authors, 147.7 (John J. Lalor ed., \n     1899), available at http://oll.libertyfund.org/ToC/0216-\n03.php.\n       In 1878, Congress passed, as part of an appropriations \n     bill, the Posse Comitatus Act, ch. 263, Sec. 15, 20 Stat 145, \n     152 (codified at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1385), which restricted the \n     President's ability to use the military for police actions in \n     the United States by imposing criminal penalties on the \n     troops themselves. (It is also in part a spending \n     restriction, providing that ``no money appropriated by this \n     act shall be used to pay any of the expenses incurred in the \n     employment of any troops in violation of this section.'' Id.) \n     The PCA was largely aimed at preventing the federal military \n     from overseeing elections in the former Confederacy.\n       FDR's Peacetime Draft. In 1940, Congress assented to FDR's \n     desire for a peacetime draft, but only on the condition that \n     no draftees be stationed outside the Western hemisphere. \n     Selective Training and Service\n\n[[Page S1478]]\n\n     Act, Pub. L. 76-783, ch. 720, Sec. 3(e); see Tiefer, supra at \n     303.\n       Vietnam. In 1964, with the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, Congress \n     authorized the President ``to take all necessary steps, \n     including the use of armed force, to assist any member or \n     protocol state of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense \n     Treaty requesting assistance in defense of its freedom.'' \n     Pub. L. 88-408, Sec. 2, 78 Stat. 384, 384. However, in 1971, \n     Congress repealed the Tonkin Gulf Resolution. Pub. L. 91-672, \n     Sec. 12, 84 Stat. 2055 (Jan. 12, 1971). Later that year \n     Congress called for a ``prompt and orderly withdrawal'' from \n     Indochina at the ``earliest practicable date.'' Pub. L. 92-\n     129, Sec. 401 (Sept. 28, 1971).\n       War Powers Resolution. In 1973, in response to the Vietnam \n     War and over President Nixon's veto, Congress passed the War \n     Powers Resolution (WPR), Pub. L. 93-148, 87 Stat. 555 \n     (1973), 50 U.S.C. Sec. 1541, et seq. The WPR requires the \n     President to consult with Congress before sending troops \n     into hostilities (and within 48 hours after commencing \n     hostilities, entering another nation equipped for combat, \n     or increasing substantially the number of troops in a \n     foreign nation). Also the WPR requires the President to \n     pull out after 60 days--absent a congressional \n     authorization of hostilities, congressional extension, or \n     inability of Congress to meet due to attack. Further, the \n     WPR ``permits Congress to terminate an unauthorized \n     presidential use of military force at any time by \n     concurrent resolution.'' John C. Yoo, The Continuation of \n     Politics By Other Means: The Original Understanding of War \n     Powers, 84 Cal. L. Rev. 167, 181 (1996).\n       First Iraq War. In 1991, Congress gave the President \n     authority to ``use United States Armed Forces pursuant to \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 678 (1990) in \n     order to achieve implementation of Security Counsel \n     Resolutions [regarding the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait],'' but \n     must first attempt diplomatic measures. Authorization for Use \n     of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution, Pub. L. 102-1, \n     Sec. 2(a), (b) (1991).\n       Afghanistan. In 2001, Congress provided by joint resolution \n     that ``the President is authorized to use all necessary and \n     appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or \n     persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or \n     aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, \n     2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to \n     prevent any future acts of international terrorism against \n     the United States by such nations, organizations or \n     persons.'' Authorization for Use of Military Force, Pub. L. \n     107-40, Sec. 2(a), 115 Stat. 224 (Sept. 18, 2001). Although \n     this example is far more open-ended than the others, there \n     are still restrictions imposed on the use of force.\n       Second Iraq War. In 2002, Congress authorized the President \n     to ``use the Armed Forces of the United States as he \n     determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to . . . \n     (1) defend the national security of the United States against \n     the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and (2) enforce all \n     relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions \n     regarding Iraq.''

The President was, however, required to \n     certify that diplomatic means are insufficient and that the \n     use of force will not impede the war on terrorism. Id. \n     Sec. 3(b).\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1478-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1478-S1480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NOMINATION OF GREGORY KENT FRIZZELL\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate very much the \nsenior Senator from Pennsylvania yielding to me. I know he is \ninterested in getting these quality judges confirmed, and votes are \ntaking place.\n  We have one coming up in a few minutes that happens to be for a close \npersonal friend of mine, a judge in Oklahoma, Greg Frizzell. I would \nlike to make a couple of comments.\n  First of all, we thought he would be confirmed before the end of last \nyear, and it didn't work out. There was bickering going on that had \nnothing to do with him but with other judges. Fortunately, over the \nlast few weeks, I have had a chance to talk to colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle.\n  I want to single out Senator Pat Leahy for being so generous with me \nand giving me time to talk about Judge Frizzell and why he should be \nconfirmed. He told me, after listening to this, he would be willing to \nput him on his top priority list. He didn't have to do it. He is a \nDemocrat and I am a Republican. So, again, I compliment Senator Pat \nLeahy for doing that for us and for justice in America.\n  This young man, Greg Frizzell, has a great family background. I \nremember when his daddy, Kent Frizzell, was in Kansas and served as \nattorney general for that State. Then he had better judgment and \ndecided to move from Kansas to Oklahoma. We became good friends many \nyears ago. Greg was very young at that time. He was raised in this \nfamily of public servants, people who served as his father had for such \na long period of time. I think his father is still at the University of \nTulsa Law School and has been for about 20 years and is doing great \nwork. That is the environment in which Greg Frizzell was raised. He has \nbeen a judge for a long time, and you would think you would hear some \nnegative things about him. But you don't hear negative things about \nthis guy. Even his political adversaries all agree that he is the \nquality and type of man who should be on the Federal bench.\n  Robert Sartin, a member of the Board of Governors, said:\n\n       Judge Frizzell is a man of extremely good character and \n     high integrity, with a deep sense of personal responsibility \n     toward his fellow man.\n\n  A fellow judge, Claire Egan, praised him. She talked about the \nurgency of this confirmation and that they actually only have three \njudges now on that bench doing the work of six judges.\n  One of the most highly respected senior Federal judges, Ralph \nThompson, who is in senior status in Oklahoma right now, praised Greg, \nsaying there is nobody out there who could be more qualified than Greg \nFrizzell for this particular appointment.\n  So it is neat that we are finally getting around to this. I apologize \nto Greg and his family for the uncertainty that is always there, even \nthough I never had any uncertainty. I knew he was going to be there.\n  Getting back again to all these different people, Joe Wolgemuth, a \nprominent attorney in Tulsa, recalls an incident where Judge Frizzell--\nhe has six kids, by the way--had work to do one night, and he went down \nand took his six kids with him and did his judicial work. Anybody who \ncan juggle six kids and do his job at the same time I know is qualified \nfor this job. I am thrilled that just in a matter of minutes we will be \nable to vote to confirm Judge Frizzell to the Northern District of \nOklahoma. He will be a great judge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                      Judge Gregory Kent Frizzell\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

I also \nnoted that the nominee was born in Wichita, KS, which is a good place \nto be born, because I was born there, too. It is sometimes the source \nof some levity.\n  When I was one of the assistant counsels to the Warren Commission, a \nman named Frances W. Adams, a prominent Wall Street lawyer, noted on my \nresume that I was born in Wichita. He said: Where was your mother on \nher way to at the time? When I say the birth place of Greg Frizzell, \nthe nominee, is Wichita, KS, I recollect my own birth place and \nrecollect the connection I had with his father being my high school \ndebating opponent many years ago.\n  While I have the floor, I know the time has been reserved to talk \nabout judges in just a few minutes.

I thank Senator Leahy, the Chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, for moving these nominations. It is very \nimportant. We have numerous judicial emergencies. We have other \nnominees awaiting action by the committee and by the full Senate.\n  Senator Leahy is moving with dispatch, which is appreciated, and it \nis also appreciated that the majority leader has listed these three \nnominees for action this morning.\n  In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Judge Gregory Kent Frizzell\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to follow up on the \ncomments made by my senior Senator, Mr. Inhofe, from Oklahoma, on the \nqualifications of Judge Gregory Frizzell. He has enumerated many of \nthose. This is a fine young man with impeccable character and \nintegrity. He is a living example of a life of service, not just in \nwhat he does as a judge in Oklahoma, but what he does in his community \nin Oklahoma. It has been a real pleasure to get to know him, to also \nwatch him as he went through the process of getting a unanimous vote \nout of the Judiciary Committee and having no significant questions \nraised about his judicial philosophy, integrity, character, background, \nor his qualifications. So it is with a great deal of pleasure that I \nlook forward to his vote today.\n\n  I might comment for a moment that he was capable of being confirmed \nin the last Congress, and there was no reason, no good reason why he \nwasn't, other than the answer: We are not going to approve any more \njudges in this Congress. That is the reason I was told by the now \nmajority leader that he would not be approved. There is no question as \nto his qualifications, but it should remind us again of the dangers of \npartisanship for party instead of partisanship for our country and for \nfuture generations.\n  I am very thankful to the Judiciary Committee chairman, Patrick Leahy \nfrom Vermont, for the speed and quickness with which he has brought \nthis to the floor. I thank him for that, and I look forward to working \nwith him with the same speed on any other judges the President might \nbring up and that the committee would put out.\n  It is my hope we can get beyond partisanship on judiciary nominees \nand get to the business of filling the significant number of voids or \nvacancies that are out there today and that are limiting justice for \npeople in this country. Justice delayed is justice denied. And a lack \nof available judges is denying justice to hundreds and thousands of \nAmericans every day. So the chairman of the Judiciary Committee has my \ncommitment as a member of the Judiciary Committee to help him in any \nway I can to move those.\n  It is a great honor that Greg Frizzell will sit as a Federal judge in \nthe northern district of Oklahoma, and it is my hope we will see many \nlike him fill the spots across this country.\n  With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will withhold.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1478-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1478-S1480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NOMINATION OF GREGORY KENT FRIZZELL\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate very much the \nsenior Senator from Pennsylvania yielding to me. I know he is \ninterested in getting these quality judges confirmed, and votes are \ntaking place.\n  We have one coming up in a few minutes that happens to be for a close \npersonal friend of mine, a judge in Oklahoma, Greg Frizzell. I would \nlike to make a couple of comments.\n  First of all, we thought he would be confirmed before the end of last \nyear, and it didn't work out. There was bickering going on that had \nnothing to do with him but with other judges. Fortunately, over the \nlast few weeks, I have had a chance to talk to colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle.\n  I want to single out Senator Pat Leahy for being so generous with me \nand giving me time to talk about Judge Frizzell and why he should be \nconfirmed. He told me, after listening to this, he would be willing to \nput him on his top priority list. He didn't have to do it. He is a \nDemocrat and I am a Republican. So, again, I compliment Senator Pat \nLeahy for doing that for us and for justice in America.\n  This young man, Greg Frizzell, has a great family background. I \nremember when his daddy, Kent Frizzell, was in Kansas and served as \nattorney general for that State. Then he had better judgment and \ndecided to move from Kansas to Oklahoma. We became good friends many \nyears ago. Greg was very young at that time. He was raised in this \nfamily of public servants, people who served as his father had for such \na long period of time. I think his father is still at the University of \nTulsa Law School and has been for about 20 years and is doing great \nwork. That is the environment in which Greg Frizzell was raised. He has \nbeen a judge for a long time, and you would think you would hear some \nnegative things about him. But you don't hear negative things about \nthis guy. Even his political adversaries all agree that he is the \nquality and type of man who should be on the Federal bench.\n  Robert Sartin, a member of the Board of Governors, said:\n\n       Judge Frizzell is a man of extremely good character and \n     high integrity, with a deep sense of personal responsibility \n     toward his fellow man.\n\n  A fellow judge, Claire Egan, praised him. She talked about the \nurgency of this confirmation and that they actually only have three \njudges now on that bench doing the work of six judges.\n  One of the most highly respected senior Federal judges, Ralph \nThompson, who is in senior status in Oklahoma right now, praised Greg, \nsaying there is nobody out there who could be more qualified than Greg \nFrizzell for this particular appointment.\n  So it is neat that we are finally getting around to this. I apologize \nto Greg and his family for the uncertainty that is always there, even \nthough I never had any uncertainty. I knew he was going to be there.\n  Getting back again to all these different people, Joe Wolgemuth, a \nprominent attorney in Tulsa, recalls an incident where Judge Frizzell--\nhe has six kids, by the way--had work to do one night, and he went down \nand took his six kids with him and did his judicial work.

In \n     1975, she received her J.D. from the UCLA School of Law.\n       Upon graduating from law school, she began working as an \n     associate with the firm Overton, Lyman & Prince in Los \n     Angeles. During her two years at Overton, Judge Baker focused \n     on business litigation.

The American Bar Association has \n     rated Judge Baker unanimously ``Well Qualified.''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for these \nthree distinguished nominees. I thank Senator Leahy, the Chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, for moving these nominations. It is very \nimportant. We have numerous judicial emergencies. We have other \nnominees awaiting action by the committee and by the full Senate.\n  Senator Leahy is moving with dispatch, which is appreciated, and it \nis also appreciated that the majority leader has listed these three \nnominees for action this morning.\n  In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Judge Gregory Kent Frizzell\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to follow up on the \ncomments made by my senior Senator, Mr. Inhofe, from Oklahoma, on the \nqualifications of Judge Gregory Frizzell. He has enumerated many of \nthose. This is a fine young man with impeccable character and \nintegrity. He is a living example of a life of service, not just in \nwhat he does as a judge in Oklahoma, but what he does in his community \nin Oklahoma. It has been a real pleasure to get to know him, to also \nwatch him as he went through the process of getting a unanimous vote \nout of the Judiciary Committee and having no significant questions \nraised about his judicial philosophy, integrity, character, background, \nor his qualifications. So it is with a great deal of pleasure that I \nlook forward to his vote today.\n\n  I might comment for a moment that he was capable of being confirmed \nin the last Congress, and there was no reason, no good reason why he \nwasn't, other than the answer: We are not going to approve any more \njudges in this Congress. That is the reason I was told by the now \nmajority leader that he would not be approved. There is no question as \nto his qualifications, but it should remind us again of the dangers of \npartisanship for party instead of partisanship for our country and for \nfuture generations.\n  I am very thankful to the Judiciary Committee chairman, Patrick Leahy \nfrom Vermont, for the speed and quickness with which he has brought \nthis to the floor. I thank him for that, and I look forward to working \nwith him with the same speed on any other judges the President might \nbring up and that the committee would put out.\n  It is my hope we can get beyond partisanship on judiciary nominees \nand get to the business of filling the significant number of voids or \nvacancies that are out there today and that are limiting justice for \npeople in this country. Justice delayed is justice denied. And a lack \nof available judges is denying justice to hundreds and thousands of \nAmericans every day. So the chairman of the Judiciary Committee has my \ncommitment as a member of the Judiciary Committee to help him in any \nway I can to move those.\n  It is a great honor that Greg Frizzell will sit as a Federal judge in \nthe northern district of Oklahoma, and it is my hope we will see many \nlike him fill the spots across this country.\n  With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will withhold.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1480-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I spoke briefly a few \nmoments ago about these nominees. They all have excellent academic \nrecords and professional records, and they have been examined by the \ninvestigative authorities and have been reviewed by the Judiciary \nCommittee. They have been passed out unanimously by the Judiciary \nCommittee for confirmation. All have been evaluated ``well qualified'' \nby the American Bar Association, and I urge my colleagues to support \nall of these nominees.\n  That pretty well summarizes, Mr. President. So in the absence of any \nSenator seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative \nclerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Nomination of Lawrence Joseph O'neill\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to support Judge \nLawrence O'Neill's nomination to the Eastern District of California.\n  His confirmation would help to alleviate a judicial emergency in the \nEastern District of California.\n  The Fresno Division, to which Judge O'Neill is nominated, is \nsuffering from a particularly acute overload of cases.\n  Judge Anthony Ishii and Senior Judge Oliver Wanger are currently the \nonly judges on the Fresno Division of the Eastern District. Their \naverage caseload is the highest in the Nation.\n  The people of Fresno and the Eastern District truly need the help \nthat Judge O'Neill will provide.\n  Fortunately, Judge O'Neill is uniquely qualified to step in and offer \nimmediate relief to the Eastern District because he has been a \nmagistrate judge in the District since 1999.\n  In addition, for the last 17 years, Judge O'Neill has been a judge in \nCalifornia, spending 10 years as a superior court judge in Fresno \nbefore becoming a magistrate.\n  He is a homegrown Californian. He was born in Oakland, CA, and \nattended school in California. He received a bachelor's degree in \ncriminology from the University of California, Berkeley, a master's \ndegree in public education from Golden Gate University, and a law \ndegree from Hastings College of Law.\n  Before attending law school, he was a police officer for the city of \nSan Leandro. I believe this additional perspective will prove an asset \non the bench.\n  I was pleased to learn that the American Bar Association unanimously \ndeclared Judge O'Neill to be ``well qualified,'' the ABA's highest \nrating.\n\n[[Page S1481]]\n\n  In California, we have developed a bipartisan process for selecting \nFederal district court nominees. Under this system, a committee of \nlawyers, including Democrats and Republicans, recommends qualified \napplicants to the President.\n  The fact that Judge O'Neill's nomination was a product of this \ncommission gives me confidence that he comes to the bench without an \nideological agenda and is prepared to serve all the people of \nCalifornia.\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF VALERIE L. BAKER\n\n  Mr. President, it is my pleasure to support Judge Valerie Baker, a \ndistinguished nominee to the U.S. District Court for the Central \nDistrict of California.\n  The Central District of California, based in Los Angeles, is the \nlargest and busiest Federal judicial district in the Nation. Judge \nBaker would be a welcome addition to this important court.\n  Judge Baker has been a trial court judge on the Los Angeles County \nSuperior Court for nearly 20 years and previously served on Los Angeles \nMunicipal Court.\n  In 1994, she was awarded the Alfred J. McCourtney Trial Judge of the \nYear Award from the Consumer Lawyers of Los Angeles.\n  Judge Baker is also a seasoned litigator, with Federal experience in \ncriminal and civil cases. With the law firm of Lillick, McHose & \nCharles she specialized in Federal business litigation and antitrust \nlaw. As an assistant U.S. attorney, Judge Baker prosecuted bank \nrobberies, major drug violations, and fraudulent enterprises.\n  At the University of California at Santa Barbara, she earned a \nbachelor of arts degree and a master's degree in English, and she \nreceived a law degree from UCLA.\n  Off the bench, Judge Baker has devoted herself to charities helping \nthe Los Angeles community.\n  As a board member of the UCLA Law School Alumni Association, she \nchaired a committee to recruit qualified minority students. She also \nserved on the board of a non-profit shelter for homeless teenagers and \nsat on the board of directors of the Braille Institute of Los Angeles.\n  The American Bar Association has given Judge Baker a unanimous ``well \nqualified'' rating, the Association's highest mark.\n  I am proud of the bipartisan process for selecting Federal district \ncourt nominees that we have developed in California. Under this system, \na committee of lawyers, including Democrats and Republicans, recommends \nqualified applicants to the President.\n  Judge Baker came through this committee, which gives me confidence \nthat she comes to the bench without an ideological agenda and is \nprepared to serve all the people of California.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate continues to make \nsignificant progress in its consideration of judicial nominations. The \nSenate will consider and, I believe, confirm the nominations of \nLawrence Joseph O'Neill for the Eastern District of California, Valerie \nL. Baker for Central District of California, and Gregory Kent Frizzell \nfor the Northern District of Oklahoma.\n  When they are confirmed, the Senate will have granted its consent to \n263 of President Bush's nominations for lifetime appointments to our \nFederal courts. Moreover, with these three confirmations today, we will \nhave confirmed more of President Bush's nominations in the 18 months I \nhave served as Judiciary Committee chairman with a Democratic majority \nin the Senate than in the more than 2 years when Senator Hatch chaired \nthe committee with a Republican Senate majority or during the last \nCongress with a Republican Senate majority. This is the 105th \nconfirmation during my time as Judiciary chairman.\n  I know some on the other side of the aisle have tried to raise a \nscare since I, again, became chairman of the Judiciary Committee. They \nrant as if the sky is falling and we would not proceed on any judicial \nnominations. We have proceeded promptly and efficiently. Last Thursday, \nthe Judiciary Committee held its first business meeting of the year. We \nmight have met earlier but for the delay in organizing the Senate from \nJanuary 4, when this session first began, until the Republican caucus \nfinally agreed to the resolutions assigning Members to Senate \ncommittees on January 12.\n  The three nominations we consider today were among the five \nnominations for lifetime appointments Federal judges that I included on \nthe agenda at our first meeting. Like the two judges confirmed on \nTuesday, Judge O'Neill's nomination is for a vacancy that has been \ndesignated a judicial emergency by the Administrative Office of the \nU.S. Courts. All five were among those returned to the President \nwithout Senate action at the end of last year when Republican Senators \nobjected to proceeding with certain nominees in September and December \nlast year.\n  Before proceeding, I inquired of each member of the committee whether \na hearing was requested on these nominations this year. I, again, thank \nall, members of the Judiciary Committee for working with me to expedite \nconsideration of these nominations this year. In particular, I extend \nthanks to our new members, the Senators from Maryland and Rhode Island.\n  These nominations were not even sent to the Senate until January 9. \nThey were considered by the committee in a little over 2 weeks and are \nbeing approved by the Senate in a little over 3 weeks from their \nnomination.\n  I have worked cooperatively with Members from both sides of the aisle \non our committee and in the Senate to move quickly to consider and \nreport judicial nominations so that we can fill vacancies and improve \nthe administration of justice in our Nation's Federal courts. I \nappreciate the interests of Senator Chambliss and Senator Isaakson in \nthe confirmation of Judge Wood, the first judge confirmed this year. \nLikewise, I was pleased to be able to respond to the needs of Senator \nInhofe and Senator Coburn by expediting consideration of Judge \nFrizzell. I thank Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer of California for \ntheir efforts on some of these nominations and for working to fill the \nvacancies in California.\n  I have long urged the President to fill vacancies with consensus \nnominees. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts list 57 judicial \nvacancies, 28 of them have been deemed to be judicial emergencies. So \nfar this Congress, the President has yet to send us nominees for 17 of \nthose judicial emergency vacancies.\n  I have also scheduled a confirmation hearing for next week for \nadditional judicial nominees and another business meeting at which the \ncommittee may consider still more judicial nominations. When a \nRepublican chaired the committee in 1999 and there was a Democratic \nPresident, the first hearing on a judicial nominee was not held until \nJune 16. We intend to hold a hearing on February 6.\n  I had initially thought that we would include the nomination of \nNorman Randy Smith of Idaho to the Ninth Circuit at that hearing next \nweek. However, with the cooperation of the Senators from California and \nthe members of the Judiciary Committee, I now hope to be able to avoid \nanother hearing on the Smith nomination.\n  I was pleased when the White House changed course and nominated Randy \nSmith for the Idaho seat on the Ninth Circuit. I had urged President \nBush to take this action last year when he insisted on resubmitting the \nSmith nomination for a California seat on the Ninth Circuit. I thank \nthe President for finally doing the right thing. I will urge the Senate \nto confirm his nomination of Randy Smith to the vacant seat on the \nNinth Circuit from Idaho. At long last Senator Craig and Senator Crapo \nwill then have a judge on that important court from their home State.\n  Each of the nominees we consider today has the support of home State \nSenators.\n  Lawrence Joseph O'Neill is nominated to the U.S. District Court for \nthe Eastern District of California, another seat deemed to be a \njudicial emergency by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. He \nis a well-qualified nominee who has over 15 years of experience on the \nbench, seven of them as a magistrate judge on the district court to \nwhich he is now nominated. Before becoming a magistrate judge, Judge \nO'Neill spent 9 years as a Fresno County superior court judge and, \nbefore that, a decade in private practice. Judge O'Neill will bring a \nvaluable perspective to the Federal bench, having served as a police \nofficer for 5 years in\n\n[[Page S1482]]\n\nthe city of San Leandro, CA. He graduated from law school at the \nUniversity of California, Hastings and then clerked for Judge Robert F. \nKane on the California Court of Appeals.\n  Valerie L. Baker, who is nominated to the U.S. District Court for the \nCentral District of California, already has over 20 years of experience \non the bench. As a Los Angeles County municipal and then superior court \njudge, she has handled thousands of cases and has been the recipient of \nthe Alfred J. McCourtney Trial Judge of the Year Award by Consumer \nLawyers of Los Angeles. After graduating from UCLA Law School, Judge \nBaker served as an assistant U.S. attorney and as a commercial \nlitigator in private practice. Judge Baker was rated unanimously well \nqualified by the American Bar Association and has the support of both \nher home State Democratic Senators.\n  As a courtesy to Senator Inhofe, I included the nomination of Gregory \nKent Frizzell on the agenda for Judiciary Committee's first executive \nbusiness meeting last week. I was glad to see Senator Inhofe say that \nhe was ``pleased with the committee action'' and that Judge Frizell was \n``fast-tracked through.'' Judge Frizzell is nominated to the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma. He has a decade \nof experience on the bench as an Oklahoma district judge in Tulsa \nCounty. In his 23 years as a lawyer, Judge Frizzell has served as \ngeneral counsel to the Oklahoma Tax Commission and tried more than 25 \ncases in private practice as a sole practitioner and an attorney at \nJones, Givens, Gotcher & Bogan, P.C., representing community colleges, \ninsurance companies, and other businesses. After graduating from the \nUniversity of Tulsa and the University of Michigan Law School, Judge \nFrizzell served as a law clerk to Judge Thomas R. Brett on the court to \nwhich he has now been nominated.\n  I congratulate the nominees and their families on their confirmations \ntoday. We continue to make progress towards filling longstanding \njudicial vacancies. I intend to do what I can to ensure that the \nFederal judiciary remains independent and able to provide justice to \nall Americans.\n  Mr. REID.

I understand \nthe Senators from Oklahoma want to have a recorded vote on Frizzell. \nValerie Baker is next on the list.\n  I yield back the remaining time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We yield back the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Valerie L. Baker, of California, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Central District of California?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n\n\n              Vote on Nomination of Gregory Kent Frizzell\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Gregory \nFrizzell nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield back whatever time we have \nremaining on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was honored a few minutes ago to talk \nabout this very outstanding young man, Greg Frizzell. Unfortunately, as \nthe senior Senator from Vermont knows, we tried our best to get him in \nlast year. We were unable to do it. But thanks to him and helping us to \nexpedite the confirmation of this fine young man, we will be voting \nnow.\n  This gentleman comes from a background that is unusual and unique. I \nknow of no one who has said anything negative about him in our State of \nOklahoma. So I think justice will be served with the confirmation of \nGreg Frizzell for the Northern District of Oklahoma.\n  I am proud to stand here today in support of Judge Greg Frizzell's \nnomination to be the U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of \nOklahoma. After his Judiciary Committee hearing in September, I was \ncertain that he would be confirmed before the end of the year. However, \ndue to some regrettable political wrangling, his nomination was \nstalled.\n  Fortunately, over the past few weeks, I have spoken to my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to help expedite Judge Frizzell through the \ncommittee process and bring his nomination to the Senate floor. I am \nconvinced that he is the most capable and well-qualified person for \nthis position.\n  His family is no stranger to the legal field--I can remember his \nfather, Kent Frizzell. He served as attorney general for the State of \nKansas--that is when I first got to know his family. Later on, when \nthey moved to Oklahoma, we became very close friends.\n  He has had all kinds of experience in the past--serving the Under \nSecretary of Interior, and he has taught at the University of Tulsa Law \nSchool for almost 20 years. So given his father's distinguished work, \nit is no surprise that Judge Frizzell felt compelled to pursue a career \nin public service, and his friends and colleagues have praised his \nprofessional qualifications and personal integrity, as well as his \nability to rule fairly from the bench.\n  Someone who has been around as long as this young judge has been \naround, you would think you would hear negative things--I have never \nheard anything negative about him. Robert Sartin, member of the board \nof governors of the Oklahoma Bar Association said, ``Judge Frizzell is \na man of extremely good character and high integrity, with a deep sense \nof personal responsibility toward his fellow man.'' Judge Claire Egan, \npraised him and talked about the urgency to fill vacant spots on the \nbench--she emphasized the fact that the court right now has three \njudges doing the work of six.\n  One of the prominent and well-respected attorneys in Oklahoma, Joe \nWohlgemuth of a distinguished law firm in Tulsa, called Judge Frizzell \n``a man of integrity and a straight arrow''.\n\n[[Page S1483]]\n\n  Before serving in the current position of District Judge of the 14th \nJudicial District of Oklahoma, Greg Frizzell had a long and \ndistinguished legal career and ample Federal experience. After \ngraduating with a law degree from the University of Michigan, he \nclerked for Judge Tom Brett--Tom Brett is now in retirement and there \nis no one who has a better reputation than he, and he has praised Greg \nFrizzell time and time again. Ralph Thompson, a prominent senior judge \nserving on the Federal bench in Oklahoma, has also praised him.\n  After clerking for Judge Brett, Frizzell became an associate at an \nOklahoma law firm and then ran his own private legal practice until he \nwas selected to be general counsel to the Oklahoma Tax Commission. \nAfter serving for a period of time at the Tax Commission, he was then \nappointed to his current position as Judge of the 14th District of \nOklahoma.\n  Not only has Judge Frizzell proven an effective and fair legal \nprofessional, he is a devoted husband and loving father of six \nchildren.\n  Getting back again to Mr. Wohlgemuth, he recalls an incident where \nJudge Frizzell, had to work late one night doing work and he brought \nall six kids to spend time with them into the late hours--anyone who \ncan handle six kids while doing his judicial work, I think can handle \nthis job.\n  So, Judge Frizzell is a man of great moral integrity who has proven \nhis character in both his private and public life. I cannot say enough \nabout him and his qualifications to be the next U.S. District Court \nJudge for the Northern District of Oklahoma and I urge my colleagues to \nconfirm his nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, a brief comment on Gregory Frizzell. He \nwas born in Wichita, KS, which is a great note of distinction, being it \nis my birthplace. I debated against his father in high school. So I \nhave a little more enthusiasm in asking my colleagues to support his \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Gregory Kent Frizzell, of Oklahoma, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Northern District of Oklahoma?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to consider en bloc the following nominations, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Lawrence Joseph O'Neill, \nof California, to be a United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of California;\n  Valerie L. Baker, of California, to be a United States District Judge \nfor the Central District of California; and\n  Gregory Kent Frizzell, of Oklahoma, to be a United States District \nJudge for the Northern District of Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes for debate on the nominations, equally divided between the \nSenator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, and the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. \nSpecter, or their designees.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I spoke briefly a few \nmoments ago about these nominees. They all have excellent academic \nrecords and professional records, and they have been examined by the \ninvestigative authorities and have been reviewed by the Judiciary \nCommittee. They have been passed out unanimously by the Judiciary \nCommittee for confirmation. All have been evaluated ``well qualified'' \nby the American Bar Association, and I urge my colleagues to support \nall of these nominees.\n  That pretty well summarizes, Mr. President. So in the absence of any \nSenator seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative \nclerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Nomination of Lawrence Joseph O'neill\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to support Judge \nLawrence O'Neill's nomination to the Eastern District of California.\n  His confirmation would help to alleviate a judicial emergency in the \nEastern District of California.\n  The Fresno Division, to which Judge O'Neill is nominated, is \nsuffering from a particularly acute overload of cases.\n  Judge Anthony Ishii and Senior Judge Oliver Wanger are currently the \nonly judges on the Fresno Division of the Eastern District. Their \naverage caseload is the highest in the Nation.\n  The people of Fresno and the Eastern District truly need the help \nthat Judge O'Neill will provide.\n  Fortunately, Judge O'Neill is uniquely qualified to step in and offer \nimmediate relief to the Eastern District because he has been a \nmagistrate judge in the District since 1999.\n  In addition, for the last 17 years, Judge O'Neill has been a judge in \nCalifornia, spending 10 years as a superior court judge in Fresno \nbefore becoming a magistrate.\n  He is a homegrown Californian. He was born in Oakland, CA, and \nattended school in California. He received a bachelor's degree in \ncriminology from the University of California, Berkeley, a master's \ndegree in public education from Golden Gate University, and a law \ndegree from Hastings College of Law.\n  Before attending law school, he was a police officer for the city of \nSan Leandro. I believe this additional perspective will prove an asset \non the bench.\n  I was pleased to learn that the American Bar Association unanimously \ndeclared Judge O'Neill to be ``well qualified,'' the ABA's highest \nrating.\n\n[[Page S1481]]\n\n  In California, we have developed a bipartisan process for selecting \nFederal district court nominees. Under this system, a committee of \nlawyers, including Democrats and Republicans, recommends qualified \napplicants to the President.\n  The fact that Judge O'Neill's nomination was a product of this \ncommission gives me confidence that he comes to the bench without an \nideological agenda and is prepared to serve all the people of \nCalifornia.\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF VALERIE L. BAKER\n\n  Mr. President, it is my pleasure to support Judge Valerie Baker, a \ndistinguished nominee to the U.S. District Court for the Central \nDistrict of California.\n  The Central District of California, based in Los Angeles, is the \nlargest and busiest Federal judicial district in the Nation. Judge \nBaker would be a welcome addition to this important court.\n  Judge Baker has been a trial court judge on the Los Angeles County \nSuperior Court for nearly 20 years and previously served on Los Angeles \nMunicipal Court.\n  In 1994, she was awarded the Alfred J. McCourtney Trial Judge of the \nYear Award from the Consumer Lawyers of Los Angeles.\n  Judge Baker is also a seasoned litigator, with Federal experience in \ncriminal and civil cases. With the law firm of Lillick, McHose & \nCharles she specialized in Federal business litigation and antitrust \nlaw. As an assistant U.S. attorney, Judge Baker prosecuted bank \nrobberies, major drug violations, and fraudulent enterprises.\n  At the University of California at Santa Barbara, she earned a \nbachelor of arts degree and a master's degree in English, and she \nreceived a law degree from UCLA.\n  Off the bench, Judge Baker has devoted herself to charities helping \nthe Los Angeles community.\n  As a board member of the UCLA Law School Alumni Association, she \nchaired a committee to recruit qualified minority students. She also \nserved on the board of a non-profit shelter for homeless teenagers and \nsat on the board of directors of the Braille Institute of Los Angeles.\n  The American Bar Association has given Judge Baker a unanimous ``well \nqualified'' rating, the Association's highest mark.\n  I am proud of the bipartisan process for selecting Federal district \ncourt nominees that we have developed in California. Under this system, \na committee of lawyers, including Democrats and Republicans, recommends \nqualified applicants to the President.\n  Judge Baker came through this committee, which gives me confidence \nthat she comes to the bench without an ideological agenda and is \nprepared to serve all the people of California.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate continues to make \nsignificant progress in its consideration of judicial nominations. The \nSenate will consider and, I believe, confirm the nominations of \nLawrence Joseph O'Neill for the Eastern District of California, Valerie \nL. Baker for Central District of California, and Gregory Kent Frizzell \nfor the Northern District of Oklahoma.\n  When they are confirmed, the Senate will have granted its consent to \n263 of President Bush's nominations for lifetime appointments to our \nFederal courts. Moreover, with these three confirmations today, we will \nhave confirmed more of President Bush's nominations in the 18 months I \nhave served as Judiciary Committee chairman with a Democratic majority \nin the Senate than in the more than 2 years when Senator Hatch chaired \nthe committee with a Republican Senate majority or during the last \nCongress with a Republican Senate majority. This is the 105th \nconfirmation during my time as Judiciary chairman.\n  I know some on the other side of the aisle have tried to raise a \nscare since I, again, became chairman of the Judiciary Committee. They \nrant as if the sky is falling and we would not proceed on any judicial \nnominations. We have proceeded promptly and efficiently. Last Thursday, \nthe Judiciary Committee held its first business meeting of the year. We \nmight have met earlier but for the delay in organizing the Senate from \nJanuary 4, when this session first began, until the Republican caucus \nfinally agreed to the resolutions assigning Members to Senate \ncommittees on January 12.\n  The three nominations we consider today were among the five \nnominations for lifetime appointments Federal judges that I included on \nthe agenda at our first meeting. Like the two judges confirmed on \nTuesday, Judge O'Neill's nomination is for a vacancy that has been \ndesignated a judicial emergency by the Administrative Office of the \nU.S. Courts. All five were among those returned to the President \nwithout Senate action at the end of last year when Republican Senators \nobjected to proceeding with certain nominees in September and December \nlast year.\n  Before proceeding, I inquired of each member of the committee whether \na hearing was requested on these nominations this year. I, again, thank \nall, members of the Judiciary Committee for working with me to expedite \nconsideration of these nominations this year. In particular, I extend \nthanks to our new members, the Senators from Maryland and Rhode Island.\n  These nominations were not even sent to the Senate until January 9. \nThey were considered by the committee in a little over 2 weeks and are \nbeing approved by the Senate in a little over 3 weeks from their \nnomination.\n  I have worked cooperatively with Members from both sides of the aisle \non our committee and in the Senate to move quickly to consider and \nreport judicial nominations so that we can fill vacancies and improve \nthe administration of justice in our Nation's Federal courts. I \nappreciate the interests of Senator Chambliss and Senator Isaakson in \nthe confirmation of Judge Wood, the first judge confirmed this year. \nLikewise, I was pleased to be able to respond to the needs of Senator \nInhofe and Senator Coburn by expediting consideration of Judge \nFrizzell. I thank Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer of California for \ntheir efforts on some of these nominations and for working to fill the \nvacancies in California.\n  I have long urged the President to fill vacancies with consensus \nnominees. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts list 57 judicial \nvacancies, 28 of them have been deemed to be judicial emergencies. So \nfar this Congress, the President has yet to send us nominees for 17 of \nthose judicial emergency vacancies.\n  I have also scheduled a confirmation hearing for next week for \nadditional judicial nominees and another business meeting at which the \ncommittee may consider still more judicial nominations. When a \nRepublican chaired the committee in 1999 and there was a Democratic \nPresident, the first hearing on a judicial nominee was not held until \nJune 16. We intend to hold a hearing on February 6.\n  I had initially thought that we would include the nomination of \nNorman Randy Smith of Idaho to the Ninth Circuit at that hearing next \nweek. However, with the cooperation of the Senators from California and \nthe members of the Judiciary Committee, I now hope to be able to avoid \nanother hearing on the Smith nomination.\n  I was pleased when the White House changed course and nominated Randy \nSmith for the Idaho seat on the Ninth Circuit. I had urged President \nBush to take this action last year when he insisted on resubmitting the \nSmith nomination for a California seat on the Ninth Circuit. I thank \nthe President for finally doing the right thing. I will urge the Senate \nto confirm his nomination of Randy Smith to the vacant seat on the \nNinth Circuit from Idaho. At long last Senator Craig and Senator Crapo \nwill then have a judge on that important court from their home State.\n  Each of the nominees we consider today has the support of home State \nSenators.\n  Lawrence Joseph O'Neill is nominated to the U.S. District Court for \nthe Eastern District of California, another seat deemed to be a \njudicial emergency by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. He \nis a well-qualified nominee who has over 15 years of experience on the \nbench, seven of them as a magistrate judge on the district court to \nwhich he is now nominated. Before becoming a magistrate judge, Judge \nO'Neill spent 9 years as a Fresno County superior court judge and, \nbefore that, a decade in private practice. Judge O'Neill will bring a \nvaluable perspective to the Federal bench, having served as a police \nofficer for 5 years in\n\n[[Page S1482]]\n\nthe city of San Leandro, CA. He graduated from law school at the \nUniversity of California, Hastings and then clerked for Judge Robert F. \nKane on the California Court of Appeals.\n  Valerie L. Baker, who is nominated to the U.S. District Court for the \nCentral District of California, already has over 20 years of experience \non the bench. As a Los Angeles County municipal and then superior court \njudge, she has handled thousands of cases and has been the recipient of \nthe Alfred J. McCourtney Trial Judge of the Year Award by Consumer \nLawyers of Los Angeles. After graduating from UCLA Law School, Judge \nBaker served as an assistant U.S. attorney and as a commercial \nlitigator in private practice. Judge Baker was rated unanimously well \nqualified by the American Bar Association and has the support of both \nher home State Democratic Senators.\n  As a courtesy to Senator Inhofe, I included the nomination of Gregory \nKent Frizzell on the agenda for Judiciary Committee's first executive \nbusiness meeting last week. I was glad to see Senator Inhofe say that \nhe was ``pleased with the committee action'' and that Judge Frizell was \n``fast-tracked through.'' Judge Frizzell is nominated to the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma. He has a decade \nof experience on the bench as an Oklahoma district judge in Tulsa \nCounty. In his 23 years as a lawyer, Judge Frizzell has served as \ngeneral counsel to the Oklahoma Tax Commission and tried more than 25 \ncases in private practice as a sole practitioner and an attorney at \nJones, Givens, Gotcher & Bogan, P.C., representing community colleges, \ninsurance companies, and other businesses. After graduating from the \nUniversity of Tulsa and the University of Michigan Law School, Judge \nFrizzell served as a law clerk to Judge Thomas R. Brett on the court to \nwhich he has now been nominated.\n  I congratulate the nominees and their families on their confirmations \ntoday. We continue to make progress towards filling longstanding \njudicial vacancies. I intend to do what I can to ensure that the \nFederal judiciary remains independent and able to provide justice to \nall Americans.\n  Mr. REID.

We yield back the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Valerie L. Baker, of California, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Central District of California?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n\n\n              Vote on Nomination of Gregory Kent Frizzell\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Gregory \nFrizzell nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield back whatever time we have \nremaining on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was honored a few minutes ago to talk \nabout this very outstanding young man, Greg Frizzell. Unfortunately, as \nthe senior Senator from Vermont knows, we tried our best to get him in \nlast year. We were unable to do it. But thanks to him and helping us to \nexpedite the confirmation of this fine young man, we will be voting \nnow.\n  This gentleman comes from a background that is unusual and unique. I \nknow of no one who has said anything negative about him in our State of \nOklahoma. So I think justice will be served with the confirmation of \nGreg Frizzell for the Northern District of Oklahoma.\n  I am proud to stand here today in support of Judge Greg Frizzell's \nnomination to be the U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of \nOklahoma. After his Judiciary Committee hearing in September, I was \ncertain that he would be confirmed before the end of the year. However, \ndue to some regrettable political wrangling, his nomination was \nstalled.\n  Fortunately, over the past few weeks, I have spoken to my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to help expedite Judge Frizzell through the \ncommittee process and bring his nomination to the Senate floor. I am \nconvinced that he is the most capable and well-qualified person for \nthis position.\n  His family is no stranger to the legal field--I can remember his \nfather, Kent Frizzell. He served as attorney general for the State of \nKansas--that is when I first got to know his family. Later on, when \nthey moved to Oklahoma, we became very close friends.\n  He has had all kinds of experience in the past--serving the Under \nSecretary of Interior, and he has taught at the University of Tulsa Law \nSchool for almost 20 years. So given his father's distinguished work, \nit is no surprise that Judge Frizzell felt compelled to pursue a career \nin public service, and his friends and colleagues have praised his \nprofessional qualifications and personal integrity, as well as his \nability to rule fairly from the bench.\n  Someone who has been around as long as this young judge has been \naround, you would think you would hear negative things--I have never \nheard anything negative about him. Robert Sartin, member of the board \nof governors of the Oklahoma Bar Association said, ``Judge Frizzell is \na man of extremely good character and high integrity, with a deep sense \nof personal responsibility toward his fellow man.'' Judge Claire Egan, \npraised him and talked about the urgency to fill vacant spots on the \nbench--she emphasized the fact that the court right now has three \njudges doing the work of six.\n  One of the prominent and well-respected attorneys in Oklahoma, Joe \nWohlgemuth of a distinguished law firm in Tulsa, called Judge Frizzell \n``a man of integrity and a straight arrow''.\n\n[[Page S1483]]\n\n  Before serving in the current position of District Judge of the 14th \nJudicial District of Oklahoma, Greg Frizzell had a long and \ndistinguished legal career and ample Federal experience. After \ngraduating with a law degree from the University of Michigan, he \nclerked for Judge Tom Brett--Tom Brett is now in retirement and there \nis no one who has a better reputation than he, and he has praised Greg \nFrizzell time and time again. Ralph Thompson, a prominent senior judge \nserving on the Federal bench in Oklahoma, has also praised him.\n  After clerking for Judge Brett, Frizzell became an associate at an \nOklahoma law firm and then ran his own private legal practice until he \nwas selected to be general counsel to the Oklahoma Tax Commission. \nAfter serving for a period of time at the Tax Commission, he was then \nappointed to his current position as Judge of the 14th District of \nOklahoma.\n  Not only has Judge Frizzell proven an effective and fair legal \nprofessional, he is a devoted husband and loving father of six \nchildren.\n  Getting back again to Mr. Wohlgemuth, he recalls an incident where \nJudge Frizzell, had to work late one night doing work and he brought \nall six kids to spend time with them into the late hours--anyone who \ncan handle six kids while doing his judicial work, I think can handle \nthis job.\n  So, Judge Frizzell is a man of great moral integrity who has proven \nhis character in both his private and public life. I cannot say enough \nabout him and his qualifications to be the next U.S. District Court \nJudge for the Northern District of Oklahoma and I urge my colleagues to \nconfirm his nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, a brief comment on Gregory Frizzell. He \nwas born in Wichita, KS, which is a great note of distinction, being it \nis my birthplace. I debated against his father in high school. So I \nhave a little more enthusiasm in asking my colleagues to support his \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Gregory Kent Frizzell, of Oklahoma, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Northern District of Oklahoma?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to speak on another matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the verdict is in on the President's plan to \nsend more American troops into Iraq: 68 percent of the American people \nare opposed to it; 62 percent of Active-Duty military officers are \nopposed to it. Top military leaders have voiced skepticism about \nwhether an increase in troops will succeed in suppressing the sectarian \nviolence that has consumed Iraq. The evidence is in. The voice of the \npeople, the American people--voix populaire--is clear. It is time to \nturn around. Unfortunately, this administration seems to have no \nintention of heeding that call from the people.\n  Last week, the Vice President talked about the ``enormous successes'' \nthat have been accomplished in Iraq. Enormous successes? I ask, \nenormous successes? The Vice President's definition of ``enormous \nsuccess'' is, apparently, different from mine.\n  The Vice President said that talk of failures and blunders in Iraq \nwas just hogwash--his word, ``hogwash''--and the Vice President \nasserted that whatever Congress votes on in relation to Iraq, ``it \nwon't stop us.'' Hear me now. Hear me. This is the Vice President \ntalking. He asserted that whatever Congress votes on in relation to \nIraq, ``it won't stop us.''\n  Now, listen to me, you people out there in the hills, in the valleys, \nacross the mountain ranges, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, that is a \nslap in the face to you. Our constituents voted for change in the last \nelection. They asked their elected representatives--us--to chart a new \ncourse in Iraq. This administration continues to disregard the will of \nthe American people, it continues to disregard the people of the \nNation, the authority of the Constitution. The administration believes \nit can continue to ignore the message that is coming--yes--from the \nAmerican people, loudly and clearly: Bring our sons and daughters home.\n\n  That is why the bipartisan resolutions we will be debating are so \nimportant. That is why they are so important. We have a duty as the \nelected representatives of the people of the United States to be their \nvoices and to speak the truth. And the truth is that sending more \nAmerican troops into Iraq would be a continuation of the mistakes that \nbrought us there in the first place. The truth is that many of us in \nboth parties deeply, deeply disagree with the President's decision to \nincrease our commitment in Iraq rather than to decrease it. The truth \nis that the American people are fed up with having our--our--soldiers \ncaught in the crossfire of a civil war.\n  It is important to send that message from the people to the President \nof the United States. But it is not enough. The American people are \nasking us to send a message, but they are also asking us for answers. \nWhat is our strategy? What is our strategy in Iraq? I am not a Johnny-\ncome-lately on this question. I was against sending American troops \ninto Iraq in the first place. I said so, and I voted so.\n  So what is our strategy in Iraq? Why are we there? When can our sons \nand daughters and grandchildren come home? When can our sons and \ndaughters come home? This President has had almost 4 years to \narticulate answers to those questions. Unfortunately, he has failed at \nevery opportunity. And so it falls to us--us, you Senators and me, and \nMembers of the other body--to find a way forward out of the mess he has \ncreated. That is why I will be introducing, within the coming days, a \nresolution that is a new approach to the war, a resolution that is\n\n[[Page S1484]]\n\nfully supportive of our troops, while laying out clear--clear; as clear \nas the noonday Sun in a cloudless sky--benchmarks for concluding U.S. \nmilitary engagement in Iraq.\n  This administration has claimed that debating the President's plan \nwill undermine the troops. Can you believe that? Debating--debating--\ndebating the President's plan will undermine the troops? Hogwash--h-o-\ng-w-a-s-h--hogwash. Only 38 percent of the Active-Duty U.S. military \nforces support sending more troops into Iraq. To imply that the \nAmerican people and the American troops are somehow incapable of \nhearing and participating in debate about this war is utterly \nridiculous--ridiculous--hogwash.\n  War--hear me now--war and the escalation of war is not something to \nbe decided in some backroom corridor far from the madding crowd, far \nfrom the light of day. We have a duty--yes, a duty--and a \nresponsibility to deliberate, to discuss, and to offer advice. That is \nthe way democracy works, and that is the system established by our \nFounding Fathers. You better believe it.\n  Some have claimed that by putting forward these resolutions, we are \nonly offering criticism--well, what is wrong with that in the \nbeginning--and, they say, not alternatives. But criticism is only the \nfirst step. That is all right. Criticism is only the first step. It is \ncritical to send a consensus message to this President that he is \nmoving us in the wrong direction. The next step is to show the \nPresident the right direction. That is why my resolution is so \nimportant and why we should be allowed to debate it and to vote on it \nquickly. We must show the President the way forward. We must send a \nlight in a binding resolution that cannot be ignored.\n  The American people want a fundamental change in the administration's \npolicies toward Iraq. The American people elected Congress--you, you, \nyou, and me--to make those changes. We must demonstrate that the \nCongress can take and is prepared to take action to compel the \nPresident to create a strategy that is not simply more of the same.\n  The resolution I will be introducing will do exactly that. You may \nnot agree with it. The resolution will do exactly that. This resolution \nreflects the will of the American people that the war in Iraq must be \nbrought to a close in a responsible way. It will establish provisions \nto bring to a close the U.S. military engagement in Iraq based not upon \ndates but based upon conditions.\n  It will restore to Congress--Congress; that is us, the people's \nelected representatives in the House of Representatives and the U.S. \nSenate--it will restore to Congress its constitutional war-making power \nby adding conditions that would terminate the original 2002 use of \nforce resolution. I was against that resolution. I spoke against it. I \nvoted against it. I was against it. I am against it. I was right. I am \nright. And there are others who voted with me--yes, the people's voice.\n  Let me say that again. It will restore to Congress--the House and \nSenate of the United States--it will restore to Congress its \nconstitutional war-making power. Do you believe me? I have it right \nhere. I hold in my hand a copy of the U.S. Constitution. It \nwill restore to Congress its constitutional war-making power by adding \nconditions that would terminate the original 2002 use of force \nresolution. Hallelujah. Amen. I was against that to start with. Not \neverybody agreed with me, which was their right. But this would \nrestore--where it was and ought to have been in the first place--to \nCongress its constitutional war-making power by adding conditions that \nwould terminate the original 2002 use of force resolution. I was \nagainst it. But that resolution was enacted, and it is still the law of \nthe land. It is still the law of the land and will be the law of the \nland unless and until the Congress acts to terminate it.\n\n  The conditions can be summarized as follows: We have achieved our \nobjective. We are no longer needed--or we are no longer wanted in Iraq. \nThese are not irresponsible conditions that would prolong our \ninvolvement in Iraq, nor do they require a chaotic or dangerous \nwithdrawal of our troops. These are reasonable conditions that, through \nthe exercise of the article I, section 8 powers granted to the \nCongress, set limits on the Iraq war resolution, which currently has no \nsunset provision. Hear me. It has no sunset provision. It goes on and \non and on--like Tennyson's brook--forever, on and on and on. Do we want \nthat? That war resolution will continue to be in effect in perpetuity. \nDo you know what that means? Till Kingdom comes; in perpetuity, from \nnow on, as far as the human eye can see and beyond that. That war \nresolution will continue to be in effect in perpetuity if the Congress \ndoes not act. And if Congress does not act, that is an abdication of \nthe responsibility of the Congress--that is an abdication of the \nresponsibility of the Congress--to be a steward, a good steward, of its \nconstitutional power to declare war.\n  Additionally, as the bipartisan Iraq Study Group concluded, a clear \nmessage must be sent to the Iraqi Government that the U.S. commitment \nto the war in Iraq is not open-ended. The Byrd resolution will point \nthe way toward concluding that commitment.\n  No Senator must set aside his or her views of the war in order to \nsupport the Byrd resolution. Those who support a rapid redeployment of \nour troops must realize that the Congress must first reassert the \npowers vested in this body by article I of the Constitution. Those who \nhave supported the war but are now calling for benchmarks for progress \nby the Iraqi Government should understand that there can be no clearer \ncall for benchmarks for progress than by writing into the law of the \nland the conditions under which our presence in Iraq will end.\n  My approach is one that I believe should have wide bipartisan \nsupport. At the appropriate time, I will make the necessary motions to \nplace my resolution, the Byrd resolution, directly onto the calendar, \nand I urge that the Senate schedule a debate on this proposal soon \nafter this body completes action on the nonbinding resolutions. \nAlthough the President believes he can act without the support of the \npeople, the Congress must not submit to such hubris. The work of the \nCongress must be the work of the people, and there is no more important \nissue--hear me, there is no more important issue--before our country \ntoday than finding a way out of the quagmire in Iraq.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I support the bipartisan compromise \nlegislation on Iraq. I urge my colleagues to support it as well. It is \na stunning repudiation of the President's misguided strategy in Iraq, \nand it will put the Senate squarely on record in opposition to the \nsurge. It is a clarion call for change and a vote of no confidence in \nthe President's failed policy.\n  It was wrong for the President to take the country to war when we \ndid, the way we did, and for the false reasons we were given. It is \nwrong to compound that mistake now by sending tens of thousands of \nadditional American troops into the middle of a civil war now taking \nplace.\n  The American people oppose this escalation. Many generals oppose it. \nA bipartisan majority of Congress opposes it as well. I especially \ncommend our colleague, Senator Warner, for his extraordinary service to \nthe Nation and making this compromise possible.\n  Could our message to the White House be any louder or clearer? I \nintend, however, to press for binding action that will prevent the \nsurge, unless the President changes course. If he doesn't, I will seek \na vote at the first appropriate opportunity. It is wrong for the \nPresident to escalate this war and send more American soldiers into the \ncauldron of civil war.\n  We are very hopeful that through the course of the afternoon we are \ngoing to be finally able to get a vote on the increase in the minimum \nwage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour. This is the 9th day we have been on \nthis particular legislation. We have had over $240 billion worth of \nincreased tax preferences that have been suggested and recommended--\nalways on the increase on the minimum wage.\n\n[[Page S1485]]\n\n  This is not a very complex issue. We have not raised the minimum wage \nin over 10 years. The purchasing power of the minimum wage has gone \ndown and down, and even with the increase now to $7.25 an hour, it will \nonly be restored to the purchasing power it had 10 years ago.\n  This is an issue of fairness. It is about people who work and work \nhard. It is about men and women of dignity who want to do a good job \nand also want to provide for their children. So I am very hopeful we \nwill have a chance this afternoon to move ahead and vote. We, on this \nside, have been prepared to vote on that increase from the first day. \nThe House of Representatives only took 4 hours. The Democrats were \njoined by 80 Republicans to increase the minimum wage.\n  But over here, we have had 9 days of debate on the minimum wage, with \na host of different amendments and still, outside of cloture, we would \nhave 96 amendments that would have been offered by our friends on that \nside.\n  I saw yesterday that the President of the United States went to Wall \nStreet and made a speech about how good everything was in terms of the \nAmerican economy. I noticed that. I read through the speech. He was \nvery robustly cheered by Wall Street during his recitation of some of \nthe facts of what has been happening in the American economy. But \nalthough the economy has worked very well for Wall Street--I don't know \nof anybody who is doubting that--it is a different situation on Main \nStreet. We have seen and heard, during the course of this debate, from \nmany of our colleagues who related many of the stories they witnessed \nfirsthand as they campaigned in their States and as they supported the \ninitiatives that took place in some six States across the country. \nRather than jobs that were going to lift you out of poverty, they are \nending up being jobs that keep you in poverty. A minimum wage job was \nnever meant to keep you in poverty. That is what it is doing today.\n  To review what our situation is, looking at the growth of poverty in \nthe United States, these are some of the figures that were not included \nin the President's speech yesterday. Between 2000 and 2005, 5.4 million \nmore Americans are in poverty in this Bush economy. This is in the last \n5 years, from 2000 to 2005. What is more distressing is the number of \nchildren who are now living in poverty. This is the other side of the \neconomic coin. This is not Wall Street; this is what is happening in \ncommunities all across our country. These are census figures, as of \nAugust 2006. We have 1.3 million more children who are living in \npoverty. We have not seen a reduction in the number of children in \npoverty; we have seen an increase in the number of children in poverty. \nThis has followed quite a series of economic policies that have brought \nus to where we are at the present time. We saw that between 1947 and \n1973--to put this administration's economic policies in some \nperspective because I think it is useful to try to find out exactly \nwhat it is and to understand it better. Rather than taking one speech \nat a time, why don't we look at what has been happening to the economy \nover the period of recent years.\n  This chart reflects statistics from 1947 to 1973, over a 25-year \nperiod, and these indicators are the five different quintiles of income \nfor the American economy, with the lowest at 20 percent. What we are \nseeing is that all of the different economic groups rose and moved \ntogether. Actually, the ones that rose the most were those at the \nlowest part of the economic ladder. But what this chart is saying is \nthat the economy of the United States of America was working for \neveryone during this 25-year period. Everyone. Everyone across the \nboard was benefiting from the expanding economy.\n  If we look at 1973 to 2000, we begin to see the growth of these great \ndisparities. This is from the Economic Policy Institute, and these are \nfigures from 1973 to 2000. It was interesting that in the President's \nspeech he talked about where we were 25 years ago. Of course, 25 years \nago is when President Reagan was President, and this is what we find, \nwhich is right in the middle of that period and when this major \ndisparity started to grow. This would be, obviously, starting in 1980, \nand this is 1973 to 2000.\n  The previous chart showed them all about even, with the lowest \ngrowing the fastest. Now we are seeing the flow line and the top moving \nalong the fastest. And if we break this out even further, between 1973 \nand 2000, we find this growth disparity starting under the Republicans. \nIt is 1980. The President made the reference to 25 years ago, and that \nis when the growth of this disparity started, and that is due to \neconomic policies. Economic policies. You just can't get away from it.\n  If we look from 2000 to 2004, this chart reflects what has happened. \nTake the line that goes right across, and we find out that low-income \nAmericans are actually losing income and falling the fastest. This is a \nCensus Bureau historical income table. These are the governmental \nfigures. So this isn't a speech, these are governmental figures. It \nshows this extraordinary growth in these disparities, and the people \nwho have suffered the most have been children and also those at the \nlower end of the economic ladder, who are the minimum wage workers. And \nthat is what we are trying to change on the floor of the Senate, to \ngive them a break and give them a raise to $7.25.\n  We can see what has happened as a result of these economic policies \nof the recent past. These are the UNICEF child poverty figures, and we \nsee across the industrial world that the United States has the highest \nchild poverty rate, the highest child poverty rate of any industrial \ncountry in the world. So we have this idea on Wall Street that we can \nsay everything is hunky-dory and yet be a nation where we have the \nhighest child poverty rate in the world. And Lord only knows that this \nweekend probably every person in this Chamber will be making a speech \nabout how children are our future and we have to invest in them, all of \nwhich is absolutely true, but we have been failing in our \nresponsibility to look after what has been happening to the children in \nour country.\n  One might say: Well, this is all very interesting, but what has the \nminimum wage got to do with any of this, Senator? It is interesting, \nbut the increase in the minimum wage doesn't solve these issues. And I \nagree with the President that we have to do more in terms of education. \nWe have to do more in terms of training and in health and in nutrition \nfor these children. There is a great deal more we have to do for \nchildren. It all starts, obviously, in the home, but schools are next, \nand then communities. We all have to do a great deal more, but these \nare rather startling indictments.\n  Look at where the poverty rate is in the United States. In States \nthat have a high minimum wage, they have lower poverty rates. This is \ndirectly related to the subject matter here.\n  We have talked generally about economic trends. We have talked about \nthe growth in poverty and the growth in child poverty. So one might \nask: What can we do about it? Well, one major step forward we can take \nis doing something about the minimum wage. Let's prove it.\n  Look at this chart. These are States with higher minimum wages. They \nare the States that have voted for an increase in the minimum wage over \nthe Federal minimum wage. Again, these are the Census Bureau's figures. \nThe national poverty rate we see is the red line, and the States that \nhave a higher minimum wage than the national average have less child \npoverty. Less child poverty.\n  This chart reflects poverty rates generally, with the next chart \nreflecting lower child poverty rates. Here is the increase in the \nminimum wage, and it shows where child poverty is. The other chart \nshowed families living in poverty. This is what happens in States with \na higher minimum wage. Again, these are all Census Bureau figures.\n  So we can do something about child poverty by increasing the minimum \nwage. And there are many other things we can do, such as increase the \nearned-income tax credit, support the CHIP, Medicaid expansion, and \nother types of outreach programs. But one thing we know we can do, and \nwhat we have before the Senate this afternoon, is the issue of whether \nwe are going to make progress in reducing child poverty. That is the \nissue. That is one of the significant outcomes of the vote this \nafternoon.\n  We are seeing at the present time, according to the USDA, that we \nhave 12.4\n\n[[Page S1486]]\n\nmillion children who are hungry under the Bush economy. This particular \nline is left out of the speeches on Wall Street. We have 12.4 million \nchildren who are going hungry every single day according to the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. But here we see what happens with these 6.4 \nmillion children who will benefit from this increase in the minimum \nwage.\n  This is the spinoff from the increase in the minimum wage. We are \ngoing to get better attendance in our schools, better concentration, \nand better performance. We have seen that time and time again. We are \ngoing to get higher test scores and higher graduation rates; children \nwith stronger immune systems, better health, fewer expensive hospital \nvisits, and fewer run-ins with the juvenile justice system.\n  We should go back and look at the Perry preschool programs. The \nstudies reflect that when we make these investments in children that we \nwill see every one of these kinds of indicators come out in a positive \nway. And increasing the minimum wage, as I mentioned, will have an \nimpact on 6.4 million children.\n  I will make just one final point, Madam President. We have 50,000 \nspouses of our military who are working today, 50,000 of them and their \nhusbands, primarily husbands but also wives, who are serving in the \nArmed Forces of the United States of America, and many of them are in \nIraq or Afghanistan or served in Iraq and Afghanistan, and they are \nearning $5.15 or slightly more an hour today. So when we ask what can \nwe do to indicate to our men and women in uniform that we have some \nrespect for their families, well, we have important responsibilities to \ntheir families. We can't expect we are going to have top-notch fighting \npersonnel if they are worried about the economic condition of their \nfamilies. Any military leader will tell you that.\n\n  So we have a responsibility to them because they are part of our \nnational security, but we have a responsibility to them also if we are \ninterested in having the most efficient kind of fighting force. Yet we \nhave 50,000 members whose families are out there earning $5.15 or \nslightly more an hour. That can change. That will change. We can \nincrease the benefits that reach these families.\n  Hopefully, we have had a good opportunity to talk about these issues. \nAt earlier times in the debate we had questions about, well, what is \ngoing to be the impact on small business. We showed the charts where \nthey had increased the minimum wage in some States and, actually, the \nnumbers of small businesses and the expansion of small business and the \nprofitability of small business had all been enhanced.\n  We had the question: Well, if we increase the minimum wage, will \nthere be an increasing loss of employment? We demonstrated here the \nbest answer to that is what has happened in the past. At other times, \nhistorically, when we saw this kind of increase in the minimum wage, we \nactually saw the unemployment figures continue to strip downward and \nthe employment figures continued to drift upward. Those are the \nstatistics. We put them out here and we haven't been challenged on any \nof these figures.\n  We also hear, although not a great deal during the course of this \nparticular debate but in other debates, that this action will be \ninflationary. So we put the chart up that showed if we provide an \nincrease in the minimum wage, in terms of the payroll, that the \nincrease is just one-fifth of 1 percent of total payroll in this \ncountry. So the idea that it is going to add to inflation is basically \nmisleading. Of course, it doesn't compare to the kinds of increases we \nhave seen in a lot of these corporate salaries. I wish we had heard \ncomplaints about some of that as we were talking about the pressures of \nincreased payout.\n  The arguments in favor of the increase are compelling, they are \noverwhelming, and, hopefully, we are going to have an opportunity this \nafternoon to finally get, after 10 years, an increase in the minimum \nwage. We have been standing virtually in the same place for 10 years \ntrying to get an increase. We had 16 days of debate on the increase in \nthe minimum wage outside of the last 9 days. So that is 25 days of \ndiscussion on the floor of the Senate as to whether we are going to \nincrease the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour over, basically, \na 2-year period. It has taken us all that time to get the Senate of the \nUnited States to hopefully vote positively on that proposal, but I am \nvery hopeful that will be the case later in the afternoon.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I further ask unanimous consent that I \nbe allowed to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Allard and Mr. Salazar pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 472 are located in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n\n\n                Congratulating Miss America Contestants\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, later today the Senate will approve a \nresolution commending Ms. Lauren Nelson, Miss Oklahoma, as having been \nnamed Miss America in the contest on Monday night. I certainly join all \nMembers of the Senate in congratulating her.\n  I also wish to acknowledge my pride in Amanda Kozak, who finished as \nsecond runner-up as Miss Georgia. She is an equally beautiful and \ntalented young lady.\n  I think it is appropriate that we memorialize on the floor of the \nSenate for the record the fact that one of our own was also in that \ncontest on Monday night. I am very proud of Miss Kate Michael, Miss \nDistrict of Columbia, who has worked in my office for the past 3 years. \nShe is a talented, insightful young woman, dedicated to the betterment \nof mankind and committed to her country. She is a gifted professional \ndancer who has danced off-Broadway. She is a beautiful person on the \noutside, and she is equally beautiful on the inside. She is very \nbright. She graduated magna cum laude from the University of Georgia, \nand now, while pursuing the Miss America contest, working every day in \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee with me, at night \nshe goes to Johns Hopkins to pursue a master's degree in government.\n  Truly, sometimes the media takes those sensational things that happen \nto young people that are always disappointing and elevates them to \nfront-page news. Yet fine young women such as the ones we recognize in \nthis resolution rarely ever get a comment once the crown is placed on \ntheir head. But I am very proud today to say how proud I am of Miss \nKate Michael, Miss District of Columbia, my employee and an employee of \nthis Senate, who performed masterfully and competed masterfully in the \nMiss America contest and is the winner of a crown with me every day of \nthe year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to speak on another matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the verdict is in on the President's plan to \nsend more American troops into Iraq: 68 percent of the American people \nare opposed to it; 62 percent of Active-Duty military officers are \nopposed to it. Top military leaders have voiced skepticism about \nwhether an increase in troops will succeed in suppressing the sectarian \nviolence that has consumed Iraq. The evidence is in. The voice of the \npeople, the American people--voix populaire--is clear. It is time to \nturn around. Unfortunately, this administration seems to have no \nintention of heeding that call from the people.\n  Last week, the Vice President talked about the ``enormous successes'' \nthat have been accomplished in Iraq. Enormous successes? I ask, \nenormous successes? The Vice President's definition of ``enormous \nsuccess'' is, apparently, different from mine.\n  The Vice President said that talk of failures and blunders in Iraq \nwas just hogwash--his word, ``hogwash''--and the Vice President \nasserted that whatever Congress votes on in relation to Iraq, ``it \nwon't stop us.'' Hear me now. Hear me. This is the Vice President \ntalking. He asserted that whatever Congress votes on in relation to \nIraq, ``it won't stop us.''\n  Now, listen to me, you people out there in the hills, in the valleys, \nacross the mountain ranges, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, that is a \nslap in the face to you. Our constituents voted for change in the last \nelection. They asked their elected representatives--us--to chart a new \ncourse in Iraq. This administration continues to disregard the will of \nthe American people, it continues to disregard the people of the \nNation, the authority of the Constitution. The administration believes \nit can continue to ignore the message that is coming--yes--from the \nAmerican people, loudly and clearly: Bring our sons and daughters home.\n\n  That is why the bipartisan resolutions we will be debating are so \nimportant. That is why they are so important. We have a duty as the \nelected representatives of the people of the United States to be their \nvoices and to speak the truth. And the truth is that sending more \nAmerican troops into Iraq would be a continuation of the mistakes that \nbrought us there in the first place. The truth is that many of us in \nboth parties deeply, deeply disagree with the President's decision to \nincrease our commitment in Iraq rather than to decrease it. The truth \nis that the American people are fed up with having our--our--soldiers \ncaught in the crossfire of a civil war.\n  It is important to send that message from the people to the President \nof the United States. But it is not enough. The American people are \nasking us to send a message, but they are also asking us for answers. \nWhat is our strategy? What is our strategy in Iraq? I am not a Johnny-\ncome-lately on this question. I was against sending American troops \ninto Iraq in the first place. I said so, and I voted so.\n  So what is our strategy in Iraq? Why are we there? When can our sons \nand daughters and grandchildren come home? When can our sons and \ndaughters come home? This President has had almost 4 years to \narticulate answers to those questions. Unfortunately, he has failed at \nevery opportunity. And so it falls to us--us, you Senators and me, and \nMembers of the other body--to find a way forward out of the mess he has \ncreated. That is why I will be introducing, within the coming days, a \nresolution that is a new approach to the war, a resolution that is\n\n[[Page S1484]]\n\nfully supportive of our troops, while laying out clear--clear; as clear \nas the noonday Sun in a cloudless sky--benchmarks for concluding U.S. \nmilitary engagement in Iraq.\n  This administration has claimed that debating the President's plan \nwill undermine the troops. Can you believe that? Debating--debating--\ndebating the President's plan will undermine the troops? Hogwash--h-o-\ng-w-a-s-h--hogwash. Only 38 percent of the Active-Duty U.S. military \nforces support sending more troops into Iraq. To imply that the \nAmerican people and the American troops are somehow incapable of \nhearing and participating in debate about this war is utterly \nridiculous--ridiculous--hogwash.\n  War--hear me now--war and the escalation of war is not something to \nbe decided in some backroom corridor far from the madding crowd, far \nfrom the light of day. We have a duty--yes, a duty--and a \nresponsibility to deliberate, to discuss, and to offer advice. That is \nthe way democracy works, and that is the system established by our \nFounding Fathers. You better believe it.\n  Some have claimed that by putting forward these resolutions, we are \nonly offering criticism--well, what is wrong with that in the \nbeginning--and, they say, not alternatives. But criticism is only the \nfirst step. That is all right. Criticism is only the first step. It is \ncritical to send a consensus message to this President that he is \nmoving us in the wrong direction. The next step is to show the \nPresident the right direction. That is why my resolution is so \nimportant and why we should be allowed to debate it and to vote on it \nquickly. We must show the President the way forward. We must send a \nlight in a binding resolution that cannot be ignored.\n  The American people want a fundamental change in the administration's \npolicies toward Iraq. The American people elected Congress--you, you, \nyou, and me--to make those changes. We must demonstrate that the \nCongress can take and is prepared to take action to compel the \nPresident to create a strategy that is not simply more of the same.\n  The resolution I will be introducing will do exactly that. You may \nnot agree with it. The resolution will do exactly that. This resolution \nreflects the will of the American people that the war in Iraq must be \nbrought to a close in a responsible way. It will establish provisions \nto bring to a close the U.S. military engagement in Iraq based not upon \ndates but based upon conditions.\n  It will restore to Congress--Congress; that is us, the people's \nelected representatives in the House of Representatives and the U.S. \nSenate--it will restore to Congress its constitutional war-making power \nby adding conditions that would terminate the original 2002 use of \nforce resolution. I was against that resolution. I spoke against it. I \nvoted against it. I was against it. I am against it. I was right. I am \nright. And there are others who voted with me--yes, the people's voice.\n  Let me say that again. It will restore to Congress--the House and \nSenate of the United States--it will restore to Congress its \nconstitutional war-making power. Do you believe me? I have it right \nhere. I hold in my hand a copy of the U.S. Constitution. It \nwill restore to Congress its constitutional war-making power by adding \nconditions that would terminate the original 2002 use of force \nresolution. Hallelujah. Amen. I was against that to start with. Not \neverybody agreed with me, which was their right. But this would \nrestore--where it was and ought to have been in the first place--to \nCongress its constitutional war-making power by adding conditions that \nwould terminate the original 2002 use of force resolution. I was \nagainst it. But that resolution was enacted, and it is still the law of \nthe land. It is still the law of the land and will be the law of the \nland unless and until the Congress acts to terminate it.\n\n  The conditions can be summarized as follows: We have achieved our \nobjective. We are no longer needed--or we are no longer wanted in Iraq. \nThese are not irresponsible conditions that would prolong our \ninvolvement in Iraq, nor do they require a chaotic or dangerous \nwithdrawal of our troops. These are reasonable conditions that, through \nthe exercise of the article I, section 8 powers granted to the \nCongress, set limits on the Iraq war resolution, which currently has no \nsunset provision. Hear me. It has no sunset provision. It goes on and \non and on--like Tennyson's brook--forever, on and on and on. Do we want \nthat? That war resolution will continue to be in effect in perpetuity. \nDo you know what that means? Till Kingdom comes; in perpetuity, from \nnow on, as far as the human eye can see and beyond that. That war \nresolution will continue to be in effect in perpetuity if the Congress \ndoes not act. And if Congress does not act, that is an abdication of \nthe responsibility of the Congress--that is an abdication of the \nresponsibility of the Congress--to be a steward, a good steward, of its \nconstitutional power to declare war.\n  Additionally, as the bipartisan Iraq Study Group concluded, a clear \nmessage must be sent to the Iraqi Government that the U.S. commitment \nto the war in Iraq is not open-ended. The Byrd resolution will point \nthe way toward concluding that commitment.\n  No Senator must set aside his or her views of the war in order to \nsupport the Byrd resolution. Those who support a rapid redeployment of \nour troops must realize that the Congress must first reassert the \npowers vested in this body by article I of the Constitution. Those who \nhave supported the war but are now calling for benchmarks for progress \nby the Iraqi Government should understand that there can be no clearer \ncall for benchmarks for progress than by writing into the law of the \nland the conditions under which our presence in Iraq will end.\n  My approach is one that I believe should have wide bipartisan \nsupport. At the appropriate time, I will make the necessary motions to \nplace my resolution, the Byrd resolution, directly onto the calendar, \nand I urge that the Senate schedule a debate on this proposal soon \nafter this body completes action on the nonbinding resolutions. \nAlthough the President believes he can act without the support of the \npeople, the Congress must not submit to such hubris. The work of the \nCongress must be the work of the people, and there is no more important \nissue--hear me, there is no more important issue--before our country \ntoday than finding a way out of the quagmire in Iraq.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I support the bipartisan compromise \nlegislation on Iraq. I urge my colleagues to support it as well. It is \na stunning repudiation of the President's misguided strategy in Iraq, \nand it will put the Senate squarely on record in opposition to the \nsurge. It is a clarion call for change and a vote of no confidence in \nthe President's failed policy.\n  It was wrong for the President to take the country to war when we \ndid, the way we did, and for the false reasons we were given. It is \nwrong to compound that mistake now by sending tens of thousands of \nadditional American troops into the middle of a civil war now taking \nplace.\n  The American people oppose this escalation. Many generals oppose it. \nA bipartisan majority of Congress opposes it as well. I especially \ncommend our colleague, Senator Warner, for his extraordinary service to \nthe Nation and making this compromise possible.\n  Could our message to the White House be any louder or clearer? I \nintend, however, to press for binding action that will prevent the \nsurge, unless the President changes course. If he doesn't, I will seek \na vote at the first appropriate opportunity. It is wrong for the \nPresident to escalate this war and send more American soldiers into the \ncauldron of civil war.\n  We are very hopeful that through the course of the afternoon we are \ngoing to be finally able to get a vote on the increase in the minimum \nwage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour. This is the 9th day we have been on \nthis particular legislation. We have had over $240 billion worth of \nincreased tax preferences that have been suggested and recommended--\nalways on the increase on the minimum wage.\n\n[[Page S1485]]\n\n  This is not a very complex issue. We have not raised the minimum wage \nin over 10 years. The purchasing power of the minimum wage has gone \ndown and down, and even with the increase now to $7.25 an hour, it will \nonly be restored to the purchasing power it had 10 years ago.\n  This is an issue of fairness. It is about people who work and work \nhard. It is about men and women of dignity who want to do a good job \nand also want to provide for their children. So I am very hopeful we \nwill have a chance this afternoon to move ahead and vote. We, on this \nside, have been prepared to vote on that increase from the first day. \nThe House of Representatives only took 4 hours. The Democrats were \njoined by 80 Republicans to increase the minimum wage.\n  But over here, we have had 9 days of debate on the minimum wage, with \na host of different amendments and still, outside of cloture, we would \nhave 96 amendments that would have been offered by our friends on that \nside.\n  I saw yesterday that the President of the United States went to Wall \nStreet and made a speech about how good everything was in terms of the \nAmerican economy. I noticed that. I read through the speech. He was \nvery robustly cheered by Wall Street during his recitation of some of \nthe facts of what has been happening in the American economy. But \nalthough the economy has worked very well for Wall Street--I don't know \nof anybody who is doubting that--it is a different situation on Main \nStreet. We have seen and heard, during the course of this debate, from \nmany of our colleagues who related many of the stories they witnessed \nfirsthand as they campaigned in their States and as they supported the \ninitiatives that took place in some six States across the country. \nRather than jobs that were going to lift you out of poverty, they are \nending up being jobs that keep you in poverty. A minimum wage job was \nnever meant to keep you in poverty. That is what it is doing today.\n  To review what our situation is, looking at the growth of poverty in \nthe United States, these are some of the figures that were not included \nin the President's speech yesterday. Between 2000 and 2005, 5.4 million \nmore Americans are in poverty in this Bush economy. This is in the last \n5 years, from 2000 to 2005. What is more distressing is the number of \nchildren who are now living in poverty. This is the other side of the \neconomic coin. This is not Wall Street; this is what is happening in \ncommunities all across our country. These are census figures, as of \nAugust 2006. We have 1.3 million more children who are living in \npoverty. We have not seen a reduction in the number of children in \npoverty; we have seen an increase in the number of children in poverty. \nThis has followed quite a series of economic policies that have brought \nus to where we are at the present time. We saw that between 1947 and \n1973--to put this administration's economic policies in some \nperspective because I think it is useful to try to find out exactly \nwhat it is and to understand it better. Rather than taking one speech \nat a time, why don't we look at what has been happening to the economy \nover the period of recent years.\n  This chart reflects statistics from 1947 to 1973, over a 25-year \nperiod, and these indicators are the five different quintiles of income \nfor the American economy, with the lowest at 20 percent. What we are \nseeing is that all of the different economic groups rose and moved \ntogether. Actually, the ones that rose the most were those at the \nlowest part of the economic ladder. But what this chart is saying is \nthat the economy of the United States of America was working for \neveryone during this 25-year period. Everyone. Everyone across the \nboard was benefiting from the expanding economy.\n  If we look at 1973 to 2000, we begin to see the growth of these great \ndisparities. This is from the Economic Policy Institute, and these are \nfigures from 1973 to 2000. It was interesting that in the President's \nspeech he talked about where we were 25 years ago. Of course, 25 years \nago is when President Reagan was President, and this is what we find, \nwhich is right in the middle of that period and when this major \ndisparity started to grow. This would be, obviously, starting in 1980, \nand this is 1973 to 2000.\n  The previous chart showed them all about even, with the lowest \ngrowing the fastest. Now we are seeing the flow line and the top moving \nalong the fastest. And if we break this out even further, between 1973 \nand 2000, we find this growth disparity starting under the Republicans. \nIt is 1980. The President made the reference to 25 years ago, and that \nis when the growth of this disparity started, and that is due to \neconomic policies. Economic policies. You just can't get away from it.\n  If we look from 2000 to 2004, this chart reflects what has happened. \nTake the line that goes right across, and we find out that low-income \nAmericans are actually losing income and falling the fastest. This is a \nCensus Bureau historical income table. These are the governmental \nfigures. So this isn't a speech, these are governmental figures. It \nshows this extraordinary growth in these disparities, and the people \nwho have suffered the most have been children and also those at the \nlower end of the economic ladder, who are the minimum wage workers. And \nthat is what we are trying to change on the floor of the Senate, to \ngive them a break and give them a raise to $7.25.\n  We can see what has happened as a result of these economic policies \nof the recent past. These are the UNICEF child poverty figures, and we \nsee across the industrial world that the United States has the highest \nchild poverty rate, the highest child poverty rate of any industrial \ncountry in the world. So we have this idea on Wall Street that we can \nsay everything is hunky-dory and yet be a nation where we have the \nhighest child poverty rate in the world. And Lord only knows that this \nweekend probably every person in this Chamber will be making a speech \nabout how children are our future and we have to invest in them, all of \nwhich is absolutely true, but we have been failing in our \nresponsibility to look after what has been happening to the children in \nour country.\n  One might say: Well, this is all very interesting, but what has the \nminimum wage got to do with any of this, Senator? It is interesting, \nbut the increase in the minimum wage doesn't solve these issues. And I \nagree with the President that we have to do more in terms of education. \nWe have to do more in terms of training and in health and in nutrition \nfor these children. There is a great deal more we have to do for \nchildren. It all starts, obviously, in the home, but schools are next, \nand then communities. We all have to do a great deal more, but these \nare rather startling indictments.\n  Look at where the poverty rate is in the United States. In States \nthat have a high minimum wage, they have lower poverty rates. This is \ndirectly related to the subject matter here.\n  We have talked generally about economic trends. We have talked about \nthe growth in poverty and the growth in child poverty. So one might \nask: What can we do about it? Well, one major step forward we can take \nis doing something about the minimum wage. Let's prove it.\n  Look at this chart. These are States with higher minimum wages. They \nare the States that have voted for an increase in the minimum wage over \nthe Federal minimum wage. Again, these are the Census Bureau's figures. \nThe national poverty rate we see is the red line, and the States that \nhave a higher minimum wage than the national average have less child \npoverty. Less child poverty.\n  This chart reflects poverty rates generally, with the next chart \nreflecting lower child poverty rates. Here is the increase in the \nminimum wage, and it shows where child poverty is. The other chart \nshowed families living in poverty. This is what happens in States with \na higher minimum wage. Again, these are all Census Bureau figures.\n  So we can do something about child poverty by increasing the minimum \nwage. And there are many other things we can do, such as increase the \nearned-income tax credit, support the CHIP, Medicaid expansion, and \nother types of outreach programs. But one thing we know we can do, and \nwhat we have before the Senate this afternoon, is the issue of whether \nwe are going to make progress in reducing child poverty. That is the \nissue. That is one of the significant outcomes of the vote this \nafternoon.\n  We are seeing at the present time, according to the USDA, that we \nhave 12.4\n\n[[Page S1486]]\n\nmillion children who are hungry under the Bush economy. This particular \nline is left out of the speeches on Wall Street. We have 12.4 million \nchildren who are going hungry every single day according to the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. But here we see what happens with these 6.4 \nmillion children who will benefit from this increase in the minimum \nwage.\n  This is the spinoff from the increase in the minimum wage. We are \ngoing to get better attendance in our schools, better concentration, \nand better performance. We have seen that time and time again. We are \ngoing to get higher test scores and higher graduation rates; children \nwith stronger immune systems, better health, fewer expensive hospital \nvisits, and fewer run-ins with the juvenile justice system.\n  We should go back and look at the Perry preschool programs. The \nstudies reflect that when we make these investments in children that we \nwill see every one of these kinds of indicators come out in a positive \nway. And increasing the minimum wage, as I mentioned, will have an \nimpact on 6.4 million children.\n  I will make just one final point, Madam President. We have 50,000 \nspouses of our military who are working today, 50,000 of them and their \nhusbands, primarily husbands but also wives, who are serving in the \nArmed Forces of the United States of America, and many of them are in \nIraq or Afghanistan or served in Iraq and Afghanistan, and they are \nearning $5.15 or slightly more an hour today. So when we ask what can \nwe do to indicate to our men and women in uniform that we have some \nrespect for their families, well, we have important responsibilities to \ntheir families. We can't expect we are going to have top-notch fighting \npersonnel if they are worried about the economic condition of their \nfamilies. Any military leader will tell you that.\n\n  So we have a responsibility to them because they are part of our \nnational security, but we have a responsibility to them also if we are \ninterested in having the most efficient kind of fighting force. Yet we \nhave 50,000 members whose families are out there earning $5.15 or \nslightly more an hour. That can change. That will change. We can \nincrease the benefits that reach these families.\n  Hopefully, we have had a good opportunity to talk about these issues. \nAt earlier times in the debate we had questions about, well, what is \ngoing to be the impact on small business. We showed the charts where \nthey had increased the minimum wage in some States and, actually, the \nnumbers of small businesses and the expansion of small business and the \nprofitability of small business had all been enhanced.\n  We had the question: Well, if we increase the minimum wage, will \nthere be an increasing loss of employment? We demonstrated here the \nbest answer to that is what has happened in the past. At other times, \nhistorically, when we saw this kind of increase in the minimum wage, we \nactually saw the unemployment figures continue to strip downward and \nthe employment figures continued to drift upward. Those are the \nstatistics. We put them out here and we haven't been challenged on any \nof these figures.\n  We also hear, although not a great deal during the course of this \nparticular debate but in other debates, that this action will be \ninflationary. So we put the chart up that showed if we provide an \nincrease in the minimum wage, in terms of the payroll, that the \nincrease is just one-fifth of 1 percent of total payroll in this \ncountry. So the idea that it is going to add to inflation is basically \nmisleading. Of course, it doesn't compare to the kinds of increases we \nhave seen in a lot of these corporate salaries. I wish we had heard \ncomplaints about some of that as we were talking about the pressures of \nincreased payout.\n  The arguments in favor of the increase are compelling, they are \noverwhelming, and, hopefully, we are going to have an opportunity this \nafternoon to finally get, after 10 years, an increase in the minimum \nwage. We have been standing virtually in the same place for 10 years \ntrying to get an increase. We had 16 days of debate on the increase in \nthe minimum wage outside of the last 9 days. So that is 25 days of \ndiscussion on the floor of the Senate as to whether we are going to \nincrease the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour over, basically, \na 2-year period. It has taken us all that time to get the Senate of the \nUnited States to hopefully vote positively on that proposal, but I am \nvery hopeful that will be the case later in the afternoon.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD.

Madam President, later today the Senate will approve a \nresolution commending Ms. Lauren Nelson, Miss Oklahoma, as having been \nnamed Miss America in the contest on Monday night. I certainly join all \nMembers of the Senate in congratulating her.\n  I also wish to acknowledge my pride in Amanda Kozak, who finished as \nsecond runner-up as Miss Georgia. She is an equally beautiful and \ntalented young lady.\n  I think it is appropriate that we memorialize on the floor of the \nSenate for the record the fact that one of our own was also in that \ncontest on Monday night. I am very proud of Miss Kate Michael, Miss \nDistrict of Columbia, who has worked in my office for the past 3 years. \nShe is a talented, insightful young woman, dedicated to the betterment \nof mankind and committed to her country. She is a gifted professional \ndancer who has danced off-Broadway. She is a beautiful person on the \noutside, and she is equally beautiful on the inside. She is very \nbright. She graduated magna cum laude from the University of Georgia, \nand now, while pursuing the Miss America contest, working every day in \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee with me, at night \nshe goes to Johns Hopkins to pursue a master's degree in government.\n  Truly, sometimes the media takes those sensational things that happen \nto young people that are always disappointing and elevates them to \nfront-page news. Yet fine young women such as the ones we recognize in \nthis resolution rarely ever get a comment once the crown is placed on \ntheir head. But I am very proud today to say how proud I am of Miss \nKate Michael, Miss District of Columbia, my employee and an employee of \nthis Senate, who performed masterfully and competed masterfully in the \nMiss America contest and is the winner of a crown with me every day of \nthe year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, earlier this week the President traveled \nto Peoria, IL, and yesterday to Wall Street and delivered speeches that \npainted a remarkably rosy picture of our economy. He praised current \nU.S. trade policy, applauding his evidence of success, the increase in \nglobal free-trade agreements since taking office. I have to say that I, \nalong with millions of middle-class families in Ohio, in Missouri, all \nover this country, had to wonder what part of the country he was \ntalking about. In my State of Ohio, in Steubenville, in Youngstown, \nToledo, Columbus, and Dayton, more than 180,000 manufacturing workers \nlost their jobs in the time the President has been in the White House.\n  The President was right about one thing: Productivity is up, and that \nis a testament to our Nation's hard-working and skilled labor force. \nFar too\n\n[[Page S1487]]\n\noften, our Nation's workers do not share in the wealth they create. Our \nsmall businesses can't compete against the multinational corporations \nthat exploit cheap labor abroad. Our Nation's history is all about \nworkers. As their productivity increases, they share in the wealth they \ncreate for their employers, creating a middle class, creating a rising \nstandard of living.\n  The President also talked about wage increases for workers, but I am \nafraid that is where he lost us again. I would invite the President to \nsit down with a steelworker in Steubenville or a machinist in Toledo or \na small tool-and-die shop owner in Dayton. Workers are not seeing their \nwages increase, nor are they seeing new job opportunities. Employers \nare not seeing trade policies that level the playing field. Our \neconomic values are skewed toward a very select few in this country.\n  While it is true the President has pushed 10 free-trade agreements \nthrough the negotiation process, he has done so using a fundamentally \nflawed trade model. More of the same in this case is not such a good \nthing.\n  What the President did not say during his speech was that trade \nnegotiations are falling apart. The Central American Free Trade \nAgreement pushed through the House of Representatives by one vote in \nthe middle of the night still has not been fully implemented. The \nsubsequent Andean Free Trade Agreement fell apart before it even began. \nTwo years ago, thousands of workers in Central America took to the \nstreets protesting this failed trade policy. Last week, tens of \nthousands of workers in Korea took to the streets protesting a pending \nfree-trade agreement with our country. Why? Again, because the \nadministration continues to use a failed trade model for these \nagreements. Revamping U.S. trade policy is not just about taking better \nhold of our economic health; it is about establishing priorities in \nWashington that reflect family values at home and building strong \nrelationships with trading partners abroad.\n  While the administration continues to be out of touch with Main \nStreet, I am pleased to say that finally in this Congress there is a \nbipartisan fair trade effort underway. I am working with Democratic \nSenator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota and Republican Senator Lindsey \nGraham of South Carolina on a new direction for trade policy. It is not \na question of if we trade but how we trade and who, in fact, benefits \nfrom trade.\n\n  While discussing the minimum wage this week, Senator Kennedy used \nthese charts to illustrate the development over time of drastic \neconomic inequality in our country. From 1946 to 1973, economic \nopportunities for poor and working families grew. The lowest 20 percent \nactually had higher growth, percentagewise, than the top 20 percent in \nthis country. The families who worked hard and played by the rules had \na real chance of getting ahead.\n  From 1973 to 2000, things began to change dramatically. From 1973 to \n2000, the lowest 20 percent had the lowest growth in their incomes; the \ntop 20 percent had the fastest growth. It so happened in the year 1973, \ntwo things happened: the oil embargo, with the price of oil shooting \nup; second, 1973 was the year when the United States, historically with \ntrade surpluses, fell into trade deficits, and we have been in trade \ndeficit ever since 1973.\n  If we look again at this chart, from 1946 to 1973, for 26 years, \neconomic growth was shared equally, with the lowest 20 percent actually \ngrowing at the fastest rate and the top 20 percent at the lowest rate. \nSince 1973, when our country went from persistent trade surpluses to \npersistent trade deficits, growing more and more and more every year, \nthe lowest 20 percent now have the lowest growth rate, by far. The \nhighest top 20 percent have the fastest growth rate, by far.\n  We should also look at what has happened to the trade deficit. In \n1972, the year I first ran for Congress, our country had a $38 billion \ntrade deficit. In 2006, when the numbers are finalized, our trade \ndeficit will exceed $800 billion. We went from a $38 billion to a $800 \nbillion trade deficit. As President Bush first pointed out, back in \n1989-1990, $1 billion in trade deficit or trade surplus translates into \n13,000 jobs. So do the math: $1 billion in trade deficit translates \ninto 13,000 lost jobs. Our trade deficit is now $800 billion for the \nyear 2006. Our trade deficit with China in 1992, the year I first ran \nfor the House of Representatives, our trade deficit with China was \nbarely into the double digits. Today our trade deficit with China has \nreached about $250 billion.\n  It is clear our trade policy has failed. We have given countries such \nas China, countries that exploit sweatshop labor and manipulate their \ncurrency, an unfair and unnecessary advantage.\n  If trade agreements can be crafted to protect drug patents and drug \ncompanies, those same trade agreements can protect the environment. If \ntrade agreements can be crafted to protect international property \nrights and Hollywood films, the same trade agreements can protect \nworkers, small American businesses and our communities.\n  Current U.S. trade policy allows for the inhumane exploitation of \nforeign workers; it exacerbates job losses in places such as Lima and \nZanesville, OH. It puts local businesses--particularly small tool and \ndie, machine shops, small manufacturers--at an unfair disadvantage, \nforcing thousands of them to close, as large corporations move to \nMexico, China, and elsewhere overseas.\n  In my home State of Ohio, more than 40,000 jobs have been lost to \nChina in the last decade, allowing foreign companies to pay slave \nwages, to abuse their workers, and to lie about their business \npractices hurts Americans. It hurts American workers. It hurts American \nbusinesses.\n  This country is already hard at work to change our trade policy to \npromote fair trade that works for U.S. businesses. We want trade \ndefined differently. We want different trade practices. We want trade \nthat will help small business, that will help workers, and that will \nstem the exploitation of workers in developing nations.\n  No longer are Democrats and Republicans in Congress going to stand \nidly by while businesses and workers in Ohio, businesses and workers in \nplaces such as Gallipolis and Springfield and Lima are penalized for \nplaying by the rules.\n  In the last Congress, we changed the debate on trade. In this \nCongress, we will change the face of trade.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask to speak for up to 10 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, as we anticipate the beginning of the \ndiscussion and debate with respect to the future of the involvement of \nthe United States in Iraq, it is important for Members always in this \nChamber to remember we are all unified in honoring the men and women \nwho serve in the Armed Forces and those men and women who continue to \nfight in Iraq with such bravery and such valor that we cannot forget \nwhat they do. Every Member in the Senate honors the sacrifice which our \ntroops and their families have made over the past 4 years. That \nsacrifice will not, cannot, and will never be forgotten.\n  It is also important to remember that no matter how contentious the \ndebate might become in the weeks and months ahead, every Senator shares \nthe same basic goals: The goal is simply peace and stability in the \nMiddle East and a safe return of our troops to their homeland.\n  We may disagree on the best path to the end. It is important to \nremember what binds us together as America so we will not be torn too \nfar apart and we can help end the divisiveness which has occurred in \nour country over this issue and move forward in a bipartisan way to \nrestore the greatness of America in the world.\n  It is my hope the anticipated debate that will occur will be with a \nspirit of bipartisanship and with a spirit of civility. I am especially \npleased we have arrived at a bipartisan resolution\n\n[[Page S1488]]\n\nwhich plainly states Congress does, in fact, support a new direction in \nIraq. I commend the efforts of the bipartisan group of Senators who \nworked together to provide a positive framework for protecting our \nnational security, supporting our troops, and defining our mission in \nIraq. That compromise resolution reflects the will of the American \npeople that we must, in fact, chart a new course of success in Iraq.\n\n  I especially commend the leadership and the great efforts of Senator \nWarner, Senator Nelson, Senator Collins, Senator Levin, Senator Biden, \nSenator Hagel, and others who have been involved in this effort over \nthe last several days.\n  Until now, the debate over our mission in Iraq has been dominated by \nessentially what has been a false choice. On the one hand, we have had \nbefore Congress and before the American people plan A, which is the \nPresident's plan, which essentially has been to say, stay the course, \nplus, add another 21,500 troops into the fight in Baghdad. This would \nbe a mistake. It would put more American troops into the middle of a \ncivil war and places too much faith in what has been, to us, an \nincompetent Iraqi Government that has failed to do its work in securing \nthe peace for its people and their country.\n  On the other hand, we have plan B, which is advocated by some Members \nof Congress, both in the House and this Senate, which calls for a more \nor less precipitous withdrawal from Iraq. From my point of view, this, \ntoo, is a bad choice. It could open the door to even more bloodshed and \nto a dangerous regionwide military escalation not only in Iraq but \nthroughout the Middle East.\n  In my view, what we need is a plan C. That plan C should reflect the \nbipartisan opposition to the President's proposal to send an additional \n21,500 troops to Iraq and also propose an alternative strategy for \nsuccess in Iraq. That is exactly what we have accomplished with this \ncompromise resolution which would make clear the following: First, that \na bipartisan majority of Senators disagrees with the President's plan \nto increase the number of United States troops in Iraq as he has \nproposed; second, that the primary objective of a United States \nstrategy in Iraq should be to encourage the Iraqi leaders to make the \npolitical compromises that are necessary to improve security, foster \nreconciliation, strengthen the Government, and end the violence; third, \nthat the United States has an important role to play in helping to \nmaintain the territorial integrity of Iraq, conducting counterterrorism \nactivities, promoting regional stability and training and equipping the \nIraqi troops; and, finally, that the United States should engage the \nnations in the Middle East to develop a regional, internationally \nsponsored peace and reconciliation diplomatic process and initiative \nwithin Iraq and throughout the region.\n  I will briefly elaborate on some of these points. The President's \nplan to simply surge or increase the number of troops in Iraq by 21,500 \nwould be a mistake. First, the violence in Iraq is becoming \nincreasingly sectarian, even intrasectarian. I worry that the American \ntroops we are sending there are being placed in what is the midst of a \ncivil war.\n  Second, I also worry that the larger American military presence will \ndiscourage the Iraqis from taking responsibility for their own \nsecurity. As General John Abizaid said in this Capitol last November:\n\n       . . . it's easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do this \n     work. I believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis \n     from taking more responsibility for their own future.\n\n  As we enter the debate over the next several days and weeks in this \nSenate, we should not forget those words:\n\n       I believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     taking more responsibility for their own future.\n\n  Furthermore, I am concerned that the plan places too much faith in \nthe present Iraqi Government, which has so far shown little willingness \nto make the difficult decisions necessary to stop the bloodshed and the \nviolence within their own country.\n  Finally, we have recent experience where the additional troops who \nhave been sent into Iraq indicate that the results of those operations \nof the last 7 to 8 months have not been successful. Last year, we tried \ntwo separate surges--one was named Operation Together Forward I and the \nother was Operation Together Forward II--and neither stopped or slowed \nthe violence in Iraq.\n  In fact, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group found that the violence had \nescalated during that same time period by 43 percent.\n  Adding to this is all the additional strain that a troop increase \nwill place on our service men and women and their families.\n  For these reasons, I oppose the President's plan to increase our \ntroop presence in Iraq. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the resolution \nthat will be before this Senate. This resolution is more than about \nopposing the President's plan. It proposes a new strategy by calling \nfor an enhanced diplomatic effort, a new focus on maintaining the \nterritorial integrity of Iraq, maintaining the territorial integrity of \nIraq, so that the weapons that are flowing from Iran and from Syria \ninto that country can, in fact, be stopped. Stopping the flow of \nweapons and terrorists into that country will be part of bringing about \nthe security that is needed in that country.\n  It also calls for a renewed focus on helping the Iraqis achieve a \npolitical settlement which is, at the end, a precondition to any \nsuccessful outcome in Iraq.\n  We need a new direction in Iraq. We need to speak in a bipartisan \nvoice. We, as an institution, need to fulfill our constitutional duty \nas a coequal branch of Government as we move forward with what is one \nof the most important questions that today faces the American Nation.\n  The resolution I hope will be considered in the Senate this next week \nis a first step in that direction. I am proud to be a sponsor and a \nsupporter of that resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1486-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1486-S1488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AMERICA'S ECONOMIC HEALTH\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

The \nsubsequent Andean Free Trade Agreement fell apart before it even began. \nTwo years ago, thousands of workers in Central America took to the \nstreets protesting this failed trade policy. Last week, tens of \nthousands of workers in Korea took to the streets protesting a pending \nfree-trade agreement with our country. Why? Again, because the \nadministration continues to use a failed trade model for these \nagreements. Revamping U.S. trade policy is not just about taking better \nhold of our economic health; it is about establishing priorities in \nWashington that reflect family values at home and building strong \nrelationships with trading partners abroad.\n  While the administration continues to be out of touch with Main \nStreet, I am pleased to say that finally in this Congress there is a \nbipartisan fair trade effort underway. I am working with Democratic \nSenator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota and Republican Senator Lindsey \nGraham of South Carolina on a new direction for trade policy. It is not \na question of if we trade but how we trade and who, in fact, benefits \nfrom trade.\n\n  While discussing the minimum wage this week, Senator Kennedy used \nthese charts to illustrate the development over time of drastic \neconomic inequality in our country. From 1946 to 1973, economic \nopportunities for poor and working families grew. The lowest 20 percent \nactually had higher growth, percentagewise, than the top 20 percent in \nthis country. The families who worked hard and played by the rules had \na real chance of getting ahead.\n  From 1973 to 2000, things began to change dramatically. From 1973 to \n2000, the lowest 20 percent had the lowest growth in their incomes; the \ntop 20 percent had the fastest growth. It so happened in the year 1973, \ntwo things happened: the oil embargo, with the price of oil shooting \nup; second, 1973 was the year when the United States, historically with \ntrade surpluses, fell into trade deficits, and we have been in trade \ndeficit ever since 1973.\n  If we look again at this chart, from 1946 to 1973, for 26 years, \neconomic growth was shared equally, with the lowest 20 percent actually \ngrowing at the fastest rate and the top 20 percent at the lowest rate. \nSince 1973, when our country went from persistent trade surpluses to \npersistent trade deficits, growing more and more and more every year, \nthe lowest 20 percent now have the lowest growth rate, by far. The \nhighest top 20 percent have the fastest growth rate, by far.\n  We should also look at what has happened to the trade deficit. In \n1972, the year I first ran for Congress, our country had a $38 billion \ntrade deficit. In 2006, when the numbers are finalized, our trade \ndeficit will exceed $800 billion. We went from a $38 billion to a $800 \nbillion trade deficit. As President Bush first pointed out, back in \n1989-1990, $1 billion in trade deficit or trade surplus translates into \n13,000 jobs. So do the math: $1 billion in trade deficit translates \ninto 13,000 lost jobs. Our trade deficit is now $800 billion for the \nyear 2006. Our trade deficit with China in 1992, the year I first ran \nfor the House of Representatives, our trade deficit with China was \nbarely into the double digits. Today our trade deficit with China has \nreached about $250 billion.\n  It is clear our trade policy has failed. We have given countries such \nas China, countries that exploit sweatshop labor and manipulate their \ncurrency, an unfair and unnecessary advantage.\n  If trade agreements can be crafted to protect drug patents and drug \ncompanies, those same trade agreements can protect the environment. If \ntrade agreements can be crafted to protect international property \nrights and Hollywood films, the same trade agreements can protect \nworkers, small American businesses and our communities.\n  Current U.S. trade policy allows for the inhumane exploitation of \nforeign workers; it exacerbates job losses in places such as Lima and \nZanesville, OH. It puts local businesses--particularly small tool and \ndie, machine shops, small manufacturers--at an unfair disadvantage, \nforcing thousands of them to close, as large corporations move to \nMexico, China, and elsewhere overseas.\n  In my home State of Ohio, more than 40,000 jobs have been lost to \nChina in the last decade, allowing foreign companies to pay slave \nwages, to abuse their workers, and to lie about their business \npractices hurts Americans. It hurts American workers. It hurts American \nbusinesses.\n  This country is already hard at work to change our trade policy to \npromote fair trade that works for U.S. businesses. We want trade \ndefined differently. We want different trade practices. We want trade \nthat will help small business, that will help workers, and that will \nstem the exploitation of workers in developing nations.\n  No longer are Democrats and Republicans in Congress going to stand \nidly by while businesses and workers in Ohio, businesses and workers in \nplaces such as Gallipolis and Springfield and Lima are penalized for \nplaying by the rules.\n  In the last Congress, we changed the debate on trade. In this \nCongress, we will change the face of trade.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask to speak for up to 10 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, as we anticipate the beginning of the \ndiscussion and debate with respect to the future of the involvement of \nthe United States in Iraq, it is important for Members always in this \nChamber to remember we are all unified in honoring the men and women \nwho serve in the Armed Forces and those men and women who continue to \nfight in Iraq with such bravery and such valor that we cannot forget \nwhat they do. Every Member in the Senate honors the sacrifice which our \ntroops and their families have made over the past 4 years. That \nsacrifice will not, cannot, and will never be forgotten.\n  It is also important to remember that no matter how contentious the \ndebate might become in the weeks and months ahead, every Senator shares \nthe same basic goals: The goal is simply peace and stability in the \nMiddle East and a safe return of our troops to their homeland.\n  We may disagree on the best path to the end. It is important to \nremember what binds us together as America so we will not be torn too \nfar apart and we can help end the divisiveness which has occurred in \nour country over this issue and move forward in a bipartisan way to \nrestore the greatness of America in the world.\n  It is my hope the anticipated debate that will occur will be with a \nspirit of bipartisanship and with a spirit of civility. I am especially \npleased we have arrived at a bipartisan resolution\n\n[[Page S1488]]\n\nwhich plainly states Congress does, in fact, support a new direction in \nIraq. I commend the efforts of the bipartisan group of Senators who \nworked together to provide a positive framework for protecting our \nnational security, supporting our troops, and defining our mission in \nIraq. That compromise resolution reflects the will of the American \npeople that we must, in fact, chart a new course of success in Iraq.\n\n  I especially commend the leadership and the great efforts of Senator \nWarner, Senator Nelson, Senator Collins, Senator Levin, Senator Biden, \nSenator Hagel, and others who have been involved in this effort over \nthe last several days.\n  Until now, the debate over our mission in Iraq has been dominated by \nessentially what has been a false choice. On the one hand, we have had \nbefore Congress and before the American people plan A, which is the \nPresident's plan, which essentially has been to say, stay the course, \nplus, add another 21,500 troops into the fight in Baghdad. This would \nbe a mistake. It would put more American troops into the middle of a \ncivil war and places too much faith in what has been, to us, an \nincompetent Iraqi Government that has failed to do its work in securing \nthe peace for its people and their country.\n  On the other hand, we have plan B, which is advocated by some Members \nof Congress, both in the House and this Senate, which calls for a more \nor less precipitous withdrawal from Iraq. From my point of view, this, \ntoo, is a bad choice. It could open the door to even more bloodshed and \nto a dangerous regionwide military escalation not only in Iraq but \nthroughout the Middle East.\n  In my view, what we need is a plan C. That plan C should reflect the \nbipartisan opposition to the President's proposal to send an additional \n21,500 troops to Iraq and also propose an alternative strategy for \nsuccess in Iraq. That is exactly what we have accomplished with this \ncompromise resolution which would make clear the following: First, that \na bipartisan majority of Senators disagrees with the President's plan \nto increase the number of United States troops in Iraq as he has \nproposed; second, that the primary objective of a United States \nstrategy in Iraq should be to encourage the Iraqi leaders to make the \npolitical compromises that are necessary to improve security, foster \nreconciliation, strengthen the Government, and end the violence; third, \nthat the United States has an important role to play in helping to \nmaintain the territorial integrity of Iraq, conducting counterterrorism \nactivities, promoting regional stability and training and equipping the \nIraqi troops; and, finally, that the United States should engage the \nnations in the Middle East to develop a regional, internationally \nsponsored peace and reconciliation diplomatic process and initiative \nwithin Iraq and throughout the region.\n  I will briefly elaborate on some of these points. The President's \nplan to simply surge or increase the number of troops in Iraq by 21,500 \nwould be a mistake. First, the violence in Iraq is becoming \nincreasingly sectarian, even intrasectarian. I worry that the American \ntroops we are sending there are being placed in what is the midst of a \ncivil war.\n  Second, I also worry that the larger American military presence will \ndiscourage the Iraqis from taking responsibility for their own \nsecurity. As General John Abizaid said in this Capitol last November:\n\n       . . . it's easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do this \n     work. I believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis \n     from taking more responsibility for their own future.\n\n  As we enter the debate over the next several days and weeks in this \nSenate, we should not forget those words:\n\n       I believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     taking more responsibility for their own future.\n\n  Furthermore, I am concerned that the plan places too much faith in \nthe present Iraqi Government, which has so far shown little willingness \nto make the difficult decisions necessary to stop the bloodshed and the \nviolence within their own country.\n  Finally, we have recent experience where the additional troops who \nhave been sent into Iraq indicate that the results of those operations \nof the last 7 to 8 months have not been successful. Last year, we tried \ntwo separate surges--one was named Operation Together Forward I and the \nother was Operation Together Forward II--and neither stopped or slowed \nthe violence in Iraq.\n  In fact, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group found that the violence had \nescalated during that same time period by 43 percent.\n  Adding to this is all the additional strain that a troop increase \nwill place on our service men and women and their families.\n  For these reasons, I oppose the President's plan to increase our \ntroop presence in Iraq. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the resolution \nthat will be before this Senate. This resolution is more than about \nopposing the President's plan. It proposes a new strategy by calling \nfor an enhanced diplomatic effort, a new focus on maintaining the \nterritorial integrity of Iraq, maintaining the territorial integrity of \nIraq, so that the weapons that are flowing from Iran and from Syria \ninto that country can, in fact, be stopped. Stopping the flow of \nweapons and terrorists into that country will be part of bringing about \nthe security that is needed in that country.\n  It also calls for a renewed focus on helping the Iraqis achieve a \npolitical settlement which is, at the end, a precondition to any \nsuccessful outcome in Iraq.\n  We need a new direction in Iraq. We need to speak in a bipartisan \nvoice. We, as an institution, need to fulfill our constitutional duty \nas a coequal branch of Government as we move forward with what is one \nof the most important questions that today faces the American Nation.\n  The resolution I hope will be considered in the Senate this next week \nis a first step in that direction. I am proud to be a sponsor and a \nsupporter of that resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1488-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR.

Madam President, I rise to discuss an amendment I have \nfiled to eliminate a provision that was added to the minimum wage bill \nregarding employee leasing firms, also known as professional employer \norganizations, or PEOs.\n  I have fought for a clean minimum wage bill, on the grounds that \nworkers have been waiting 10 long years for this raise. During that \ntime, businesses have seen record profits and productivity--and that \nhas been equally the case in States and regions that have raised the \nminimum wage. Yet now we are being asked to include this aggressively \nanti-worker PEO provision in order to pass a minimum wage increase in \nthe Senate.\n  For my colleagues and others who may not know what a PEO is, let me \nexplain. It is an organization that handles administrative details for \nworkers who actually do work for another company. For example, I might \ntechnically be employed by Tristate PEO, but I actually show up to work \nevery day at Main Street Construction Company. Companies use PEOs so \nthey don't have to handle the tax-and-benefits paperwork for many of \ntheir workers.\n  The language in the PEO provision, however, seeks to make these PEOs \nthe ``employer of record'' for tax purposes. PEOs have sought to become \nthe ``employer of record'' under various laws because they would like \nto be able to tell employers that the PEOs can independently take care \nof payroll taxes, workers' compensation, unemployment\n\n[[Page S1489]]\n\ninsurance, and the like. However, in the past, PEOs have misrepresented \nwhat jobs are covered by workman's compensation--for instance, by \ncharacterizing construction workers as clerical. Under current law, \nlegal responsibility for employer obligations typically remains partly \nor wholly with the worksite employer.\n  Making a PEO the sole employer makes the evasion of labor and \nemployment standards much easier. The National Employment Law Project \nand other worker-rights advocates have concluded that the language now \nin the bill would make it harder for employees to go to an arbiter and \nget unpaid overtime, unemployment insurance benefits, or workman's \ncompensation benefits if the PEO collapses. And this is by no means \nhypothetical. Such collapses have happened not just with small, fly-by-\nnight operations, but with large PEOs like Administaff and Simplified \nEmployment Services, SES.\n  For example, when SES allowed health insurance premiums to go unpaid \nand then went bankrupt, it left employees like Melanie Martin out in \nthe cold. She said ``We trusted him to pay our insurance premiums, and \nnow I'm stuck with a $7,000 surgery bill. Every time I think about \nthis, I cry.''\n  In 2004, when MidAtlantic Postal Express in Roanoke, VA, went \nbankrupt, the U.S. Treasury wasn't the only one left holding the bag. \nEmployees were left wondering where to turn for thousands of dollars in \nback pay. Victory Compensation Services was the PEO handling the \nworkers' pay and benefits, and admitted that workers had no workman's \ncompensation coverage even though MidAtlantic had paid Victory \npremiums. But Victory blamed MidAtlantic for the unpaid payroll.\n  Now, let's say that you are newly unemployed trucker who is owed \n$7,000 in back pay. This is a complicated mess for a worker to try to \nnavigate just to get a paycheck that he or she is owed.\n  This is part of a larger, systemic problem. Working people in the \nUnited States feel less and less empowered in our you're-on-your-own \nsociety. Seventy percent of families are headed by either dual-income \ncouples or a single parent. The housing bubble is bursting. \nGlobalization is sending American jobs overseas. Pensions are being \nfrozen at an unprecedented pace. The national savings rate has actually \ngone into negative figures. Women are working an average of 500 more \nhours more per year than in 1979. But productivity has increased 70 \npercent since then. People are working harder and getting paid less.\n  In this context of economic anxiety, we shouldn't be making it even \nharder for workers to organize, negotiate or enforce contracts, or \nfight for their rights under law. But that will be the sure-fire result \nif the final bill has this PEO provision in it.\n  I urge my colleagues to strip this provision from the bill. We must \nnot sacrifice worker rights in exchange for this modest and long-\noverdue increase in the wages for those at the lowest rungs of the \neconomic ladder.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I have long supported an increase in the \nminimum wage. I am pleased that, with the leadership of the new \nmajority in Congress, this minimum wage increase will be passed by a \nbipartisan majority.\n  In 1996 Congress raised the minimum wage by 90 cents an hour in two \nsteps to $5.15 an hour. That increase was enacted more than 10 years \nago. Since then, the real value of that wage has eroded by 21 percent \nand the nearly 5.5 million workers earning the minimum wage have \nalready lost all of the gains from the 1996-1997 increase. Since then, \nGallup polls have shown that 86 percent of small business owners do not \nthink that the minimum wage affects their business, and nearly half of \nsmall business owners think that the minimum wage should be increased. \nSince then, 29 States, including Michigan, as well as the District of \nColumbia have recognized the importance of keeping our working families \nout of poverty by increasing State minimum wages.\n  Unfortunately, since the 1970s, poverty has increased by 50 percent \namong full-time, year-round workers. Currently, 37 million Americans, \nincluding 13 million children, live in poverty. As the most prosperous \nnation in the world, our minimum wage should be a living wage, and it \nis not. When a father or mother works full time, 40 hours a week, year-\nround, they should be able to lift their family out of poverty. A full-\ntime minimum wage laborer working 40 hours a week for 52 weeks earns \n$10,700 per year--more than $6,000 below the Federal poverty guidelines \nfor a family of three.\n  I believe that a full-time minimum wage job should provide a minimum \nstandard of living in addition to giving workers the dignity that comes \nwith a paycheck. These lower paid workers, many of whom have entered \nthe workforce due to the welfare reform, should be rewarded for \nentering the workforce, not penalized by a poverty wage. A higher \nminimum wage has the potential to ensure that lower paid workers will \nbe protected from falling into poverty and possibly back on the welfare \nrolls. The minimum wage increase during the recession in 1991 provided \nmuch needed income to poor people and helped to increase spending in \nthe economy. 58 percent of the benefit of the 1996 increase went to \nfamilies in the bottom 40 percent of income groups. Over one-third of \nthe benefit went to the poorest families--those in the bottom 20 \npercent of income groups.\n  Today the real value of the minimum wage is $4.00 below what it was \nin 1968. To have the purchasing power it had in 1968, the minimum wage \nwould have to be at least $9.37 an hour today, not $5.15. According to \nthe United States Department of Labor, over 60 percent of minimum wage \nearners are women; almost 40 percent are minorities, and nearly 80 \npercent are adults. These hardworking Americans deserve a fair deal.\n  In addition to the long overdue minimum wage provision, this bill \ncontains a package of tax provisions. I am pleased that these include a \nnumber of measures to crack down on abusive tax dodges, including an \nimprovement to current law to end the tax benefits received by \ncompanies that reincorporate and set up shell headquarters in offshore \ntax havens.\n  I am also pleased that the bill extends the work opportunity tax \ncredit, which allows employers credit against wages for hiring workers \nfrom targeted groups such as recipients of public assistance, qualified \nveterans, and ``high risk'' youth. I have heard from a number of \nMichigan companies that the WOTC program is important to them in their \nhiring members of these targeted groups, and I am pleased that this \nprovision will be extended through the end of 2012.\n  I am also pleased that the tax provisions would put in place a limit \non the amount that corporate executives and other highly paid employees \ncan place tax-free into deferred compensation plans. Under current law, \npublic companies cannot deduct more than $1 million per year for \ncompensation paid to their top officers. However, compensation that is \n``deferred,'' meaning the employee doesn't have immediate access to it, \nis not subject to this $1 million limit; so deferred compensation \npackages have become a main way that company executives can get multi-\nmillion dollar compensation packages while their companies continue to \ntake a tax write-off.\n  We have seen these excessive packages time and again in recent \nstories about runaway executive compensation totaling tens of millions \nof dollars. Tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars have been \nsalted away in this fashion for corporate executives, and companies \nhave simply found another way to game the system by excluding this \n``deferred compensation'' from those individuals' income for the year. \nIt is more than time for Congress to put an end to this game which has \nfueled excessive executive pay.\n  This bill would set a limit on the amount of compensation that could \nreceive tax deferral at the lower of $1 million annually or the average \nof the previous 5 years compensation. The ability of corporate \nexecutives to defer tax on up to $1 million in compensation is still a \nsignificant benefit that stands in stark contrast to the minimum wage \nwe are attempting to raise for those at the lowest end of the pay \nscale.\n  It is only right that those who are at the low end of the pay scale \nwho work hard should receive a fair wage and be able to support their \nfamilies. These people do not always have the leverage to negotiate a \nfair salary. This bill to increase the minimum wage will help to move \nthem to a more livable wage.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I will unavoidably miss the final vote \non\n\n[[Page S1490]]\n\nthe minimum wage bill but I come down here now to ask unanimous consent \nthat the Record reflect, immediately after the vote, my announcement \nthat I would have voted against this bill.\n  In so doing, I remain consistent on the issue. Government is best \nwhen it is does not pick winners and losers--when it does not \ncompetitively advantage one group of people over another or one set of \nStates over another.\n  Senator DeMint offered an amendment to equally and fairly increase \nthe minimum wage by $2.10 for each State over what the wage is today.\n  The fact that the liberals voted against the DeMint amendment is \nproof that their bill as now constituted is really about damaging the \ncompetitiveness of middle America--the so-called red States, \ndisparagingly called `'fly-over country'' by liberals--compared to the \nliberal fringe States.\n  Without this amendment, the underlying legislation would partially \nexempt minimum wage workers in higher-cost States that already have \nState minimum wage rates greater than the Federal level of $5.15 an \nhour, and completely exempt minimum wage workers in highest-cost States \nthat have State minimum wage rates near $7.25 an hour.\n  The DeMint amendment would increase the Federal minimum wage equally \nfor workers in all States at the same rate as H.R. 2 would increase the \nminimum wage from the current Federal minimum wage rate.\n  Senator Kennedy's arguments against this amendment have been both \nconfusing and contradictory. On the one hand, he said that we need a \none-size-fits-all mandate, and then he said that Massachusetts has a \nhigher cost of living.\n  I will not stand for people in Washington, DC, damaging the \ncompetitiveness of Oklahoma against other States. If Oklahomans vote to \nchange our own laws, that is one thing, but we are not going to buckle \nunder to DC and the liberal fringe States.\n  Thus I would vote nay.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following chart be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as

\n\n[Pages S1488-S1490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007--Continued\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I rise to discuss an amendment I have \nfiled to eliminate a provision that was added to the minimum wage bill \nregarding employee leasing firms, also known as professional employer \norganizations, or PEOs.\n  I have fought for a clean minimum wage bill, on the grounds that \nworkers have been waiting 10 long years for this raise. During that \ntime, businesses have seen record profits and productivity--and that \nhas been equally the case in States and regions that have raised the \nminimum wage. Yet now we are being asked to include this aggressively \nanti-worker PEO provision in order to pass a minimum wage increase in \nthe Senate.\n  For my colleagues and others who may not know what a PEO is, let me \nexplain. It is an organization that handles administrative details for \nworkers who actually do work for another company. For example, I might \ntechnically be employed by Tristate PEO, but I actually show up to work \nevery day at Main Street Construction Company. Companies use PEOs so \nthey don't have to handle the tax-and-benefits paperwork for many of \ntheir workers.\n  The language in the PEO provision, however, seeks to make these PEOs \nthe ``employer of record'' for tax purposes. PEOs have sought to become \nthe ``employer of record'' under various laws because they would like \nto be able to tell employers that the PEOs can independently take care \nof payroll taxes, workers' compensation, unemployment\n\n[[Page S1489]]\n\ninsurance, and the like. However, in the past, PEOs have misrepresented \nwhat jobs are covered by workman's compensation--for instance, by \ncharacterizing construction workers as clerical. Under current law, \nlegal responsibility for employer obligations typically remains partly \nor wholly with the worksite employer.\n  Making a PEO the sole employer makes the evasion of labor and \nemployment standards much easier. The National Employment Law Project \nand other worker-rights advocates have concluded that the language now \nin the bill would make it harder for employees to go to an arbiter and \nget unpaid overtime, unemployment insurance benefits, or workman's \ncompensation benefits if the PEO collapses. And this is by no means \nhypothetical. Such collapses have happened not just with small, fly-by-\nnight operations, but with large PEOs like Administaff and Simplified \nEmployment Services, SES.\n  For example, when SES allowed health insurance premiums to go unpaid \nand then went bankrupt, it left employees like Melanie Martin out in \nthe cold. She said ``We trusted him to pay our insurance premiums, and \nnow I'm stuck with a $7,000 surgery bill. Every time I think about \nthis, I cry.''\n  In 2004, when MidAtlantic Postal Express in Roanoke, VA, went \nbankrupt, the U.S. Treasury wasn't the only one left holding the bag. \nEmployees were left wondering where to turn for thousands of dollars in \nback pay. Victory Compensation Services was the PEO handling the \nworkers' pay and benefits, and admitted that workers had no workman's \ncompensation coverage even though MidAtlantic had paid Victory \npremiums. But Victory blamed MidAtlantic for the unpaid payroll.\n  Now, let's say that you are newly unemployed trucker who is owed \n$7,000 in back pay. This is a complicated mess for a worker to try to \nnavigate just to get a paycheck that he or she is owed.\n  This is part of a larger, systemic problem. Working people in the \nUnited States feel less and less empowered in our you're-on-your-own \nsociety. Seventy percent of families are headed by either dual-income \ncouples or a single parent. The housing bubble is bursting. \nGlobalization is sending American jobs overseas. Pensions are being \nfrozen at an unprecedented pace. The national savings rate has actually \ngone into negative figures. Women are working an average of 500 more \nhours more per year than in 1979. But productivity has increased 70 \npercent since then. People are working harder and getting paid less.\n  In this context of economic anxiety, we shouldn't be making it even \nharder for workers to organize, negotiate or enforce contracts, or \nfight for their rights under law. But that will be the sure-fire result \nif the final bill has this PEO provision in it.\n  I urge my colleagues to strip this provision from the bill. We must \nnot sacrifice worker rights in exchange for this modest and long-\noverdue increase in the wages for those at the lowest rungs of the \neconomic ladder.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I have long supported an increase in the \nminimum wage. I am pleased that, with the leadership of the new \nmajority in Congress, this minimum wage increase will be passed by a \nbipartisan majority.\n  In 1996 Congress raised the minimum wage by 90 cents an hour in two \nsteps to $5.15 an hour. That increase was enacted more than 10 years \nago. Since then, the real value of that wage has eroded by 21 percent \nand the nearly 5.5 million workers earning the minimum wage have \nalready lost all of the gains from the 1996-1997 increase. Since then, \nGallup polls have shown that 86 percent of small business owners do not \nthink that the minimum wage affects their business, and nearly half of \nsmall business owners think that the minimum wage should be increased. \nSince then, 29 States, including Michigan, as well as the District of \nColumbia have recognized the importance of keeping our working families \nout of poverty by increasing State minimum wages.\n  Unfortunately, since the 1970s, poverty has increased by 50 percent \namong full-time, year-round workers. Currently, 37 million Americans, \nincluding 13 million children, live in poverty. As the most prosperous \nnation in the world, our minimum wage should be a living wage, and it \nis not. When a father or mother works full time, 40 hours a week, year-\nround, they should be able to lift their family out of poverty. A full-\ntime minimum wage laborer working 40 hours a week for 52 weeks earns \n$10,700 per year--more than $6,000 below the Federal poverty guidelines \nfor a family of three.\n  I believe that a full-time minimum wage job should provide a minimum \nstandard of living in addition to giving workers the dignity that comes \nwith a paycheck. These lower paid workers, many of whom have entered \nthe workforce due to the welfare reform, should be rewarded for \nentering the workforce, not penalized by a poverty wage. A higher \nminimum wage has the potential to ensure that lower paid workers will \nbe protected from falling into poverty and possibly back on the welfare \nrolls. The minimum wage increase during the recession in 1991 provided \nmuch needed income to poor people and helped to increase spending in \nthe economy. 58 percent of the benefit of the 1996 increase went to \nfamilies in the bottom 40 percent of income groups. Over one-third of \nthe benefit went to the poorest families--those in the bottom 20 \npercent of income groups.\n  Today the real value of the minimum wage is $4.00 below what it was \nin 1968. To have the purchasing power it had in 1968, the minimum wage \nwould have to be at least $9.37 an hour today, not $5.15. According to \nthe United States Department of Labor, over 60 percent of minimum wage \nearners are women; almost 40 percent are minorities, and nearly 80 \npercent are adults. These hardworking Americans deserve a fair deal.\n  In addition to the long overdue minimum wage provision, this bill \ncontains a package of tax provisions. I am pleased that these include a \nnumber of measures to crack down on abusive tax dodges, including an \nimprovement to current law to end the tax benefits received by \ncompanies that reincorporate and set up shell headquarters in offshore \ntax havens.\n  I am also pleased that the bill extends the work opportunity tax \ncredit, which allows employers credit against wages for hiring workers \nfrom targeted groups such as recipients of public assistance, qualified \nveterans, and ``high risk'' youth. I have heard from a number of \nMichigan companies that the WOTC program is important to them in their \nhiring members of these targeted groups, and I am pleased that this \nprovision will be extended through the end of 2012.\n  I am also pleased that the tax provisions would put in place a limit \non the amount that corporate executives and other highly paid employees \ncan place tax-free into deferred compensation plans. Under current law, \npublic companies cannot deduct more than $1 million per year for \ncompensation paid to their top officers. However, compensation that is \n``deferred,'' meaning the employee doesn't have immediate access to it, \nis not subject to this $1 million limit; so deferred compensation \npackages have become a main way that company executives can get multi-\nmillion dollar compensation packages while their companies continue to \ntake a tax write-off.\n  We have seen these excessive packages time and again in recent \nstories about runaway executive compensation totaling tens of millions \nof dollars. Tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars have been \nsalted away in this fashion for corporate executives, and companies \nhave simply found another way to game the system by excluding this \n``deferred compensation'' from those individuals' income for the year. \nIt is more than time for Congress to put an end to this game which has \nfueled excessive executive pay.\n  This bill would set a limit on the amount of compensation that could \nreceive tax deferral at the lower of $1 million annually or the average \nof the previous 5 years compensation. The ability of corporate \nexecutives to defer tax on up to $1 million in compensation is still a \nsignificant benefit that stands in stark contrast to the minimum wage \nwe are attempting to raise for those at the lowest end of the pay \nscale.\n  It is only right that those who are at the low end of the pay scale \nwho work hard should receive a fair wage and be able to support their \nfamilies. These people do not always have the leverage to negotiate a \nfair salary. This bill to increase the minimum wage will help to move \nthem to a more livable wage.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I will unavoidably miss the final vote \non\n\n[[Page S1490]]\n\nthe minimum wage bill but I come down here now to ask unanimous consent \nthat the Record reflect, immediately after the vote, my announcement \nthat I would have voted against this bill.\n  In so doing, I remain consistent on the issue. Government is best \nwhen it is does not pick winners and losers--when it does not \ncompetitively advantage one group of people over another or one set of \nStates over another.\n  Senator DeMint offered an amendment to equally and fairly increase \nthe minimum wage by $2.10 for each State over what the wage is today.\n  The fact that the liberals voted against the DeMint amendment is \nproof that their bill as now constituted is really about damaging the \ncompetitiveness of middle America--the so-called red States, \ndisparagingly called `'fly-over country'' by liberals--compared to the \nliberal fringe States.\n  Without this amendment, the underlying legislation would partially \nexempt minimum wage workers in higher-cost States that already have \nState minimum wage rates greater than the Federal level of $5.15 an \nhour, and completely exempt minimum wage workers in highest-cost States \nthat have State minimum wage rates near $7.25 an hour.\n  The DeMint amendment would increase the Federal minimum wage equally \nfor workers in all States at the same rate as H.R. 2 would increase the \nminimum wage from the current Federal minimum wage rate.\n  Senator Kennedy's arguments against this amendment have been both \nconfusing and contradictory. On the one hand, he said that we need a \none-size-fits-all mandate, and then he said that Massachusetts has a \nhigher cost of living.\n  I will not stand for people in Washington, DC, damaging the \ncompetitiveness of Oklahoma against other States. If Oklahomans vote to \nchange our own laws, that is one thing, but we are not going to buckle \nunder to DC and the liberal fringe States.\n  Thus I would vote nay.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following chart be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Current       Kennedy Proposal

\n\n[Pages S1488-S1490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007--Continued\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I rise to discuss an amendment I have \nfiled to eliminate a provision that was added to the minimum wage bill \nregarding employee leasing firms, also known as professional employer \norganizations, or PEOs.\n  I have fought for a clean minimum wage bill, on the grounds that \nworkers have been waiting 10 long years for this raise. During that \ntime, businesses have seen record profits and productivity--and that \nhas been equally the case in States and regions that have raised the \nminimum wage. Yet now we are being asked to include this aggressively \nanti-worker PEO provision in order to pass a minimum wage increase in \nthe Senate.\n  For my colleagues and others who may not know what a PEO is, let me \nexplain. It is an organization that handles administrative details for \nworkers who actually do work for another company. For example, I might \ntechnically be employed by Tristate PEO, but I actually show up to work \nevery day at Main Street Construction Company. Companies use PEOs so \nthey don't have to handle the tax-and-benefits paperwork for many of \ntheir workers.\n  The language in the PEO provision, however, seeks to make these PEOs \nthe ``employer of record'' for tax purposes. PEOs have sought to become \nthe ``employer of record'' under various laws because they would like \nto be able to tell employers that the PEOs can independently take care \nof payroll taxes, workers' compensation, unemployment\n\n[[Page S1489]]\n\ninsurance, and the like. However, in the past, PEOs have misrepresented \nwhat jobs are covered by workman's compensation--for instance, by \ncharacterizing construction workers as clerical. Under current law, \nlegal responsibility for employer obligations typically remains partly \nor wholly with the worksite employer.\n  Making a PEO the sole employer makes the evasion of labor and \nemployment standards much easier. The National Employment Law Project \nand other worker-rights advocates have concluded that the language now \nin the bill would make it harder for employees to go to an arbiter and \nget unpaid overtime, unemployment insurance benefits, or workman's \ncompensation benefits if the PEO collapses. And this is by no means \nhypothetical. Such collapses have happened not just with small, fly-by-\nnight operations, but with large PEOs like Administaff and Simplified \nEmployment Services, SES.\n  For example, when SES allowed health insurance premiums to go unpaid \nand then went bankrupt, it left employees like Melanie Martin out in \nthe cold. She said ``We trusted him to pay our insurance premiums, and \nnow I'm stuck with a $7,000 surgery bill. Every time I think about \nthis, I cry.''\n  In 2004, when MidAtlantic Postal Express in Roanoke, VA, went \nbankrupt, the U.S. Treasury wasn't the only one left holding the bag. \nEmployees were left wondering where to turn for thousands of dollars in \nback pay. Victory Compensation Services was the PEO handling the \nworkers' pay and benefits, and admitted that workers had no workman's \ncompensation coverage even though MidAtlantic had paid Victory \npremiums. But Victory blamed MidAtlantic for the unpaid payroll.\n  Now, let's say that you are newly unemployed trucker who is owed \n$7,000 in back pay. This is a complicated mess for a worker to try to \nnavigate just to get a paycheck that he or she is owed.\n  This is part of a larger, systemic problem. Working people in the \nUnited States feel less and less empowered in our you're-on-your-own \nsociety. Seventy percent of families are headed by either dual-income \ncouples or a single parent. The housing bubble is bursting. \nGlobalization is sending American jobs overseas. Pensions are being \nfrozen at an unprecedented pace. The national savings rate has actually \ngone into negative figures. Women are working an average of 500 more \nhours more per year than in 1979. But productivity has increased 70 \npercent since then. People are working harder and getting paid less.\n  In this context of economic anxiety, we shouldn't be making it even \nharder for workers to organize, negotiate or enforce contracts, or \nfight for their rights under law. But that will be the sure-fire result \nif the final bill has this PEO provision in it.\n  I urge my colleagues to strip this provision from the bill. We must \nnot sacrifice worker rights in exchange for this modest and long-\noverdue increase in the wages for those at the lowest rungs of the \neconomic ladder.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I have long supported an increase in the \nminimum wage. I am pleased that, with the leadership of the new \nmajority in Congress, this minimum wage increase will be passed by a \nbipartisan majority.\n  In 1996 Congress raised the minimum wage by 90 cents an hour in two \nsteps to $5.15 an hour. That increase was enacted more than 10 years \nago. Since then, the real value of that wage has eroded by 21 percent \nand the nearly 5.5 million workers earning the minimum wage have \nalready lost all of the gains from the 1996-1997 increase. Since then, \nGallup polls have shown that 86 percent of small business owners do not \nthink that the minimum wage affects their business, and nearly half of \nsmall business owners think that the minimum wage should be increased. \nSince then, 29 States, including Michigan, as well as the District of \nColumbia have recognized the importance of keeping our working families \nout of poverty by increasing State minimum wages.\n  Unfortunately, since the 1970s, poverty has increased by 50 percent \namong full-time, year-round workers. Currently, 37 million Americans, \nincluding 13 million children, live in poverty. As the most prosperous \nnation in the world, our minimum wage should be a living wage, and it \nis not. When a father or mother works full time, 40 hours a week, year-\nround, they should be able to lift their family out of poverty. A full-\ntime minimum wage laborer working 40 hours a week for 52 weeks earns \n$10,700 per year--more than $6,000 below the Federal poverty guidelines \nfor a family of three.\n  I believe that a full-time minimum wage job should provide a minimum \nstandard of living in addition to giving workers the dignity that comes \nwith a paycheck. These lower paid workers, many of whom have entered \nthe workforce due to the welfare reform, should be rewarded for \nentering the workforce, not penalized by a poverty wage. A higher \nminimum wage has the potential to ensure that lower paid workers will \nbe protected from falling into poverty and possibly back on the welfare \nrolls. The minimum wage increase during the recession in 1991 provided \nmuch needed income to poor people and helped to increase spending in \nthe economy. 58 percent of the benefit of the 1996 increase went to \nfamilies in the bottom 40 percent of income groups. Over one-third of \nthe benefit went to the poorest families--those in the bottom 20 \npercent of income groups.\n  Today the real value of the minimum wage is $4.00 below what it was \nin 1968. To have the purchasing power it had in 1968, the minimum wage \nwould have to be at least $9.37 an hour today, not $5.15. According to \nthe United States Department of Labor, over 60 percent of minimum wage \nearners are women; almost 40 percent are minorities, and nearly 80 \npercent are adults. These hardworking Americans deserve a fair deal.\n  In addition to the long overdue minimum wage provision, this bill \ncontains a package of tax provisions. I am pleased that these include a \nnumber of measures to crack down on abusive tax dodges, including an \nimprovement to current law to end the tax benefits received by \ncompanies that reincorporate and set up shell headquarters in offshore \ntax havens.\n  I am also pleased that the bill extends the work opportunity tax \ncredit, which allows employers credit against wages for hiring workers \nfrom targeted groups such as recipients of public assistance, qualified \nveterans, and ``high risk'' youth. I have heard from a number of \nMichigan companies that the WOTC program is important to them in their \nhiring members of these targeted groups, and I am pleased that this \nprovision will be extended through the end of 2012.\n  I am also pleased that the tax provisions would put in place a limit \non the amount that corporate executives and other highly paid employees \ncan place tax-free into deferred compensation plans. Under current law, \npublic companies cannot deduct more than $1 million per year for \ncompensation paid to their top officers. However, compensation that is \n``deferred,'' meaning the employee doesn't have immediate access to it, \nis not subject to this $1 million limit; so deferred compensation \npackages have become a main way that company executives can get multi-\nmillion dollar compensation packages while their companies continue to \ntake a tax write-off.\n  We have seen these excessive packages time and again in recent \nstories about runaway executive compensation totaling tens of millions \nof dollars. Tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars have been \nsalted away in this fashion for corporate executives, and companies \nhave simply found another way to game the system by excluding this \n``deferred compensation'' from those individuals' income for the year. \nIt is more than time for Congress to put an end to this game which has \nfueled excessive executive pay.\n  This bill would set a limit on the amount of compensation that could \nreceive tax deferral at the lower of $1 million annually or the average \nof the previous 5 years compensation. The ability of corporate \nexecutives to defer tax on up to $1 million in compensation is still a \nsignificant benefit that stands in stark contrast to the minimum wage \nwe are attempting to raise for those at the lowest end of the pay \nscale.\n  It is only right that those who are at the low end of the pay scale \nwho work hard should receive a fair wage and be able to support their \nfamilies. These people do not always have the leverage to negotiate a \nfair salary. This bill to increase the minimum wage will help to move \nthem to a more livable wage.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I will unavoidably miss the final vote \non\n\n[[Page S1490]]\n\nthe minimum wage bill but I come down here now to ask unanimous consent \nthat the Record reflect, immediately after the vote, my announcement \nthat I would have voted against this bill.\n  In so doing, I remain consistent on the issue. Government is best \nwhen it is does not pick winners and losers--when it does not \ncompetitively advantage one group of people over another or one set of \nStates over another.\n  Senator DeMint offered an amendment to equally and fairly increase \nthe minimum wage by $2.10 for each State over what the wage is today.\n  The fact that the liberals voted against the DeMint amendment is \nproof that their bill as now constituted is really about damaging the \ncompetitiveness of middle America--the so-called red States, \ndisparagingly called `'fly-over country'' by liberals--compared to the \nliberal fringe States.\n  Without this amendment, the underlying legislation would partially \nexempt minimum wage workers in higher-cost States that already have \nState minimum wage rates greater than the Federal level of $5.15 an \nhour, and completely exempt minimum wage workers in highest-cost States \nthat have State minimum wage rates near $7.25 an hour.\n  The DeMint amendment would increase the Federal minimum wage equally \nfor workers in all States at the same rate as H.R. 2 would increase the \nminimum wage from the current Federal minimum wage rate.\n  Senator Kennedy's arguments against this amendment have been both \nconfusing and contradictory. On the one hand, he said that we need a \none-size-fits-all mandate, and then he said that Massachusetts has a \nhigher cost of living.\n  I will not stand for people in Washington, DC, damaging the \ncompetitiveness of Oklahoma against other States. If Oklahomans vote to \nchange our own laws, that is one thing, but we are not going to buckle \nunder to DC and the liberal fringe States.\n  Thus I would vote nay.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following chart be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Current       Kennedy Proposal

REID. Madam President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe next cloture vote be vitiated.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this next vote is not necessary. As a \nresult of yesterday's breakthrough in negotiations, the base bill for \nthe Iraq debate will be the Warner-Levin legislation and not S. Con. \nRes. 2. So I will vote against cloture and urge both sides of the aisle \nto do likewise.\n  The most important question that I have been asked, by popular \ndemand, is when are we going to have a vote on Monday. I have conferred \nwith the Republican leader on more than one occasion. We can still vote \nat 4:30 and complete the 30 hours prior to Wednesday, which would be \nour goal. So we are going to vote at 4:30 on Monday on cloture on the \nLevin-Warner measure, unless we work something out beforehand. Again, \nthat is 4:30 Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Sioux Falls Cougars\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the University of \nSioux Falls Cougars football team for winning the 2006 NAIA National \nFootball Championship. I would also like to recognize their coach, \nKalen DeBoer, for being named the NAIA Football Coach of the Year. The \nCougars championship victory in December marked the second national \nfootball title for the school in the past 10 years.\n  This group of young men had an extraordinary season capped by a 23-\nto-19 victory over the previously unbeaten University of Saint Francis. \nThat championship victory ensured the Cougars an undefeated season and \nthe first football title since 1996. The University of Sioux Falls did \nnot achieve a No. 1 ranking throughout the entirety of the 2006 season. \nTheir championship was won on the field, not in the polls.\n  Coach DeBoer was able to achieve this victory in just his second year \nas head coach of the Cougars. He succeeded legendary coach Bob Young. \nUnder the tutelage of Coach Young, and continued now by Coach DeBoer, \nthe University of Sioux Falls has emerged as one of the premier \nfootball institutions in the country. Over the past 10 seasons, the \nCougars have amassed a 103 to 19 record while capturing eight \nconference titles. Faith, loyalty, commitment, and teamwork have served \nas the foundation to building this tradition of excellence.\n  The 2006 Cougars were led to the title thanks to the work of an \nexplosive offense and a powerful defense. They averaged nearly 39 \npoints per game while allowing only seven. Leading the way for the \nCougars this season were Chad Cavender, Mike Dvoracek, Dusty Hovorka, \nand Trey Erickson. These four were selected to the first-team of the \n2006 NAIA All-American football team. This marks the first time in \nUniversity of Sioux Falls history that four players have represented \nthe school on the first-team. Also, five Cougars earned NAIA All-\nAmerican honorable mention honors. These players were Zach Campbell, \nJosiah Fenceroy, Jason Glasco, Letarius Lee, and Adam Paulson.\n  Many of the players from this year's team have spent the last 4 years \nas teammates. The sixteen current University of Sioux Falls seniors \nhave compiled a remarkable 48 to 4 record, including three Great Plains \nAthletic Conference championships, four NAIA Championship Series \nappearances, and the 2006 NAIA Football Championship. This group of \nstudent-athletes should be very proud of their impressive \naccomplishments over the past years.\n  The coaching staff, in alphabetical order, is as follows: Jon \nAnderson, Adam Breske, Al Christensen, Kalen DeBoer, Jeff Fitzgerald, \nNick Fulton, Tom Grogan, Al Hansen, Chuck Morrell, Nate Moser, and \nKurtiss Riggs.\n  The team, in alphabetical order, is as follows: Blake Andersen, Alex \nAnderson, Drew Anderson, Kyle Anderson, Jeremy Barnes, Bret Beachner, \nNick Benedetto, Trevor Bowers, Curtis Brown, Tyson Brown, Zach \nCampbell, Doug Carlson, Luke Castle, Chad Cavender, Max Chapman, Erik \nCimpl, Ross Cimpl, Kyle Cummings, Josh Daniels, Drew DeGroot, Dan \nDeJong, Glen Dirksen, Kyle Dreckman, Michael Dvoracek, Ernest Eaton, \nBrett Elgersma, Trey Erickson, Nate Everett, Josiah Fenceroy, Clint \nFischer, Jason Glasco, Aaron Gunderson, Mike Hartley, Luke Hartman, \nNick Haub, Adam Henglefelt, Trevor Holleman, Cameron Horton, Dusty \nHovorka, Aaron Jensen, Gregg Jensen, James Johnikin, Matt Johnson, Joel \nKelpe, Kyle Kidd, Blake Klinsing, Brandon Koolstra, Todd Kutter, Ty \nLarson, Letarius Lee, John Lentz, Matt Lindgren, Tyler Lodermeier, Ryan \nLowmiller, Brad Maag, Lane Mellegaard, Matt Miller, Dan Moe, Joe Moen, \nTyler Mousel, A.J. Munger, Scott Neu, Tyler Newman, Matt Norgaard, Jeff \nNuzum, Chris Opitz, Cody O'Reilly, Aaron Parker, Adam Paulson, Adam \nPerry, Weston Peterson, Darren Quaile, Nick Ramstad, Jim Rawhouser, \nKyle Robertson, Jon Ross, Jon Ryan, Dan Schmeichel, Shawn Schnabel, \nAndrew Schoenfelder, Brady Schwebach, Brandon Sexton, George Sperry, \nAlex Staebell, Dominic Studzinski, Robb Tiff, D.J. Tille, Chad Traver, \nBrent Tuxhorn, Brooks Underberg, Derek Varin, Josh Veurink, Michael \nWarren, Keegan Warwick, T.J. Wendt, Ben Westerfield, Brandon Williams, \nand Alex Woolbright.\n  I congratulate the men who won this National Championship and the \ncoaches who led the way. The University of Sioux Falls football team \nhas proven that they are strong competitors and dedicated athletes. On \nbehalf of the city of Sioux Falls and the state of South Dakota, I am \npleased to say congratulations, Cougars. You have made us all very \nproud.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the contribution \nof the Roman Catholic school system in the United States. From January \n28 through February 2 of this year, communities across our Nation \ncelebrated National Catholic Schools Week. This year's theme of \n``Catholic Schools: the Good News in Education'' emphasizes the \nbalanced and diverse educational perspective offered by Catholic \neducation.\n  With more than 8,000 elementary and secondary schools across our \nNation, Catholic education is an important part of educational \ncommunities across our country. My home State of Nevada is no \nexception. We have more than 16 Catholic schools that serve over 5,000\n\n[[Page S1514]]\n\nstudents. These schools play an important role in their communities, \nteaching service and character to their students in the Catholic \ntradition.\n  This tradition is what encourages many parents to sacrifice to pay \nfor a Catholic education. As many students, parents, and teachers will \ntell you, a Catholic education provides balance to students not only in \ntheir educational experience, but also in their spiritual life. The \nvalues taught in Catholic schools are important for developing engaged \nand informed members of the community.\n  Catholic education has played a needed role in our educational system \nfor more than a century. I am confident that Nevada and our Nation will \nbe well served by Catholic schools for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1514-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ANNIVERSARY OF ALASKA STATEHOOD\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, January marked the 48th anniversary of \nthe day Alaska achieved statehood. Earlier this week, Senator Murkowski \nand I introduced S.J. Res. 49, a resolution commemorating our State's \n50th anniversary. We will reach this milestone on January 3, 2009.\n  Alaska's path to statehood was a long one. In 1867, Secretary of the \nTreasury William Seward convinced President Andrew Johnson to purchase \nAlaska for $7.2 million. At the time, this purchase was often derided \nas ``Seward's Folly,'' and many wondered what the United States would \ndo with what some called its new ``Polar Bear Garden.''\n  While history shortly proved the critics wrong, statehood for Alaska \ndid not come easily. It took more than 90 years for Alaska to become a \nstate. The first Alaska statehood bill was introduced by James \nWickersham, our territorial delegate, in 1916. Over the years, seven \nCongresses considered legislation regarding Alaska's admission to our \nUnion. Between 1946 and 1957 alone, statehood hearings held by the \nHouse and Senate spanned more than 3,500 pages in the printed record.\n  Alaskans tirelessly advocated for statehood. On November 8, 1955, 55 \nmen and women assembled at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks for \nAlaska's Constitutional Convention. These delegates worked for 75 days, \nand their efforts produced a precedent-setting constitution.\n  Thanks to the dedication of George Lehleitner of Louisiana and C.W. \nBill Snedden, the publisher of the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, our \nconstitution included Alaska's version of the ``Tennessee Plan''. Under \nthis plan, our territory elected a congressional delegation without \nfederal approval. Our constitution--and this plan--ultimately became \nthe basis for congressional approval of statehood.\n  Alaskans also made countless trips to Washington, DC, to testify in \nsupport of statehood. These visits were critical to our success--in \n1957, the House Insular Affairs Committee reported, ``Alaska is in all \nways ready for statehood.''\n  Forty-two years after the introduction of the first statehood bill, \nour long wait finally ended. On May 12, 1958, Representative Clair \nEngle moved to bring the Alaska statehood bill to the floor of the \nHouse. He sought and received a special privileged status which is \nreserved for statehood bills. This status allowed him to circumvent the \nRules Committee, which had blocked statehood legislation for more than \n11 months.\n  Right up until the end, statehood for Alaska faced fierce opposition. \nIn the Senate, a small group of opponents prolonged the debate for 5 \nlong days and nights. I was among the many Alaskans who gathered in the \nviewing galleries above this Chamber on June 30, 1958, waiting for the \nhistoric vote. At 8:02 pm, the Senate passed the Alaska statehood bill \nby a vote of 64 to 20. Six months later, on January 3, 1959, we \nofficially became the 49th State in the Union.\n\n  I come to the floor today to pay tribute to the Alaskans who fought \nfor statehood and our good friends in Congress who supported them. Bob \nBartlett, our State's delegate in the House, worked on statehood for 14 \nyears. He was assisted by men like Leo O'Brien of New York, who chaired \nthe Territories Subcommittee; John Saylor of Pennsylvania, who led the \nfloor fight for Republican supporters; Clair Engle of California, who \nchaired the Insular Affairs Committee; and Sam Rayburn, the Speaker of \nthe House.\n  In the Senate, Alaskans found a good friend in Senator Henry \n``Scoop'' Jackson of Washington State, who was chairman of Territories \non the Interior Committee. Senator Jackson helped plan the successful \nstrategy that put the vote for statehood over the top. Twenty-five \nyears later, Senator Jackson cosponsored a resolution celebrating the \nsilver anniversary of Alaska's statehood. Earlier this week, Senator \nMurkowski and I offered a similar resolution, this time to commemorate \nour State's golden anniversary in 2009.\n  Alaskans also found many good friends outside of the Halls of \nCongress. President Eisenhower, President Truman, and Secretary of the \nInterior Fred Seaton each supported our campaign for statehood. It was \nmy great privilege to know and serve with many of these men. I am \nparticularly indebted to Secretary Seaton, who asked me to serve as his \nlegislative counsel, Assistant to the Secretary, and ultimately the \nSolicitor of the Department of the Interior during the Eisenhower \nadministration. These positions gave me the opportunity to work on the \nAlaska Statehood Act.\n  History has proven those who criticized Seward's purchase--and those \nwho opposed statehood--wrong. When William Seward purchased Alaska from \nRussia, he paid $7,200,000--less than 2 cents per acre. With the full \nrights and opportunities granted to the states in our Union, Alaska has \nmore than made good on this investment--the Federal revenue from the \ndevelopment of our resources has repaid this investment hundreds of \ntimes over.\n  The list of our State's opportunities remains promising. We have vast \ncoal reserves and enormous potential in oil and gas both on and off our \nshores. Trillions of feet of gas hydrates lie beneath our permafrost. \nOur State's 34,000 miles of shoreline are the gateway to some of our \nNation's most promising tidal and ocean energy prospects. Our forests \ncontain much of the Nation's timber and pulp. Sixty percent of our \ncountry's commercial fish harvest is caught in the waters off of our \nState's shores.\n  Our geographic location was a vital asset during World War II and the \nCold War, and it continues to offer our Armed Forces important \nstrategic advantages. Our location has also helped boost our Nation's \ntrade with Canada, Russia, and nations throughout Asia.\n  Our State's greatest resource, however, will always be our people. \nAlaskans are resourceful, enterprising, and fiercely independent. Our \npioneer spirit runs deep. And the traditions and heritage of our Alaska \nNative people have greatly contributed to our country's cultural life.\n  The list of our State's opportunities is long, but we are still a \nyoung State. For each of our opportunities, there is a challenge to \novercome. The Federal Government owns more than 60 percent of our \nlands. We have only 14,000 miles of roads. Seventy percent of our \ntowns, villages, and cities can be reached only by boat or air. If we \nare to fulfill our potential, we will need greater understanding of \nthese facts.\n  Forty-eight years is not a long time. In fact, our State is younger \nthan all but eight of the Members who serve in this Senate. Our ability \nto fulfill our potential depends on the willingness of those who serve \nin Congress to provide us with the opportunities and support given to \nother States when they were in similar stages of their development.\n  On this anniversary of statehood, Alaskans honor those who made this \nmilestone possible. And we share our hope that--once again--we will \nfind friends in Congress and elsewhere that will help us fulfill our \nState's potential.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1514-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1514-S1516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, there is growing awareness across the \ncountry that too little has been done to combat illegal gun \ntrafficking. This awareness was validated by a report released last \nweek by the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence which revealed that \nsome licensed gun dealers are complicit in aiding gun traffickers, yet \nremain largely untouched by the law.\n  The report, ``Shady Dealings: Illegal Gun Trafficking from Licensed \nGun Dealers,'' was released in Philadelphia, a city that is combating a \nsharp increase in gun violence. In 2002, the city reached a 17-year low \nin homicides with 288. However, since then, homicide rates have soared. \nLast year, the city suffered 406 homicides and is on track to exceed \nthat total in 2007. The report documents over two dozen cases of \nillegal gun trafficking from dealers across the country. In each case, \ngunrunners were prosecuted; however, the dealers who supplied them \nreceived no legal sanctions.\n  ``Shady Dealings'' documents several scenarios in which dealers turn \na blind eye to clear indications of gunrunning. In-store straw \npurchases are transactions that violate Federal law in which one \nindividual submits to the required Federal background check for a gun \nthat is clearly intended for use by someone else. Multiple purchases of \nthe same model gun by an individual should be an indication that the \nguns are not for personal use. Large volume sales of handguns should be \na red flag to dealers. In one case, a gun dealer sold 87 pistols to a \ngun trafficker's straw buyer in a single transaction. Another red flag \nfor trafficking should occur when a single buyer makes repeated \npurchases from a dealer. In one instance, a trafficker from Ohio made \nat least 19 visits to a particular gun shop, yet was never turned away. \nDealer sales to traffickers at gun shows present special opportunities \nfor trafficking. A single gun dealer in Georgia was recorded selling \neight guns to one trafficker and 20 additional pistols to two other \ntraffickers. Several of the weapons were recovered by the New York City \npolice, and one of them was used to shoot a New York City police \nofficer.\n  Unfortunately, making life easier for gun traffickers presents the \nopportunity for financial reward with little to no consequence for gun \ndealers. Not one of the dealers profiled in the Brady Center report has \nbeen put out of business by the ATF or prosecuted for selling guns to \nconvicted gun traffickers. As a result, the underground market for guns \nis fueled the diversion of massive numbers of guns from licensed gun \ndealers into the hands of criminals. Almost 60 percent of the guns \ntraced to crime by the ATF originated from only about 1 percent of the \nNation's gun dealers. Additionally, approximately 30 percent of the \nguns traced to crime were traced within 3 years of their retail sale. I \nurge my colleagues to take up and pass sensible gun legislation that \nwill help prevent such egregious acts and help protect the welfare of \nour communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1516-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1516-S1517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN RECOGNITION OF AMERICAN HEART MONTH\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today marks the start of American Heart \nMonth. I note the occasion not as a reminder to my colleagues to \npurchase flowers or chocolates for their loved ones for Valentine's Day \nbut as a reminder that we need to redouble our efforts to fight heart \ndisease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases.\n  More than 80 million Americans--about 1 in 3 adults--are living with \nsome form of cardiovascular disease. Heart disease remains the leading \ncause of death in America and stroke is the No. 3 killer. These \ndevastating diseases have touched the lives of nearly every family in \nAmerica.\n  Heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases will cost \nour Nation more than $430 billion in 2007, including more than $284 \nbillion in direct medical costs.\n  While it is true that we are making some progress, we can't win the \nfight against heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases \nwithout the support of Congress and the administration. Next week, the \nPresident will send Congress a budget proposal for fiscal year 2008. \nThe budget is more than just a lengthy document--it is a statement of \nour Nation's priorities. I believe investing in cardiovascular \nresearch, prevention, and treatment programs should be one of our \nhighest priorities.\n  I was disappointed by the budget the President proposed last year. \nThe administration's proposal would have scaled back funding for heart \ndisease and stroke research at the National Institutes of Health, NIH, \nprevention programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nCDC, and a program that helps rural communities purchase lifesaving \nmedical equipment.\n  The administration's fiscal year 2007 budget would have cut funding \nfor the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute by $21 million and the \nNational Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke by $11 million. \nI am grateful that Congress rejected this proposal. Our investment in \nthe NIH holds enormous promise to turn the tide against so many \ndevastating diseases, including heart disease and stroke.\n  The President also proposed scaling back funding for the heart \ndisease and stroke prevention program at the CDC. This program helps \nStates design and implement plans to prevent cardiovascular disease \nbefore it occurs. Despite the fact that heart disease is the No. 1 \ncause of death in the country and stroke is the No. 3 killer, the CDC \ndoes not have enough funding to implement this important program in all \nStates. The CDC provides funding for 19 States to develop plans and \nanother 14 States to implement the plans.\n  Finally, the administration tried to eliminate funding for a program \nthat helps rural communities purchase automated external \ndefibrillators, AEDs. AEDs are small, laptop-size devices that help \nrestore normal heart function after cardiac arrest. AEDs save lives, \nespecially when placed in areas where large numbers of people \ncongregate and in rural communities where emergency medical personnel \nare not readily available. I believe Congress should continue to \nprovide grants\n\n[[Page S1517]]\n\nto help communities purchase these lifesaving devices.\n  I hope that the President does not send Congress another budget that \nproposes Draconian cuts in funding for heart disease and stroke \nresearch, prevention, and treatment programs. Failing to make these \ninvestments will have real consequences. It is projected that, if we \ndon't act today, deaths from heart disease alone will increase by \nnearly 130 percent by 2050.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a few minutes during February to \nrecognize American Heart Month and to join me in starting a national \ndialogue about making the fight against cardiovascular disease a \npriority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1517-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I join millions of people across our \nNation to commemorate Black History Month.\n  Black History Month is a time to honor those heroes of the past and \npresent who have played pivotal roles in African American history. \nDuring this month, we celebrate the lives of these extraordinary \nindividuals and pay tribute to their many sacrifices and great \naccomplishments in strengthening the diverse cultural history we have \nin America. We are especially reminded during this month to renew our \ncommitment to ensuring equality and justice for all Americans.\n  Black History Month was originally established as Negro History Week, \nlater known as Black History Week, in 1926 by Dr. Carter G. Woodson, a \nson of former slaves who became the second African American to earn a \nPh.D. from Harvard University. Woodson chose the second week in \nFebruary in remembrance of the birthdays of two prominent individuals \nin the history of African Americans--President Abraham Lincoln, who \npromulgated the Emancipation Proclamation, and Frederick Douglass, one \nof the most renowned black abolitionists. In 1976, Black History Week \nwas officially expanded to a month-long celebration--Black History \nMonth, or African-American History Month.\n  Since 1926, the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and \nHistory, ASALH, has established the national theme for Black History \nMonth. This year's theme is ``From Slavery to Freedom: The Story of \nAfricans in the Americas.'' Long after slavery was abolished, people of \nAfrican descent struggled for the basic rights afforded American \ncitizens. This year's theme brings to light this quest for equality and \nfreedom during the age of emancipation, when Africans throughout the \nAmericas were emerging from the bonds of slavery to take their rightful \nplace in society. The path was not an easy one--independence and \nliberty remained elusive for many. Yet through the work of visible \nleaders and heroes and those individuals who quietly persevered, we see \ngreat achievements in the African-American experience--triumph that \nwent hand in hand with some of the greatest struggles and most severe \nobstacles.\n  In Idaho, many individuals have continued Woodson's vision to educate \nand inform our communities about the great contributions of African \nAmericans. For over 85 years, Idaho's National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People, NAACP--comprised of some of Idaho's \nfinest citizens and humanitarians--has served as a leader for promoting \ncultural diversity and awareness in our state.\n  I also commend the work at the Idaho Black History Museum. \nEstablished in 1995, this museum is the only one of its kind in the \nPacific Northwest. Through its exhibits and community outreach programs \nsuch as lectures, workshops, literacy courses, and musical \nperformances, the Idaho Black History Museum successfully fosters a \ndeeper understanding of cultural diversity in the State of Idaho.\n\n\n                         Honoring Mamie Oliver\n\n  Today, I join with the Idaho Black History Museum in honoring a \nspecial Idahoan--Dr. Mamie Oliver--for her outstanding record of \nachievement and efforts on behalf of Idaho's communities. A historian, \nprofessor, and community leader, Dr. Oliver truly embodies what Black \nHistory Month is all about.\n  When Mamie Oliver accepted a position at Boise State University in \n1972, she became Idaho's first African-American professor. At Boise \nState, Dr. Oliver and her students completed foundational research on \nAfrican-American history in Idaho, launching the early development of \nwhat was previously untold history.\n  Dr. Oliver was influential in getting the St. Paul Baptist Church \nbuilding on the Historical Register. The church, established in 1909, \nwas one of two African-American churches in Idaho and is now the home \nof the Idaho Black History Museum. Together with her husband and fellow \ncommunity leader, Dr. H. Lincoln Oliver, Ph.D., B.D., she sought to \nmeet the needs of the less fortunate in the community by founding the \nTreasure Valley Council for Church and Social Action 25 years ago.\n  For her remarkable service, Dr. Oliver was recognized as a \nDistinguished Citizen by the Idaho Statesman and as one of the ten \nOutstanding Women in Idaho by the Boise March of Dimes. Dr. Oliver was \nselected for the Jefferson Award for Outstanding Public Service \nBenefiting Local Communities by the American Institute for Public \nServices and received the 2004 Women of Today and Tomorrow Award from \nthe Girl Scouts of Silver Sage Council (Boise).\n  Dr. Oliver was appointed by Governor Evans to chair the first Martin \nLuther King, Jr., Task Force and by Governor Kempthorne to serve two \nterms on the Governor's Coordinating Council for Families and Children.\n  Dr. Oliver and her late husband, Dr. Lincoln Oliver, have two adult \nchildren and two grandchildren. Currently, she teaches at Northwest \nNazarene University in Nampa, ID.\n  We in Idaho are proud to have individuals such as Dr. Mamie Oliver in \nour community. It is through the dedication of people like Dr. Oliver \nthat we realize as a Nation our strengths and are empowered by what is \nintegrally part of our American history and brought to the forefront \nthis February--Black History Month.\n  Our Nation has made great strides in putting civil and human rights \nchallenges behind us. But we must be ever vigilant in pursuing the \nfundamental principles of equality and justice and in continuing the \nlegacy that so many individuals have worked so hard to achieve. In \nCongress, one of our most important duties is to protect these core \npersonal freedoms that we as American citizens enjoy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1517-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1517-S1518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SENATOR GEORGE SMATHERS\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nlife and achievements of Senator George Smathers. I delivered remarks \nat his memorial service on January 29. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       It is fitting that we gather in this community, in this \n     state, to honor George A. Smathers--an outstanding American, \n     and one of the great sons of Miami and Florida.\n       Because it was here that George Smathers grew up.\n       It was here that he became president of the student bodies \n     at Miami Senior High School and his beloved University of \n     Florida, where he also was captain of the basketball, track \n     and debate teams.\n       It was here that he joined the Marines, faking appendicitis \n     so he could avoid a Navy desk job and see combat in World War \n     II.\n       And it was here that the handsome young Miamian broke into \n     public service as an assistant prosecutor, after which he \n     kept ascending and never looked back.\n       This community, this state--this is where George Smathers \n     devoted so much of his life.\n       I am honored that his family asked me to pay him tribute. \n     He has two wonderful sons, John and Bruce, and is survived by \n     his devoted wife Carolyn.\n       The fact of the matter is--my life has intersected with the \n     family for 45 years. Even today, my desk in the chamber of \n     the United States Senate is the one used by George Smathers.\n       I first met the Smathers' family when I was a college \n     intern in the senator's office.\n       But it is the friendship of one of George Smathers' sons \n     that has been especially important in my life.\n       At a time in my young life when I lost both parents, Bruce \n     was more than a friend, he was a brother. Bruce is always \n     faithful, never waivers, always encourages. He is a loyal \n     friend--a Smathers' trait.\n       Bruce and I even introduced each other to our wives. And \n     ``little'' Bruce is my godson.\n       As a kid, I'll never forget attending the funeral of \n     President Kennedy with the senator and his sons, watching the \n     rider-less horse with the boots turned backward, following \n     the caisson down Pennsylvania Ave. and across Memorial Bridge \n     for the burial at Arlington.\n\n[[Page S1518]]\n\n       In the nine days since George Smathers has left us, many \n     people have paused to remember.\n       The senator had become quite a successful businessman and \n     philanthropist, giving the University of Florida $20 million \n     for its libraries, and the University of Miami $10 million \n     for its Wellness Center.\n       He was, in the words of his biographer, Brian Crispell, \n     ``congenial, humorous, and respected as a highly effective \n     orator and legislator.''\n       He also has been described as prophetic.\n       Indeed, he was so sure years ago that Miami would become a \n     major international city and gateway to the rest of the \n     hemisphere, that he insisted his sons learn to speak Spanish.\n       The year was 1946 when he set his sights on Congress.\n       That's when he took on a four-term incumbent U.S. \n     congressman--and, with a group of young turks in Miami he \n     beat the odds.\n       That was quite a class that went to Washington with him. It \n     included the late Jacob Javits and Hale Boggs.\n       The young congressman from South Florida soon became close \n     with President Truman, as the president would visit the Key \n     West White House for his retreats.\n       No one will ever forget one of Smathers' earliest \n     accomplishments, which was helping to create the Everglades \n     National Park.\n       While he was in the House of Representatives, he also \n     developed a passion for the politics and peoples of Latin \n     America, making some 14 trips there.\n       Many years later in the Senate, his colleagues would refer \n     to him, in jest, as the Senator from Latin America.\n       Everyone would laugh, and Senator Smathers would go along. \n     But he would offer a disclaimer: Sure he had a specialty in \n     foreign affairs in the Western Hemisphere, but his first duty \n     was being the senator from Florida.\n       In 1948, the senator from Florida met Fidel Castro. And in \n     a private conversation, Fidel told him he was going to take \n     over Cuba. Smathers always was leery of Castro. And sure \n     enough, 11 years later, Castro overthrew Batista.\n       While so many in America thought that was a good thing--\n     ousting the hated dictator Batista--Smathers was one of the \n     strongest anti-Castro voices around, saying, ``Watch out for \n     this fellow. You better be careful.''\n       Leading up to the elections of 1950, President Truman \n     called Smathers to the White House and asked him to run \n     against Florida's incumbent Senator Claude Pepper. Apparently \n     there had been a misunderstanding between Truman and Pepper, \n     and the president still was angry.\n       Up to that point, Smathers had not seriously considered the \n     Senate.\n       That 1950 campaign still is noted for remarks supposedly \n     made to play on the ignorance of certain voters.\n       Years later, Smathers decided to debunk the myth by \n     offering a $10,000 personal reward to anyone who could \n     authenticate and verify his alleged comments.\n       Nobody could.\n       When he went to the Senate, George Smathers joined the \n     ``club.'' There were giants. Symington of Missouri, Johnson \n     of Texas, Dirksen of Illinois, Kerr of Oklahoma, Kennedy of \n     Massachusetts. And right there with them were Smathers and \n     Holland, of Florida.\n       Smathers became close friends with John Kennedy, and was \n     one of the best men in the wedding party when JFK married \n     Jacqueline Bouvier.\n       LBJ depended on George Smathers, too, even though they \n     differed on a number of issues.\n       When there was a vacancy in the assistant majority leader, \n     Lyndon Johnson asked Smathers to fill that position.\n       And then, when Johnson suffered his heart attack and was \n     out for seven months, Smathers filled in as the acting \n     majority leader.\n       When LBJ resumed his duties running the Senate, he asked \n     his friend from Florida to be his permanent assistant \n     majority leader.\n       Johnson, who was not accustomed to hearing the word no, had \n     to accept just that from his friend from Florida.\n       In 1956, the senator was considered for vice president, for \n     the first of two times.\n       During his Senate career, he chaired the Senate Democratic \n     Campaign Committee and is credited with passing legislation \n     to help small businesses, reform immigration and advance \n     tourism for Florida.\n       He helped upgrade transportation, and fought for what would \n     become, under JFK, the Alliance for Progress in Latin \n     America.\n       He also helped eliminate the poll tax, establish the \n     Kennedy Space Center, set up the Permanent Select Committee \n     on Aging and, of course, set aside that natural wonder, \n     Everglades National Park, the ``River of Grass'' that means \n     so much to us in Florida.\n       In 1960, he was the southern chairman for Kennedy and \n     Johnson; and that same year he created a new judicial \n     district for southern Florida to handle an increasing case \n     load.\n       In the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, Smathers Beach in Key \n     West, named after the senator, was an antimissile battery. \n     The world now knows just how close we came to a nuclear \n     exchange in the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n       Few know that George Smathers helped President Kennedy \n     write the speech that warned the Soviet Union that any attack \n     upon the United States from Cuba would be considered an \n     attack by the Soviet Union.\n       After the Kennedy assassination, Smathers became a regular \n     at the Johnson White House and an adviser to LBJ. In 1968, he \n     turned down presidential nominee Hubert Humphrey's offer of \n     being his vice presidential running mate.\n       The next year, he stepped out of public service and into \n     private life, ending three terms in the Senate and two terms \n     in the House.\n       Among the many accolades he received, perhaps the one he \n     prized most came from Louisiana's Senator Russell Long. \n     George Smathers, in Long's words, ``was a statesman.''\n       During a lifetime of public service, he also was a good \n     husband and father, a Marine, a prosecutor, congressman, \n     senator--a leader.\n       In later years, George Smathers said when asked, that he'd \n     like to be remembered as a fellow ``who worked hard for the \n     people he represented and did his best for his country.''\n       That he will be and much more.\n       Senator Smathers, thank you on behalf of a grateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1518-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1518-S1519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             LIHEAP FUNDING\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a very \nimportant Federal program that helps hundreds of thousands of Michigan \nfamilies and millions of Americans across the country. The Low Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, is critically \nimportant for families and seniors who struggle to pay high energy \nbills to heat their homes in the winter and cool their homes in the \nsummer. Without LIHEAP, many of these households would be forced to \nmake the impossible choice between paying for energy or paying for food \nand medicine.\n  Today is the National Fuel Funds Network's Washington Action Day for \nLIHEAP and folks from many different States will be walking the Halls \nof Congress to make sure we know how important it is to fully fund \nLIHEAP.\n  As winter kicks into high gear, the importance of the LIHEAP program \nis even more pronounced. According to the Energy Information \nAdministration, American households spent an average of $948 in 2006 on \ntheir winter heating needs--an increase of $250 over the 2000-2001 \nwinter season. That might seem like a modest increase, but for most \nAmericans living paycheck to paycheck, it could have disastrous effects \non their household budgets. LIHEAP assistance, which emphasizes \npartnerships between utilities, charitable organizations, and State \ngovernments, is a highly effective and cost-efficient way for our \ncountry to help the neediest families manage these incremental \nincreases in their home energy costs. It has thus become an important \ncomponent of our social safety net.\n  Not surprisingly, LIHEAP assistance historically has been targeted to \ncold-weather States in the Northeast and Upper Midwest. In the State of \nMichigan, for instance, more than 470,000 households received LIHEAP \naid in 2006. In recent years, however, the program has been retooled in \norder to recognize the need to provide similar assistance to warm-\nweather States in the South and Southwest to help their neediest \ncitizens meet their home cooling needs. Last year, more than 6.2 \nmillion households received assistance nationwide, including many new \nfamilies in the warm-weather areas.\n  Unfortunately, the LIHEAP program has never been funded to its \nauthorized level--which recently was raised to $5 billion as part of \nthe Energy Policy Act of 2005. Even though LIHEAP was funded at $3.1 \nbillion in fiscal year 2006 the highest level ever--many who are \neligible remain unable to get help because there are simply not enough \nfunds to help them. We need to take a good, hard look at our funding \nefforts so that we are not forced to make unfair choices between cold \nand warm-weather States, much less deny support to eligible recipients.\n  Increased gas prices, unforeseen medical bills, sudden unemployment, \nor any other unexpected situation that causes a family's living costs \nto rise while their income stays fixed, forces families to make some \ntruly hard choices. But no one should have to choose between the need \nto heat and the need to eat. At its foundation, the LIHEAP program \nhelps these families deal with one of the most basic of their needs--a \nwarm home in wintertime as they work to regain their footing.\n  Today, the National Fuel Funds Network has mobilized a coalition of \ncharitable organizations such as the Salvation Army and The Heat And \nWarmth Fund, THAW, utilities such as CMS Energy and DTE Energy of \nMichigan,\n\n[[Page S1519]]\n\nState government officials, and low-income constituents to meet with \ncongressional offices to educate Congress about the LIHEAP program and \nmake the case for greater funding. I commend the organizers and \nparticipants of today's Washington Action Day for LIHEAP, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support and fully fund the LIHEAP program. By supporting \nthis important program, we are supporting hard-working American \nfamilies.

I had a \nwonderful holiday that I was fortunate to spend with my family, and I \nthought about those in the world who did not have that same \nopportunity. World peace is our ambition, but, today I want to speak \nabout our hope for the people of Darfur, Sudan.\n  I rise to add my voice, and that of my constituency, on the crisis in \nDarfur. Everyday I hear from Arkansans concerned about the escalating \nchaos and destruction happening in Darfur. Whether it is through church \ngroups, schools, the newspaper, Internet, or the television, the \nreports from Darfur are shocking and disturbing. Darfur, Sudan, is \n7,117 miles away from Little Rock, AR, but it is not removed from the \nthoughts and prayers of our citizens.\n  The statistics on this crisis are heartbreaking. It has been \nestimated that between 200,000 and 400,000 people have been killed and \nthousands of women have been raped. Over 2 million people have been \ndisplaced. Their lives have been completely uprooted, and their only \nchance of survival is refugee camps. These makeshift camps provide \nlittle shelter and are subjected to raids by armed militias. Aid \nworkers and organizations have recently pulled out of the region due to \nsafety concerns, and the conflict is spreading to neighboring \ncountries, destabilizing governments that may be ill-equipped to \nintegrate an influx of refugees. Moreover, the Sudanese government has \nrestricted media and diplomatic access to the region.\n  While the United States has taken considerable actions to support an \nend to the horrible violence in Darfur, the situation continues to \ndeteriorate. Darfur is the world's crisis, and we must do more to \nensure that an effective peacekeeping force is in place to stem the \nescalating rape, murder, and destruction.\n  I am hopeful that the United Nations' most recent effort will work. I \nam encouraged that so many humanitarian organizations have worked \ntirelessly to find a resolution to this matter. It is my wish that \npeace and stability will come to Darfur in 2007.\n  The people of Darfur have been deprived of the most basic of human \nliberties: the right to live in peace. It is our responsibility as U.S. \nSenators, as Americans, and as humanitarians to do all that we can to \nbring about an end to this world crisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1519-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  USC-RIVERSIDE CITRUS RESEARCH CENTER\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in recognizing 100 years of groundbreaking research and education at \nthe University of California Riverside's Citrus Research Center--\nAgricultural Experiment Station. This year, the university celebrates a \ncentury of improving our Nation's agriculture, environment, and natural \nresources.\n  The idea behind the creation of a citrus experiment center began with \nthe pioneering work of Riverside citrus grower John Henry Reed, who \nfirst proposed the idea in 1900. At the time Riverside was the hub of a \nrapidly expanding citrus industry, in part because refrigeration made \nnationwide shipments possible. His proposal became a reality in 1905 \nwhen the California Legislature passed a measure authorizing the \nestablishment of the Citrus Experiment Station in Riverside. By 1907, \nthe Citrus Experiment Station became an open branch of the Statewide \nAgricultural Experiment Station of the University of California.\n  From that time on, the Citrus Experiment Station continued to grow \nand develop, to become one of California's premier agricultural \nresearch institutions. In 1914, the station maintained a staff of 18 \nwith an annual budget of $60,000. Over the next 40 years, the \nExperiment Station's research area grew from 30 acres to almost 1,000 \nacres, and staff grew to 265.\n  During that time, Leon D. Bachelor, as director, worked to initiate \nmany of the long-term fertilizer experiments and worked to ensure the \nstrength of the walnut industry through disease research. During his \ntenure, shipping and processing of produce was vastly improved, and \nimprovements were implemented in citrus rootstocks, disease resistance, \nand fruit quality.\n  While this was taking place, facilities and physical plant \nconstruction continued to increase as more research stations and \nresearch buildings were being built. In 1954 Weber Hall was \nconstructed, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Boyden Entomological \nLaboratory was built in 1961, and research property increased to 1,100 \nacres. There were also advances in research focus, beginning in 1955 \nwith the arrival of a vegetable crops group from UC Davis. During the \nnext year, the Department of Nematology and the Biometrical Laboratory \nwere established. Work also came from UCLA focusing on entomology and \nplant pathology on ornamentals.\n  Just after this, the Air Pollution Research Center was established on \nthe UC Riverside campus, and agronomists from Davis were welcomed to \njoin in the research efforts. A Dry Lands Research Institute was added \nin 1963, and in the year following, the UC Riverside campus added a \nDepartment of Agricultural Engineering. The year after this, the \nDepartment of Agronomy accepted further work from UCLA on turf grasses.\n  With the expansion of research into all of these areas, it became \nclear that the university did not simply research citrus, and the \nCitrus Experiment Station was appropriately renamed the Citrus Research \nCenter and Agricultural Experiment Station, CRC-AES, in 1961. A full \ncollege devoted to this research effort was added in 1974, establishing \nthe College of Natural and Agricultrual Sciences.\n  Today, UC Riverside agricultural and natural science researchers pave \nthe way for many of our Nation's important scientific advances. Studies \nin plant sciences and environmental and natural resources continue to \nimprove the quality of life for our Nation and our planet. As the \nCitrus Research Center--Agricultural Experiment Station at the \nUniversity of California, Riverside celebrates its centennial, I \napplaud the tremendous efforts and advances and look forward to another \ncentury of progress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1519-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1519-S1520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO 2006 KENTUCKY DERBY WINNER BARBARO\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \nlife of Barbaro, the 2006 Kentucky Derby Champion. He was an \ninspirational survivor and was beloved by the State of Kentucky. \nBarbaro's motivational rise to the top of horse racing history and \nrelentless fight for his life against all odds, serves as a shining \nexample of strength and courage to us all.\n  Barbaro first entered this world on April 29, 2003, when he was \nfoaled in Nicholasville, KY, at Springmint Farm. He is the son of the \ngreat champion racehorse Dynaformer and was destined to be a champion \nfrom the beginning.\n  Barbaro was always a favorite of the crowd, but it was his \nperformance at the Kentucky Derby, May 6, 2006, that would make him a \nlegend. He ended up winning the Derby with a lead of seven lengths, \nwhich was the largest margin of victory since 1946. Because of this \nspectacular race, many people believed Barbaro was destined for \ngreatness in the horse racing industry and favored him to go on to win \nthe Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing.\n  Later that same year, Barbaro ran the Preakness Stakes on May 20, \n2006, as the crowd favorite. After an initial false start through the \nstarting gate and signs of distress early on in the race, it was clear \nthat Barbaro had sustained a severe injury. Laboratory tests showed \nthat he had fractured three bones in and around his ankle and right \nhind leg. This resulted in immediate surgery and many subsequent\n\n[[Page S1520]]\n\nsurgeries. A last effort was made by doctors to save Barbaro, but their \ncontinued efforts proved to be unsuccessful and caused his current \nailments to spread farther through his body. Although he kept fighting \nto recover, it was clear to everyone that he was in monumental pain. On \nJanuary 29, 2007, Barbaro's owners decided that his pain was too much \nto handle and he was laid to rest.\n  Barbaro had a unique, motivational quality that made him the object \nof care and affection from the public in a way that few animals before \nhim have ever experienced. He will be terribly missed but never \nforgotten. Barbaro was a champion, a fighter, and a true inspiration to \nthe entire State of Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1520-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN BRIAN GLACKIN\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to congratulate CAPT \nBrian Glackin upon the completion of his career of service in the U.S. \nNavy. Throughout his 23 year military career, Captain Glackin served \nwith distinction and dedication.\n  A native of Lansdale, PA, Captain Glackin received a bachelor's \ndegree in lectrical engineering from Villanova University prior to \nbeing commissioned as an Ensign in 1984.\n  During his career he accumulated over 4,000 hours of flight time, \nincluding over 400 hours of combat time in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the \nformer Republic of Yugoslavia. He has over 900 carrier arrested \nlandings; and even more impressive over 300 of these took place at \nnight. Captain Glackin completed seven deployments while serving on the \naircraft carriers USS Ranger, USS Roosevelt, USS Independence, and USS \nEnterprise. He completed two overseas tours, including a tour forward \ndeployed with the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet in Japan. He commanded a \nsquadron of EA-6B Prowlers aboard USS Enterprise in the fight against \nthe Taliban in Afghanistan following the horrific attacks of September \n11.\n  Captain Glackin's family and shipmates can be proud of his \ndistinguished service. His wife Maureen and their two children, Ann and \nOwen, also deserve praise for the sacrifices they made in support of \nCaptain Glackin's naval career. As he departs the Pentagon to his \nsecond career, I call upon my colleagues to wish Brian and his family \nevery success, and the traditional Navy ``fair winds and following \nseas.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1520-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING MARVIN FARBMAN\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I honor a dedicated public \nservant, Marvin Farbman, who is retiring after 30 years of tireless \nwork at Connecticut Legal Services, CLS, on behalf of the people of \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. Farbman came to Connecticut Legal Services in 1977 with an \nimpressive academic record. He received his undergraduate degree in \nbiology at Boston University, his M.A. in Philosophy from the \nUniversity of Western Ontario, and finally his law degree at the \nUniversity of Connecticut, where he graduated with honors. Connecticut \nLegal Services hired him as a staff attorney, where he quickly took on \nmore than 100 client cases per year, serving as counsel for low-income \nConnecticut families.\n  Over the past 30 years, Marvin Farbman worked tirelessly to provide \nbetter housing for low-income residents of Connecticut. Only a year \nafter joining the staff of Connecticut Legal Services, he created \nEquity in Housing, a ground-breaking housing cooperative that continues \nserving low-income households today. Within 2 years, Mr. Farbman was \npromoted to the position of managing attorney of the Middletown office \nof Connecticut Legal Services.\n  During his years as managing attorney, Mr. Farbman continued to lead \nthe fight for low-income housing improvements both in and out of the \ncourtroom. He served as lead counsel in several influential court \ncases, including Korsko v. Harris, which stopped the conversion of a \nfederally-subsidized 200-unit housing project into private condominiums \nwith no assistance for low-income residents, Nelson v. Heintz, a \nsuccessful lawsuit against the City of Bridgeport to obtain more \nreasonable shelter payment levels for low-income citizens, and Father \nPanik Village Tenants Assoc. v. Cisneros, which obtained a preliminary \ncourt settlement requiring the Bridgeport Housing Authority to replace \nmore than 1,000 demolished public housing units.\n  Mr. Farbman's dedication and continued success in court was matched \nby the success of his other efforts to improve the community. In 1985, \nhe led the effort to create the Middlesex Red Cross homeless shelter, \nthe first apartment-based family shelter in Connecticut. He also \norganized a local coalition to renovate Arriwani Hotel, a single room \nflophouse, into a nonprofit apartment building with support services \nfor residents.\n  When he was promoted to executive director of CLS in 1995, Mr. \nFarbman successfully guided the agency in the establishment of an \noperating plan to begin rebuilding its service capacity. Over his \ntenure as executive director, Connecticut Legal Services handled \napproximately 50,000 client cases, improving the lives of countless \nConnecticut residents and the communities where they live.\n  Millions of Americans live in poverty, and many must depend on people \nlike Marvin Farbman to fight for their basic needs in court. Mr. \nFarbman has dedicated his life to improving the lives of low-income \nfamilies, and his influence can be seen throughout Connecticut. For his \ndedicated service, Connecticut, and indeed, the whole nation owe him a \ntremendous debt of gratitude.\n  On February 8, a dinner will be held in honor of Marvin Farbman's \nmany contributions to Connecticut Legal Services and the field of legal \nrepresentation for low-income families. This dinner will be a wonderful \ntribute to Marvin's dedication to serving underprivileged residents of \nConnecticut.\n  Once again, I extend my deep thanks to Marvin Farbman for his long \nlegacy of service to his community, to the people of Connecticut, and \nto our Nation. I wish to congratulate him, his wife Evelyn, and his \nsons Daniel and Herschel on this wonderful occasion, and I wish him \nwell as he embarks on this new chapter in his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1520-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1520-S1521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RICHARD M. SHAPIRO\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I express my gratitude and thanks to \nRichard M. Shapiro for his many years of service to the Members and \nstaff of the Congress. I and other Members honor him for his dedication \nto this great institution, his tireless work on its behalf, and the \ncountless ways in which he has helped us serve the public over nearly \nthree decades, including almost two decades as executive director of \nthe Congressional Management Foundation.\n  Mr. Shapiro began his impressive career in 1978 here in the Senate, \nwhen he was a staff investigator at the former Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations. After receiving a master's degree in public policy \nfrom Princeton University, Mr. Shapiro returned to Congress as the \nstaff director for the former House Post Office and Civil Service \nSubcommittee on Investigations and later became staff director at the \nHouse Small Business Subcommittee on Regulations and Business \nOpportunities. In those positions, he continued to learn Congress \ninside and out, especially the importance of good management in the \nformation of effective teams and the unique challenges facing managers \nin Congress. This experience led him to become deputy executive \ndirector of the Congressional Management Foundation in 1988, and just 1 \nyear later he became executive director.\n  During his years at CMF, Rick has undertaken numerous strategies with \njust one goal--helping Congress do the public's business more \nefficiently and effectively. His efforts as a management consultant \nhave involved countless office retreats, staff surveys, individual \nassessments, and strategic planning sessions. Rick has also delivered \ndozens of training programs to address the needs of legislative and \nsupport staff. He has also authored and coauthored several books \nincluding the biannual ``House and Senate Staff Salary Survey, \nFrontline Management, and Setting Course; A Congressional Management \nGuide'' which has proved to be an invaluable guide for hundreds of new \nMembers as they arrive in Congress. Rick has also undertaken a wide\n\n[[Page S1521]]\n\nrange of activities to help Congress effectively move into the Digital \nAge, including recommendations on Web site design and managing Internet \ncommunications.\n  I can speak directly to the terrific work that Rick has done over the \nyears because for more than a decade he has played a critical role in \nhelping me and my staff manage the challenges and take advantage of \nopportunities we have in representing the people of Wisconsin here in \nthe Senate. That assistance has taken a wide variety of forms, ranging \nfrom multiday all-staff retreats, to staff surveys and analysis, to \nindividual staff assessment and advice. He has helped us design annual \nevaluations, improve our salary and bonus structure, design our Web \nsite, improve our mail system, and--perhaps most importantly--step back \nand assess our environment regularly to be sure we are doing our best \nfor the people of Wisconsin.\n  Rick's efforts on behalf of our office reflect the amazing dedication \nand commitment that he has brought to every task over the years. There \nis never any question too small--or any hour too late--for him to make \nhimself available to offer advice. His thoughtful analysis has been \ncritical to many decisions I have made over the years, and I am \ngrateful for his assistance at many key junctures in my career. I know \nthat my office operates much more efficiently and effectively today \nthanks to his advice over the years.\n  Beyond his work with my office, I would also like to honor Rick for \nhis dedication in continuing and dramatically expanding the work of \nCMF. Nonprofit organizations are a bit like restaurants--many of them \nopen every year, but few of them last. Ultimately, those that survive \ndo so as a result of the tireless dedication of a very small group of \npeople, and in the case of CMF, Rick has helped them not only survive \nbut to thrive and grow. During his tenure, the budget for CMF has more \nthan quadrulpled, while the staff has doubled and the work done for \nCongress has grown exponentially. As I mentioned earlier, Rick and CMF \nhave undertaken a wide range of activities on behalf of Congress. \nUltimately, Rick and CMF have a ``whatever it takes'' attitude, and we \nin Congress have been the beneficiaries of that intensity, creativity, \nand dedication.\n  In conclusion, I would like to honor Rick for his tireless dedication \nto assisting Senators, Congressmen, staff, and the entire institution \nof the Congress in our efforts to better serve the American people. We \nare grateful for all of his hard work over the years, and we look \nforward to working with him again in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1521-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill and joint resolution were read the second time, \nand placed on the calendar:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to authorize a major medical facility project for the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs at Denver, Colorado; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to fully \nauthorize the necessary funds needed to complete the construction of a \nnew VA medical facility near Denver, CO. I am joined by my colleague \nSenator Salazar on this important legislation. Thankfully, Congress \nauthorized approximately 16 percent of the needed funds for this \nproject last year in order to finalize planning and site acquisition. \nThat is a promising start that enables the project planners to begin \nthe serious business of building this hospital. Although this was a \ntremendous step forward, there is still a great deal more that needs to \nbe accomplished in order for this hospital to become a reality.\n  The current Denver VA hospital was built ``more than 50 years ago and \nas we are all well aware, medical technology has far surpassed what the \nbuilders of the Denver VA originally envisioned. This facility, which \nhosted the first liver transplant in 1963, has provided tremendous care \nover the years, but simply does not have the infrastructure to continue \nto provide our veterans the care they need in the 21st century. While I \ncannot say enough about the care and service our veterans receive at \nthe current facility, many changes and improvements can and should be \nmade, and a new facility is the only way to accomplish these goals.\n  This new VA hospital to be located at Fitzsimons campus and the \nformer home of the Fitzsimons Army Medical Center will carry on a \nstrong tradition of providing exceptional medical care for our Nation's \nbest and bravest citizens. The current Fitzsimons campus first began \ntreating wounded veterans in 1918, specializing in assisting those who \nhad been victims of chemical weapons in world War I. The facility \ncontinued to grow through the 20th century and became one of the \npremiere Veterans hospitals through World War II. Fitzsimons was even \nunofficially deemed the ``White House of the West'' when President \nEisenhower spent 7 weeks in the facility while recovering from a heart \ncondition in 1955. Fitzsimons Hospital was even the birthplace of my \ncolleague, Senator Kerry.\n  The new facility will provide an example of successful collaboration \nbetween numerous parties and will be the culmination of years of hard \nwork. The Denver VA, the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center \nand the University of Colorado Hospital already have a complex and \nrewarding partnership in meeting veterans' healthcare needs in the \nregion, and all are partnered together on this unique project. The \nUniversity of Colorado, who currently owns the land for the new \nhospital, strongly supports the move of the existing Denver VA medical \nfacility to the Fitzsimons Campus in Aurora, CO, and looks forward to \nstrengthening their partnership with the Veterans Administration, \nallowing each entity to focus on its strengths.\n  Of course, the biggest endorsement of this new facility comes \nultimately from the end-users: our veterans. The United Veterans \nCommittee of Colorado, a coalition of 45 federally chartered veterans' \nservice organizations, strongly supports the relocation of the Denver \nVA medical center to the Fitzsimons campus and has worked closely with \nmy office and the Colorado congressional delegation over the years to \nensure its success.\n\n  Of course, not too long ago it looked like this project was in peril. \nThankfully, in 2005 Secretary Nicholson brought a much-needed, fresh \nperspective to this project. He made it a priority and made it clear to \nthe entire Colorado delegation that he would pursue every opportunity \nto make the project a reality. I commend his efforts and thank him for \nhis support. It is also important to mention the hard work and \ndiligence of those in Colorado who have also worked to ensure the \nsuccess of this new hospital. Without the extraordinary efforts put \nforth by the Fitzsimons Redevelopment Authority and its chairman, city \nof Aurora Mayor Ed Tauer, an agreement would not have been reached on \nthe ultimate location of the Hospital.\n  I strongly support authorization of this hospital and look forward to \nseeing the completion of the new VA medical facility which undoubtedly \nwill serve as a regional beacon for modern veteran medical care science \nnot only for veterans in Colorado but throughout the entire Rocky \nMountain region as well.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, today Senator Allard and I are \nintroducing a bill that will authorize full funding for a state-of-the-\nart veterans' hospital at the Fitzsimons campus in Aurora, CO.\n  This crown jewel of our veterans' health system will serve more than \n424,000 veterans who live in Colorado, and many more who live in nearby \nStates, with the best available health care. Our veterans deserve the \nbest, and Fitzsimons will be the best.\n  Since the VA identified the Fitzsimons VA Hospital as one of its top \nmedical construction projects in 2004, I have fought to move this \nproject forward, although we've encountered some hurdles along the way.\n  But we are making progress. I helped bring all the stakeholders \ntogether in 2005 so that supporters of the project, and advocates for \nveterans' health care, could speak with one voice on Fitzsimons. Thanks \nin part to this dialogue, in February of 2006 the VA finally reached \nagreement with the Fitzsimons Authority on the purchase price of 24 \nacres at the site.\n  And just 2 months ago, in December, I was pleased that the omnibus \nveterans' bill we passed, S. 3421, included a $98 million authorization \nfor Fitzsimons that was so desperately needed to keep the project on \ntrack. Senator Allard and I fought hard for that authorization because \nit allowed the VA to use unspent project funds from previous years, and \nto begin spending more on the critical initial phases of the project.\n  Today, Senator Allard and I are introducing a bill that will complete \nthe authorization for Fitzsimons VA Hospital. Our bill authorizes the \nremaining $523 million necessary to complete the project. It is a \nstraightforward bill that we should pass as soon as possible to ensure \nwe don't run into any costly construction delays down the road.\n  I spoke with Secretary Nicholson about this project just last week, \nand he reiterated his commitment to getting this project done as soon \nas possible. Just as the VA must keep Fitzsimons at the top of its \npriority list, so too should Congress do its part by completing the \nauthorization for the project.\n  I look forward to the day when our veterans can enjoy the benefits of \na new state-of-the-art facility at Fitzsimons. They have more than \nearned the high quality care they will receive there, and I urge this \nbody to keep the project on track by passing this bill as soon as \npossible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 473. A bill to improve the prohibitions on money laundering, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of a bill \nthat I am introducing today, the Combating Money Laundering and \nTerrorist Financing Act of 2007.\n  The life-blood of any criminal organization or enterprise is money. \nWhether engaged in drug dealing or terrorism, criminals cannot operate \nwithout money. The targeting of efforts by criminals to hide \nillegitimate funds in legitimate financial institutions has long been a \nfocus of law enforcement.\n\n[[Page S1524]]\n\nYet like all other aspects of criminal activity, money laundering \ncontinues to evolve into newer and more complex forms. This is \nparticularly true in the funding of terrorist organizations and \noperations. Therefore, money laundering remains not only a criminal \nracket but also poses a grave threat to our national security.\n  Tracking how terrorists obtain, store, and move illicit funds is \namong the most critical aspects of stopping their efforts. Among its \nrecommendations, the 9/11 Commission report stated that, ``Vigorous \nefforts to track terrorist financing must remain front and center in \nthe U.S. counterterrorism efforts.'' We have made some significant \nstrides in identifying how terrorists accumulate and move money, but \nmore remains to be done. Terrorists and criminal networks continually \nevolve new ways of using legitimate means to launder illegally obtained \nfunds. We must not underestimate the intelligence or resolve of these \ngroups. Many have already utilized loopholes in current law to hide \nfunds or circumvent required reporting to U.S. Customs officials.\n  Work must continue so that terrorists and other criminals are left \nwithout the ability to hide illegally obtained funds inside or in \nconcert with legitimate means. We should commit to increasing pressure \non these organizations to make money laundering as difficult and \nunprofitable as possible. And ultimately, we must give law enforcement \nand prosecutors the ability to effectively deal with criminals' ever-\nchanging tactics.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today will strengthen our \ncurrent money laundering statutes by streamlining those laws, closing \nthose loopholes in the laws exploited by criminal organizations, and \ncreating more efficient means for dealing with violators of money \nlaundering laws. My bill goes about doing this in several ways.\n  First, my bill deals with the problem of ``specified unlawful \nactivities'' or ``SUAs.'' SUAs are predicate offenses required for \ncurrent money laundering statutes to apply, and there are currently \nover 200 of them. As criminals continue to change methods of laundering \nmoney, the list of SUAs will continue to grow. This legislation will \nprevent criminals from turning to other means not designated as an SUA, \nand will consolidate the ever growing list of SUAs by including all \nfederal and state offenses punishable by imprisonment for more than one \nyear. Also, criminals will no longer be able to hide behind borders, as \nthis legislation would subject violations in foreign countries that \nhave an effect on the U.S. to the same penalties as if they had \noccurred in the United States.\n  Currently, most circuit courts must charge each violation of money \nlaundering statutes separately. My bill will allow, at the election of \nthe government, prosecutors to charge multiple acts under one count in \nan indictment. This will significantly reduce the time and expense \nincurred by the courts in these cases, versus the current method of \ncharging each and every violation separately.\n\n  Criminals have realized that the movement of large sums of money \nthrough traditional financial institutions will result in increased \nscrutiny and investigation. Therefore, many have turned to smuggling \nlarge quantities of money via a courier or bulk cash smuggling. They \nhave developed techniques to avoid having to declare property with a \nvalue greater than $10,000 and to protect those couriers who are \ncaught. My legislation will remove the criminal's ability to get around \ncurrent laws, and remove protections for the smuggler.\n  For example, current law requires that couriers know specifics about \nthe illegal activities that produced the monies they carry before they \nmay be prosecuted under money laundering statutes. As a result, many \nclaim ignorance about the illegal origins of the money and are \nreleased. With my bill, couriers will now be held responsible for their \nactions, even if they try to claim ignorance. Therefore, law \nenforcement can get both the courier and the money off the street. This \nbill also would stiffen the penalty for bulk cash smuggling to 10 \nyears.\n  Another tactic now being used by criminals is to have couriers carry \nblank checks in bearer form. The couriers argue that the check has no \namount, so it is not subject to declaration. Once the courier arrives \nat his destination, he merely has to fill in the amount, whatever it \nmay be. My legislation would remove this loophole by setting the value \nof any blank check in bearer form equal to the highest amount in that \naccount during the time period it was being transported, or when it is \ncashed.\n  My bill also seeks to mitigate the tactics of ``commingling funds'' \nand ``structured transactions.'' The ``commingling funds'' tactic \ninvolves depositing illegal money in an account with legitimate funds. \nUnder current law, criminals can argue that money withdrawn from the \naccount was from the legitimate sources. The language in this bill \nwould clarify that transactions on accounts containing more than \n$10,000 in illegally obtained funds will be considered a transaction \ninvolving more than $10,000 in criminally derived property, regardless \nof how the other money in the account was obtained. Nor will criminals \nbe allowed to avoid the law by structuring smaller transactions below \nthe $10,000 reporting requirement. Under my bill, individual but \nrelated transactions will be considered at their aggregate value.\n  Finally, this bill will provide the United States Secret Service with \nthe legislative and financial resources it needs to combat \ncounterfeiters and other criminals seeking to harm our financial \nsystems. The U.S. Federal Reserve Note is the most identifiable \ncurrency in the world and the backbone of many other nations' \neconomies. To help ensure continued stability of the Greenback \nworldwide, my bill will make illegal the possession of any materials \nused to make counterfeit currency. This is necessary because technology \nhas evolved far beyond the old days of printing plates, stones, and \ndigital images. Like the evolving tactics used by those in money \nlaundering operations, the counterfeiter constantly changes his tactics \nand technologies. Furthermore, the crime of counterfeiting is becoming \nmore and more international in scope every day. The Secret Service has \nidentified counterfeiting operations in Colombia, Nigeria, Italy, Iraq, \nand North Korea. This is apparent in the use of bleached notes. \nBleached notes are simply bills with low denominations being bleached \nwith chemicals. This produces a blank canvas of genuine currency paper \nfor counterfeiters to work with, to which they can add higher \ndenominations. My bill will make it illegal to possess these bleached \nor otherwise altered notes, and give the Secret Service the \nauthorization it needs to pursue these criminals outside the United \nStates.\n  Additionally, this bill gives the Secret Service the authorization to \nuse funds seized from criminals to pay for ongoing undercover \ninvestigations. This seems like common sense, and indeed, every other \nfederal investigative agency has this authority. Tasked with protecting \nour financial systems, the Secret Service should be provided with all \nthe resources necessary to fund its undercover operations. This makes \neven more sense, considering it's the criminals themselves who would be \npaying those bills. My bill provides that authority to the Secret \nService and will allow them to continue the important work of \nprotecting our financial infrastructure.\n  As I said, money is essential for the operation of any criminal or \nterrorist organization. The ability to get, move, and hide these funds \nis critical to the operations of both. We have had some success in \nthwarting this ability, as is evident by the constantly changing \ntechniques for laundering money. We must continue to apply pressure on \nthese groups, and do everything we can to identify and stop their \nfinancing operations. This bill is designed to do just that, and put \nthese organizations out of business for good. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me and my cosponsors, Senators Kyl, Cornyn, and Graham, in \nsupporting this legislation to combat the financing of criminal and \nterrorist activities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 473\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S1525]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to award a congressional gold medal to Michael Ellis \nDeBakey, M.D.; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nlifetime achievements of my dear friend Dr. Michael Ellis DeBakey, a \npublic servant and world-renowned cardiologist, by re-introducing \nlegislation to award him the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  Throughout his life, Dr. DeBakey has made numerous advances in the \nfield of\n\n[[Page S1527]]\n\nmedicine. When he was only 23 years of age and still attending medical \nschool, Dr. DeBakey developed a roller pump for blood transfusions--the \nprecursor and major component of the heart-lung machine used in the \nfirst open-heart operation. This device later led to national \nrecognition for his expertise in vascular disease. His service to our \ncountry did not stop there.\n  Dr. DeBakey put his practice on hold and volunteered for military \nservice during World War II with the Surgeon General's staff. During \nthis time, he received the rank of Colonel and Chief of Surgical \nConsultants Division.\n  As a result of his military and medical experience, Dr. DeBakey made \nnumerous recommendations to improve the military's medical procedures. \nHis efforts led to the development of mobile army surgical hospitals, \nbetter known as MASH units, which earned him the Legion of Merit in \n1945.\n  After WWII, Dr. DeBakey continued his hard work by proposing national \nand specialized medical centers for those soldiers who were wounded or \nneeded follow-up treatment. This recommendation evolved into the \nVeterans Affairs Medical Center System and the establishment of the \ncommission on Veterans Medical Problems of the National Research \nCouncil.\n  In 1948, Dr. DeBakey joined the Baylor University College of \nMedicine, where he started its first surgical residency program and was \nlater elected the first President of Baylor College of Medicine.\n  Adding to his list of accomplishments, Dr. DeBakey performed the \nfirst successful procedure to treat patients with aneurysms. In 1964, \nDr. DeBakey performed the first successful coronary bypass surgery, \nopening the doors for surgeons to perform preventative procedures to \nsave the lives of many people with heart disease. He was also the first \nto successfully use a partial artificial heart. Later that same year, \nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Dr. DeBakey as Chairman of the \nPresident's Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer and Stroke, which led \nto the creation of Regional Medical Programs. These programs coordinate \nmedical schools, research institutions and hospitals to enhance \nresearch and training.\n  Dr. DeBakey continued to amaze the medical world when he pioneered \nthe field of telemedicine by performing the first open-heart surgery \ntransmitted over satellite and then supervised the first successful \nmulti-organ transplant, where a heart, both kidneys and a lung were \ntransplanted from a single donor into four separate recipients.\n  These accomplishments have led to national recognition. Dr. DeBakey \nhas received both the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction \nfrom President Johnson and the National Medal of Science from President \nRonald Reagan.\n  Recently, Dr. DeBakey worked with NASA engineers to develop the \nDeBakey Ventricular Assist Device, which may eliminate the need for \nsome patients to receive heart transplants.\n  I stand here today to acknowledge Dr. DeBakey's invaluable work and \nsignificant contribution to medicine by offering a bill to award him \nthe Congressional Gold Medal. His efforts and innovative surgical \ntechniques have since saved the lives of thousands, if not millions, of \npeople. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing the \nprofound impact this man has had on medical advances, the delivery of \nmedicine and how we care for our Veterans. Although, Dr. DeBakey is not \na native of Texas, he has made Texas proud. He has guided the Baylor \nCollege of Medicine and the city of Houston into becoming a world \nleader in medical advancement. On behalf of all Texans, I thank Dr. \nDeBakey for his lifetime of commitment and service, not only to the \nmedical community, but to the world.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 474\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Michael Ellis DeBakey, M.D., was born on September 7, \n     1908, in Lake Charles, Louisiana, to Shaker and Raheeja \n     DeBakey.\n       (2) Dr. DeBakey, at the age of 23 and still a medical \n     student, reported a major invention, a roller pump for blood \n     transfusions, which later became a major component of the \n     heart-lung machine used in the first successful open-heart \n     operation.\n       (3) Even though Dr. DeBakey had already achieved a national \n     reputation as an authority on vascular disease and had a \n     promising career as a surgeon and teacher, he volunteered for \n     military service during World War II, joining the Surgeon \n     General's staff and rising to the rank of Colonel and Chief \n     of the Surgical Consultants Division.\n       (4) As a result of this first-hand knowledge of military \n     service, Dr. DeBakey made numerous recommendations for the \n     proper staged management of war wounds, which led to the \n     development of mobile army surgical hospitals or ``MASH'' \n     units, and earned Dr. DeBakey the Legion of Merit in 1945.\n       (5) After the war, Dr. DeBakey proposed the systematic \n     medical follow-up of veterans and recommended the creation of \n     specialized medical centers in different areas of the United \n     States to treat wounded military personnel returning from \n     war, and from this recommendation evolved the Veterans \n     Affairs Medical Center System and the establishment of the \n     Commission on Veterans Medical Problems of the National \n     Research Council.\n       (6) In 1948, Dr. DeBakey joined the Baylor University \n     College of Medicine, where he developed the first surgical \n     residency program in the city of Houston, and today, guided \n     by Dr. DeBakey's vision, the College is one of the most \n     respected health science centers in the Nation.\n       (7) In 1953, Dr. DeBakey performed the first successful \n     procedures to treat patients who suffered aneurysms leading \n     to severe strokes, and he later developed a series of \n     innovative surgical techniques for the treatment of aneurysms \n     enabling thousands of lives to be saved in the years ahead.\n       (8) In 1964, Dr. DeBakey triggered the most explosive era \n     in modern cardiac surgery, when he performed the first \n     successful coronary bypass, once again paving the way for \n     surgeons world-wide to offer hope to thousands of patients \n     who might otherwise succumb to heart disease.\n       (9) Two years later, Dr. DeBakey made medical history \n     again, when he was the first to successfully use a partial \n     artificial heart to solve the problems of a patient who could \n     not be weaned from a heart-lung machine following open-heart \n     surgery.\n       (10) In 1968, Dr. DeBakey supervised the first successful \n     multi-organ transplant, in which a heart, both kidneys, and \n     lung were transplanted from a single donor into 4 separate \n     recipients.\n       (11) In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Dr. \n     DeBakey to the position of Chairman of the President's \n     Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer and Stroke, leading to \n     the creation of Regional Medical Programs established ``to \n     encourage and assist in the establishment of regional \n     cooperative arrangements among medical schools, research \n     institutions, and hospitals, for research and training''.\n       (12) In the mid-1960's, Dr. DeBakey pioneered the field of \n     telemedicine with the first demonstration of open-heart \n     surgery to be transmitted overseas by satellite.\n       (13) In 1969, Dr. DeBakey was elected the first President \n     of Baylor College of Medicine.\n       (14) In 1969, President Lyndon B. Johnson bestowed on Dr. \n     DeBakey the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction, \n     and in 1985, President Ronald Reagan conferred on him the \n     National Medal of Science.\n       (15) Working with NASA engineers, he refined existing \n     technology to create the DeBakey Ventricular Assist Device, \n     one-tenth the size of current versions, which may eliminate \n     the need for heart transplantation in some patients.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate \n     shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on \n     behalf of the Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate \n     design, to Michael Ellis DeBakey, M.D., in recognition of his \n     many outstanding contributions to the Nation.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a \n     gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions \n     to be determined by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of \n     the gold medal struck pursuant to section 2 under such \n     regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, at a price \n     sufficient to cover the cost thereof, including labor, \n     materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses, and \n     the cost of the gold medal.\n\n     SEC. 4. STATUS OF MEDALS.\n\n       (a) National Medals.--The medals struck pursuant to this \n     Act are national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title \n     31, United States Code.\n       (b) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of sections 5134 and \n     5136 of title 31, United States Code, all medals struck under \n     this Act shall be considered to be numismatic items.\n\n     SEC. 5. AUTHORITY TO USE FUND AMOUNTS; PROCEEDS OF SALE.\n\n       (a) Authority To Use Fund Amounts.--There is authorized to \n     be charged against the\n\n[[Page S1528]]\n\n     United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund such amounts as may \n     be necessary to pay for the costs of the medals struck \n     pursuant to this Act.\n       (b) Proceeds of Sale.--Amounts received from the sale of \n     duplicate bronze medals authorized under section 3 shall be \n     deposited into the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 475. A bill to increase the number of Deputy United States \nMarshals that investigate immigration crimes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to with Senator Bingaman to \nintroduce legislation that provides resources that the U.S. Marshals \nService desperately needs for their role in improving the security of \nour borders and enforcing our immigration laws.\n  Our U.S. Marshals are involved in several aspects of immigration \nmatters, including helping to transport criminal immigrants and \nguarding them in federal courthouses. As we improve border security and \ninterior enforcement, our Marshals need increased staff to handle the \nincreased caseload that will be associated with those improvements.\n  Therefore, my legislation calls for hiring 50 new deputies each year \nfor five years. Increasing the number of Deputy U.S. Marshals by 250 \nnew law enforcers will make a great impact on this service that is \nstretched thin in their role relating to border security and \nimmigration enforcement. Without such legislation, we will only be \nadding to the workload of our already thinly-stretched Marshals \nService.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 475\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DEPUTY UNITED STATES MARSHALS.\n\n       (a) Increase Positions.--In each of the fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2012, the Attorney General, subject to the \n     availability of appropriations, shall increase by not less \n     than 50 the number of positions for full-time active duty \n     Deputy United States Marshals that investigate criminal \n     matters related to immigration.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Attorney General such sums as may \n     be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2012 \n     to carry out subsection (a).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 477. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain land and improvements of the Gooding Division of the Minidoka \nProject, Idaho; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce a bill today \nwith my colleague, Senator Craig to formally convey title a portion of \nthe American Falls Reservoir District from the Bureau of Reclamation to \nthe National Park Service in our home State of Idaho.\n  The Minidoka Internment National Monument Draft General Management \nPlan and Environment Impact Statement proposes, the transfer of these \ntwo publicly owned parcels of land, which are both within and adjacent \nto the existing 73-acre NPS boundary, and have been identified as \nimportant for inclusion as part of the Monument. The sites were both \nwithin the original 33,000-acre Minidoka Relocation Center that was \noperated by the War Relocation Authority, where approximately 13,500 \nJapanese and Japanese Americans were held from 1942 through 1945.\n  The smaller 2.31-acre parcel is located in the center of the monument \nin the old warehouse area and includes three historical buildings and \nother important cultural features. The Draft General Management Plan \nproposes to use this site for visitor services, including a Visitor \nContact Station within an original warehouse to greet visitors and \nprovide orientation for the monument. The other, a 7.87-acre parcel, is \non the east end of the monument and was undeveloped during WWII. The \nNPS proposes to use this area for special events and to provide a site \nfor the development of a memorial for the Issei, first-generation \nJapanese immigrants. These two publicly-owned properties are critical \nfor long-term development, visitor services, and protection and \npreservation of historical structures and features at Minidoka \nInternment National Monument.\n  I would like to add that this legislation was developed with and is \nstrongly supported by both the agencies involved and the local \ncommunities. I ask my colleagues to join me in enacting this small land \ntransfer that we might move a step closer toward properly memorializing \nan important, but often forgotten, chapter of our Nation's history.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 477\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nreplace the Federal Election Commission with Federal Election \nAdministration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my good \nfriend and colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold in once again \nintroducing legislation to replace the Federal Election Commission \n(FEC) with the Federal Election Administration (FEA). The FEA would \nserve as an independent body to enforce Federal campaign laws--\nsomething the FEC has been unable, and often unwilling, to do.\n  This legislation would terminate the FEC and establish a new \nregulatory entity. Using a new organizational structure and \nadministrative law judges, we hope to avoid the routine partisan \ndeadlocks that are now so prevalent at the FEC.\n  This bill would authorize the new FEA to impose civil penalties, \nissue cease and desist orders, report apparent criminal violations to \nthe appropriate law enforcement authorities, and conduct audits and \nfield examinations of campaign committees. Finally, this bill would \ndirect the Comptroller General to examine and report to Congress on the \nenforcement of the criminal provisions of the Federal campaign finance \nlaws.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this common sense reform proposal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Rockefeller, Ms. \n        Snowe, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Smith, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Thune, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 479. A bill to reduce the incidence of suicide among veterans; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am honored to join with the \ndistinguished senior Senator from my State, Senator Grassley, to \nintroduce the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act.\n  During my years in the Navy, I learned one of the most important \nlessons of my entire life: Never leave a buddy behind. That's true on \nthe battlefield--and it's also true after our servicemembers return \nhome. Taking care of our veterans is a continuing cost of national \ndefense, and we need to make sure we don't abandon them once they \nreturn home.\n  Our service men and women endure tremendous stress during combat. \nAlmost all of our soldiers reported being under fire while serving in \nIraq and knowing someone seriously injured or killed. Returning home \nand rejoining their families and friends can be a time of hope and joy, \nbut it can also be a time of enormous stress. In particular, the \ntraumas and memories of combat service can cause profound problems. \nArmy studies show that around 25 percent of soldiers who have served in \nIraq display symptoms of serious mental-health problems, including \ndepression, substance abuse and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n  Tragically, suicide disproportionately affects veterans. In 2004, \nveterans accounted for more than 20 percent of deaths by suicide, yet \nthey make up only 10 percent of the general population. We should be \naddressing this shocking rate of suicide among our veterans. But the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) currently does not have appropriate \nsuicide prevention, early detection, and treatment programs available \nto meet the needs of our veterans. This is unacceptable! The aim of our \nbill is to improve early detection and intervention; provide access to \nservices for veterans in crisis; and, thereby, prevent the unnecessary \ndeaths of the men and women who have put their lives on the line to \ndefend our nation.\n  Joshua Omvig was one such veteran. Josh was a member of the United \nStates Army Reserve 339th MP Company, based in Davenport, IA. Before \nleaving for Iraq, he was a member of the Grundy Center Volunteer Fire \nDepartment and the Grundy Center Police Reserves. He felt honored to \nserve his country in the Reserves and hoped to return to serve his \ncommunity as a police officer. Unfortunately, when he returned from his \n11-month deployment in Iraq, he brought the traumas of war with him. He \ncommitted suicide a few days before Christmas in 2005. He was just 22 \nyears old.\n  This was a preventable death. If Josh and his family had had better \naccess to mental health services; if they had been trained to recognize \nthe symptoms of PTSD; and if they had known where to turn for help; \nthen the tragedy of his death might well have been avoided.\n  In his honor, Senator Grassley and I offer this legislation to \nimprove the services offered by the VA, and to bring down the appalling \nrate of suicide among veterans.\n  First, this bill focuses on reducing the stigma associated with \nseeking treatment for mental health problems. Almost 80 percent of \nsoldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan who exhibited signs of mental \nhealth problems were not referred for mental health services. More than \ntwo-thirds of the servicemembers who screened positive for a mental \nhealth problem reported that they were concerned about the stigma \nassociated with seeking treatment.\n  Given these statistics, our bill calls for the creation of a mental \nhealth campaign to increase awareness of mental illness and the risk \nfactors for suicide. Veterans need to hear from members of the chain of \ncommand, leadership within the VA, and from their peers that seeking \nmental health services is important for their health, their families, \nand no different than seeking treatment for a physical health issue, \nsuch as chronic pain or a broken leg.\n  Second, this bill ensures that VA staff and medical personnel will \nreceive suicide prevention and education training so that they can \nrecognize when and where to refer veterans for assistance. \nAdditionally, the legislation ensures 24-hour access to mental health \ncare for those who are at risk for suicide, including those in rural or \nremote areas. Veterans who do not have easy access to VA hospitals and \nveterans centers must be assured of access to services during periods \nof crisis.\n  Finally, this bill recognizes the importance of family and peer \nsupport. It trains peer counselors to understand the risk factors for \nsuicide, provide support during readjustment, and to assist veterans in \nseeking help. This bill also engages family members by helping them to \nunderstand the readjustment process; to recognize the signs and \nsymptoms of mental illness; and let them know where to turn for \nassistance. By enlisting the aid and support of family members and \npeers, we will reduce the likelihood that our veterans suffer in \nisolation.\n  The stresses that our service men and women endure in combat are \nstrong and can trigger severe mental\n\n[[Page S1530]]\n\nhealth issues. Although our men and women may come home safely, the war \nisn't over for them. Often, the physical wounds of combat are repaired, \nbut the mental damage--the psychological scars of combat--can haunt a \nperson for a lifetime. The Federal Government has a moral contract with \nthose who have fought for our country and sacrificed so much. Together, \nwe can work to make good on that contract. Our service men and women \ndeserve to know that we will not forget about their service--and we \nwill not leave them behind.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 480. A bill to amend the Antitrust Modernization Commission Act of \n2002, to extend the term of the Antitrust Modernization Commission and \nto make a technical correction; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Antitrust \nModernization Commission Extension Act of 2007. This legislation will \nensure that the Commission is able to finalize its report examining the \nstate of the Nation's antitrust laws in a timely manner by granting it \na brief 30 day extension to close out its operations. I thank my co-\nsponsors Senators Hatch and Specter for joining me in introducing this \nmeasure.\n  Congress established the Antitrust Modernization Commission through \nthe passage of the Antitrust Modernization Act of 2002. The \nCommission's purpose was to ``examine whether the need exists to \nmodernize the antitrust laws'' of our Nation. In fulfillment of this \npurpose the Commission is now finalizing a comprehensive report due to \nboth Congress and the President by April 2, 2007. Currently, the \nCommission expects the report to be submitted in a timely manner. The \nCommission is concerned, however, with the sufficiency of the \nstatutorily required 30 day deadline to dismantle itself following the \nsubmission of the report.\n  In order to comply with the current statutory framework and shut down \noperations within 30 days of the report's submission date, the \nCommission will need to begin archiving its records prior to its \ncompletion of the report. This large administrative undertaking will \ninterfere with the Commission's final efforts on the report given the \nCommission's very limited staff resources. In view of the importance of \nthe report, it is imperative that no aspect of this report be \njeopardized by administrative deadlines. To alleviate this burden on \nthe closing operations of the Commission, I am introducing this \nlegislation to extend the Commission's administrative shutdown period \nfrom 30 days to 60 days.\n  Granting an additional 30 days to the Commission will provide it with \ntime to archive Commission records and work product, while allowing it \nto perform other necessary close-out tasks, including the transfer of \nits acquired property to other government agencies, without interfering \nwith the completion of its report. Furthermore, the time extension \nrequested does not contemplate the appropriation of any additional \nfunding to the Commission. In fact, the Commission expects that it will \nlikely return at least $500,000 to the Treasury of the $4 million \nallocated to it upon fulfillment of its purpose. This 30 day extension \nis merely directed at the administrative process of wrapping up \noperations.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that will \neffectively and efficiently allow the Antitrust Modernization \nCommission to complete its designated tasks.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 480\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Antitrust Modernization \n     Commission Extension Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF TERMINATION.\n\n       Section 11059 of the Antitrust Modernization Commission Act \n     of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 1 note) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``30 days'' and inserting ``60 days''; and\n       (2) by striking ``section 8'' and inserting ``section \n     11058''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. McCain, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mr.  Kohl, and Mr. Thune):\n  S. 481. A bill to recruit and retain more qualified individuals to \nteach in Tribal Colleges or Universities; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, 5 years ago, I formed the bipartisan Task \nForce on Tribal Colleges and Universities to raise awareness of the \nimportant role that the tribal colleges and universities play in their \nrespective communities as educational, economic, and cultural centers. \nThe Task Force seeks to advance initiatives that help improve the \nquality education the colleges provide.\n  For more than 3 decades, tribal colleges have been providing a \nquality education to help Native Americans of all ages reach their \nfullest potential. More than 30,000 students from 250 tribes nationwide \nattend tribal colleges. Tribal colleges serve young people preparing to \nenter the job market, dislocated workers learning new skills, and \npeople seeking to move off welfare. I am a strong supporter of our \nNation's tribal colleges because, more than any other factor, they are \nbringing hope and opportunity to America's Indian communities.\n  Over the years, I have met with many tribal college students, and I \nam always impressed by their commitment to their education, their \nfamilies and their communities. Tribal colleges and universities have \nbeen highly successful in helping Native Americans obtain a higher \neducation. Congress has recognized the importance of these institutions \nand the significant gains they have achieved in helping more \nindividuals obtain their education. While Congress has steadily \nincreased its financial support of these institutions, many challenges \nstill remain.\n  One of the challenges that the tribal college presidents have \nexpressed to me is the frustration and difficulty they have in \nattracting qualified individuals to teach at the colleges. Recruitment \nand retention are difficult for many of the colleges because of their \ngeographic isolation and low faculty salaries.\n  To help tackle the challenges of recruiting and retaining qualified \nfaculty, I am introducing the Tribal Colleges and Universities Faculty \nLoan Forgiveness Act. This legislation will provide student loan \nforgiveness to individuals who commit to teach for up to five years in \none of the tribal colleges nationwide. Individuals who have Perkins, \nDirect, or Guaranteed loans may qualify to receive up to $15,000 in \nloan forgiveness. This will provide these institutions with extra help \nin attracting qualified faculty, and thus help ensure that deserving \nstudents receive a quality education. Finally, the bill also includes \nloan forgiveness for nursing instructors at the few tribal colleges \nwith accredited nursing programs. Nursing instructors currently receive \nloans through the Department of Health and Human Services for their \ntraining. As a result, without the added provision in this bill, they \nwould not qualify for assistance.\n  I would be remiss if I did not recognize that former Senator Daschle \nwas responsible for spearheading this initiative for a number of years. \nThe tribal colleges lost a true champion, but I am pleased to carry \nforward his vision and support for the colleges.\n  I am pleased that Senators Domenici, Dorgan, McCain, Bingaman, Kohl \nand Thune are original cosponsors of this bill, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to pass this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 484. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act and the Federal \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to improve drug safety and oversight, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a very important \nbill, one that my colleague Senator Kennedy and I have been working on \nfor some time.\n  For decades, the United States has been the standard bearer in \nbringing new drugs and medications to the world market. Like it or not, \nthe FDA\n\n[[Page S1531]]\n\nhas a very important role in all of our daily lives. The FDA is \ninvolved in ensuring the safety of the meals we are eating today, the \npills we are taking, and even the cell phones in our pockets and \nbriefcases. The FDA's role in our health and in our economy is broad.\n  Nearly half of all Americans take a prescription drug daily. Anyone \nwho prescribes, provides or takes a prescription drug could benefit \nfrom enhanced safety and risk communication about these life-saving \nproducts. Over the last few years, a spate of safety issues, such as \nthe withdrawal of the arthritis drug Vioxx and the labeling of \nantidepressants for suicidality in adolescents, has caused a crisis of \npublic confidence in the FDA. I believe the American people are losing \nconfidence in the FDA and its ability to evaluate and weigh the \nbenefits and risks of prescription drugs. In addition, staff at the \nagency feel like they are under heavy fire, with little or no \nprotection from the prevailing political winds, due to the lack of a \nconfirmed Commissioner of Food and Drugs for most of the last six \nyears. I believe that only Congress can restore the public's confidence \nin FDA and morale at the agency.\n  In 2005, the HELP Committee held two hearings on the issue of drug \nsafety. We received over 50 recommendations from witnesses at those \nhearings. At that time, Senator Kennedy and I pledged to develop a \ncomprehensive response to the drug safety issues raised. Last August, \nwe introduced the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act. That bill, \nS. 3807, was the product of working across party lines, and created a \nstructured framework for resolving safety concerns. Careful and \ncomprehensive pre-approval planning of how drugmakers and FDA will \nidentify, assess and manage serious risks post-approval is a better way \nto obtain safety information without compromising patient access.\n  In September 2006, the Institute of Medicine released its report \ntitled ``The Future of Drug Safety: Promoting and Protecting the Health \nof the Public.'' The recommendations in this report had much in common \nwith S. 3807. The Senate HELP Committee held a hearing in November 2006 \nat which representatives of the IOM, a physician and drug safety \nexpert, patient groups, a consumer group, and a pharmaceutical company \ntestified about the IOM report, the bill, and the relationship between \nthem. In addition, other stakeholder groups made additional comments on \nthe bill. Yesterday, FDA released their response to the IOM report. \nNewly confirmed Commissioner Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach has put forward \na number of promising ideas to improve the internal processes and \nculture at FDA. His leadership is outstanding and his ideas are \nhelpful, but internal change is not enough to alter public perception. \nFDA needs new drug safety authorities, and this bill provides those \nauthorities.\n  While the bill we are introducing today reflects numerous refinements \nto clarify ambiguities or to address issues that S. 3807 had not \naddressed, we realize that there are thoughtful differences of opinion \nand ideas on how best to move forward with drug safety. I welcome any \nand all suggestions on improving this bill, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues and other stakeholders to understand those \nconcerns more fully and incorporate any necessary changes in the bill \nwhich will be considered in front of the HELP Committee in the next few \nweeks. I hope that all of my colleagues will take another look at this \nlegislation and its goals and work with me to change the status quo. \nEveryone agrees: We must do more for drug safety.\n  Under the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act, FDA would begin \nto approve drugs and biologics, and new indications for these products, \nwith risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS). The REMS is \ndesigned to be an integrated, flexible mechanism to acquire and adapt \nto new safety information about a drug. The sponsor and FDA will assess \nand review an approved REMS at least annually for the first three \nyears, as well as in applications for a new indication, when the \nsponsor suggests changes, or when FDA requests a review based on new \nsafety information.\n  The development of tools to evaluate medical products has not kept \npace with discoveries in basic science. New tools are needed to better \npredict safety and efficacy, which in turn would increase the speed and \nefficiency of applied biomedical research. The Enhancing Drug Safety \nand Innovation Act would spur innovation by establishing a new public-\nprivate partnership between the FDA, industry and academia to advance \nthe Critical Path Initiative and improve the sciences of developing, \nmanufacturing, and evaluating the safety and effectiveness of drugs, \ndevices, biologics and diagnostics.\n  The Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act also establishes a \ncentral clearinghouse for information about clinical trials and their \nresults to help patients, providers and researchers learn new \ninformation and make more informed health care decisions.\n  Finally, the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act would make \nimprovements to FDA's process for screening advisory committee members \nfor financial conflicts of interest. FDA relies on its 30 advisory \ncommittees to provide independent expert advice, lend credibility to \nthe product review process, and inform consumers of trends in product \ndevelopment. The bill would clarify and streamline FDA's processes for \nevaluating candidates for service on an advisory committee, and address \nthe key challenge of identifying a sufficient number of people with the \nnecessary expertise and the fewest potential conflicts of interest to \nserve on advisory committees.\n  I want to thank the dozens of stakeholders, including the Food and \nDrug Administration, patient and consumer groups, industry \nassociations, individual companies, and scientific experts who have \ntaken the time and effort to give us their comments and input on the \nbill. Their assistance has been invaluable, and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with them as we go through this legislative process.\n  Senator Kennedy and I believe that this bipartisan effort will bring \nmore consistency, transparency, and accountability to the process of \nassuring a drug's safety after it is approved. The 110th Congress will \nhold an exceptionally full agenda with respect to the FDA. In addition \nto updating the FDA's authorities as we are proposing today, Congress \nmust renew the drug and device user fee programs, as well as the Best \nPharmaceuticals for Children and Pediatric Research Equity Acts. The \nintroduction of this bill today is the beginning, not the end, of the \nprocess, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance \nthese important pieces of legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Enzi in \nintroducing the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act of 2007. The \ngoals of the legislation are to strengthen the Food and Drug \nAdministration's authority over the safety of prescription drugs after \nthey are approved; to encourage innovation in medical products; to \nincrease access to clinical trials for patients and ensure that doctors \nand patients are aware of the results of clinical trials involving the \ndrugs they prescribe and use; and to improve the screening of members \nof FDA's scientific advisory committees to avoid conflicts of interest.\n  The withdrawal of the drug Vioxx from the market 2 years ago \ndemonstrated again that all prescription drugs have risks, many of \nwhich are unknown when a drug is approved, or even for years after \napproval. We need a more effective system to identify and assess the \nserious risks of drugs, inform health care providers and patients about \nsuch risks, and manage and mitigate these risks as soon as they are \ndetected.\n  Our bill will require drugs to have a risk evaluation and mitigation \nstrategy when it is approved. For many drugs, the strategy will include \nonly the drug labeling, reports of adverse events, a justification for \nwhy only such reporting is needed, and a timetable for assessing how \nthe REMS is working.\n  The FDA will be able to include additional requirements for drugs \nthat pose serious risks, such as by requiring that the drug be \ndispensed with labels that patients can understand, that the drug \ncompany have a plan to inform health care providers about how to use \nthe drug safely, and that a drug should not be advertised directly to \nconsumers for up to 2 years after approval. If a serious safety concern \nneeds to be understood, FDA can require further studies\n\n[[Page S1532]]\n\nor even clinical trials after the drug is approved. Enhanced data \ncollection and data mining techniques will help identify risk signals \nearlier and more thoroughly.\n  For drugs with the most serious side effects, FDA will be able to \nrequire that its risk evaluation and mitigation strategy include the \nrestrictions on distribution or use needed to assure its safe use.\n  The FDA will be able to impose any of these requirements at the time \na drug is approved. The agency can also modify the labeling or \notherwise alter a drug's availability after the approval. The drug's \nmanufacturer will propose the overall strategy, or modifications to it, \nand the FDA and the company will try to work out an adequate \ncompromise. If the agency and the company cannot agree, the agency's \nDrug Safety Oversight Board can review the dispute and recommend a \nresolution to senior FDA officials, who will make the final decision.\n  Civil monetary penalties are added to FDA's traditional enforcement \nauthority to ensure compliance. Drug user fees will also be used to \nreview and implement the program.\n  The bill formalizes and makes mandatory what is now only informal and \nvoluntary. Our intent is not to change the standards for approving \ndrugs, but to see that the FDA has the ability to identify, assess, and \nmanage risks as they become known. Better risk management will mean \nthat drugs with special benefits for some patients will remain \navailable, despite serious risks for other patients, because FDA can \nbetter identify the risks and manage them.\n  The bill helps to improve drug safety in other ways as well. The \nReagan-Udall Institute for Applied Biomedical Research will be a new \npublic-private partnership at the FDA to advance the agency's critical \npath initiative. The initiative is intended to improve the science of \ndeveloping, manufacturing, and evaluating the safety and effectiveness \nof drugs, biologics, medical devices, and diagnostics.\n  The Institute will be supported by Federal funds and by contributions \nfrom the pharmaceutical and device industries. Philanthropic \norganizations will be able to supplement Federal support. The institute \nwill have a board of directors and an executive director, and will \nreport to Congress annually on its operations.\n  The bill will also expand the public database at NIH to encourage \nmore patients to enroll in clinical trials of drugs. The database will \nbuild on the current systems and would include late phase II, phase \nIII, and all phase IV clinical trials for all drugs.\n  A second, publicly available database would include the results of \nphase III and phase IV clinical trials of drugs, with the possibility \nthat late phase II trials would be added later. Posting of results \ncould be delayed for up to 2 years, pending the approval of the drug or \nthe publication of trial results in a peer- reviewed journal.\n  The public needs to know about the results of clinical trials on \ndrugs. Tragically, such information was not adequately available for \nthe clinical studies of antidepressants in children.\n  Posting information in the clinical trials registry and the clinical \ntrials results database will be requirements for federal research \nfunding and for drug review and approval by the FDA. Both the FDA and \nother appropriate offices in the Department of Health and Human \nServices will review the content of submissions to the results database \nto ensure they are truthful and nonpromotional. These Federal \nrequirements will preempt State requirements for clinical trial \ndatabases.\n  Finally, the bill will improve FDA's process for screening advisory \ncommittee members for financial conflicts of interest. The agency \nrelies on advisory committees to provide independent, expert, \nnonbinding recommendations on significant issues. Ideally, committee \nmembers should be free of any financial ties to the companies affected \nby an issue before a committee. But at times, there may be no \nindividual without financial ties to such companies--for example, when \nthe issue involves a rare disease or a cutting edge medical technology. \nIn these cases, the FDA must be able to grant a waiver to allow an \nindividual with essential expertise to serve on the committee. The bill \nwill require the agency to seek qualified experts with minimal \nconflicts, clarify how it makes waiver decisions, and disclose those \ndecisions at least 15 days before a committee meeting.\n  Our bill is a comprehensive response to drug safety and other \nimportant issues involving prescription drugs and other medical \ntechnologies. I commend Chairman Enzi and his dedicated staff--\nespecially Amy Muhlberg--for working closely with us on this proposal, \nand I urge our colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 485. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to establish an economy-\nwide global warming pollution emission cap-and-trade program to assist \nthe economy in transitioning to new clean energy technologies, to \nprotect employees and affected communities, to protect companies and \nconsumers from significant increases in energy costs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Global Warming \nReduction Act of 2007. Senator Kerry and I are here today offering this \nlegislation because the issue of global warming is no longer seriously \nopen to skepticism. The preponderance of peer-reviewed scientific \nevidence is irrefutable and the cost of inaction incalculable. It is no \nlonger a question of science--it is now a question of political will.\n  I believe our bill offers a means by which anyone who is honestly \ncommitted to addressing global warming can vote to improve our \nenvironmental future while preserving our economy. We call for 65 \npercent reductions of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 for all major \nsectors of our society, and starting in 2010, we put these called-for \nemissions reductions on a downward glide path to make the reductions \nrealistic yet aggressive. It takes a forward-looking, comprehensive, \nscience-based approach to tackling this issue without putting a \nstranglehold on our economy. This is the right course at the right \ncost.\n  While Congress fiddles, alpine glaciers and polar ice caps millions \nof years old are melting. Sea levels are rising globally. Manmade \ncarbon dioxide levels and the average global temperature have increased \nat unprecedented levels over the past century--and are projected to \nincrease up to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit in the next 100 years. Meanwhile, \nthe CO2 we continue to release today while we await \nmeaningful action will remain in the atmosphere for at least a \ncentury--with concentrations rising in the coming decades. Just think--\nCO2 emissions from Henry Ford's very first car are still in \nthe atmosphere. Clearly, we can't afford to wait any longer.\n  And it's not as though we aren't literally catapulting toward a \nconsensus on at least the existence of the problem. We have a Federal \nagency, NOAA, reporting that 2006 was the warmest year since regular \ntemperature records began in 1895 and the past nine years have been \namong the 25 warmest years on record for the contiguous U.S. Even \nthough the President announced no new direct climate policy changes, he \ndid state in his most recent State of the Union Address that we must \nconfront the serious challenge of global climate change.\n  Just last week, a coalition of ten major U.S. companies came together \nto form the U.S. Climate Action Partnership--Alcoa, BP America, \nCaterpillar, Duke Energy, DuPont, General Electric, FPL Group, Lehman \nBrothers, PG, and PNM Resources all have advocated for a mandatory \ncarbon cap-and-trade system--as our bill provides. Even ExxonMobil, \nlong skeptical on anthropogenic global warming, recently saw its CEO \nstate that ``the risk [of climate change] is so great that it justifies \ntaking action.''\n  Two years ago, I became co-chair of the International Climate Change \nTaskforce, comprised of respected scientists, business leaders, and \nelected officials from eight industrialized and developing nations. The \nfirst and significant recommendation we published was to prevent global \ntemperatures from rising above 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit in the next \ncentury--because science suggests that beyond this temperature increase \nthere is a tipping point--a possible abrupt climate change that would \nhave a catastrophic\n\n[[Page S1533]]\n\neffect on our ecosystems and our society.\n  This bill would prevent us from reaching that tipping point with a \nrequired 65 percent reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050--a \nfigure that is both rigorous and realistic. And it does so by both \ninstituting the successful California emissions standards that have \nalready been embraced by other States--including seven northeastern \nStates like my home State of Maine--and that provide industry with \npredictability and uniformity . . . and also putting in place a \nflexible but mandatory carbon ``cap and trade'' system that uses the \npower of the ``invisible hand'' to reduce emissions more cost-\neffectively for businesses.\n  And to encourage greater investment in renewable energy, we also call \nfor 20 percent of America's electricity to come from renewable sources \nby 2020. But at the same time we provide incentives for advanced \ntechnologies so that existing industries can actually make investments \ninto cleaner infrastructure.\n  Moreover, with the U.S. comprising only four percent of the world's \npopulation yet emitting 20 percent of the world's carbon dioxide, we \nthink it's time our response to this crisis become proportional to our \nnation's contribution to the problem. And that's why our bill also \nurges the U.S. to return to the international negotiating table.\n  Global warming is a comprehensive problem that demands the kind of \ncomprehensive approach our bill provides--with measures to minimize the \neffects on our communities and our ecosystems that other bills \nacknowledge are inevitable but do not address. Ours is the only climate \nbill to be introduced that calls for research to assess the \nvulnerability of coral reefs to increased CO2 deposits, and \nof marine organisms throughout the marine food web. Our bill also calls \nfor the creation of a ``vulnerability scorecard'' to provide \ncommunities with a yardstick for them to measure the potential impact \nof climate change and make informed decisions to minimize the impact.\n  In the end, government leaders should make no mistake--the public \nunderstands the severity of the risk of inaction on this crucial issue, \nwith half of voters reporting in a recent Zogby poll that concerns \nabout global warming made a difference in who they voted for and 58 \npercent said that combating global warming should be a high priority. \nSo the truth is that elected officials ignore the public's concerns \nwith global warming at their own peril--just as we ignore the danger to \nthe detriment of our children and future generations.\n  The opportunity to stop, and ultimately reverse, global climate \nchange is not open-ended. The clock is ticking . . . and the cost of \ninaction continues to escalate. We recognize the major cause of global \nwarming and we understand what a solution requires. Now we are \ncompelled to muster the political will to make it happen--and the \nKerry-Snowe bill provides a reasonable yet vigorous path to follow. \nThank you.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Harkin, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 486. A bill to establish requirements for lenders and institutions \nof higher education in order to protect students and other borrowers \nreceiving educational loans; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join my colleague, \nSenator Durbin, in introducing the Student Loan Sunshine Act, to \nprovide greater support for students and families across America who \nare struggling with great difficulty to pay for college.\n  Over the past 20 years, the cost of attending college has doubled. \nToday, the average cost of attendance at a 4-year public college is \nalmost $13,000. As a result, students and families are going deeper and \ndeeper into debt to finance the cost of higher education. In 1993, \nfewer than a third of students at four-year colleges graduated with \ndebt to pay on their student loans. Today that number has doubled. Two-\nthirds of students now graduate with student loan debt.\n  The average debt load has soared as well. In the past decade, it has \nincreased by 57 percent at public colleges and 38 percent at private \ncolleges. Today, the typical graduate leaves college saddled with \n$17,000 in student loans.\n  Nowhere has this growth been more pronounced than in private student \nloans. Until recently, most students who borrowed for college took out \nloans under the Direct Loan program and the Federal Family Education \nLoan program--the two main student loan programs subsidized by the \nFederal Government.\n  With the cost of college rising rapidly and grant aid stagnating, \nhowever, more and more students are turning to the private loan sector \nand are taking out so-called ``alternative loans''--private loans that \nlenders offer through colleges and universities. Students are also \nborrowing increasingly from direct-to-consumer education lenders, which \ninclude giant lenders such as Sallie Mae that also participate in the \nFFEL program, as well as other companies that just offer private-market \nloans, such as Loan to Learn.\n  A decade ago, private loans accounted for only 3 percent of all funds \nused to finance students' post-secondary education. Since then, the \nvolume of private loans has grown by an astronomical 1200 percent. \nToday, private loans now total $17 billion, and represent 20 percent of \nall borrowing for higher education.\n  Many lenders making these private loans claim they're providing an \nimportant service. They say that at a time when college prices are \nrising rapidly, they provide needed funds to help students pay for \ncollege.\n  What they won't tell you is the exorbitant cost that countless \nstudents are paying for these loans. Unlike loans offered through the \nfederal programs, private loans frequently carry much higher interest \nrates, especially for students without credit histories and families \nwithout strong credit ratings. In some cases, the interest rates on \nprivate loans may be as high as 19 percent a year, compared to 6.8 \npercent for loans offered through the FFEL and Direct Loan programs.\n  The lenders also don't tell you about the aggressive tactics they use \nto persuade colleges to offer private loans to their students--and to \npersuade students to borrow directly as well.\n  The private company Student Loan Xpress has offered 100 percent loan \napproval at colleges if the college agrees to ``brand'' the private \nloan with the college's name and emblem--making the loan appear to be \noffered by the college, not the private lender.\n  Other private loan companies encourage borrowers not to fill out the \nFree Application for Federal Student Aid, which allows borrowers to \nobtain loans at lower interest rates. They don't prominently disclose \nthe fact that their interest rates are typically much higher.\n  Some lenders make gifts to college and university employees. Loan to \nLearn invited college officials and their spouses to an all-expenses \npaid ``education conference'' in the West Indies. Many lenders who \nparticipate in the FFEL program offer similar ``educational \nconferences'' at fancy hotels, and offer free entertainment and tickets \nto sporting events to college officials. The Attorney General in New \nYork State has opened an investigation into such practices and is \nlooking into the practices of six lenders, including Sallie Mae, \nNelnet, and Educap, the corporate name of Loan to Learn.\n  We need to take immediate steps to stop actions that prevent students \nfrom obtaining the best loan agreement possible. That is what the \nStudent Loan Sunshine Act does.\n  First and foremost, it is a consumer protection measure. It will \nprotect student and parent borrowers by ending the inappropriate lender \npractices I've just mentioned.\n  It prohibits lenders from offering to a college employee any gift \nworth more than $10, including free or discounted trips, meals, \ninvitations to entertainment events or other form of hospitality.\n  It prohibits lenders from offering services to financial aid offices \nthat create a conflict of interest, such as lending staff during peak \nloan processing times. It also prohibits lenders from ``branding'' \ntheir loans with a college name, emblem, or logo.\n  The Sunshine Act also arms students and parents with the information \nthey need to make wise decisions when they borrow funds for higher \neducation.\n\n[[Page S1534]]\n\n  The Act requires lenders to report any special arrangements they have \nwith colleges to make such loans, and it ensures that this information \nis conveyed to borrowers.\n  It requires the Secretary of Education, together with members of the \nhigher education community and students, to develop a clear, easy-to-\nuse model format for reporting the terms and conditions of student \nloans, similar to the APR disclosure required for other types of loans.\n  If a college creates a ``preferred lender'' list, the Act requires \nthe college to disclose clearly and fully why it has identified a \nlender as a preferred lender. Schools must also include at least three \nnonaffiliated lenders on the list, so that students have a real choice. \nFinally, the Sunshine Act also addresses the fast-growing direct-to-\nconsumer educational loan market. It offers new protections for \nstudents who take out direct-to-consumer loans, so they don't borrow \nmore than is necessary to pay for their college education.\n  The Act requires all lenders of direct-to-consumer private \neducational loans to state clearly and prominently that borrowers may \nqualify for low-interest loans through the Federal Government's loan \nprograms. It also requires lenders to clearly disclose the terms and \nconditions of the loans they're offering, including any hidden fees, as \nwell as any complaints against the lender that have been filed by \nconsumer agencies such as the Better Business Bureau or the state \nattorney general's office.\n  Before a direct-to-consumer lender can offer an education loan of \nmore than $1000, the Act requires the lender to notify the borrower's \ncollege of the amount of the proposed loan, so that the school can \nadvise the borrower whether the loan exceeds what's necessary to cover \nthe student's cost of attendance after other aid sources are factored \nin.\n  Students deserve the best loan advice possible from financial aid \nofficers and the best deal from lenders. They have the right to exhaust \ntheir federal loan eligibility before turning to more expensive private \nlenders for aid.\n  Going to college is a lifetime investment, but paying for college is \na heavy burden for too many families. As the private student loan \nmarket continues to grow, it's our responsibility to protect students \nfrom exploitation in that market.\n  I thank the bill's cosponsors, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill as well. It's time we put students first, and the Student \nLoan Sunshine Act takes important steps to do just that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 486\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Kennedy-Durbin ``Student Loan Sunshine Act.''\n  There is no question that having a college education is essential in \ntoday's job market. Over the course of a lifetime, a college graduate \nwill earn over $1 million more than those with only a high school \ndiploma.\n  In addition to the individual benefits of a college education, \ninvesting in and producing more college-educated Americans is vital to \nour nation's growth. Economists estimate that the increase in the \neducation level of the United States labor force between 1915 and 1999 \ndirectly resulted in at least 23 percent of the overall growth in U.S. \nproductivity.\n  However, paying for college is becoming increasingly difficult for \nstudents and their families. Tuition at four-year public institutions \nrose by 42 percent in the last five years, and more and more students \nare leaving college saddled with ever increasing debt burdens. \nAccording to the U.S. Department of Education, the average student debt \nhas increased by more than 50 percent over the last decade. In 2004, \ncollege students graduated with an average of $17,400 in federal \nstudent loan debt, almost 45 percent more than students who graduated \nin 1993. When private loans are factored in, the average debt increases \nto more than $19,000.\n  As students and their families struggle to find ways to pay for \nhigher education, more and more are forced to turn to private student \nloans in order to close the gap. Because these loans are not guaranteed \nor subsidized by the government, they often carry much higher interest \nrates.\n  According to The College Board, private student loans are now a $17.3 \nbillion industry. Between the 2000-2001 and 2005-2006 school years, \nprivate student loans grew at an average annual rate of 27 percent, \nafter adjusting for inflation.\n  As more students begin to rely on private student loans to help pay \nfor college, some lenders and colleges are engaging in practices that \ndo not appear to be in the best interests of the students. An article \npublished in The New York Times revealed examples of incentives offered \nto colleges by student loan companies in order to be placed on a \ncollege's ``preferred lender'' list.\n  An example cited in the article included an all-expense paid trip to \nthe Caribbean for university officials and their spouses to attend an \neducation ``summit'' held at a luxury five-star beachfront resort. \nBetween symposiums, forums and roundtable discussions on the importance \nof addressing the cost of higher education, guests could enjoy \ncomplimentary water and beach sports such as snorkeling, sailing, \nkayaking, sailboarding and volleyball as well as access to an 18-hole \nchampionship golf course, a 10-court tennis complex, two beachfront \npools and a luxury spa. News of the trip garnered such a negative \nresponse from the public that the sponsor of the trip, Loan to Learn, \nultimately cancelled the trip. Aside from all-expense paid trips, other \nexamples of incentives include iPods that were given away at a \nfinancial aid administrators meeting and bonuses that are based on how \nmuch students borrow.\n  Colleges and universities should not be enticed to select ``preferred \nlenders'' or take other actions related to the student loan program on \nthe basis of factors that are irrelevant, or at best ancillary, to the \nprimary interests of the students.\n  The Student Loan Sunshine Act protects students and parents from \npotential exploitation by private student loan lenders and lenders that \noffer gifts to schools as a way to acquire the school's loan business. \nIt ensures that students and their families have all the facts and can \nfeel confident that they're receiving the best deal on their college \nloan.\n  First, this bill puts a stop to inappropriate lender practices. \nLenders are\n\n[[Page S1537]]\n\nprohibited from offering any gift over $10 to employees of a \nuniversity, including free trips, meals, and tickets to entertainment \nevents. Lenders are no longer allowed to offer services to a financial \naid office that create a conflict of interest such as lending staff \nduring peak loan processing times, printing literature for the \nfinancial aid office and e-mailing students on behalf of the financial \naid office.\n  Second, the Act provides students and their families access to \ninformation about preferred lender lists, special arrangements between \nlenders and colleges and terms and conditions of loans. A school's \npreferred lender list must include at least three lenders that are \nindependent from each other, clearly disclose why a lender was \nidentified as a preferred lender, and clearly state that students and \nparents may take out a student loan with a lender that is not on their \nschool's preferred lender list. This requirement is needed because in \nsome instances, a school's preferred lender list may include what \nappear to be five different lenders; however, four of the five lenders \nmay turn out to be subsidiaries of a single company. Lenders are \nrequired to report to the Secretary of Education any special \narrangement they have with colleges to make loans to the students at a \nschool including the terms of the arrangement and any benefit provided \nto the school in connection with the loan arrangement. In addition, the \nAct requires the Secretary of Education, along with the higher \neducation community and students, to develop an easy-to-understand form \nfor reporting the terms and conditions of student loans--similar to an \nAPR disclosure.\n  Finally, the Act encourages students to maximize their borrowing \noptions through the government's loan programs before obtaining private \nloans with higher interest rates and discourages over-borrowing through \ndirect-to-consumer education loans. Some companies fail to clearly \ndisclose that their private educational loans typically carry a higher \ninterest rate and even encourage students not to complete the Free \nApplication for Federal Student Aid form, which allows students to \nborrow low-interest educational loans. The Act requires all direct-to-\nconsumer lenders to clearly disclose to students certain information \nsuch as: the fact that the student may be eligible for low-interest \nstudent loans through the federal government, how the interest rate is \ndetermined, any and all fees, and whether any complaints have been \nfiled against the lender. Additionally, the Act puts in place \nprovisions that will ensure that before a student obtains an \neducational loan through a direct-to-consumer lender, the student is \ninformed of their loan options through the federal government and \nwhether the loan will cause the student to exceed what is necessary to \ncover the student's cost of attendance.\n  These requirements are simply meant to ensure that as students are \nabout to sign on the dotted line and accept what will likely be one of \nthe largest debts they will incur in their lives, they have the \ninformation they need to make an informed decision and some assurance \nthat their school has only their best interests in mind--not visions of \nthe Caribbean or the latest iPod. We must not look away and allow them \nto be taken advantage of at one of the most critical points in their \nlives. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/01/senate-section/article/S1537-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 64--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON \n                           FOREIGN RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. BIDEN submitted the following resolution; from the Committee on \nForeign Relations; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Small \nBusiness\n\n[[Page S1540]]\n\nand Entrepreneurship Committee be discharged from further consideration \nof H.R. 434 and the Senate then proceed to its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 434) to provide for an additional temporary \n     extension of programs under the Small Business Act and the \n     Small Business Investment Act of 1958 through December 31, \n     2007, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand there is an amendment at the \ndesk. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered agreed \nto; the bill, as amended, be read three times, passed; the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; the title amendment be agreed to; \nand any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record, \nwithout intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the \nauthorization of these small business programs expires tomorrow. The \nbill before us, H.R. 434, was received in the Senate on January 18. I \ndon't understand why the committee has waited until the day before the \nprogram expires to act. If we amend this bill and send it back to the \nHouse, they will not be able to act before these programs expire.\n  It is my understanding that if we allow this authorization to lapse, \nit will result in the dissolution of the SBA's Advisory Committee on \nVeterans Business Affairs. This committee serves veteran entrepreneurs \nby formulating, executing, and promoting policies that assist veterans \nseeking to start and develop small businesses. I cannot imagine why we \nwould want to dissolve the committee designed to assist veterans who \nwant to start their own small businesses.\n  Accordingly, I ask the Senator to modify the unanimous consent \nrequest to omit the Senate amendment and instead pass a bill clean so \nthat it may go directly to the President for his signature.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in responding to my friend, Senators Kerry \nand Snowe, who are the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on \nSmall Business, have indicated there are a lot of matters relating to \nsmall business jurisdiction that need to be completed forthwith. They \nare going to work on this next week and hope to have something done \nvery quickly, but this gives them an opportunity to deal with the \nHouse, which, I am told, basically did not confer with them at all \nduring the work they did over there, and they should have done that.\n  I say again, Senators Kerry and Snowe understand the importance of \nthis issue. They also know there are many other things depending on \ntheir raising this as an issue at this time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may, I have been informed by \nSenator Snowe, with all due respect to the majority leader, that is not \nher view. It may well be the view of Senator Kerry, but it is not the \nview of Senator Snowe.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are checking at this time with Senator \nKerry to see if we can work something out on this small business \nmatter.

DRINAN, S.J.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of S. Res. 66.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 66) honoring the life, achievement \n     and distinguished career of the Reverend Robert J. Drinan, \n     S.J.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today we pay our respects to a great son of \nMassachusetts who passed away on Sunday, an inspiration to me and a \nleader beloved by many, Father Robert Drinan.\n  In all his life's endeavors, from the church pulpit to the halls of \nCongress to the classroom, Father Drinan was guided by a firm and \nunwavering moral compass. He lived out in public life the whole cloth \nof Catholic teachings.\n  In religion and politics alike, he followed his sense that we are all \nput on this Earth for something greater than ourselves. Wherever he \nwent, he was led there by a concern for the weak, the helpless, the \ndowntrodden. In religion and politics alike, that was his calling.\n  And as he walked between these worlds, on a path unique in our \nNation's history, he was always unmistakably and wonderfully true to \nhimself.\n  Father Drinan was a forever gentle, resilient, tenacious advocate for \nsocial justice and fundamental decency. In the most divisive days of \nVietnam, when things were coming apart, this incredible man, this most \nunlikely of candidates, showed America how a man of faith could be a \nman of peace.\n  As a politician, Father Drinan is best remembered for his spirited \nopposition to the Vietnam war. That's what brought him to Congress in \nthe first place and it is how our paths first crossed. In 1970, after \nwe first met as opponents in the Peoples' Caucus, I was honored to \nsupport, campaign, and to work with and learn from committed Democrats \nlike Jerome Grossman, John Marttila, Tom Kiley, John Hurley, and Tom \nVallely. Together, many of these committed activists would spend the \nnext decades championing the great progressive causes that marked the \nDrinan campaign.\n  Father Drinan's slogan was ``Father Knows Best.'' I began studying \nlaw at Boston College--where Father Drinan had been the youngest law \nschool Dean in the country--while he was down here, in Congress, making \nlaw, and making history.\n  Father Drinan's testimony against the war was remarkably powerful. He \ntoured jails in Saigon and met a South Vietnamese politician there who \nhad been jailed after placing second in an\n\n[[Page S1541]]\n\nelection. In the religious language of just war doctrine and the plain \nlanguage of common decency, he helped us to see the flaws of our policy \nin Vietnam and urged the Church to speak out with great moral \nauthority.\n  And even before his own words found their way into FBI files, even \nbefore his own name made its way onto Nixon's enemies list, Father \nDrinan was a champion for dissent and he had a special understanding of \nthe obligations of patriotism. He helped eliminate the House Committee \non Un-American Activities, the scene of one of the Cold War's ugliest \nchapters. He met with famous Soviet dissidents like Sharansky and \nSakharov and founded the National Interreligious Task Force for Soviet \nJewry. Angered by the treatment of Soviet dissidents, he was the first \nCongressman to call for a boycott of the Moscow Olympics.\n  And he sought to hold the President of the United States accountable \nfor his behavior. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, he questioned \nwitnesses in the Watergate hearings. But even before then he became the \nfirst Congressman to urge the impeachment of President Nixon, not for \nthe Watergate coverup but for the illegal bombing of Cambodia. That, he \nthought, was the far greater crime. ``Can we be silent about this \nflagrant violation of the Constitution?'' he asked. ``Can we impeach a \npresident for concealing a burglary but not for concealing a massive \nbombing?''\n  After 10 years in Congress, Father Drinan was forced to choose \nbetween the two passions of his life: politics and the Catholic Church. \nHe chose to remain in the priesthood and spent the rest of his life \noutside government as a passionate advocate for human rights and a \nmuch-loved law professor. ``As a person of faith,'' he said, ``I must \nbelieve that there is work for me to do which somehow will be more \nimportant than the work I am required to leave.''\n  As president of the Americans for Democratic Action, he traveled and \nspoke widely on hunger, civil liberties and the dangers of the nuclear \narms race. He cofounded the Lawyers' Alliance for Nuclear Arms Control, \nand served as vice chair of the ACLU's National Advisory Council and a \nmember of the Helsinki Watch Committee.\n  Father Drinan's life of political activism was in the best tradition \nof what it means to be a Jesuit--love of learning and a commitment to \njustice. Jesuits were among the first to speak out against the Vietnam \nwar and later against illegal interventions in Central America. As a \nprofessor and an activist, Father Drinan lived the ideals of his faith.\n  Asked about his activism, Father Drinan once said ``it goes back to \nthe fact that you're a Christian and a Jesuit. . . . It means you have \nto love each other and that you can't persecute people. You have to be \ncompassionate to everyone in the world.'' It was as simple as that for \nhim. When asked if he was planning to slow down in old age, Drinan \nrecently told a reporter, ``Jesuits don't ordinarily retire. You just \ndo what you do.''\n  His leadership helped give a new moral authority to the antiwar \nmovement, and he was a mentor to a generation of Massachusetts \npoliticians. People like Barney Frank, who stepped into Father Drinan's \ncongressional seat with big shoes to fill--and has spent the last 25 \nyears there honoring Father Drinan's legacy with his own dogged fight \nfor social justice.\n  Father Drinan leaves behind a sister-in-law, three nieces, over 6,000 \nadoring students, legions of supporters in the fourth district of \nMassachusetts, and those across the State and the Nation whose lives he \ntouched.\n  Father Drinan once said, ``If people are really Christians, they are \ninvolved in life, and politics is part of life. I feel if a person is \nreally a Christian, he will be in anguish over global hunger, \ninjustice, over the denial of educational opportunity.'' It was the \ndefining mission of his truly remarkable life.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid on the table, and any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 66) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 66\n\n       Whereas the Reverend Robert F. Drinan, S.J. was a talented \n     scholar, who received a bachelor's degree in 1942 and a \n     master's degree in 1947 from Boston College, a bachelor's \n     degree in law in 1949 and a master of law degree in 1951 from \n     Georgetown University, and a doctorate in theology in 1954 \n     from Gregorian University in Rome, Italy;\n       Whereas Father Drinan entered the Society of Jesus in 1942, \n     completed his seminary work at Weston College in Cambridge, \n     Massachusetts, and was ordained as a Jesuit priest in 1953;\n       Whereas Father Drinan was an influential educator who \n     served as the Dean of the Boston College Law School from 1956 \n     to 1970 and transformed it into one of the leading \n     educational institutions in the United States;\n       Whereas Father Drinan was elected in 1970 to represent \n     Massachusetts in the House of Representatives;\n       Whereas Father Drinan represented Massachusetts in the \n     House of Representatives from 1971 to 1981, the first Roman \n     Catholic priest ever to serve in Congress as a voting Member;\n       Whereas Father Drinan, during his service in the House of \n     Representatives, was an advocate for social justice, a \n     fighter for civil rights, and a champion in the cause of \n     international human rights;\n       Whereas Father Drinan drew on his legal expertise to make \n     significant contributions in the areas of copyright law \n     reform, consumer protection, and criminal justice;\n       Whereas Father Drinan renewed his commitment to education, \n     after his service in Congress, as a professor at Georgetown \n     University Law Center, where he specialized in constitutional \n     law and human rights and taught more than 6,000 students;\n       Whereas Father Drinan was the founder and faculty adviser \n     to the Georgetown Journal of legal Ethics and was the author \n     of 12 books on major public policy issues;\n       Whereas Father Drinan was the recipient of 22 honorary \n     degrees and was a visiting professor at 4 universities;\n       Whereas Father Drinan's service led the American Bar \n     Association (ABA) to award him the ABA Medal in 2004, the \n     organization's highest honor, given to individuals who make \n     exceptionally distinguished contributions to the \n     jurisprudence of the United States; and\n       Whereas Father Drinan's lifelong leadership in promoting \n     greater awareness of the importance of international human \n     rights resulted in 2006 in the establishment by the \n     Georgetown University Law Center of an endowed chair in his \n     honor, known as the Robert F. Drinan, S.J. Chair in Human \n     Rights Law: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the life, achievements, and distinguished career \n     of the Reverend Robert F.
