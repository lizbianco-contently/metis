We will interrupt consideration of \nthe supplemental at 11:50 in order to debate a judicial nomination. A \nvote on confirmation of the nomination of George Wu to be a U.S. \ndistrict judge will occur around 12:10 or thereabouts. The vote will be \nthe first vote today. After that vote, we will recess until 2:15 p.m. \nin order to permit the regular Tuesday meeting of the respective party \nconferences.\n  As a reminder, cloture was filed last evening on the supplemental \nappropriations bill. Members have until 2:30 today to file first-degree \namendments.\n  We are conferring with the Republicans--Senator McConnell and I have \nspoken on a number of occasions, not this morning yet but yesterday--to \ntry to arrange votes on a number of amendments, one of which is the one \nfiled by Senator Cochran. We are going to try to work out an orderly \nprocess to go to an amendment relating to minimum wage. There are, \nperhaps, some other amendments the Republicans want to do dealing with \nstrikes, dealing with the funding of this bill. There is an issue which \nis important to both Democrats and Republicans dealing with county \npayments and payment in lieu of taxes.\n  At this stage, that is the universe of the matters we will work on \nand try to get time agreements to proceed to the cloture vote, which \nwill occur in the morning. Hopefully, we can work toward that end and \nget a lot of it done today.\n  We all recognize the importance of this legislation, not only from \nthe aspect of the military, but there are other matters in the bill \nthat are extremely important.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/27/senate-section/article/S3781-7", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I think this is certainly one of the most \nimportant bills we have had before us and one, frankly, that is the \nmost time-constrained of any we have had before us. Normally, we have a \ngood deal of time to talk about bills and we have budget bills that \nwon't go into effect until next year, but the fact is, this bill, which \nis for the funding of troops, these dollars need to be available within \nthe next couple of weeks, as we understand it, of course. So it is \nimportant that we recognize that and that we understand the purpose of \nthis bill is to fund our troops.\n  Whether you agree with the troops being there, the troops are there, \nand the fact is that it is up to us to provide the support they need \nand the dollars which are necessary to provide them the support they \nneed in the position they are in. If there were ever a bill that should \nbe recognized as having a unique purpose and should not be attached to \nother kinds of nonpertinent issues, I believe this is one. We are going \nto have the opportunity to decide whether we want to attach other \nissues to this bill and extend it, whether we want to have a situation \nwhere there is a veto and all those time-consuming things or whether we \nindeed want to have a clean bill that provides for the support of our \ntroops who are now in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  For weeks now, the President has repeatedly said he will veto the \nbill if it ties the hands of the generals on the ground. What he is \nsaying is he and the generals have a plan, and the fact is the plan \nseems to be making more advances and accomplishments than we have had \nin the past, so we need to allow that to continue to work. We have all \nsaid the President needs a different plan. The President now has a \ndifferent plan. There is new leadership in Iraq.\n  So I think we need to understand where we are with respect to this \nbill because we certainly have been on notice and are well aware of the \nlooming veto. That veto would simply take more time and keep this money \nfrom getting where it needs to be to support the troops.\n  Not passing this legislation, of course, would only delay the \ncritical resources and the necessary equipment and training for our \nsoldiers who are getting ready to deploy or have, in fact, deployed. \nSecretary of Defense Gates has warned the Congress that if we delay \nemergency spending for our troops already deployed, many will not be \nable to come home. This is a very serious statement, and we need to pay \nattention to it.\n  I don't want to portray the President's plan in Iraq as being a \nsuccess so far, but our commanders on the ground are reporting good \nnews and that we are making progress, and that is what it is all about, \nof course. We need to be there until we have completed our task. I \nunderstand that explaining what the completion of the task is may not \nbe easy, and people have different views about what that should be, but \nit is pretty clear we need to be able to get the Iraqis in a position \nto govern themselves before we can return. I am for returning as soon \nas possible, but I think setting an artificial definition for when they \nreturn is not appropriate anywhere and particularly not appropriate on \nthis bill.\n  I just do not understand how Members on the other side can say one \nthing in their States and then stand and do the opposite thing--stand \nfor supporting their troops in their States and then come here and have \nexactly the opposite position in Washington. At this point, we are \nwhere we are, and we need to have funding for our troops in the field, \nno question. Nobody would argue that, and I think no one would dispute \nthat is a time sensitive issue as well.\n  We are going to be here this week on this bill. We are going to be \ngone next week. If the bill were to be vetoed, then we would have to go \nthrough that whole process. One can see that if we are going to get \nthis done by the date which we have all heard, which is April 15, it is \nimportant we take off these kinds of things that are holding it up. We \nshould not play political one-upmanship when it comes to funding our \nmen and women who are in theater or are ready to deploy--I don't think \nthere is any question about that--nor should we attempt to move \nlegislation by buying votes for things that would be at the expense of \nour troops.\n  Unfortunately, the emergency legislation we have before us has been \nlarded up with all manner of nonemergency spending and extraneous \nmeasures. Not only are we attempting to tie the President's hands by \nmicromanaging the war, but we are trying to push through pet projects \nat the expense of our troops. I understand the politics of this place. \nWhen someone has something they would like very much to have done, the \ngreatest thing to do is to put it on the bill that has to pass, and \neven though it is inappropriate, even though it is not a part of the \npurpose of the bill, of course, I understand that helps get it done. \nBut the request submitted to the Congress was to have $100 billion for \ntroops and hurricane relief. The bill we are considering contains an \nadditional $20 billion--$20 billion--for individual Member requests, a \nminimum wage increase, and small tax packages. The last time I checked, \nnone of these is an emergency, so they do not qualify for this bill. I \nunderstand the merits of many of these things, and they should be \nconsidered. But, again, in terms of how we do things here, this is an \nemergency bill, and things that are in here ought to qualify as \nemergencies or else not be on the bill.\n  So we have to say: Do they have merit? Of course they have merit. \nThere is no question that many of them do and should be individually \naddressed in the normal legislative process. They should be considered \nbecause they have merit and, indeed, are worth consideration. However, \nwe are also faced with the question that the majority has said we must \nget our fiscal house in order. That is what we have been hearing, but \nthat is not what we have been doing. It is easy to say that, but it is \nhard to do it.\n  We do need to take a look at spending. This is an emergency bill--\nthis is outside the budget--and so it is a wonderful place to pen on a \nlot of things that are additional spending that really aren't within \nthe limits of spending, which all of us seem to be so proud to be \nputting on in this Congress. So I think we have to take a look at all \nthose things. Almost to a person, everyone has come to the floor and \npromised the American public that future spending would be paid \nfor. These things that are added are not paid for. So we are not \nkeeping that promise that has been made.\n\n  I think this week the majority will have an opportunity to stand by \ntheir words. We must keep Federal spending under control and \naccountable. To add things that are inappropriate, that do not fit on \nthe bill, that are outside the budget--to use this opportunity is not \nbeing accountable. To add projects to emergency spending, which by \ndefinition is outside the normal budget process, is not the right way \nto accomplish this goal.\n  It is going to be tough. We are going to have projects that everyone \non both sides of the aisle thinks: Oh, that is good for my State--\nwhether it is shrimp or spinach or whatever. So there will be support \nfor those things. But the fact is, they do not belong on this emergency \nbill.\n  I remind my colleagues of the budget resolution for 2007 which \nexplicitly defines what constitutes an emergency. It says all of the \nfive following criteria must be satisfied in order for something to be \nconsidered an emergency: No. 1, is necessary, essential, or vital; No. \n2, sudden, quickly coming into being, and not building up over time; \nNo. 3, a pressing and compelling urgent need requiring immediate \naction; No. 4, an unforeseeable, unpredictable, and\n\n[[Page S3783]]\n\nunanticipated issue; and, finally, not permanent but temporary in \nnature.\n  The Senate has to establish the criteria, and I think we ought to \nfollow it in this budget area. I know we cannot fix the problems in \njust 1 week. There should be an effort to remove all the extraneous and \nnondefense spending. I look forward to bringing an important question \nbefore us, privatizing these things. The American people will soon \nlearn whether the Members of the Senate have committed themselves to \ngetting their financial house in order, whether they will back their \nwords with action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague from \nWyoming in addressing the pending business of the Senate, which is the \nemergency supplemental to help fund our troops who are serving in \nharm's way. The problem with this particular legislation is it does \nmore than that. In fact, contrary to its advertised purpose of \nsupporting the troops, it undermines the ability of our commanders on \nthe ground to actually succeed in the goal they volunteered to achieve \nand which we have asked them to do because it sets artificial timelines \nand attempts to micromanage the fighting of the war on the ground.\n  It ultimately jeopardizes the ability to get funds for the troops, to \nprovide the necessary equipment, to provide the replenishment of used-\nup resources that are necessary as we rotate troops who are in the \nbattlefield today. It would ultimately make it more likely that troops \nwho are already there--who sacrificed a lot, along with their \nfamilies--are going to have to sacrifice even more because the troops \nnecessary and the equipment necessary to actually rotate in and relieve \nthem of their responsibilities will not be available.\n  The other thing that is so unseemly, to me, about this whole process \nis, because this is the train leaving the station and colleagues know \nthat this bill needs to pass, or at least some version of it--emergency \nspending to support our troops--that the House, in particular, and now \nthe Senate has joined in a similar manner in larding this \nappropriations bill with various pork projects.\n  My colleague from Wyoming has pointed out that the nature of \nemergency spending means this money goes straight to the deficit. In \nother words, the bill is passed on to the next generation and beyond \nand not paid for.\n  We just went through an elaborate process in passing a budget \nresolution. Time and time again, the new majority has said they want to \nengage in some budget and fiscal discipline, but that stated goal, to \ntry to deal with taxpayer dollars responsibly, to find offsets for \nspending and have pay-as-you-go rules is completely belied by the \nactions reflected in this particular appropriations bill.\n  The fact is, we did debate this issue just 2 weeks ago with regard to \nartificial timelines and micromanaging the war. The Senate voted 48 to \n50 not to approve cloture on S.J. Res. 9, which was an effort by our \nDemocratic colleagues to micromanage and set artificial timelines. They \nlost that vote by 48 to 50. Now they are back again, trying it another \ntime.\n  Giving the enemy a timetable when American troops will withdraw from \nIraq without regard to conditions on the ground, without regard to the \nearly signs of progress that we are making, only helps the enemy plan \non how to establish and accomplish their goals, not our goals. Our \nfocus should be on how to succeed in Iraq, not how to tie the hands of \nour troops, jeopardize the funding that is necessary for their success, \nand to micromanage something that we have no business micromanaging \nfrom the Halls of Congress, thousands of miles away from the \nbattlefield.\n  The tragedy of this is it now represents 18 different proposals by \nthe Democrats in Congress on how to lose in Iraq and not a single \nproposal on how to succeed. The chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee on which I serve has pointed out that there are between 5,000 \nand 6,000 al-Qaida operatives now in Iraq. To pass legislation which \nsets an arbitrary deadline for withdrawing our combat forces without \ndefeating al-Qaida makes no sense, no sense at all. It will create a \npower vacuum, much as Afghanistan was after the fall of the Soviet \nUnion, which then gave rise to a failed state and a launching pad for \nterrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001. We need \nto do everything in our power to prevent that from happening again and \nnot forget the lessons of 9/11 and allow it to be repeated in Iraq.\n\n  The Iraqis know our commitment there is not open ended, and they \nunderstand the future of Iraq is in their hands. But to pass \nlegislation that micromanages how our troops should fight the enemy and \nessentially allow the creation of safe havens for terrorists is the \nheight of irresponsibility.\n  We pointed out before, but it is worth pointing out again, we \nunanimously confirmed General Petraeus, the architect of the \ncounterinsurgency plan currently being carried out in Baghdad. He does \nnot need the armchair generals in the Senate dictating military tactics \nto him. If the Members of this body really support the troops, we will \nprovide, unencumbered, the resources necessary for our troops to \naccomplish the goals which they so valiantly and bravely volunteered to \ndo, under the leadership of great generals such as GEN David Petraeus.\n  We all want our troops home as soon as possible. We all share that \ngoal. But any decision to withdraw from Iraq before the Iraqis \nthemselves are able to stabilize their country, with our help, to allow \nthem to govern and defend themselves, will not heighten America's \nnational security but, rather, will jeopardize it.\n  We have had 18 proposals to date from our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle. Every attempt they have had to try to pass one of \nthese proposals has failed. But as Yogi Berra said, ``It's deja vu all \nover again.'' Here we go again. We just voted last week 48 to 50 \nagainst legislation that would impose a deadline. I hope we will not \nhave to continue to debate this over and over again and continue to \nsend the message to our enemies: Yes, you are that much closer to \nbreaking America's will in this contest of wills in something that is \nso important to our national security. We need to get this legislation \npassed and passed soon, so our troops do not have to guess whether the \nfunding necessary to carry out their mission will be forthcoming.\n  Using the supplemental appropriations to play political games and to \npay off domestic priorities, such as peanut subsidies and spinach \nsubsidies, is not in the best interests of our men and women in \nuniform. That is why the President has threatened to veto this bill, \ndue to the pork and the timelines that are included in it. I encourage \nmy colleagues to think long and hard before moving forward in a way \nthat would compromise the mission of our troops who are serving to \nprotect all of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the amendment of \nSenator Cochran, the amendment to strike the language, of which I am a \ncosponsor. I raised this in the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense \nlast week. Senator Cochran indicated then that he would do as he has \ndone; that is, to move to strike the language in the supplemental \nrequiring the phased withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq in 120 days, 4 \nmonths--120 days.\n  Mr. President, as you heard--and you have been a party to--4 months \nis clearly not enough time for General Petraeus or the brave members of \nour Armed Forces to have a chance to see if a surge in troop numbers \ncould turn the war. I don't know for sure. I had, as a lot of us did, a \nconversation with General Petraeus before he took command about the \ntroop surge, about the 20,000 troops. I personally think we need \n100,000 troops, but we don't have them. General Petraeus is a very \nsmart man. He is a combat soldier. He is in control. I believe to put \non an arbitrary timeline of 120 days is the wrong message at the wrong \ntime, where they are beginning--just beginning--to secure some \nneighborhoods. Will they continue to do this? We hope so. But we should \nbring every bit of stability we can to the Baghdad area.\n  I have no illusion about sooner or later coming home. I would like to \nsee our troops come home. I don't think that will be the end of the \nstruggle\n\n[[Page S3784]]\n\nwith Islamic fundamentalists by any stretch of the imagination, but I \nthink if we are able to stabilize that area of Iraq to some degree, \nperhaps there can be some kind of diplomatic resolution because \nultimately none of us ever envisioned staying in Iraq. We have been \nthere 4 years. I wish we were not there today, but we are and we are \nheavily engaged.\n  I think we need to give our Armed Forces every opportunity to \nsucceed. We should not send an ambiguous message to them: We are going \nto support you today and tomorrow we want you to withdraw, in 120 days, \nor begin to withdraw. I think that is the wrong message, and I think it \nwould undermine the morale of our troops.\n  Congress should not be armchair generals. We should not try to \nmicromanage what is going on on the ground. That is why I support the \nCochran amendment. We need to give our commanders and our soldiers \nevery chance to succeed in Iraq, to bring stability there, where \ndiplomatic maneuvers then perhaps could begin to work. Sending \nambiguous messages to our Armed Forces is not the right way. They need \nour support both morally and materially. I believe at the end of the \nday they are going to get it.\n  The President has already signaled if this language were to stay he \nwould veto this bill. I believe what he says he is going to do. But we \ncan strike this language today. We can move on and get this \nsupplemental passed to make sure our troops are well funded and that \nthey have what they need to succeed. And they will succeed.\n  The members of our Armed Forces are in harm's way every day. We know \nthe horror stories about war. But they bravely face a sometimes unknown \nenemy and have done everything asked of them--sometimes two and three \ntimes, Mr. President, as you well know. Micromanaging the war from the \nHalls of Congress is not the right thing to do.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Cochran amendment and strike this \nlanguage from the supplemental bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. I \nknow it is not our side's time. If there is no objection, I would \nappreciate using the time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this is going to be a very busy day. I have \ncomments that will relate to what will happen when we bring the bill up \non the floor, but I thought I would take this time to talk about two \nthings that are extremely important. First, with respect to the bill, I \nam the lead Republican cosponsor, with the Senators from North Dakota \nand South Dakota, on ag disaster. We have been 3 years without an \nagricultural disaster bill. We have had 3 years of agricultural \ndisasters. Those of us from the Midwest know that we have been \nafflicted with droughts, tornadoes, tremendous losses by farmers, \nlivestock producers, and others in agricultural production. I visited \nsouthwest Missouri this January and saw what some people described as \ncountywide tornadoes. The ice storms were so severe they broke down \ntrees, collapsed sheds, knocked out power, broke down fences, and put \nmany livestock and poultry producers on the verge of financial \ndisaster.\n  Similarly over the years, when drought has struck, the ag producers, \nlivestock and poultry and crops, were hit severely. This ag disaster \npackage is absolutely essential. I appreciate the lead of the chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee in including our request for ag \ndisaster.\n  In addition, I am a very strong supporter of the amendment of the \nranking minority member of the Appropriations Committee to strike the \nlimitations on the ability of General Petraeus to conduct the war in \nIraq. Let us remember that General Petraeus came before the committees \nto outline his new ideas, his new plan for moving forward in Iraq. \nPeople had been saying: We need a new plan. Yes, clearly, we need a new \nplan. The Bremer plan, debaathification, firing the Army, sending them \nhome without pay and with their weapons, turns out to have been the \nabsolute wrong thing to do. But General Petraeus, who was unanimously \nconfirmed by this body, has gone back to Iraq with his new way of going \nforward.\n  They have made some significant changes in the rules of engagement. \nNow no longer are Shia death squads or militia off-limits. Moqtada al-\nSadr has seen the light or felt the heat, and he has gone to Tehran. We \nare talking action against Jaysh al-Mahdi and others who are engaged in \nsectarian battles. We have a new plan of going in, holding, and \nclearing, the conventional and now-proven theory of dealing with \ninsurgencies. You cannot just go in and wipe out people who are causing \nchaos and killing their political enemies. You have to stay there and \nmaintain peace, security. That is what we are supporting the Iraqi \nforces doing. The Iraqi forces are there. They are the ones who are \ngoing to have to take over. The training of the Iraqi forces is the \ncritical element for us to assure stability in the region.\n  Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and on mine \nembraced the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. For example, the \ndistinguished majority whip on December 8 on CNN said:\n\n       We ought to follow the Iraqi Study Group.\n\n  This new plan the President and General Petraeus have put forward is, \nby and large, the Iraq Study Group's plan. After receiving the report, \nwhen you look at the recommendations, they track with what we are doing \nnow, from sending reinforcements to Baghdad to increasing the number of \nembedded American advisers, to holding the Iraqi Government responsible \nfor specific security and political milestones. The differences between \nwhat we are doing now in Iraq and the Iraq Study Group recommendations \nare insignificant. Sending reinforcements to Baghdad, the principal \ntenet of the new plan General Petraeus has put forth, is referenced in \ngeneral by the Iraq Study Group, which said it could support a short-\nterm redeployment or surge of American combat forces to stabilize \nBaghdad, recognizing the level of violence in and around Baghdad has \ncrippled the ability of both the al-Maliki Government and the U.S. \nmilitary to restore basic services and establish a modicum of law and \norder. I quote:\n\n       The ISG recognized, as does the U.S. military, that Baghdad \n     is central to success or failure in Iraq. It is not \n     surprising that more troops were added--the total number of \n     which is still below 2005 levels.\n\n  There is one other very important point that is of concern to \neverybody in this body and all Americans. The Iraq Study Group said:\n\n       The United States should not make an open-ended commitment \n     to keep large numbers of American troops deployed in Iraq.\n\n  President Bush said of his plan and its implementation:\n\n       I've made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other \n     leaders that America's commitment is not open-ended. If the \n     Iraqi government does not follow through on its promises, it \n     will lose the support of the American people.\n\n  It is clear we have a new way forward. The language in the underlying \nlegislation before us says we ought to set a timetable, a political \ntimetable. We ought to determine in this body exactly the dates when we \nstart removing troops from Baghdad, from Iraq, changing our policy.\n  I have a novel idea: Wars cannot be run from these hallowed and \ncomfortable and sanctified chambers 10,000 miles away from the war \nzone. How about allowing the officers, the men, and the commanders in \nthe field--who are engaged daily, risking their lives to bring peace \nand security to Iraq--to determine when and how we can best turn over \nto the Iraqi security forces the critical job--the critical job--of \nassuring security and a relatively peaceful country? Nobody is saying \nit is going to be a Jeffersonian democracy. What we are seeking is \npeace and security.\n  We had an open hearing with the leaders of the intelligence community \nin January before the Senate Intelligence Committee. The top leaders of \nthat intelligence community said, unanimously, it would be very unwise \nto establish a short-term political timetable for withdrawal prior to \nthe\n\n[[Page S3785]]\n\ntime the Iraqi security forces take over.\n  If this body, in its ``wisdom''--an oxymoron in this case--says pull \nout on such-and-such date, and the Iraqi security forces are not ready \nto take over, what would happen? Three things--all of them bad.\n  No. 1, the killing, sectarian violence between Shia and Sunnis would \nescalate. You would see many more thousands killed, as we would no \nlonger be there to serve as a buffer and as adviser to prevent that \nfrom happening.\n  No. 2, the goal of al-Qaida, as expressed by Osama bin Laden and his \nNo. 2 man, Ayman al-Zawahiri, to achieve the headquarters of the \ncaliphate in the ``land of the two rivers,'' i.e., Baghdad, would be \nachieved. They would have a safe haven. They would have a safe haven \nfrom which they could train, recruit, perhaps even get back to turning \non the dual-use facilities Saddam Hussein set up for turning out \nchemical or biological weapons.\n  Now, the third thing that would happen, which is a true disaster, \nwould be the neighboring countries would have to come in to back up \ntheir co-religionists. If the Sunnis are being oppressed by the Shia, \nthen the Sunni states will be ready, and they will come in. If they \ncome in, Iran and its Shia partners are all ready to come in.\n  What happens then? We have a conflagration in the Middle East \nbringing in many countries in a region-wide war that will draw, \nunfortunately, perhaps hundreds of thousands of American troops to \nprevent the disaster from spreading, to support our friends in Israel.\n  General Petraeus has promised, in his confirmation hearings, that he \nwill tell us if the new plan, the new rules of engagement--putting the \nIraqi security forces out front, with American advisers continuing to \nsupply American troops to go after the high-value targets, the radical \nSalafist jihadists of al-Qaida and other entities--we will continue to \nhunt them down so they do not overwhelm the Iraqi security forces.\n  General Petraeus will tell us. He should know by this summer if it \nfails. If it fails, he said he will tell us, and I would trust he would \nbegin making such changes as are necessary, without tipping off the \nenemy what they are planning to do. The important thing is not telling \nthe enemy what our timetable is.\n  I think it is perhaps illustrative to share with you some comments \nfrom an e-mail I received from a marine who has been in Iraq and who is \ngoing back. He was commenting on a timetable. He said: I haven't polled \nall of them. I don't speak for all of them, but I can tell you, a \nlion's share think a timetable is a disastrous idea. I don't know what \npossible benefit you can assess that would come from a timetable. Where \nis the help toward mission accomplishment?\n  He said: Iraqis understand that progress is being made. I think the \nIraqi forces are getting ready to take over and with our help should be \nable to do it sometime in 2007. But if we tell everyone exactly when \nthat is going to be, it gets a lot easier for the merry mujahedin to \nclaim victory, lay low, and then wreak havoc when the coalition packs \nup shop.\n  This particular marine said: I'm not wild about going back to Iraq, \nbut I would sure as heck rather do that than essentially invalidate \neverything we've done to date by leaving too early and inviting chaos.\n  That is the choice. Does a political timetable give Members cover \nback here? Maybe. But I have even heard that ridiculed. I have heard \nthat ridiculed. I ask this body to strike the language, let General \nPetraeus run the war, let him pursue every avenue to assure Iraq is \nstable and secure. He and the President have said, if it does not work, \nwe will change policy. But let's give it a chance to work.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues and yield \nthe floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/27/senate-section/article/S3785-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 1591, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1591) making emergency supplemental \n     appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Cochran amendment No. 643 (to amendment No. 641), to strike \n     language that would tie the hands of the Commander-in-Chief \n     by imposing an arbitrary timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. \n     forces from Iraq, thereby undermining the position of \n     American Armed Forces and jeopardizing the successful \n     conclusion of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, before my colleague from Missouri, Senator \nBond, leaves the floor, I wonder if I might just engage him in a \ncolloquy for just a moment.\n  Mr. BOND. Sure.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to speak about \nagriculture disaster provisions in the emergency supplemental bill. We \nhad some people on the Senate floor yesterday questioning whether they \nare valid, whether they are necessary provisions to help family \nfarmers. I noted the Senator from Missouri was a cosponsor of mine, as \nwe worked together to put the agriculture disaster program in the \nemergency supplemental bill.\n  Let me make a point and then ask a question of my colleague from \nMissouri.\n  First of all, I appreciate very much his help. I know Missouri has \nbeen hit with a devastating drought and other weather-related disasters \nfor family farmers. It has been the case in other parts of the country \nas well. We have been working for some long while just to reach out a \nhelping hand to those farmers out there struggling who got hit with \nweather-related disasters to say: You are not alone. As is the \ntradition in this country when you get hit with a weather-related \ndisaster and lose everything, this country wants to help you some. We \nhelp everyone around the world. It is time to take care of things at \nhome. That is what this provision is about.\n\n  I ask the Senator from Missouri about his motivation for being a part \nof those of us who worked together to get this put in the emergency \nsupplemental bill. I know he strongly supports it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from the Dakotas. \nBefore he arrived on the floor, I made the case for it. The Senator \nasked about the situation in Missouri. I told them about the \ndevastating ice storms. We have had a historic drought. What we need is \na comprehensive national policy to deal with the problems and not just \nfor the Dakotas or Missouri but for Colorado, Texas, Nebraska, Kansas, \nCalifornia--throughout this country--where people have been devastated \nby extreme weather conditions.\n  We have livestock producers who were hit the hardest. There is no \nsafety net in place for livestock producers. They are not protected by \ncrop insurance, the farm bill, or disaster protection under the USDA \nsince the standard is crop loss and there were no crops to be lost in \nthe middle of the winter in an ice storm. But the devastation is there.\n  This body and this Government came to the rescue of people who were \nabsolutely wiped out by Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters. \nWell, the impact in the farm area is very severe. No, it is not the \nsame as a hurricane, but the weather disasters have caused tremendous \nhardships and threaten to put many farmers under and destroy rural \ncommunities.\n  That is why I am very pleased to join with my colleague in urging \nthis body to keep the agricultural disaster program, the relief we have \nnot had for 3 years, in this bill.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for his \nleadership on this issue as well.\n  Let me say that the Congress did help farmers in the gulf region who \nlost their crops. I understand we helped cities that were devastated \nand lost buildings and lives and so on. We also helped farmers who lost \ntheir crops.\n  My point is--and I think the point of the Senator from Missouri is--\nthere is\n\n[[Page S3786]]\n\nno difference between a person who loses their entire crop in Missouri \nor North Dakota or in the gulf region because of a hurricane. We do not \nname droughts. We name hurricanes. But if Hurricane Katrina took your \nentire crop away, this Government would say: We want to help you. So, \ntoo, should we help in the case of a drought or ice storms, as the \nSenator from Missouri just described. I certainly appreciate his help \non these matters.\n  I wanted to come to the floor because yesterday there was some \ndiscussion by several Members of the Senate referring to the \nagriculture disaster piece as pork. Now, our farmers know about pork, \nand they know you do not legislate pork, you eat pork. There is a big \ndifference.\n  I am just curious, why is it every time you try to do something in \nthis country to help people who need help, it is called pork. Well, if \nyou invest, for example, in public policy, as we have, to say build a \nroad in Iraq, that is national security. If you have a provision in an \nappropriations bill that says build a road in this country, it is pork. \nIf you build a health clinic in Iraq, that is national security. If you \nbuild it here, it is pork. If you build a water project in Iraq, that \nis national security. If you build it here, it is pork.\n  Why is it, to someone in this Chamber, investing in this country is \nalways pork, but as long as it is investing somewhere else in this \nworld, that is just fine. Mr. President, $18.1 billion went out of this \nChamber in unbelievable ways for reconstruction in Iraq. Let me tell \nyou, any time someone is sending one-hundred-dollar bills out of the \nback of a pickup truck, you don't think there is going to be graft and \nfraud and corruption? You take a look at what has happened with respect \nto the taxpayers' money and the way it was spent in Iraq. I described \nsome of that on the floor of the Senate previously.\n  We paid a corporation $220 million to reconstruct 142 health clinics \nin Iraq. Twenty got done. The rest--122--never got done. A courageous \nIraqi doctor went to the Iraqi Health Minister and said: Well, can I \nsee these Iraqi clinics that were supposed to have been rehabilitated \nwith American taxpayer dollars?\n  The Iraqi Health Minister says: Well, those were ``imaginary \nclinics.''\n  The money was not imaginary. The American taxpayer got fleeced. The \nmoney is gone.\n  But why is it when we come to this Chamber and talk about investing \nin people's lives in this country--a farmer, his wife, and two kids, \nwho live out under a yard light, who planted in the spring, trying to \nmake a go of it, hoping it would not rain too much, hoping it would \nrain enough, hoping it would not hail or they would have crop disease \nor insects, hoping they would raise a crop. Finally, when they get a \ncrop, they hope the price is sufficient so maybe they can make a \nliving. Then, along comes a storm, an unbelievably devastating storm--\nperhaps an ice storm, perhaps a torrential rain--that wipes out their \nentire crop, washes it away. Or maybe it is a drought. All of a sudden, \nthat farmer has nothing. Oh, they put the seeds in the ground, but \nnothing came up, or they put the seeds in the ground, and it washed \naway. The farmer ends up with nothing.\n  Look, the grand tradition in this Chamber has always been to provide \nsome disaster aid to farmers who lose everything. Why? Because we want \nto maintain a network of family farms in this country. This is not new. \nWe have been doing it for some long while. When we have devastating \nweather-related disasters hit family farmers, we help them with a \ndisaster bill. It is only recently that has become controversial.\n  Twice I have run that disaster bill through the Appropriations \nCommittee. Senator Conrad, myself, and others put together a bipartisan \nbill. As an appropriator this year, I offered it with my colleague, \nSenator Feinstein from California, and Senator Bond from Missouri--\nbipartisan. We offered it a third time. It is going to come to the \nfloor now. It is in this bill, and we have people complaining about \nit. This is investing in our country's strength. This is the best \nnotion of our country to say to family farmers: You had some trouble. \nIt wasn't your fault. We want to help you through this difficult time.\n\n  Now, we have usually done this without great controversy. The \ncontroversy this time is because the last two times I got this through \nthe Senate, I was a conferee and I went to the conference. The \nPresident was threatening to veto a bill that had agriculture disaster \nhelp in it for family farmers. So twice we went to conference and the \nU.S. House conferees, at the request of the then-Speaker of the House, \nMr. Hastert, blocked it on behalf of the President.\n  Well, it is here a third time and we will go to conference. This time \nI will be a conferee and my colleague Senator Feinstein will be a \nconferee, Senator Bond will be a conferee, and there will be bipartisan \nsupport on the Senate side. The difference this time is we go to the \nconference and the House conferees will come to conference having \npassed their own disaster bill for family farmers. This time we are \ngoing to get this to the President's desk, at long last.\n  Some say: Well, why just farmers? Why family farmers? There is \nsomething unusual about those who produce from the land in this \ncountry. It goes back to the homestead days in sod huts out there, \nalone, trying to raise a family, raise a crop, make a living. We could \ndo, I suppose, without family farmers, but it wouldn't be the same \ncountry. You could have corporate agri-factory farms from California to \nMaine, but it wouldn't be the same country. Once they control food \nproduction, then ask yourselves: What is going to be the cost of food \nin this country?\n  Someone once wrote, and I have mentioned him on the floor a few \ntimes--Rodney Nelson, in fact, a North Dakota rancher who wrote a piece \nof prose about ranching and farming. He asked this question, and I \nthink it is important for the country. He said: What is it worth for a \nkid to know how to plow a furrow, how to teach a newborn calf to suck \nmilk from a pail? What is it worth for a kid to know how to weld a \nseam? What is it worth for a kid to know how to build a door, to build \na lean-to, to grease a combine, to pour cement? What is it worth for a \nkid to learn all of those things? There is only one university in \nAmerica where you learn all of that, and that is the family farm, \nAmerica's family farm. It is an unbelievable asset to this country.\n  We are asking for something very simple that has been done routinely \nprior to this President beginning to block it, and that is when trouble \ncomes, when weather disasters wipe out an entire crop, we say to \nfamilies living out there under the yardlight, trying to raise a family \nand raise a crop: You are not alone. This country wants to help. That \nis why we brought this in this bill to the floor of the Senate. It \nwon't make anybody whole, but it does say to farmers: Maybe you will \nhave a chance to keep going. They live on hope. How else could you \nplant a crop and do anything other than hope that things will work out?\n  This country has a rich tradition of supporting family farmers, \nbecause it is in this country's interests. The seedbed rolls from big \ncities to small towns and enriches and nourishes this country. We have \nalways known that and we have always done the right thing.\n  Family farmers have been hard hit in the last couple of years with \nweather-related disasters. This Congress took action with respect to \none facet of those weather-related disasters. We said farmers in the \nGulf of Mexico who lost their entire crops due to a hurricane named \nKatrina, you are going to get some help. The rest of you, we are sorry. \nWell, listen. I was supportive of saying to those farmers we are going \nto give you some help. It doesn't matter to me whether it is a Katrina \nor a drought that doesn't have a name or an ice storm that is not \nnamed, weather-related disasters that destroy farmers' crops, in my \njudgment, ought to be responded to by this Congress to say to those \nfamily farmers: This has destroyed your crop, but not your hope. We \nwant to give you hope to be able to continue farming. That is what this \ndisaster piece is all about. I am proud to stand here and support it. \nThose who believe this is some kind of pork do not understand what \nessential investment in this country's strength is all about. An \ninvestment in America's family farming is a good investment in this \ncountry's future.\n  My colleague from California who worked with me in the Appropriations\n\n[[Page S3787]]\n\nCommittee to get this done is on the floor, so let me yield the floor \nto her and thank her for her leadership in responding to these needs as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator very much. Thank you, Mr. \nPresident.\n  I very much commend the Senator from North Dakota. I think he said it \nwell and in a very inspiring way. If I had to summarize it, it would be \nthat we in America try to take care of our own--not only people in \nother nations, but people who have been the victims of real disaster in \nthis country.\n  The fact is we haven't been doing it for 3 years, and the disasters \nhave piled up: in 2005, 2006, and 2007. This package takes care of that \nproblem. In my State, California, we suffered two devastating disasters \nin the last 2 years which have resulted in Federal disaster \ndeclarations: a heat wave and a freeze. We are currently suffering a \ndrought. Governor Schwarzenegger has certified through March 13 a loss \nfrom the freeze of $1.397 billion. The total damage has yet to be \nfigured.\n  I think people don't understand how big this was in California. We \nhave losses in 35 out of 58 counties, many the most productive in the \ncountry, that produce more agricultural products than 22 other States, \nin 40 different types of crops. They include avocados, strawberries, \ngrapes, walnuts, guavas, lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, artichokes, \nasparagus, and celery.\n  The losses include $817 million in damage to California's citrus \ncrops. Lemons, limes, mandarins, grapefruit, navel oranges, and \nValencias are dead in the field. Here is what some of it looks like. \nThis is one tree.\n  Now, most people know Florida has oranges, but those are the oranges \nwe make juice out of. When you eat an orange, a tangerine, or a \ngrapefruit, or you put a lemon in your ice tea, those fruits are from \nCalifornia. But not this year. We have lost at least 50 percent of the \nnavel orange crop, 65 percent of the Valencia crop, and 65 percent of \nour mandarins. My farmers need this assistance.\n  Some of my colleagues are asking, why do we need to provide this \nfunding? Farmers should have their own insurance. The answer is, in \nCalifornia most farmers already do have insurance, but here is the rub: \nIt is not going to be nearly enough to cover the damage.\n  Let me provide an example. According to the Department of \nAgriculture's Risk Management Agency, citrus growers will be able to \ncollect up to $311 million in crop insurance. Now, that sounds like a \nlot, but the farming costs for California's citrus industry for this \nyear's operations alone total $560 million. What do I mean by farming \ncosts? This is the amount farmers have spent to irrigate, spray, prune, \neverything that is necessary to prepare a crop for harvest. But this \nyear, there is no harvest. Therefore, they absorb the $560 million.\n  They also have to begin to get ready for next year's harvest. They \nneed to get their loans. That will also be an incurrence of $560 \nmillion in normal farming costs. That adds up to $1.2 billion in \nregular farming costs, and only $311 million--at most--in available \ninsurance they can recoup. And they are not guaranteed a crop next \nyear.\n  Add on to that the $100 million these growers spent in January on \nwind machines, irrigation, and other methods to protect their orchards \nfrom the freezing temperatures, plus the costs they are incurring now \nto remove the dead fruit and branches.\n  Now, 85 percent of citrus is grown by family farmers--that is just a \nfact--not the big agricultural combines. These are responsible farmers. \nIn fact, 75 percent of the citrus acres in California are insured, but \nagain, insurance alone will not cover the needs of my constituents. \nThis is why we need this assistance.\n  When some people saw there was also an appropriation for dairy milk \nloss, some people actually laughed. I was offended, because in July of \n2006, California experienced 2 weeks of blistering, triple digit \ntemperatures. For 12 days the San Joaquin Valley, the most productive \nagricultural region of this country, had temperatures over 105 degrees.\n  What does this mean? Well, 20,552 milk cows died and 10,738 calves \ndied. Those are counted animals--over 30,000 dead. That doesn't include \nour losses in poultry. There were so many dead carcasses, the rendering \nplants could not handle the load. The State temporarily lifted the ban \non burying dead livestock in landfills, but that was still not enough. \nThese cows died because of the heat. Even the cows that survived \nproduced 25 percent less milk than is normal. So the death of these \nanimals, plus the stress put on the ones still producing, resulted in \nmore than $228 million in milk losses for my dairymen.\n  In addition, because regular breeding could not take place for a \nmonth because of the death of so many animals, my farmers will again \nface at least $228 million in losses for 2007. That is why my \ncolleague, Senator Barbara Boxer, has joined with me in helping us push \nfor the addition of this relief into our emergency supplemental.\n  This is a total of $460 million in losses. We are asking for only $95 \nmillion, and that is in this supplemental. What is more, this funding \ncan be accessed by dairymen on the gulf coast, including Mississippi, \nLouisiana, and Arkansas, who also suffered losses due to the \nhurricanes.\n  Let me conclude. This has not been easy, and I thank Senator Byrd, \nSenator Dorgan, Senator Conrad, Senator Kohl, and Senator Reid for \ntheir work on this Agricultural Disaster package, and also the \nRepublican leadership on the Appropriations Committee who acceded to \nthe request.\n  America is a great nation, and one of the reasons we are a great \nnation is we don't only care about others; we care about our own. If \nthere is ever a time when we could help our own, it is in this \nsupplemental appropriation. So what I say is: Hands off, please. We \nhave worked hard to get where we are. The losses have been substantial. \nThe disasters have been large. Families who can't pay their mortgages, \nwho lose their boats if they are fishermen, lose their farms if they \ncan't make the payments, can be helped by this assistance. So I hope it \nremains in. I hope we resist an effort to remove this from the \nsupplemental package. Again, I thank those who have helped with this.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are considering the supplemental \nappropriations bill. I spoke earlier about the agricultural disaster \npiece in that bill. I believe other colleagues will be over to talk \nabout that as well. My colleague, Senator Feinstein from California, \njust finished discussing it. She was a major cosponsor of it. I have \nindicated previously that my colleague, Senator Conrad, is coming. He \nworked to create a coalition of interest and support of the \nagricultural disaster piece. So when others come, I expect we will have \nmore discussion about this important issue.\n  I wish to talk for a moment about the supplemental appropriations \nbill and the issue of Iraq. Earlier, one of my colleagues was \ndescribing the issue of Iraq and the controversy that the Congress \nmight get involved and somehow interfere and that there cannot be 535 \ncommanders in chief. I understand that. I wish to make a couple of \npoints about Iraq, however.\n  The issue of Iraq, as you know, casts a shadow on virtually \neverything else in this country. We are spending, in terms of the lives \nof American soldiers and America's treasure, an unbelievable amount \nwith respect to the war in Iraq. All of us want this country to \nsucceed. There is nobody here who doesn't want America to succeed in \nwhatever we are involved in.\n  I wish to make this point: The National Intelligence Estimate has \njust been completed. There is a classified and an unclassified version. \nThe unclassified version tells all of us and the American people that \nwhat is happening in Iraq is largely sectarian violence. It is not a \nfight against the ``terrorists.'' It is sectarian violence--Shia\n\n[[Page S3788]]\n\ntrying to kill Sunni, Sunni trying to kill Shia. That is a civil war by \nclassic definition. That is what we face in Iraq. There is an al-Qaida \npresence in Al Anbar Province. We understand that. What is happening \nthere is largely a civil war.\n  Now, the head of our intelligence services in this country testified \ntwice. The former head, Mr. Negroponte, and the current head have \ntestified within the last 2\\1/2\\ months. Both of them have said exactly \nthe same thing. They have both said the greatest terrorist threat to \nthis country is al-Qaida, its networks around the world, and its \ndetermination to strike us in our homeland. So the greatest threat to \nour homeland is from the terrorist group al-Qaida. Both have described \nal-Qaida as operating in a safe hideaway in northern Pakistan.\n  If the greatest threat to our country is al-Qaida, if the leadership \nof al-Qaida is directing threats against our homeland and they are in a \nsecure hideaway in northern Pakistan, if that is the greatest threat to \nour homelend, and if, in fact, what is happening in Iraq, according to \nthe National Intelligence Estimate, is a civil war, then I think the \nquestion is, What better protects our country? Is it beginning to \nextract from a civil war? After all, the Iraqi people have seen Saddam \nHussein executed. They have seen the opportunity to vote for their own \nnew Constitution. They have been given the opportunity to vote for \ntheir own new Government. The only question remaining is, Do those same \npeople have the will to provide for their own security? So the question \nis, What better protects our country? Is it the opportunity to extract \nfrom a civil war at some point soon or is it the determination to \nignore the presence of the al-Qaida leadership in northern Pakistan?\n  If we begin to withdraw and extract from a civil war in Iraq, do we \nthen have a better capability to keep our eye on the ball, the greatest \nthreat to our country, the leadership of al-Qaida and their network \naround the world? If that were the case, wouldn't this country wish to \nbegin to take action against the greatest threat to our homeland and \nthreat to our security, the leadership of al-Qaida?\n  That is not me describing that. That is from the National \nIntelligence Estimate, the combined judgment of the intelligence \ncommunities in our Government.\n  You can make a pretty strong case that Osama bin Laden, who boasted \nabout murdering innocent Americans on 9/11/2001--he still speaks to us \nfrom time to time from a ``secure hideaway,'' as described by the head \nof our intelligence. Al-Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden, after all of \nthese years having passed since 9/11, still exist. Their leadership \napparently is still intact, according to the head of our national \nintelligence services. We generally know where they are. They are \napparently in a country that is supposed to be cooperating with us--\nPakistan.\n  The question is, Why have we not brought to justice the leadership of \nal-Qaida, if that is our greatest threat? The answer, I suppose, is \nbecause this country has 140,000-plus soldiers in Iraq prosecuting a \nwar in the middle of what is now a civil war in Iraq.\n  We can debate forever, perhaps, the conditions that got us to this \npoint--terrible intelligence, the most unbelievable intelligence \nfailure, perhaps, in the history of this country. This country told the \nworld that the country of Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction \nthat threatened America. Now it turns out, we understand, to take one \nexample, that the issue of mobile chemical weapons laboratories--that \nintelligence was given to us by German authorities. That came from a \nfabricator who is now alleged to have been a drunk--a single source, \nperhaps drunk, fabricator persuades this country to tell the world Iraq \nhas mobile chemical labs. But it turns out they didn't.\n  I could go on at great length about the intelligence failures. \nWhatever the intelligence failures were, we went to Iraq. This country \nwent to Iraq, and a number of things have happened. We have unearthed \nmass graves. Several hundred thousand Iraqis were murdered by a brutal \nregime headed by Saddam Hussein. There are a number of brutal regimes \nin this world. We don't take it upon ourselves--unless it is in our \nnational interest--to send troops to those brutal regimes. But Saddam \nHussein was, in fact, a brutal dictator. He has been executed. The \nworld is better for that. The country of Iraq has shed itself of a \nbrutal dictator. His execution comes amid other opportunities for the \npeople of Iraq. They have a constitution, a brandnew one; they wrote it \nand voted for it. They have a new government. They have created and \nvoted for that government. And now we have tens and tens and tens of \nthousands of American soldiers in Iraq, in the middle of a civil war.\n  We have taken our eye off the ball because the issue really is the \nterrorist organizations that wish to commit acts of terror against our \ncountry. The head of our national intelligence says that al-Qaida is \nthe greatest terrorist threat to our country. They are in secure \nhideaways in northern Pakistan. It seems to me that the ability to \nbegin to extract ourselves from the middle of a civil war in Iraq gives \nus the opportunity to put pressure on and work with other countries to \nbring to justice the greatest terrorist threat to this country, the \nterrorist organization that murdered Americans on 9/11/2001. That ought \nto be our overriding goal. If that is the greatest terrorist threat, it \nseems to me our most important job is to eliminate that threat, and \nsooner rather than later.\n\n  So I end where I began. No one in this Chamber has a difference of \nopinion about whether we want our country to succeed. We love our \ncountry, and we want to succeed. We honor our soldiers, and we insist, \nwhen we send America's sons and daughters to war, that they have all \nthe things they need and the support they need to do their job. But \nfrom a policy perspective, I believe this President has made very \nserious mistakes.\n  One of my colleagues, this morning, said the general will tell us \nwhether things are going well. I cannot tell you how many briefings I \nhave been in--top-secret briefings--month after month after month and \nyear after year in which the top generals have come to us and said \nthings are going really very well, when, in fact, that hasn't been the \ncase. Only later have we discovered it was not the case; it never was \nthe case.\n  It seems to me that this country has to evaluate what it can do at \nthis point to begin to find a way to withdraw and extract from a civil \nwar in Iraq. Perhaps there needs to be partitioning, I don't know. I \nknow that is a tough subject to introduce these days. But if there are \nno alternatives, perhaps you have to partition the parties fighting \neach other, the Sunnis and Shias, and try to find another device to \ndeal with the issue.\n  In any event, it seems to me it is in this country's best interest to \nkeep our eye on the ball, and the ball here is, according to head of \nour intelligence, that the greatest terrorist threat to our country is \nthe leadership of al-Qaida and their network. We have not, in my \njudgment, with respect to al-Qaida and the deepening problems of the \nTaliban in Afghanistan, kept our eye on the ball. That is one of the \nreasons there needs to be a change.\n  This notion of ``stay the course'' or ``cut and run,'' which was the \nslogan--there is the slogan of the week or the slogan of the month. The \nadministration's slogan of the month last year was ``stay the course'' \nor ``cut and run.'' It was always a false choice that was never a \nsubstitute for thoughtful debate. It was a thoughtless chant of things \nthat mattered very little.\n  What matters most to this country is that we are engaged in pursuits \nwhich will provide opportunity to strengthen this country, which do \nhonor and justice to the efforts of our soldiers, and which relate to \nresponding to the terrorist threat because the threat against this \ncountry is a very serious, abiding, long-term threat. All of us want to \nsucceed in dealing with that threat.\n  Mr. President, one of my colleagues, Senator Conrad, has arrived. I \nthink he intends to speak on this agricultural disaster issue. Let me \nat this point yield the floor, and I think other colleagues will speak \non the agricultural disaster piece I spoke on earlier.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3789]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this week, the Senate will once again have \nthe opportunity to demonstrate its support for America's family farmers \nand ranchers by improving emergency agricultural disaster assistance as \npart of the supplemental appropriations bill.\n  For over a year, I, along with Senate colleagues from both sides of \nthe aisle, have attempted repeatedly to convince the Congress of the \nUnited States and this administration to provide desperately needed \ndisaster assistance.\n  As part of the hurricane supplemental last year, the Senate approved \nan agricultural disaster package. That measure was dropped in \nconference as a result of opposition from the administration. The need \nfor this legislation has only been made more compelling by the severe \ndisasters that have hit California, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New \nMexico, and Oklahoma during the final weeks of 2006.\n\n  In my own home State of North Dakota, in 2005, we had a disaster that \nwas devastating to thousands of farm and ranch families. This is what \nwe saw across North Dakota--flooded lands, over a million acres of land \nthat could not even be planted and another million acres of land that \nwas drowned out. Then, irony of ironies, the next year we had a \ndevastating drought--the third worst drought in this Nation's entire \nhistory, hitting not only North Dakota but right down the heartland of \nAmerica.\n  This is a farm field near my home, in Burleigh County. I live in \nBismarck. This is a farm field in that same county, and you can see \nalmost nothing growing.\n  Here is the U.S. Drought Monitor, and they determine on a scientific \nbasis the effect of drought across America. This is from July 25, 2006, \nand you can see drought right down the heartland of America--in our \ncase, exceptional drought. That is the dark brown right on the border \nbetween North Dakota and South Dakota--exceptional drought. The next \ncategory going down the scale, extreme drought, an even broader area \nbetween the two States. We also see exceptional and extreme droughts in \nthese parts of the country, and then severe drought. That is the tan. \nVirtually all of North Dakota had exceptional, extreme, and severe \ndrought conditions. And, of course, not just North Dakota, it was right \ndown the heartland of the country.\n  This is a headline from July 30, 2006, from the Grand Forks Herald: \n``Dakotas the Epicenter of a Drought-Stricken Nation. More than 60 \npercent of the United States in drought.''\n  This has been an absolutely bizarre set of circumstances: One year, \nextreme flooding; the next year, extreme drought. But that is the \nreality of what we have confronted, and if assistance is not provided, \nthousands of farm families will be forced off the land.\n  The President's chief economic adviser was in my office to visit me \non another matter at the same time there were independent bankers from \nmy State there to talk to me about agricultural assistance--bankers \ntalking to me about the desperate need for drought assistance. They \ntold me and told the President's chief economic adviser that if \nassistance were not forthcoming, they would lose 5 to 10 percent of \ntheir clients. These are farm and ranch families who work hard, who \nlove this country, who work the land, and who are some of the most \nindependent people you would ever want to meet. The last thing they \nwant is a government handout, but if they do not have a helping hand \nextended to them, they are going to be out of business. That shouldn't \nbe the result. We should provide the very basic assistance we have \nprovided in other times in other parts of the country to those who have \nbeen hard hit.\n  Let me make certain that people understand. To get any assistance, \nproducers will need to demonstrate they have had a 35-percent loss, and \nthey will get no help for that first 35 percent of loss. That is the \nfloor. They have to have lost 35 percent before they get anything, and \nthen the assistance will apply to the losses beyond 35 percent.\n  Nobody is getting rich on this program. Some have suggested this bill \nwill result in farmers becoming more than whole because of crop \ninsurance. That is simply incorrect. Under the provisions, a producer \nreceiving disaster assistance cannot recover more than 95 percent of \nthe expected value of the crop, after both crop insurance and the \nexpected market income from the crop have been deducted.\n  This is desperately needed. It is done in a way that is fair and \nbalanced and prevents abuse. I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/27/senate-section/article/S3789-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3789-S3792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     NOMINATION OF GEORGE H. WU TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of George H. Wu, of \nCalifornia, to be United States District Judge for the Central District \nof California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 20 \nminutes for debate, equally divided between the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with this confirmation--and I expect Mr. Wu \nwill be confirmed--we will have confirmed 14 lifetime appointments to \nthe Federal bench so far this year. This is March. I mention that \nbecause, when President Clinton was in office and the Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate, there were only 17 confirmations during the \nentire 1996 session of the Senate.\n  For those who think there is partisanship in the confirmation of \njudges, yes, there has been. Fortunately, it has been my friends on the \nother side.\n  Today the Senate continues, as we have since the beginning of this \nCongress, to make progress on judicial nominations. The Senate will \nconsider and, I believe, confirm the nomination of George H. Wu to be a \nUnited States District Judge for the Central District of California.\n  With this confirmation, the Senate will have confirmed 14 lifetime \nappointments to the Federal bench so far this year. There were only 17 \nconfirmations during the entire 1996 session of the Senate. I have \nworked cooperatively with Members from both sides of the aisle on our \ncommittee and in the Senate to move quickly to consider and confirm \nthese judicial nominations so that we can fill vacancies and improve \nthe administration of justice in our Nation's Federal courts.\n  The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts lists 48 remaining \njudicial vacancies, yet the President has sent us only 27 nominations \nfor these vacancies. Twenty-one of these vacancies--almost half--have \nno nominee. Of the 20 vacancies deemed by the Administrative Office to \nbe judicial emergencies, the President has yet to send us nominees for \n10 of them. That means half of the judicial emergency vacancies are \nwithout a nominee.\n\n  Judge Wu's nomination has the support of his home State Senators, and \nI thank Senators Feinstein and Boxer for their support of this \nnomination.\n  Judge Wu has an extensive record of public service as a State trial \njudge, a Federal prosecutor, and a law professor. In his 14 years on \nthe State trial bench, Judge Wu has served in the Los Angeles Municipal \nCourt and in the Los Angeles Superior Court, handling an array of \ncriminal and civil cases. Previously, Judge Wu worked on complex \ncommercial matters in private practice for two Los Angeles law firms. \nJudge Wu has also served as a law professor at the University of \nTennessee School of Law, and as an assistant U.S. attorney and later \nassistant division chief in the civil division of the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice for the Central District of California.\n  I am pleased that the nominee before us is an Asian-Pacific American. \nI have urged, and will continue to urge, the President to nominate men \nand women to the Federal bench who reflect the diversity of America. \nRacial and cultural diversity remains a pillar of strength for our \ncountry and one of our greatest\n\n[[Page S3790]]\n\nnatural resources. Diversity on the bench helps ensure that the words \n``equal justice under law,'' inscribed in Vermont marble over the \nentrance to the Supreme Court, are a reality and that justice is \nrendered fairly and impartially. Judicial decisions should reflect \ninsight and experiences as varied as America's citizenry. A more \nrepresentative judiciary helps cultivate public confidence in the \njudiciary which strengthens the independence of our Federal courts.\n  There is still much work to be done. Out of the 875 seats on the \nFederal judiciary, there are only 5 active Asian-Pacific American \njudges on the Federal bench, less than 1 percent of all Federal judges. \nPresident Bush has nominated only two Asian-Pacific American candidates \nduring his 6 years in office, neither to a seat on a Federal circuit \ncourt. With outstanding lawyers like Dean Harold Koh of Yale, Professor \nGoodwin Liu of Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California \nat Berkeley, or attorneys Karen Narasaki, John Yang and Debra Yang, it \nis not as if there is a dearth of qualified candidates who would be \nuniversally endorsed.\n  Our Nation has highly qualified individuals of diverse heritages who \nwould help to unify our Nation while adding to the diversity of our \ncourts. I hope the President will send us more consensus nominees that \nreflect the rich diversity of our Nation.\n  I congratulate Judge Wu, and his family, on his confirmations today.\n\n\n                 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations\n\n  Mr. President, this emergency supplemental bill that we are debating \ntoday has been long seen as our best chance of extricating ourselves \nfrom the quagmire in Iraq. As one of only 23 Senators who opposed the \nauthorization of the use of military force, I have supported every \ncredible proposal that has come before this body to bring our troops \nhome.\n  The war in Iraq was not about September 11. It was not about al-\nQaida. It was not about making our Nation safer. While no one can prove \na negative, I believe the damage this war has done to our national \nsecurity, our national interest, and our international standing has \nbeen incalculable. When we had a chance to capture Osama bin Laden, the \nmaster mind of 9/11, we let him get away because the administration, \nthe Bush-Cheney administration, wanted to take our troops out of \nAfghanistan and send then to Iraq, a country that had absolutely \nnothing to do with 9/11. The injustices perpetrated at Abu Ghraib and \nGuantanamo have tarnished our national reputation and leadership, and \nthe way Iraq has become a rallying cry for religious extremists has \nmade the American people less safe.\n  For whatever misguided reasons, the President started a unilateral, \npreemptive war in Iraq which has cost us thousands of American lives \nand made us less safe. I think that historians will look back at this \nwar as one of the most costly, reckless mistakes made by any \nadministration in this history.\n  This supplemental contains another $96 billion to support U.S. \nmilitary operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. I supported the use of \nmilitary force to remove the Taliban from power, and I support the \ncontinued efforts of our military and NATO forces against the Taliban \nand al-Qaida in Afghanistan. But I did not, do not, and will not agree \nto the use of the U.S. military to continue putting our people in \nharm's way in the middle of a continuing civil war in Iraq.\n  This bill also contains money to help the people of Lebanon rebuild \nafter the devastating war between Hezbollah and Israel last year, aid \nfor refugees in Darfur, the Congo, Uganda, and other humanitarian \ncrises, and to prevent the spread of avian influenza. It contains \nresources to help Kosovo as it moves toward independence, for Liberia \nto rebuild after their civil war, and to support the peace process in \nNepal which finally has a chance to shed its feudal past.\n  It contains a provision I sponsored, with the support of both \nRepublicans and Democrats, to fix the illogical and unfair provisions \nin the Immigration and Naturalization Act that have been used to \nprevent victims of terrorist groups or members of groups who fought \nalongside the United States from admission as refugees or from \nobtaining asylum.\n  As the chairman of the Senate's Subcommittee on State, Foreign \nOperations, and Related Programs, I am also pleased to report the bill \nincludes, for the first time, benchmarks on a portion of the \nreconstruction assistance for Iraq. We are not going to continue to \npour billions of dollars into no-bid contracts that have been plagued \nby rampant fraud and shoddy workmanship. It is about time we put an end \nto the practice of handing out American taxpayers' money with no \nstrings attached. These benchmarks reflect what the Iraqi Government \nitself has pledged and what even President Bush acknowledged is \nnecessary if the Iraqi Government is to succeed in bringing stability \nto that country.\n  So there is much in this bill that I support, but despite that, I do \nnot support the funding to continue the military operations in Iraq, \nand I will vote against this bill unless it contains the provision \nrelating to the withdrawal of our forces, which is similar to \nlegislation which narrowly lost in the Senate last week. I voted for it \nthen, and I will vote for it again.\n  The withdrawal provision in this bill is not, in some respects, as \ndefinitive as what passed the House by the slimmest of margins last \nFriday. Like many others, I would have written it differently. I wanted \na deadline for commencement of the withdrawal of our forces but also \nfor completing it within a target date. I have cosponsored legislation \nthat contains such a deadline. But this provision represents a 90-\ndegree change of course from the President's policy of escalation in \nthe middle of a civil war. It is our best hope of obtaining the \nmajority of votes needed to begin that process. So I am confident that \nonce the withdrawal of our troops begins, there will be no turning \nback.\n  We have to remove our troops from the Iraq civil war. That argument \nhas been made eloquently, including by former senior military officers \nwhose credibility is unimpeachable. Retired LTG William Odom, in an op-\ned piece of February 11 in the Washington Post, said it better than I \never could. It is the only way the Iraqis will make the difficult \npolitical compromises that can save their country from further \ndestruction.\n  The President has threatened to veto this bill if the troop \nwithdrawal provision is included. That is not surprising for a White \nHouse that has stubbornly refused to change course even in the face of \ndwindling support from the American people whose sons and daughters are \ndying. For more than 4 years, President Bush, Vice President Cheney and \nformer Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, backed by a rubberstamp Congress, \nmade one incompetent decision after another, arrogantly insisting they \nknew best and dismissing anyone who so much as questioned their policy \nfor ``not supporting the troops.'' It has been reminiscent of the old \n``soft on communism'' and ``soft on drugs'' refrains that were used, \nand still are used, for political purposes to justify failed policies.\n  None of us should be intimidated by these worn out arguments. If they \nwant to show their support of the troops, they should do something \nabout our VA system. Fix up Walter Reed and fix up the other facilities \nwhere we are not giving proper help to our wounded soldiers when they \nreturn from Iraq. We Democrats want to support those troops, too, and \nnot just to be at the parades when they go over but to be there to help \nthem when they come back. If this administration wants to support the \ntroops, it should have given them the equipment, the training, and the \narmor they still don't get in a war that has lasted longer than World \nWar II. And they should take care of the wounded whose bodies, minds \nand lives have been shattered.\n  None of us should have confidence in a failed war effort that has \nalready wrought enormous toll in American blood, treasure, and \ncredibility, not after the fiasco this White House has wrought. It is \ntime for the Congress to act as the voice and the conscience of the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to urge my \ncolleagues to support the nomination of\n\n[[Page S3791]]\n\nJudge George H. Wu to be U.S. district judge for the Central District \nof California. Judge Wu currently serves as a judge on the Los Angeles \nSuperior Court, where he has presided since 1996, and before that was a \njudge on the Los Angeles municipal court from 1993 to 1996.\n  He came to those judicial positions with an excellent academic \nbackground--a bachelor's degree from Pamona College in 1972 and a law \ndegree from the University of Chicago in 1975. He has an outstanding \nrecord in the practice of law. He was assistant professor of law at the \nUniversity of Tennessee College of Law from 1979 to 1982. He was an \nAssistant U.S. Attorney in the civil division of the Central District \nof California office in Los Angeles from 1982 to 1989. He later served \nas Assistant Division Chief in the U.S. Attorney's Office from 1991 to \n1993. Judge Wu is very well qualified, rated so by the American Bar \nAssociation. They unanimously rated Judge Wu as ``well qualified.''\n\n  His nomination to the Federal bench is recognition of the \ncontributions of lawyers from the Southern California Chinese Lawyers \nAssociation, where he was a member from 1984 until the present time.\n  I recently spoke at the convention of lawyers from the Asian-Pacific \nAmerican Bar Association, who made the point to me that there ought to \nbe more representation, more diversity for judges with a background \nfrom Asia and specifically from China. There are not very many judges \nrepresenting that particular group. I think it is a good idea to have \ndiversity on the Federal bench among people from all walks of life, all \nbackgrounds, all national origins, all ethnic representations, and \napplaud his nomination from that point of view, in addition to the \nexcellent credentials which I have cited.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of his resume and \nbackground on two pages be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              George H.

A \n     hearing was held on his nomination on February 6 and the \n     Judiciary Committee favorably reported him on March 1.\n       Judge Wu is a highly qualified nominee with a distinguished \n     record.\n       In 1972, he earned his B.A. degree from Pomona College. In \n     1975, he earned his J.D. from the University of Chicago Law \n     School.\n       After law school, Judge Wu became an associate at the firm \n     of Latham & Watkins in Los Angeles from 1975 to 1976.\n       Judge Wu subsequently served as a judicial clerk for the \n     Honorable Stanley N. Barnes on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \n     the Ninth Circuit.\n       From 1979 to 1982 Judge Wu was an Assistant Professor of \n     Law at the University of Tennessee College of Law in \n     Knoxville, Tennessee, where his courses included civil \n     procedure, torts, and labor law.\n       Judge Wu served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Civil \n     Division of the Central District of California office in Los \n     Angeles from 1982 to 1989 and later served as Assistant \n     Division Chief from 1991 to 1993.\n       From 1989 to 1991, Judge Wu returned to private practice, \n     this time as an associate at LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby & MacRae in \n     Los Angeles.\n       In 1993, Governor Pete Wilson appointed Judge Wu to the Los \n     Angeles Municipal Court, which handles misdemeanor cases, \n     preliminary felony hearings, and small civil actions. In \n     1996, Governor Wilson elevated Judge Wu to the Los Angeles \n     Superior Court, which handles felony cases and larger civil \n     suits.\n       The American Bar Association unanimously rated Judge Wu \n     ``Well Qualified.''\n\n                       Attorney General Gonzales\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I note we are scheduled to vote on Judge Wu at 12:10. As \nranking member, I have the balance of the time until that period. I \nchoose to use it to comment briefly on a letter which I received \nyesterday from John M. Dowd, who is an attorney for Ms. Monica \nGoodling, who was counsel to Attorney General Gonzales and White House \nliaison. In this letter, Mr. Dowd asserts the basis for having Ms. \nGoodling claim her constitutional rights under the fifth amendment, and \nprivilege against self-incrimination, not to testify before the \nJudiciary Committee on our inquiry into the eight U.S. attorneys who \nwere asked to resign. Mr. Dowd makes the point emphatically that in \nasserting this privilege against self-incrimination, Ms. Goodling is \nnot saying she has done anything wrong and explicitly denies any \nwrongdoing but cites Supreme Court authority for the right of an \nindividual to claim the privilege against self-incrimination, even \nthose who are innocent, as well as those who might have something to \nhide. There is a firm assertion of her innocence by her attorney and \nher own affidavit.\n  I can understand the reasons for this claim of privilege and the \nreasons Ms. Goodling does not want to testify before the Judiciary \nCommittee. In Mr. Dowd's letter, he references some of my prior \nstatements and then says:\n\n       Senator Schumer has no less than five times characterized \n     the Department's testimony to date as ``false'' or ``a \n     falsehood,'' and concluded that there have been misleading \n     statement after misleading statement, deliberate \n     misstatements.\n\n  If a false statement has been made to a congressional committee, that \nconstitutes a crime under title 18 of the United States Code, section \n1001. That was the basis on which the No. 2 man in the Interior \nDepartment entered a guilty plea during the course of the past week. \nWhere there have already been characterizations, as cited by Mr. Dowd \nof Senator Schumer's statement that there are misleading statements \nwhich have been made, which I state is a crime, I can understand the \nsense of a potential witness in not wanting to be ensnared in that kind \nof proceeding where conclusions have already been reached by Senator \nSchumer who is in charge of the investigation.\n  Mr. Dowd's letter further goes on, citing comments which I had made \nearlier, ``that Senator Schumer is using the hearings''--this is Mr. \nDowd's statement--``hearings to promote his political party. That is \nnot a legitimate reason for the Judiciary Committee to conduct \nhearings.''\n  I have said in the Judiciary Committee hearings, in the presence of \nSenator Schumer, eyeball to eyeball, so to speak, that I thought there \nwas a conflict of interest. In concluding there was a conflict of \ninterest, I did not ask Senator Schumer to step aside. I said that was \nup to him.\n  But following the testimony of U.S. Attorney Iglesias, from New \nMexico, the very next day the Web site of the Democratic Senatorial \nCampaign had Senator Domenici's picture on it, urging his defeat in the \n2008 election. Then, shortly thereafter, there was a fundraising letter \nfrom the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to raise money, \nsaying the Democrats were elected to clean up Washington and this is an \nexample of what needs to be cleaned up.\n  Any of us may be subject to comment in a political situation. Senator \nSchumer has a right to make political hay out of whatever he chooses. \nBut I think it is inconsistent with leading an inquiry, and I can \nunderstand Ms. Goodling's decision not to testify in this context. I \nthink it is very unfortunate,\n\n[[Page S3792]]\n\nbecause it is very important for the Judiciary Committee to get to the \nbottom of what has happened with the request for eight U.S. attorneys \nto resign. There is a cloud over U.S. attorneys, and I think it has had \na distinctly chilling effect on all 93 U.S. attorneys, not knowing what \nwill come next.\n  It is generally agreed that the President of the United States has \nthe authority, standing, right to discharge U.S. attorneys for no \nreason at all. When President Clinton took office, in one fell swoop he \nreplaced 93 U.S. attorneys and no one raised any question. But I think \nnot if U.S. attorneys have been asked to resign and have been replaced \nfor an improper reason, for a bad reason. Suggestion has been made that \nthe U.S. attorney in San Diego, Ms. Lam, was replaced because she was \nhot on the trail of political operatives who may have been connected to \nformer Congressman Duke Cunningham, who is now serving an 8-year \nsentence; or the allegation has been made--it has not been \nsubstantiated but it has been made--that New Mexican U.S. Attorney \nIglesias was replaced for failure to prosecute a vote fraud case. An \nextended article in the New York Times a week ago Sunday gave extensive \nanalysis, which might lead to the conclusion that there was \njustification for Mr. Iglesias's resignation, or perhaps there was not. \nBut that is up to the Judiciary Committee to make a determination.\n  So it is unfortunate that you have a situation where witnesses are \nnot coming forward. It is my hope we would not rush to judgment on this \nmatter, that we would avoid conclusory statements, and that instead we \nwould wait until we find out what the facts are. If these U.S. \nattorneys were asked to resign for improper reasons, I will be among \nthe first to say so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is true Ms. Goodling's attorney has said \nthat she will take the fifth amendment. Now, as both a former defense \nattorney and a former prosecutor, I respect the right under our \nConstitution for anybody to take the fifth so they won't say something \nthat might incriminate them and bring about criminal charges against \nthem from their own statements. But it is a little bit odd that in a \nletter from Ms. Goodling's attorney, he speaks that she does not want \nto face the fate of Mr. Libby, or words to that effect. Scooter Libby \nwas convicted of perjury. He was convicted of obstruction of justice. \nWhile I realize many believe he is going to be pardoned, those are the \nreasons he was convicted.\n  I would have assumed that Ms. Goodling--who has been a very high-\nranking member of the Department of Justice, would come in and tell the \ntruth. If she takes the fifth amendment, that's a more difficult thing. \nWe won't hear from her. If she feels that what she has to tell us would \nsubject her to criminal prosecution, well, that raises some serious \nquestions. We hope that others will testify and that they will testify \nhonestly. We'll continue to ask people. But it is very, very difficult \nto get the facts when you have key members of the Bush-Cheney \nadministration taking the fifth.\n  Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I have any further time, I yield it back and I request \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof George H. Wu, of California, to be a U.S. District Judge for the \nCentral District of California. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden) and \nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, on a matter of concern and seriousness, in \nmy office this morning I had a newspaper clipping regarding Tony Snow. \nHe had a tumor removed and the cancer had not returned, and I wrote a \nletter and signed it. A few minutes later, my secretary brought in a \nnews clipping that Tony Snow's cancer has returned. I have known Tony \nSnow long before he became the spokesperson for the White House. My \nrelations with him have always been superb. To me he has always been \nvery fair. I have great respect for him and his family.\n  I want the record to reflect that I speak for everyone on this side \nof the aisle of our real concern. He has been a tremendously good \nrepresentative for the President. He does an outstanding job dealing \nwith some of the most serious issues any person could face. He has done \na wonderful job. I hope and pray that Tony Snow will again be able to \nwhip the cancer he has already whipped once.

So if \nthe Senator would withhold for a half an hour or so.\n  I would have to object to it. I do not personally object to it. I \nobject for the leadership until it has an opportunity to examine the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, may I raise a question. Will the \ndistinguished Senator be able to respond that I have submitted the \namendment, in other words, that I would not have to reappear to \nresubmit the amendment at that time or is the Senator in a position to \ngive us that assurance?\n  Mr. President, I have already submitted the amendment, and I am \nsubmitting an updated version of the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, is the Senator trying to perfect his own \namendment?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes, and I am attempting to file the amendment. It was \nrequested I appear in person to do so.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator is requesting to alter his \namendment, I have no objection to him doing so.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 680\n\n (Purpose: To provide for an increase in the Federal minimum wage, and \n                          for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, amendment No. 680 is at the desk, and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the pending amendment is set aside and the clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself, \n     Mr. Enzi, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Grassley, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 680.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for the benefit of the Members, as they \nremember, we passed the substance of this legislation, I believe, 97 to \n3. That is what is effectively the substance of this legislation. The \nHouse of Representatives has passed its own minimum wage. Because of \nthe parliamentary complexities, we were unable to get this issue \nresolved. The House has included a minimum wage provision in their \nproposal.\n  We offer this proposal, which is an expression of the Senate. It has \nbroad bipartisan support--Republican and Democrat. This will mean both \npieces of legislation--the supplemental--will have the minimum wage, \nand then the conferees will be able to make their judgment. But out of \nit will come an increase in the minimum wage. So it is in that spirit. \nI am delighted to debate the minimum wage, but I think we had a good \ndebate. We had, I think, close to 7 days' debate on it in the last few \nweeks, so I do not think that is necessary.\n  That is the current situation. That is the reason that legislation is \npending at this time. I very much appreciate the cooperation of the \nfloor managers in letting us get this at least up before the Senate at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment--is the distinguished Senator from North Carolina \nintending to manage this legislation?\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, the Senator from North Carolina is not \nintending to manage this side. Our manager is not here right now. I \nwould ask the Senator from Oregon if he would withhold setting the \ncurrent amendment aside. If he wishes to talk on an amendment, feel \nfree to, but at this time I would have to object to setting aside the \npending amendment.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would be happy to do that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 709\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the bipartisan \namendment I will be offering as soon as we have a manager on the other \nside to conduct business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in a few minutes I will offer a bipartisan \namendment to address the great needs of rural communities across this \ncountry. It is an amendment I will offer on behalf of myself, the \ndistinguished Senate majority leader, the chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee, the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee; my \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Smith; Senator Craig of Idaho, Senator \nDomenici, and a large additional group of Senators of both political \nparties who wish to see reauthorized the Secure Rural Schools and \nCommunity Self-Determination Act which is also known as the County \nPayments Program.\n\n  Mr. President and colleagues, without this amendment, there is a very \nreal prospect small counties in the rural West are going to fall into \nthe Pacific Ocean. These small counties are now standing on the abyss \nbecause without county payments funding, they simply are not going to \nbe able to pay for critical services such as law enforcement and rural \neducation.\n  In Oregon, the sheriff of Grants Pass told me without county payments \nfunding, he may have to call out the National Guard to protect public \nsafety. The county commissioners of Curry County report that without \ncounty payments funding, they may have no choice but to dissolve their \ncounty altogether. Local officials in Coos County, just at the prospect \nof losing county payments funds, have already released prisoners from \ntheir jails. Local communities in many other States face similar \nhardships.\n  Some Senators may not yet be fully aware of what the county payments \nlaw is about, so I am going to give a brief explanation of how the \nprogram has come to be.\n  County payments are not welfare, but they are a more than 100-year-\nold Federal obligation that goes back to the creation of the Federal \nforest system. The deal was if Federal policy prevented local \ncommunities from maximizing their revenues from their forests, the \nFederal Government would provide a partial payment to these local \ncommunities so they could pay for essential services such as law \nenforcement and schools.\n  As environmental values changed in the 1990s, and these payments grew \neven smaller, Senator Craig of Idaho and I wrote the Secure Rural \nSchools and Community Self-Determination Act. That law compensated \nthese rural communities for part of what they needed to pay for \nessential services. The act has worked extraordinarily well and expired \nat the end of last year.\n  In this amendment, our large bipartisan coalition--and I read only a \nnumber of the Senators from both political parties who are sponsoring \nthis amendment--our large group seeks to put in place a new updated \nlifeline to small rural counties. County payments would be extended for \n5 years and a new formula put in place to provide greater funding to \nmore than 80 percent of the counties in our country. The formula is \nbased on the current funding formula for county payments and the \nacreage of U.S. Forest Service and eligible Bureau of Land Management \nlands, along with a mechanism to focus support on those communities \nwhere there is greatest economic need.\n  In addition to the County Payments Program, this amendment also \nassists States with a similar program, the Payment in Lieu of Taxes \nProgram. This is a program which compensates States for the loss of tax \nrevenue from\n\n[[Page S3794]]\n\nFederal lands in their State. For the first time in modern history, \nthis program will receive full funding, and it will result in \nadditional support for each county with Federal land.\n  I note at this time, particularly, the exceptional work done by the \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, who, with \nSenator Bingaman and so many of our colleagues of both political \nparties, has been involved in these efforts. As a result of those \ncombined efforts, this amendment is paid for with all funding beyond \n2007 paid for by closing tax loopholes that have been identified by \nSenator Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.\n  This bipartisan amendment is supported by a diverse coalition, \nincluding the National Association of Counties, many labor \norganizations, and education advocates across the country. I urge the \nSenate this afternoon to recognize the exceptional urgency of this \nsituation and to support the bipartisan effort to reauthorize the \nCounty Payments Program and to strengthen the Payment in Lieu of Taxes \nProgram.\n  Rural communities across this country have been hit with a wrecking \nball. With the change in environmental values, we have seen many of \nthem, as they look to diversify their economies, reach out and find new \nindustries, yet they have still had great difficulty in paying for \nessential services.\n  As they try to meet these challenges--and I am committed, as chairman \nof the Forestry Subcommittee, to work on finding new economic \nopportunities for these rural communities--the country should not turn \nits back on rural America as it looks to come up with vibrant, new \neconomic prospects for the future.\n  These laws--the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination \nAct and the law that puts in place the Payment in Lieu of Taxes \nProgram--provide essential funding and will be a lifeline as these \ncommunities work to transition into additional areas that make sense \nfor resource-based economies.\n  Today, these small communities are asking the Senate to help them \nfrom falling into the abyss. The blow to rural communities, if they \nlose county payments, will be a crippling blow that, in my view, some \nrural counties simply will not be able to recover from.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, let us remember rural America as we \nconsider this legislation. I hope Senators of both political parties \nwill join the very large block of Democratic and Republican Senators \nwho offer this amendment today.\n  Mr. President, we are waiting for a manager on the other side. A \nnumber of colleagues, particularly the Senator from Illinois, has been \nvery gracious and very patient. I think what I wish to do is yield at \nthis time. When a manager comes, we will resume deliberations.\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois for his patience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields the floor.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, it is my understanding that at this point \nwe cannot set aside the pending amendment because we are waiting for a \nfloor manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator from \nIllinois, unanimous consent needs to be sought and granted in order to \nproceed while the Cochran amendment is pending.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, why don't I wait to find out whether it is \npossible for the Senator from Oregon to potentially call up his \namendment. If not, then what I would like to do is speak on my \namendment and find out when I can call up my amendment.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois has indicated he \nwould speak very briefly. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nIllinois could speak for his 5 minutes, and with the floor manager \ncoming on to the floor, that we could then turn to the county payments \nlegislation after the Senator from Illinois has spoken for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after I speak, \nif the Senator from Oregon is able to call up his amendment, I be able \nto call up my amendment as well thereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 664\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, toward the end of World War II, Norman \nRockwell created a cover for the Saturday Evening Post titled \n``Homecoming GI.'' It is a picture of a soldier returning from war. He \nhas a duffle bag clutched in his left hand. He is looking up at the \nback of a brick building with laundry hanging from the back porch. A \nwoman in an apron sees him with outstretched arms, and a young child \nraces down the stairs. Everyone sees that soldier--the neighbors' kids, \nthe man fixing the roof, faces from another window--and everyone \nwelcomes that soldier who has come home from war.\n  That is what our Nation did for the millions of servicemembers who \nreturned from the Atlantic and the Pacific. We watched them come home \nin waves. Some were just as strong as their first day in battle; others \nlimped. We saw them crowd Times Square. We saw them walk down Main \nStreet and sit on stoops. My grandfather, who fought in Patton's army, \nwould often speak about this time as America at its finest. That \nhomecoming didn't just happen; we were ready for it.\n  Long before the beaches of Normandy were stormed and the last battle \nwas fought, in 1943 President Roosevelt said:\n\n       Among many other things, we are, today, laying plans for \n     the return to civilian life of our gallant men and women in \n     the armed services. They must not be demobilized into an \n     environment of inflation and unemployment, to a place on a \n     bread line, or on a corner selling apples. We must, this \n     time, have plans ready instead of waiting to do a hasty, \n     inefficient, and ill-considered job at the last moment.\n\n  These are the words of wisdom that we ignore at our peril.\n  Today we have more than 631,000 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan \nand other parts of the global war on terror. According to a recent VA \nhealth care report, one-third--more than 205,000--have sought treatment \nat VA health facilities.\n  Even if the war in Iraq comes to an end soon--and I hope the Senate \ntakes action this week to accomplish that goal--the war will live on \nwith our servicemembers and their families for the rest of our lives.\n  Unfortunately, over the past month, we have all seen the disturbing \npictures of neglect at Walter Reed. We have read about bats and \nbureaucratic redtape at the VA. We have seen too many stories about our \nveterans who have been forgotten--not greeted by the Nation that asked \nthem to serve. The time has come for us to see this generation of \nveterans in all their valor and pain. We should provide them with a \nplan that is worthy of their courage and will help build back the \nmilitary they love.\n  That is what Senator McCaskill and I are trying to do with the \namendment we offer today.\n  First, we provide an additional $41 million to hire more caseworkers \nto assist servicemembers navigating the military's bureaucracy. The \nlast thing a wounded servicemember should have to face when they return \nhome is a front line of paperwork and delay. Right now, the caseworker-\nto-service-member ratio at Walter Reed is 1 to 50. Caseworkers help \nrecovering soldiers schedule appointments, take care of their everyday \nneeds, and fill out paperwork. Military caseworkers are overwhelmed. I \nunderstand the Army is reducing the caseworker-to-service-member ratio \nto 1 to 17, and I applaud this move. Our amendment would help the \nmilitary achieve this goal at all military hospitals.\n  Our amendment also provides $30 million for the Armed Forces to \ncreate an Internet-based system for servicemembers to submit their \npaperwork electronically. No longer will amputees and servicemembers in \nwheelchairs have to go to countless offices to fill out duplicative \nforms only to learn that the forms have been lost in Government \nbureaucracy.\n  We also need to do more to increase the number of mental health \ncrisis counselors available to assist recovering servicemembers and \ntheir families. Too many servicemembers are returning home with unmet \nmental health needs--stresses that are often experienced by their \nfamily members.\n\n[[Page S3795]]\n\nThat is why our amendment provides $17 million for more mental health \ncrisis counselors.\n  While we all praise how our country treated the servicemembers \nreturning from World War II, we must remember the lessons after \nVietnam. The landmark National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study was \ncongressionally mandated in 1983, 15 years after the height of that \nwar. The completed report showed the vast majority of Vietnam veterans \nhad successfully acclimated to postwar life.\n  We can't wait 15 years to plan and prepare for the readjustment needs \nof the servicemembers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. The average \nage of a servicemember deployed since September 11 is 27. The average \nage of our Guard and Reserves is 33. Sixty percent of those deployed \nhave family responsibilities, and 47 percent of those who have died \nhave left families. Mr. President, 160,000 women have been deployed, \nand 10 percent of those women are single mothers. These men and women \nare going to face real challenges in readjusting to normal life.\n\n  Our amendment would provide for a study by the National Academy of \nSciences of the mental health and readjustment needs of returning \nservicemembers. This study will assist the Department of Defense, the \nVeterans' Administration, and Congress in planning for the long-term \nneeds of our veterans.\n  Last week I met a woman at Walter Reed. She is one of the 160,000 \nwomen who have been deployed, and she suffers from post-traumatic \nstress disorder. Most of us associate PTSD with men in combat, but many \nof the women in theater face firsthand dangers in their combat support \nroles. Driving a truck in Baghdad is one of the most dangerous missions \naround, and it is considered a support role. Women are witnessing the \nhorrors of improvised explosive devices and the horrors of losing \nfellow servicemembers, and too many are experiencing the trauma of \nsexual harassment or abuse.\n  This young woman was very scared, and she trembled as we spoke. I \nasked her what we could do to help. She said that she could not handle \ngroup therapy sessions; she could only tolerate one-on-one sessions \nwith counselors. Her experience is shared by many women. Treatment for \nwomen with PTSD, especially sexual abuse victims, is very different \nfrom treatment for men.\n  That is why as part of our amendment we want to provide $15 million \nto address the unique mental health needs of women. This funding will \nensure the development and implementation of a women's treatment \nprogram for mental health conditions, including PTSD. It will also \ninclude the hiring and training of sexual abuse counselors so that the \nservicemembers who suffer from this trauma do not have to suffer in \nsilence. We can do this for the woman I met at Walter Reed and the \nthousands who suffer like her.\n  The total cost of our amendment is $103 million--less than one-tenth \nof 1 percent of the total cost of this bill. This is the least we can \ndo for our servicemembers recovering at Walter Reed and other military \nhospitals.\n  I am proud that Veterans For America has endorsed our amendment, and \nI ask unanimous consent that their letter of endorsement be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Veterans For America,\n\n                                                   March 27, 2007.\n       Dear Senator Obama: Veterans for America commends you for \n     fighting to ensure that the service-related needs are met of \n     the one and a half million men and women who have been \n     deployed in our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We commend you \n     for fighting to enact an amendment--based primarily on the \n     provisions of the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act (S. 713)--\n     to the current emergency supplemental appropriations bill (S. \n     965).\n       This is the most important piece of legislation offered \n     since the start of our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       Today's military is drastically different from any other we \n     have ever sent to war. Too many of our troops are returning \n     to a system that completely ignores their most urgent \n     service-related health and readjustment needs.\n       One fact is quite striking: of the tens of billions of \n     dollars spent to meet the needs of America's veterans, less \n     than one percent is spent on this generation.\n       We waited almost 15 years after the end of the Vietnam War \n     to examine the specific needs of my generation through the \n     National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study. We fought hard \n     for this study, and while we waited for its completion, tens \n     of thousands of lives were shattered.\n       We cannot wait that long this time. The study included in \n     your amendment will prevent us from failing thousands upon \n     thousands of our service members and veterans. We must stop \n     throwing money at a broken system that does not address the \n     most urgent unmet needs of today's service members and \n     veterans.\n       I also want to commend your efforts to recognize the \n     challenges faced by women service members and veterans. The \n     needs of women troops are being effectively ignored. This is \n     a national disgrace.\n       Again, you have my sincere thanks and the thanks of \n     millions of others who have proudly served our country.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Bobby Muller,\n\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this \namendment. At this point I turn the floor back to the Senator from \nOregon, Mr. Wyden, and I ask, if the floor managers are prepared, that \nI be able to call up this amendment after the Senator from Oregon does \nso with his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak to \nthe Obama amendment and then go back to regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I apologize. I should have allowed----\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if I could just clarify for all of us, \ncould you tell us what the current unanimous consent agreement has in \nit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment before the Senate is the \nCochran amendment. The Senator from Illinois had asked unanimous \nconsent to address the Senate for 5 minutes, and then when he \ncompleted, to yield back to Senator Wyden to continue to discuss his \namendment. There was no objection. Further, after the Wyden amendment \nwas brought up, the next amendment to be offered would be that of the \nSenator from Illinois, Mr. Obama. There was no objection.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Missouri \nis recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 664\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the \namendment that will be offered by Senator Obama. Our amendment takes \npart of the legislation we have introduced, the Dignity for the Wounded \nWarriors Act, and moves it to the front of the line.\n  The question which has to be asked is, Why? Why is it important that \nthis go into this bill at this time? There is a lot of talk about what \nshould and shouldn't go into the supplemental. I think it is important \nwe realize if we don't act immediately to begin to take the kind of \ncare of our wounded they need to have, that they should have, that we \nare morally bound to give them, then we shouldn't be passing any more \nsupplemental funding for any more activities in this war.\n  It is of primary importance to us that we take care of the men and \nwomen who have been wounded, who have given more than most Americans \nwill ever give as it relates to this conflict in the Middle East.\n  I have to say, if you step back and look at this problem, it is not \njust the active military hospitals that this amendment deals with, but \nit is the entire system of medical care for our wounded and for our \nveterans.\n  I was struck last week when a report came out on all the veterans \nfacilities around the country. This was an internal report done by the \nVeterans' Administration but contained in that report was a startling \nrevelation. In that report they found there was a bat infestation in a \nveterans hospital in the State of the Senator from Oregon.\n  Now, one would think that if you found a bat infestation in a \nhospital alarms would go off, lights would signal, and the head of that \nhospital would step up and say: I failed. Oh, no. The head of that \nhospital said the bats had been helpful to the insect population. \nUnderstand that with this particular species of bat, there is more \nbacteria contained in an ounce of the droppings from this animal than \nany other species of bat. Microbiologists\n\n[[Page S3796]]\n\nyearn to study these droppings because of all of the bacteria that is \ncontained in them.\n  Something is terribly wrong when we have a veterans hospital in this \ncountry that is putting up with an infestation of bats, and if we don't \nhave it in us to fix this medical facility and all others like it in \nthis country, then shame on us. Shame on our Nation that we can't do \nwhat we must do to take care of those who have taken care of us.\n  All the rhetoric about ``support the troops''--forget about it if we \ncan't do basic medical care for those who are coming home who are \nwounded. We specifically deal with that in our amendment, with the \nadditional funds in this supplemental that we have added to the \nPresident's budget to care for our veterans and veterans facilities.\n  There is no job we have here that is more important. I hope my \ncolleagues will support this amendment and the addition of about $1.7 \nbillion in funding to the supplemental for veterans care. They are both \nimportant. They are both moral imperatives. It is time we make that \nphrase--``support our troops''--more than a political phrase.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Oregon, or to go back to \nregular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment, and I call up my bipartisan amendment on county \npayments and the payment in lieu of taxes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I do not \nintend to object but for the purpose of asking if there would be any \nobjection to my offering an amendment on behalf of the Senator from \nIndiana, Mr. Lugar, and then yielding to the Senator. We wouldn't have \nany debate, but we would just offer this amendment so it would be \npending in the regular order.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I would be happy to proceed, but I recognize the manager \non our side.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if I could just clarify, is it amendment \nNo. 690?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It is amendment No. 690.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Then we would not object.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 690\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment on behalf \nof the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Lugar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for Mr. Lugar, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 690.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 690\n\n(Purpose: To provide that, of the funds appropriated by this Act under \n   the headings ``diplomatic and consular programs'' and ``Economic \n    Support Fund'' (except for the Community Action Program), up to \n $50,000,000 may be made available to support and maintain a civilian \n                             reserve corps)\n\n       On page 56, after line 18, insert the following:\n\n\n                         CIVILIAN RESERVE CORPS\n\n       Sec. 1713. Of the funds appropriated by this Act under the \n     headings ``diplomatic and consular programs'' and ``Economic \n     Support Fund'' (except for the Community Action Program), up \n     to $50,000,000 may be made available to support and maintain \n     a civilian reserve corps. Funds made available under this \n     section shall be subject to the regular notification \n     procedures of the Committees on Appropriations.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 709\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and to call up our bipartisan amendment on County \nPayments and the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden], for himself, Mr. Reid, \n     Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Smith, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n     Domenici, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Craig, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \n     Tester, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Bennett, and Ms. Murkowski, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 709.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, a great many Senators of both political \nparties have signed on as cosponsors of this legislation: the \ndistinguished Senate majority leader; the chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee, Chairman Baucus; chairman of the Energy Committee, \nSenator Bingaman; Senators Smith, Domenici, Craig, Stevens, Bennett, \nCantwell, Boxer, Murray, Crapo, Tester, and Murkowski. A great many \nSenators have agreed to be cosponsors.\n  My understanding is that, perhaps, in a few minutes the Senate is \ngoing to be given a choice of two approaches on how to deal with this \nissue: the approach that I and a large bipartisan group of Senators are \noffering this afternoon or an approach that will be offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina, our colleague, Senator Burr, \nwhich, in my view, is very restrictive and, unfortunately, it is not in \nline with what Senator Craig and I sought to do on a bipartisan basis \nback in 2000.\n  Our law that was enacted at that time was called the Secure Rural \nSchools and Community Self-Determination Act. Unfortunately, as I \nunderstand it, the proposal offered by the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Carolina would, for example, make it very difficult for local law \nenforcement to get some of these essential dollars that have been \nabsolutely critical to public safety for all these years.\n  My view is that, under our bipartisan proposal, local law enforcement \nwould have at least a fair measure of the resources they need to fight \nmethamphetamine in local communities across the country. Our colleague \nfrom North Carolina, in his approach, would not make that possible.\n  So I hope that, as colleagues consider this debate, they will vote in \nfavor of the amendment I offer this afternoon, on behalf of the large \ngroup of Senators of both political parties who have been intimately \ninvolved in this program for many years.\n  Our amendment is fully paid for through the good work of the chairman \nof the Senate Finance Committee, and I hope our colleagues will vote \nfor our amendment and will reject the amendment of the Senator from \nNorth Carolina, which is much more restrictive and, unfortunately, \nforgets the second part of the legislation that is so vital to rural \ncommunities and that is law enforcement and roads and other essential \nservices.\n  I had a chance to speak on this earlier, so I will be brief. Other \ncolleagues would like to speak as well. The reality in rural America \nand the rural West is that communities are about to fall off a \nfinancial cliff.\n  They are going to lose these essential funds that have been part of a \nFederal obligation for more than a hundred years. It is not a welfare \nprogram. It is not some kind of a handout that goes to rural \ncommunities in the West. These are communities where the Federal \nGovernment owns most of the land. The local community is not allowed to \nmaximize its revenues on those lands because the Federal Government has \nessentially said we are not going to treat them as private property, \nwhere you generate a sale and revenue and you pay for essential \nservices.\n  So the Federal Government entered into an agreement more than a \nhundred years ago to provide compensation to those local communities \nwhere the Federal Government owned most of the land. What our \nbipartisan group wants to do is update and modernize that obligation \nthat was incurred more than a hundred years ago when the Federal forest \nsystem was established.\n  Our amendment would resolve the budget crisis that is confronting \nrural communities by fully funding the County Payments Program for \n2007, and then we set in place a formula that was negotiated for many \nmonths through a large group of Senators.\n  I have the chart indicating the new formula that has been put into \nplace. It makes it very clear that Senators understand this program, \nbecause of the\n\n[[Page S3797]]\n\nwill of this body, ought to be modernized. That is what we have done. \nBut in addition to that effort, we have made sure the Payment in Lieu \nof Taxes Program, which compensates States for the loss of tax revenue \nfrom Federal lands in that State, would receive support as well. And \nevery county in our country with Federal land would benefit from this \nparticular program. The emergency funding is what gets us over the \nfirst year of the program; it is a 5-year program. Senator Baucus has \nbeen willing because he feels strongly about making sure when the \nFederal Government steps in and goes to bat for rural communities, that \nit will be fully paid for. On the Senate Finance Committee, because of \nChairman Baucus's leadership, we are going to raise those funds by \nclosing tax loopholes.\n  I know my friend from North Carolina is going so speak in a moment. I \nwish to note, again, a number of colleagues on the other side of the \naisle who are supporting this: Senators Smith, Domenici, Craig, Crapo, \nStevens, Bennett, and Murkowski. They have all said that this amendment \nis the way to go if you want to stand up for rural communities. But if \nyou want to make a break with 100 years' worth of history and not even \ngive rural communities the opportunity to get support, as they \nhistorically have, for local law enforcement, then Senators can vote \nfor the amendment offered by our colleague from North Carolina, Senator \nBurr. I hope my colleagues will not do that.\n\n  We are going to have two votes. One will be on the amendment I \noffered with that large bipartisan group of Senators I listed. I hope \nSenators will vote in favor of that amendment.\n  There will be another amendment offered by the Senator from North \nCarolina. For the reasons I have described this afternoon, I hope \nSenators will vote against that. Keep in mind that under the amendment \noffered by the Senator from North Carolina, if you have people who are \nconcerned about local law enforcement they are not, under the amendment \nof the Senator from North Carolina, going to be able to get support as \nit relates to law enforcement--the needed support to fight meth and to \nbe able to protect public safety in their communities. That is why the \nlarge coalition I have described this afternoon is in favor of what I \nam proposing.\n  The Senator from North Carolina has come to the floor. I have \nenormous respect for him. He is going to be the ranking member on the \nsubcommittee. We don't happen to see eye to eye on this issue. I point \nout that the predecessor of the Senator from North Carolina, Senator \nCraig, is a cosponsor of this amendment. He remembers the history from \nback in 2000, when we came together. It is my intent to allow the \nSenator from North Carolina time to offer his amendment as well, and \nthen at that time I would like to respond to what the distinguished \nSenator from North Carolina said about his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, is it possible for the Senator from Oregon \nto yield to me briefly so I could call up an amendment? I will call it \nup, would not discuss it and it can then be set aside and we can \nimmediately go to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 664\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so I may call up amendment No. 664.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Obama], for himself, Mrs. \n     McCaskill, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Cantwell, \n     Mr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Casey, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. \n     Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 664.\n\n  Mr. OBAMA.

I ask unanimous consent that Senators Casey, Baucus, and \nDurbin be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set the pending \namendment aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 709\n\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to resume \nconsideration of the Wyden amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I have deep respect for my colleague, \nSenator Wyden. We worked together in the House. We will work together \nin the Senate. As he said, this is a small disagreement we have because \nI believe when you have a bill that says this money is going to be used \nfor schools and communities, we should make a commitment that this \nmoney in fact does go to our Nation's schools. Today, through my \namendment, we have an opportunity to make an obligation to education.\n  Seventy percent of our children in high school today graduate on \ntime. In North Carolina it is 68 percent. That is 32 percent of \nstudents who don't graduate on time. We hear on the floor of this \ninstitution state all the time that there's a need to make a commitment \nto education. And I believe we need to make a commitment to it.\n  I believe we need to make a commitment on this bill. This program was \nset to sunset this year. That means the Congress, in the past, set this \nprogram to expire, to go away; that the Federal Government had met its \nobligation. I don't disagree with the Senators from Oregon, Senator \nWyden and Senator Smith, who have both been instrumental on this. North \nCarolina is a beneficiary. We have a tremendous amount of public land. \nI think it should continue. But at a time that we are required to \nprioritize where we make our investment, I believe we would help every \ncommunity by saying 80 percent of the new money--not the money we were \nusing up until this point but the almost $500 million of additional \nmoney per year we are going to pump into this program, all new money, \nthat 80 percent of it ought to be used for our schools. It ought to be \nused for public education and ought to be there to support school \nconstruction, K through 12, No Child Left Behind. It ought to focus on \nhigh school graduation.\n  We should take America's high school children from 70 percent \ngraduation and drive it to 100 percent graduation. I heard the argument \nthis was about economic development, about communities, about law \nenforcement. If you solve education, you lessen the need for law \nenforcement. The reason we need so many cops on the beat today, that we \nneed more schools, is because our children don't have the skills to \ncompete in the job market. So, yes, we can add policemen and make all \nFederal dollars open for every community to decide how they use them, \nbut let me assure you, if we don't educate our children, no matter how \nmuch money is pumped into those communities, they will have cancer in \nthem.\n  What am I doing? It is very simple. I am going to offer an amendment \nthat requires 80 to 85 percent of the new dollars to be devoted solely \nto education. That way every community that is the beneficiary of this \nmoney--Oregon, with millions of dollars, and North Carolina, with the \nseveral million dollars it gets. It is not enough to solve the \neducation problem, but it shows a commitment on our part to make sure \nwe are willing to contribute the Federal dollars that are available to \nbegin to address this cancer our kids have succumbed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 716 to Amendment No. 709\n\n  At this time, Madam President, I send to the desk a second-degree \namendment to the Wyden amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Burr] proposes \n     amendment numbered 716 to amendment No. 709.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require that payments to eligible States and eligible \n               counties only be used for public schools)\n\n       Beginning on page 13, strike line 22 and all that follows \n     through page 17, line 18, and insert the following:\n       ``(2) Expenditure purposes.--Subject to subsection (d), \n     payments received by a State under subsection (a) and \n     distributed to eligible counties shall be expended only for \n     public schools of the eligible county.\n       ``(d) Expenditure Rules for Eligible Counties.--\n       ``(1) Allocations.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (3)(B), \n     if an eligible county elects to receive its share of the \n     State payment or the county payment, not less than 80 \n     percent, but not more than 85 percent, of the funds shall be \n     expended only for public schools of the eligible county.\n       ``(B) Election as to use of balance.--Except as provided in \n     subparagraph (C), an eligible county shall elect to do 1 or \n     more of the following with the balance of any funds not \n     expended pursuant to subparagraph (A):\n       ``(i) Reserve any portion of the balance for projects in \n     accordance with title II.\n       ``(ii) Reserve not more than 7 percent of the total share \n     for the eligible county of the State payment or the county \n     payment for projects in accordance with title III.\n       ``(iii) Return the portion of the balance not reserved \n     under clauses (i) and (ii) to the Treasury of the United \n     States.\n       ``(C) Counties with modest distributions.--In the case of \n     each eligible county to which more than $100,000, but less \n     than $350,000, is distributed for any fiscal year pursuant to \n     either or both of paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)(B) of subsection \n     (a), the eligible county, with respect to the balance of any \n     funds not expended pursuant to subparagraph (A) for that \n     fiscal year, shall--\n       ``(i) reserve any portion of the balance for--\n\n       ``(I) carrying out projects under title II;\n       ``(II) carrying out projects under title III; or\n       ``(III) a combination of the purposes described in \n     subclauses (I) and (II); or\n\n       ``(ii) return the portion of the balance not reserved under \n     clause (i) to the Treasury of the United States.\n       ``(2) Distribution of funds.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Funds reserved by an eligible county \n     under subparagraph (B)(i) or (C)(i)(I) of paragraph (1) shall \n     be deposited in a special account in the Treasury of the \n     United States.\n       ``(B) Availability.--Amounts deposited under subparagraph \n     (A) shall--\n       ``(i) be available for expenditure by the Secretary \n     concerned, without further appropriation; and\n       ``(ii) remain available until expended in accordance with \n     title II.\n       ``(3) Election.--\n       ``(A) Notification.--\n       ``(i) In general.--An eligible county shall notify the \n     Secretary concerned of an election by the eligible county \n     under this subsection not later than September 30 of each \n     fiscal year.\n       ``(ii) Failure to elect.--Except as provided in \n     subparagraph (B), if the eligible county fails to make an \n     election by the date specified in clause (i), the eligible \n     county shall--\n\n       ``(I) be considered to have elected to expend 85 percent of \n     the funds in accordance with paragraph (1)(A); and\n       ``(II) return the balance to the Treasury of the United \n     States.\n\n       ``(B) Counties with minor distributions.--In the case of \n     each eligible county to which less than $100,000 is \n     distributed for any fiscal\n\n[[Page S3799]]\n\n     year pursuant to either or both of paragraphs (1)(B) and \n     (2)(B) of subsection (a), the eligible county may elect to \n     expend all the funds for public schools in the eligible \n     county.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, it is very simple. The question before us, \nwhether it is a side-by-side we decide on or a second-degree amendment, \nis: Are we going to commit to using part of these Federal dollars that \nStates deserve--because it is in many cases in lieu of Federal payments \nfor a tax--are we going to commit those to local school systems to \neducate our children? That is the decision we will have.\n  At the end of the day, I am going to support Wyden-Reid-Baucus-\nBingaman, and however many more people go on the chart before we \nactually have a vote, but before that vote we will have a decision as \nto whether we are going to make a commitment to education in this \ncountry, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of that.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I see the distinguished Senator from \nArizona is here, but I wish to briefly respond to the comments of \nSenator Burr.\n  When we do vote, again I would highlight that I hope Senators, on a \nbipartisan basis, for the amendment I am offering on behalf of the \nlarge group that includes Senator Smith, Senator Domenici, Senator \nCraig, Senator Murkowski, and a great many Senators on the other side, \nvirtually every Democrat, will reject the Burr amendment. Here is the \ndifference, and it is striking.\n  The Burr amendment, offered by our distinguished colleague from North \nCarolina, sets in place a Federal mandate. It is a one-size-fits-all \napproach that somehow we ought to decide here in Washington, DC what \nhappens in these local communities. What I have decided, with our \nbipartisan coalition, is we ought to have an approach that gives local \ncommunities a lot of flexibility and a lot of freedom to design \napproaches that are tailor made to their area.\n  I have mentioned law enforcement, for example, as one critical area a \nlocal community might want to support under the approach I offer with \nour bipartisan group but which cannot be offered under the approach of \nthe distinguished Senator from North Carolina, and there would be other \nexamples as well.\n  For example, if a community was concerned about its roads and was \ntroubled about the prospect that their roads were dangerous, so that, \nfor example, in the snowy seasons it would be treacherous for kids to \nget to school, under our amendment local communities would have the \nflexibility to support some of that upkeep for local roads. I have been \ntold in communities such as Fossil, in my home State, they don't think \nthey even have a roads program without the county payments legislation. \nSo there are stark differences between the approach offered by the \nSenator from North Carolina and the bipartisan approach I am offering \ntoday with many of our colleagues.\n  At the end of the day, the difference is the Senator from North \nCarolina is offering a Federal mandate which ties the hands of local \ncommunities and local school districts, and I gather is one of the \nreasons some educational advocates have already come out against the \namendment of the Senator from North Carolina.\n  I hope our colleagues will support the approach we are advocating \ntoday which gives local communities real flexibility, ensures that the \nFederal Government is keeping its obligation--its more than 100-year \nobligation--to these rural communities, but updates it, as we have \nsought to do with this payment in lieu of taxes provision in our \namendment and with the new formula--a formula, as the distinguished \nSenator from Washington, the manager of the legislation, mentioned was \narrived at only through some very difficult negotiations with many \nSenators involved.\n  So when Senators vote in a few minutes, I hope they will support the \namendment I am offering today, with the large group of bipartisan \nsponsors, and reject the amendment offered by the Senator from North \nCarolina which, in my view, is a Federal mandate that greatly limits \nthe ability to make the best use of these county payments dollars.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today in support of Senator \nWyden's amendment to the emergency supplemental appropriations bill \nthat would provide critical funding for a multiyear extension of the \nSecure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act and fully \nfund the Payment in Lieu of Taxes, PILT, Program.\n  This amendment provides nearly $5 billion for rural schools, counties \nand communities through 2012--crucial to California's rural counties, \nwhich face a devastating loss in Federal funding.\n  Last Thursday, March 22, my colleagues and I on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee approved the inclusion of $425 million in \nemergency appropriations to fund the Secure Rural Schools program for 1 \nyear in the emergency supplemental--helping to immediately address the \npending budget crisis confronting over 700 counties in 39 States, \nincluding my State of California.\n  This emergency funding adds $425 million to the $100 million \navailable from the 25 percent of receipts that compensate counties for \nreductions in timber harvest on public lands.\n  However, our counties should not have to rely on emergency funding \nyear after year and be faced with such uncertainty.\n  We must provide our rural counties with a stable funding stream so \nthat they are not in the same dire situation next year and can plan for \nthe future.\n  This amendment, supported by the National Association of County \nOfficials, the National Forest Counties and Schools Coalition, and the \nNational Education Association, would maintain a safety net for \ncounties while gliding down funding in a predictable manner so counties \ncan fiscally prepare for the future.\n  Specifically, this amendment would provide $2.8 billion in funding \nover 5 years for a multiyear extension of the Secure Rural Schools \nProgram. It would also provide $1.9 billion to fund the Payment in Lieu \nof Taxes, PILT, Program for 5 years, from 2008 through 2012. This \nprogram compensates States for the loss of tax revenue from Federal \nlands in the State. It would also provide funding beyond fiscal year \n2007 to be fully paid for by a combination of tax offsets.\n  In addition, it would provide California, Oregon, and Washington with \nadditional transition funding in the early years to minimize the \neffects of the overall decline of the total authorization level to $379 \nmillion in 2011 under the Secure Rural Schools Program. The additional \ntransition funding for these States--California, Oregon, and \nWashington--would also help counties with adjusting to the new funding \nformula under the Secure Rural Schools Program.\n  The new funding formula would be based on the current formula of \nhistorical payments and the current acreage of U.S. Forest Service and \neligible Bureau of Land Management lands, along with mechanism to focus \nsupport on those communities in greatest economic need.\n  Under this amendment, California's counties would receive $283 \nmillion in funding from fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2011 from the \nSecure Rural Schools Program. Without this funding, mostly rural \nCalifornia counties would face sudden, catastrophic cuts. Counties in \nCalifornia would lose $57 million this year alone if the Secure Rural \nSchools Program is not extended.\n  Last year, California's counties received $69 million to fund their \nschools and road and forest improvement projects from this program. The \nloss of these Federal funds would have a devastating impact on \nCalifornia's rural counties, resulting in school closures, teacher \nlayoffs, and some schools could even face bankruptcy or State takeover. \nFurthermore, essential road and forest improvement projects would be \njeopardized.\n  For example, Trinity County received almost $8 million in funding, \nand all school districts in the county could be faced with bankruptcy \nand would have to eliminate the school curriculum, cut one full-time \nschool nurse--leaving one nurse to cover the entire 4,000-square-mile \ncounty--and cut music and arts programs.\n  Plumas County, which received $7.5 million, would have to lay off \nteachers--resulting in increased class sizes in grades K through 12--\neliminate all school librarians, and close school cafeterias.\n\n[[Page S3800]]\n\n  Lassen County received $4 million, and over half of the 10 school \ndistricts in the county would be faced with budget insolvency--\nresulting in school libraries being closed, teacher layoffs, the \nelimination of school-based health services, and the reduction of \nteacher training and student textbooks.\n  We simply cannot allow this to happen.\n  It is critical that we provide immediate and long-term funding to our \nrural counties that depend on the Secure Rural Schools Program for \ntheir livelihood.\n  This amendment would also fund the Payment in Lieu of Taxes, PILT, \nProgram, providing $1.9 billion over 5 years.\n  This means California would receive an estimated $11 million or more \nin additional dollars annually on top of the $21 million the State \ncurrently receives from the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program.\n  In recognition of the reality that Federal lands pay no local \nproperty taxes, PILT compensates counties for the Federal lands within \ntheir borders. PILT compensation is especially important for rural \ncounties with heavy concentrations of Federal lands that reduce their \navailable tax base.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so we can ensure that \nour Nation's rural counties continue to receive much needed resources \nto serve their schools and communities.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I rise today in support of the funding \nprovided in the supplemental appropriations legislation for \ncontinuation of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\nDetermination Act, and the 5-year reauthorization of the program \nthrough the Wyden amendment. Counties and school districts across this \ncountry are poised to cut much needed jobs and services without this \ncontinuation. Many of us have heard the urgent calls from constituents. \nThe message has been clear--``Please help us.'' And, I'm proud to \nanswer that call by supporting this reauthorization.\n  For example, Idaho's Fremont County is one of the counties across the \nState and Nation that have been faced with a dire situation. Fremont \nCounty is looking at not only eliminating road and bridge services but \nalso students would be impacted by a loss of nursing services for \nstudents, playground and safety equipment at elementary schools, \nlibrary books, and continuing education instructions. Counties across \nIdaho face similar difficult emergency situations.\n  Ideally, management of our forested land would generate the revenue \nnecessary to assist with services in cash-strapped communities with \nlarge amounts of federally owned land. Unfortunately, that just hasn't \nbeen the case for some time. We must continue to work to remove \nimpediments to forest health and productivity. However, in the \nmeantime, Congress must commit the resources necessary to ensure that \nrural communities across this country do not have to forgo road \nmaintenance, close libraries, and make cuts to children's education. \nAnything less is unacceptable.\n  The legislation before us today would respond by fully funding PILT \nthrough 2012 reauthorizing Secure Rural Schools through 2011, \nreauthorizing the valuable Resource Advisory Committees, RACs, and \nphasing down the payments over time. I urge other Senators to join me \nin supporting this amendment that fulfills the responsibility to these \ncommunities that shoulder the local cost of the public lands we all \nenjoy.\n  Thank you for the opportunity to share a few words.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for \noffering this amendment.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Salazar be \nallowed to speak for 3 minutes on the pending amendment, and that \nSenator McCain, who has been waiting, follow Senator Salazar with his \ncomments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I thank my good friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona, and I thank Senator Murray and \nSenator Wyden as well.\n  I wish to make two quick points in support of the amendment Senator \nWyden and our colleagues have brought to the Senate floor today.\n  The reality of the West in America is so much of our lands are owned \nby the Federal Government. We have about a third of the entire State of \nColorado--and it is a big State, but it is about a third of that \nState--that is owned by the Federal Government. In some of those \ncounties in my State, 95 to 98 percent of the lands is owned by the \nFederal Government as well. So they have been dependent on payments in \nlieu of taxes in order for them to be able to pay the expenses of their \ngovernment.\n  Unfortunately, what has happened over many years in the past is there \nhas not been the full funding of the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program. \nThe consequence of that is some of these small rural counties in my \nState of Colorado have not had the financial wherewithal to be able to \nmove forward with the functioning of their government. I am hopeful the \nbipartisan coalition Senator Wyden has put together will help us move \nforward in the full funding of the bill.\n  Secondly, I wish to make a quick comment about the Secure Rural \nSchools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000. I fully support \nthat part of this legislation. I know the importance of funding for \nthose rural school districts. The rural school district I grew up in \nwould receive about one-half of the funding that is being spent in \nother school districts in the metropolitan areas. What this funding \nwill do is help equalize the amount of funding we are putting into \nequal education opportunity for all people, so it doesn't matter \nwhether you come from a wealthy urban area or you come from one of the \npoorest, most rural, remote areas, there will be that funding \nassistance so everyone in America has an equal educational opportunity.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor again, thanking my colleagues and \nSenator McCain for yielding to me first.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe Senator from Arizona, the Senator from Virginia be recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment which \nwe will be voting on at 5 p.m. that would, according to, I believe, the \nunanimous consent agreement, strike the language in this bill calling \nfor a withdrawal of American forces from Iraq. These same provisions \nwere rejected by the Senate 2 weeks ago by a 48-to-50 vote. Now here we \nare debating the same provisions that have the same serious problems. I \nhope they will be rejected again by the same, if not a larger, margin. \nSupporters of this provision say they want a date certain for a U.S. \nwithdrawal from Iraq, but what they have offered us is more accurately \ndescribed as a date certain for surrender--a date certain for \nsurrender--with grave consequences for the future of Iraq, the \nstability of the Middle East, and the security of Americans at home and \nabroad. And they offer it just as the situation in Iraq, though still \nfraught with difficult challenges, is beginning to improve.\n  The new developments argue for more effort in Iraq rather than the \nwithdrawal advocated by this bill's sponsors. As my colleagues know, I \nhave been critical of the conduct of this war since 2003, and I very \nmuch regret that only now, 4 years into the conflict, are we beginning \nto implement the kind of strategy that was necessary from the start: a \ntraditional counterinsurgency strategy that emphasizes protection of \nthe population, economic development, and political progress, all with \ntroop levels appropriate for the mission.\n  We are seeing today the emergence of precisely such a strategy. I \nwould emphasize this point: This new plan is not ``stay the course.'' \nWe are not staying the course in Iraq and I would not support the \nstatus quo any more than I have over the past 4 years. Nor have we\n\n[[Page S3801]]\n\nmerely deployed a new commander, however capable, and additional \nforces. America is engaged today in a fundamentally new strategy, a new \napproach to the war, an approach that is already showing encouraging \nsigns that it might succeed.\n  Until now, U.S. forces did not attempt to defeat the insurgency and \nthe terrorists, protect the population, and end the violence so \npolitical and economic progress could occur. Most American troops spent \ntheir days on large forward-operating bases making forays out into \nhostile territory in which they were subject to ambush. Today, U.S. \ntroops, along with Iraqi forces, are out of the FOBs and living in \nsmall outposts. Today, U.S. forces are operating throughout Baghdad, \neven in Shiite strongholds such as Sadr City, Sunni areas such as \nMansoor, and mixed districts such as Rashid. As of March 15, 24 joint \nsecurity stations were operational, with many more planned. American \nforces in these stations are visible every day, living among the \npopulation, building confidence that we--and not the terrorists--will \nprevail. Contrary to some predictions, this has not increased U.S. \ncasualties. And, not surprisingly, our presence has resulted in a \ndramatic increase in actionable intelligence about terrorists.\n  You might not know it from reading newspapers or watching the evening \nnews, but in Iraq today there are real signs the new strategy is \nworking. I wish to spend a few moments outlining some of this progress, \nnot to paint an overly rosy scenario but, rather, to correct what has \nbecome an almost single-minded focus in the Congress on the prospects \nof defeat. The debate in Congress has an ``Alice in Wonderland'' \nquality about it: We are debating efforts to micromanage a conflict \nbased on what the conditions were 3 months ago, not on what the reality \nis today. Conditions have changed in Iraq. The Baghdad security plan--\nthe ``surge''--is working far better than even the most optimistic \nsupporter had predicted. The progress is tangible in many key areas \ndespite the fact only 40 percent of the planned forces are in Iraq.\n  Allow me to review some specifics.\n  In Baghdad, the military has reported an increase in real-time, \nactionable intelligence provided to U.S. and Iraqi forces by a newly \nconfident population. Prime Minister Maliki, who prevented U.S. troops \nfrom conducting certain Baghdad operations last year, has given the \ngreen light to American incursions throughout the city, including \nShiite strongholds. All of the Iraqi army battalions called for under \nthe plan have arrived, many at or above 75 percent of their programmed \nmanning levels. Bomb attacks and murders are down since the surge \nbegan. Civilians killed in Baghdad numbered 1,222 in December, 954 in \nJanuary, and fell to 494 in February. There are reports of Sunni and \nShia moving back into neighborhoods from which they had fled constant \nand horrific violence. Markets that have been subject to horrific car \nbombings have been turned into pedestrian malls that facilitate \ncommerce and thwart terrorists.\n  Moqtada al-Sadr has fled, possibly to Iran, and has ordered his \nfollowers not to oppose the new Baghdad security plan. The Madhi army, \npurportedly dedicated to the expulsion of Americans from Iraq, does not \ntoday openly challenge either U.S. or Iraqi forces. American troops are \nengaged in reconstruction efforts in Saudi City, with the cooperation \nof the local mayor. In the western part of Baghdad, our troops are \nestablishing new outposts in areas--these areas here--that have been \nconduits for al-Qaida in Iraq penetration into the capital city, and \nhave begun to clear these areas of terrorists and insurgents. The net \nresult of all of this is key Shiite leaders are now claiming the \nBaghdad security plan was their idea, and are taking credit for the \nincrease in security--a development that would have been unthinkable 3 \nmonths ago.\n  There is progress outside Baghdad as well:\n  Throughout Anbar Province, Sunni sheikhs have banded together to \nfight al-Qaida in Iraq, and are pouring recruits into the police \nforces. Sixteen of twenty-six tribes in that western province are now \nworking against al-Qaida. With numerous senior al-Qaida leaders killed \nor captured, the younger, less experienced leaders are making mistakes, \nsuch as targeting respected sheikhs and murdering children, that have \nalienated Sunnis and their leaders.\n  In the town of Ramadi, hundreds of Iraqi police last week conducted a \nmajor sweep. In the surrounding areas--all of these surrounding areas--\nincluding Haditha and Hit, U.S. and Iraqis are conducting operations \nagainst al-Qaida and insurgents while protecting the population.\n  In Diyala Province U.S. forces expelled al-Qaida forces from one of \ntheir major bases in January, seized major weapons caches, disrupted \nfighter networks, and cleared cities and villages of al-Qaida fighters. \nA U.S. Stryker battalion has reinforced Diyala and is conducting major \noperations against AQI forces seeking to reconstitute. At the same \ntime, other U.S. forces in Diyala are acting against rogue Mahdi Army \nleaders in the province and are holding the Diyala and Tigris Rivers to \ncombat re-infiltration into Baghdad.\n  On the belt to the south of Baghdad, al-Qaida has come under heavy \nU.S. pressure in recent weeks, with American forces destroying car bomb \nfactories and uncovering major weapons caches in areas such as \nYusufiya, Latifiya, and Salman Pak.\n  In Mosul, U.S. and Iraqi forces have killed and captured numerous al-\nQaida operatives since December.\n  In Samarra, American and Iraqi troops have captured al-Qaida \nfacilitators and north of the city, Salahuddin Province, American \ntroops have moved off of their forward operating base and into the town \nof Bayji, an important hub on the road network.\n  These developments, which have occurred just 1 month into the new \nstrategy and with only a portion of the five additional U.S. brigades \nhaving yet deployed, suggest that, at long last, we have a strategy in \nIraq that is succeeding. That is not to say that all is going well in \nIraq; clearly, it is not. Violence continues, the Mahdi Army recently \nlaunched an attack in Basra, and one of Iraq's vice presidents was \ngravely wounded in a bomb attack. But we all know the negatives; we \nread about them every day and see them flash across our television \nscreens hourly. The enemy knows how attention-getting car bombs are, \nand their strategy reflects this understanding.\n  We must try to stop such events, and push the Iraqi Government to \nmove forward with its reconciliation efforts and meet the benchmarks \nlaid out by the President. What we cannot do, and, for the sake of \nAmerica's vital national security interests, we must not do, is give up \njust at the moment we are starting to turn things around in Iraq.\n  Yet in the face of this new reality, the proponents of the \nlegislation offer one prescription for the future: withdrawal of U.S. \nforces. Despite the progress, despite the ongoing need for U.S. troops \nto stabilize Iraq and pave the way for a political solution, despite \nthe moral burdens we have incurred as a result of our decision to \ntopple Saddam Hussein, and, above all, despite the catastrophic \nconsequences for vital U.S. interests that would follow a premature \nwithdrawal from Iraq, the sponsors of this legislation would force \nprecisely that.\n  To those who believe that the best course is to withdraw, I ask: Can \nyou explain to the American people precisely what you believe to be the \nconsequences of this action? If we follow the timetable included in \nthis bill--to withdraw troops whether or not we are succeeding or \nfailing; regardless of whether the country is secured; irrespective of \nwhether the Iraqis can manage their own affairs alone, or whether the \nforces of terror and chaos will triumph--if we follow this timetable we \nrisk a catastrophe for American national security interests.\n  Note that American national security interests are directly at stake. \nNot just Israeli interests, though Prime Minister Olmert has said that \ndefeat in Iraq could be devastating for his country. Not just for our \nArab friends and partners in the region, though they fear the \nconsequences of massive humanitarian displacement, growing Iranian \ninfluence, and wider bloodshed. Not just for the Iraqis themselves, for \nwhom genocide is a real prospect should sectarian violence spiral out \nof control. But for America. Success or failure in Iraq is the \ntranscendent issue for our foreign policy and our national security. \nPeople say they want to defeat the terrorists. But if we withdraw\n\n[[Page S3802]]\n\nfrom Iraq prematurely, it will be the terrorists' greatest triumph.\n  Withdrawing before there is a stable and legitimate Iraqi authority \nwould turn Iraq into a failed state, in the heart of the Middle East. \nWe have seen a failed state emerge after U.S. disengagement once \nbefore, and it cost us terribly. In pre-9/11 Afghanistan, terrorists \nfound sanctuary to train and plan attacks--including attacks against \nAmerica--with impunity. If we leave Iraq based on an artificial \ntimetable, al-Qaida will be free to plan, train for and conduct \noperations from Iraq just as they did from Afghanistan. We cannot make \nthis fatal mistake twice.\n  If Iraq descends into chaos, the power vacuum there will invite \nfurther Iranian interference, at a time when Tehran already feels \nemboldened. Iraq's neighbors, from Saudi Arabia to Egypt to Turkey, \nwould feel their own security eroding, and may intervene on the side of \nparticular factions. This uncertain swirl of events could spark \nregional war severely damaging to America's fundamental security \ninterests. And we would then face a terrible choice: watch the region \nburn, watch the terrorists establish new bases, with profound \nimplications for the safety of Americans and their economic well-being, \nor send troops back into Iraq once again.\n  The proponents of withdrawal state that they envision no such \ncatastrophe; they are not advocating a precipitous withdrawal but \nsomething more gradual, and they would leave American troops in place \nto focus on three limited objectives: protecting coalition personnel \nand infrastructure, training and equipping Iraqi forces, and conducting \ntargeted counter-terrorism operations. But if these three missions \nsound familiar, that's because they formed the centerpiece of the \nstrategy that was failing up until the beginning of this year. They \nwould forbid counterinsurgency operations, protection of the \npopulation, and the other elements of our new strategy that are \ndirectly responsible for the successes we have seen this year. This \nlegislation is a plan for failure. But neither failure nor success is \nthe objective of its sponsors. They wish to get out of Iraq, whatever \nthe consequences for America. They conceive no failure as worse than \nremaining in Iraq and no success worthy of additional sacrifice. They \nare wrong, terribly, terribly wrong.\n  These provisions draw a false distinction between terrorism and \nsectarian violence. Let us think about the implications of ordering \nAmerican soldiers to target ``terrorists,'' but not those who foment \nsectarian violence. Was the attack on the Golden Mosque in Samarra a \nterrorist operation or the expression of sectarian violence? When the \nMahdi Army attacks government police stations, are they acting as \nterrorists or as a militia? When AQI attacks a Shia village along the \nDiyala River, is that terrorism or sectarian violence? What about when \nan American soldier comes across some unknown assailant burying an IED \nin the road? The obvious answer is that such acts very often constitute \nterrorism in Iraq and sectarian violence in Iraq. The two are deeply \nintertwined. To try and make an artificial distinction between \nterrorism and sectarian violence is to fundamentally misunderstand al-\nQaida's strategy which is to incite sectarian violence. To say that \ntargeting terrorist violence is allowable while stopping sectarian \nviolence is illegal flies in the face of this reality, and would make \nit impossible to fight this war against terrorism, let alone prevail in \nit.\n  Some Senators have taken a different tack, arguing that Iraq is still \nwinnable but that, by withdrawing troops, we will actually maximize the \nchances of success. They concede that a withdrawal will encourage \ninsurgents and terrorists to unleash greater violence on the Iraqi \npeople, but believe that such violence might induce Iraqi politicians \nto make the political decisions necessary to end it. Could this \npossibly be true? Can we, by withdrawing our troops from Iraq, actually \nincrease the stability in Iraq rather than risk catastrophe, and induce \na political solution rather than make it less possible? Is success in \nIraq as simple as issuing redeployment orders, a move blocked only by \nstubborn commanders and civilian authorities?\n\n  GEN David Petraeus, for one, believes that it is not. Of course the \ndire situation in Iraq demands a political solution. That is undeniably \ntrue. But a political solution among the Iraqis cannot be simply \nconjured. It is impossible for meaningful political and economic \nactivity to take place in an environment as riddled with violence as \nBaghdad has been. Security is the precondition for political and \neconomic progress, and without security, we will not see the political \nprogress all of us agree is necessary. In this regard, there are \npositive indications. Prime Minister Maliki went to Ramadi to reach out \nto Sunnis, and the Iraqi Government is pushing through a new de-\nBaathification law. The oil revenue sharing law has been approved by \nthe Council of Ministers and should be approved by parliament soon. \nReports indicate that Iraqi officials are in discussions with a number \nof non-AQI Sunni insurgent groups, while fighting has broken out \nbetween AQI and Sunni insurgents.\n  Reconciliation is not the inevitable outcome of the new strategy. On \nthe contrary, there is no guarantee of success. What the situation \ndemands is not a guarantee, but rather a strategy designed to give us \nthe best possible chance for success. This, I believe, is what the new \nplan represents.\n  The provisions our amendment would strike would force redeployments \nof U.S. forces within 120 days, and nearly all troops would have to \nleave Iraq by March 31, 2008. This does not incentivize the Government \nof Iraq to make tough decisions on reconciliation; it sets the stage \nfor the Government's collapse. This arbitrary deadline informs our \nenemies when they need no longer fear American military power. It \nsignals to the population that their best bet for security really does \nrest in the hands of militias, rather than the Government. It \ndemonstrates to the Government that they cannot rely on us--after all, \nwe are pulling out regardless of the situation or the consequences. And \nit tells the terrorists that they--not we--will prevail.\n  All of us want to bring our troops home, and to do so as soon as \npossible. None of us, no matter how we voted on the resolution \nauthorizing this war, believes the situation that existed until \nrecently is sustainable. But there is a new situation, a new reality in \nIraq. This amendment ignores that reality and ignores the consequences \nthat would flow from its adoption. When Congress authorized this war, \nwe committed America to a mission that entails the greatest sacrifice a \ncountry can make, one that falls disproportionately on those Americans \nwho love their country so much that they volunteer to risk their lives \nto accomplish that mission. When we authorized this war, we accepted \nthe responsibility to make sure they could prevail. When we voted to \nsend them into battle we asked them to use every ounce of their courage \nand fortitude on behalf of us.\n\n  This body unanimously confirmed General Petraeus. Why would we now \ndeprive him of the opportunity to pursue the strategy he helped design \nand believes can work? Why would we hand our enemies a victory when we \nhave finally taken the initiative and they are on the defensive? Let us \ngive him and the soldiers he has the honor to command, Americans who \nare risking everything so that this new plan can succeed, the time \nnecessary to achieve its objectives.\n  And let us elected officials who have the honor of overseeing the \nconduct of our soldiers' mission in Iraq exercise a lesser magnitude of \ncourage--our political courage on behalf of them and the country they \nserve. If any Senator believes that our troops' sacrifice is truly in \nvain, the dictates of conscience demand that he or she act to prevent \nit. Those who would cut off all funding for this war, though I disagree \ndeeply with their position, and dread its consequences, have the \ncourage of their convictions, and I respect them for it.\n  If, on the other hand, you believe, as I do, that an increase of U.S. \ntroops in Iraq, carrying out a counterinsurgency mission, provides the \nbest chance for success in Iraq, then you should give your support to \nthis new strategy. It may not be popular nor politically expedient, but \nwe are always at our best when we put aside the small politics of the \nday in the interest of our Nation and the values upon which they rest.\n  Those are the only responsible, the only honorable choices before us. \nThere\n\n[[Page S3803]]\n\nare no others. I wish there were. But here we are, confronting a \npolitical, military and moral dilemma of immense importance, with the \ncountry's most vital security interests and the lives of the best \nAmericans among us at stake. May God grant us the wisdom and humility \nto make this difficult judgment in our country's best interests only, \nand the courage to accept our responsibility for the consequences that \nwill ensue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, under the previous unanimous consent \nagreement, at 3:45 we will return to the Cochran amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Webb, proceed for \nup to 8 minutes and that the time remaining until 3:45 be allocated to \nthe Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 692\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up my \namendment No. 692.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Webb] proposed an amendment \n     numbered 692.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for military operations in Iran)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR MILITARY OPERATIONS \n                   IN IRAN.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, no funds appropriated or otherwise made available by \n     this Act may be obligated or expended for military operations \n     or activities within or above the territory of Iran, or \n     within the territorial waters of Iran, except pursuant to a \n     specific authorization of Congress enacted in a statute \n     enacted after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Exceptions.--The prohibition in subsection (a) shall \n     not apply with respect to military operations or activities \n     as follows:\n       (1) Military operations or activities to directly repel an \n     attack launched from within the territory of Iran.\n       (2) Military operations or activities to directly thwart an \n     imminent attack to be launched from within the territory of \n     Iran.\n       (3) Military operations or activities in hot pursuit of \n     forces engaged outside the territory of Iran who thereafter \n     enter into Iran.\n       (4) Intelligence collection activities of which Congress \n     has been appropriately notified under applicable law.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 24 hours after determining to \n     utilize funds referred to in subsection (a) for purposes of a \n     military operation described in subsection (b), the President \n     shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a \n     report on the determination, including a justification for \n     the determination.\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I have been on the Senate floor on a \nnumber of occasions to discuss the amendment which I am introducing \ntoday. I introduced it on March 5 as S. 759, which is a bill to \nprohibit the use of funds for military operations in Iran without the \nconsent of the Congress. I am offering this legislation today as an \namendment to the fiscal 2007 emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill, with the support of the chairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  This bill has received a good bit of discussion and also a good bit \nof correspondence from various citizens groups that have gone to \nMembers' offices. I will not take a great deal of time in terms of \ngoing through a lot of the debate about it. I would like to say at the \noutset that I have taken great care in the preparation of this \namendment to ensure that it will not in any way prevent our military \nforces from carrying out their tactical responsibilities in places such \nas Iraq and in other areas that are on the coastlines and border lines \nof Iran. But I would like to emphasis that, in my view, this amendment \nis essential to revitalizing the constitutional health of our \ngovernmental process.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to restore a proper balance \nbetween the executive and legislative branches when it comes to the \ncommencement of war. Any general attack on Iran would be, beyond cavil, \na commencement of a new war in a region that is already enduring two \ncostly and debilitating wars. If this action is to be taken, it should \nbe done only with the full and considered consent of the Congress.\n  At the same time, the legislation allows American forces to directly \nrespond to attacks or possible attacks which might be initiated from \nIran, as well as those which might be begun elsewhere and then carry \nover into Iranian territory.\n  Specifically, the amendment requires that the President seek \ncongressional authorization prior to commencing any broad military \naction in Iran, and it allows the following exceptions: first, military \noperations or activities that would directly repel an attack launched \nfrom within the territory of Iran; second, those activities that would \ndirectly thwart an imminent attack that would be launched from Iran; \nthird, military operations or activities that would be in hot pursuit \nof forces engaged outside the territory of Iran who thereafter would \nenter Iran; and finally, those intelligence-collection activities that \nhave been properly noticed to the appropriate committees of Congress.\n  The major function of the amendment again is to restore the \nconstitutional balance. No administration should have the power to \ncommence unproved military activities against Iran or any other nation \nwithout the approval of the Congress, but the issue of the day is Iran.\n  I am offering this amendment partly due to my concern over President \nBush's signing statement which accompanied the 2002 congressional \nresolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq. That amendment, if you \nread it carefully, indicates that this administration believes it \npossesses the broadest imaginable authority to commence military action \nwithout the consent of the Congress. It should not be left unanswered \nby this body.\n  This amendment will not take any military operations off the table, \nany options off the table. It will not tie the hands of this \nadministration if our military forces are actually attacked from \nIranian soil or territorial waters or by forces that retreat into \nIranian territory.\n  This is responsible legislation. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I understand I have 7 minutes; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has until 3:45--9 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I was going to yield to Senator Coburn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendments and set them aside. That way, they can be considered as \ncalled up. Senator Graham has graciously allowed me some of his time to \ndo that. The amendment Nos. are 648, 649, 656, 657, 715, 717, and 718.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. If the Senator would hold and let us take a quick look \nat that. Perhaps Senator Graham could go ahead and use his time. We \nwill talk, and then when Senator Graham is done, before we begin the \ndebate on the Cochran amendment, we can work with the Senator on an \nagreement on those amendments.\n  I object at this time, and I will work with the Senator to work out \nthose amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I would like to associate myself with \nthe comments of Senator McCain about what is going on on the ground in \nIraq. I thought he did an excellent job of explaining that this new \nstrategy is just what it is described as being--new. We are not sending \nmore people to do the same old thing. It is a fundamentally different \napproach to how we handle the situation in Iraq.\n  The situation in Iraq is the result of not having enough forces on \nthe ground in the early parts of the war. The security environment in \nIraq got out of control. The terrorists seized an opportunity to divide \nthe Iraqis by bombing the Samarra mosque, the third most holy site in \nthe Shia region in Samarra. Ever since then, we have been in a conflict \nbetween Shias and Sunnis in Baghdad.\n  Anbar has always been about Sunni insurgents trying to topple this \ninfant\n\n[[Page S3804]]\n\ndemocracy, and it has been the place where al-Qaida has been hiding.\n  The progress is that the Sunni insurgency--the tribal chiefs are \nbeginning to understand that their lives are better with the unified \nIraq; that if they can share in the oil revenues of the country, future \nSunni generations will be benefited. I think Shias are beginning to \nunderstand that to reject Al-Sadr--his view of Iraq becoming a Shia \ntheocracy is not going to be accepted by people in the neighborhood and \nother folks living in Iraq. So I think every group is beginning to \nunderstand that through political reconciliation, they have a better, \nbrighter future. The way to get political reconciliation is to control \nthe violence. That is why we need more troops, more troops to hold \nareas previously cleared, to buy time for political reconciliation and \neconomic progress, and the early indications are that it is working.\n  Now, what is not working. The Congress is not working. I think the \nCongress is about to make history in all of the wrong ways. Do we \nreally want to be the first Congress--maybe ever in the history of the \ncountry, that I am aware of--that would, by congressional enactment, \nset a hard date to withdraw from a war in Iraq with which our vital \nnational security interests as Americans are intertwined? What are the \nconsequences of leaving in March or any other date in 2008? What \nhappens when we leave? No one who is offering these amendments has \nreally thought that through.\n  I do believe that a failed State in Iraq jeopardizes our national \nsecurity interests for decades, is a loss in the war on terror, is an \nempowering event for extremists, a death blow to moderation, and that \nwe need to see this through by changing course, and this is exactly \nwhat we are doing.\n  Setting a timeline for withdrawal is saying you have no confidence in \nGeneral Petraeus to execute the plan we sent him to execute. It is \nsaying we have no confidence in our military to deliver, because the \nday you set that date, you are going to freeze political \nreconciliation. People are not going to do deals the same way when they \nknow America is going to leave at a certain date because what happens \nwhen America leaves will be thought of in terms of the consequences of \na particular deal.\n  If we leave and Iraq is in chaos, the police and the army are unable \nto deal with the wolves of terrorism, then they are overwhelmed, the \ncountry breaks apart, and the regional consequences and the \nconsequences to the world are monumental, in my opinion.\n  The first rule of medicine is to do no harm. It should be the first \nrule of politics. And we have done harm with our Iraqi strategy. We \nhave assumed the best and never planned for the worst.\n  Whatever mistakes the Bush team has made, and there are many, the \nCongress is about to make the greatest mistake of all; that is, to tell \nthe enemy what they have to do to get us out of Iraq on their terms, \nnot ours. It is a death blow to moderation. Who in the Mideast will try \nto come together knowing that the United States cannot be counted on? \nWhat effect would it have on the worldwide terrorist networks if they \nbelieve, through their acts of violence and barbaric behavior, that \nAmerica will leave?\n  We cannot let suicide bombers determine the fate of the 21st century. \nWe cannot let people who will blow up children in a car determine the \nfate of Iraq. We cannot let that happen. We are bigger than that. We \nare better than that. I believe passionately, after five visits, with \none more to come, that the people in Iraq want more. They are dying for \ntheir own freedom. I would leave tomorrow if I thought the Iraqi people \nwere incapable of solving their problems. I do believe the majority of \nShias, Sunnis, and Kurds want the same thing that every Member of this \nbody wants for their family--a better life. They have looked into the \nabyss, and they are making the changes they need to make.\n  If we restrict funding, if we restrict our military commanders' \nability to go after the enemy in all of its forms, we are doing them a \ndisservice. If you set a hard deadline for withdrawal, you have doomed \nus as a nation to lose in Iraq. What good would it be for one person to \nbe maimed or to die waiting on that day to come? If you pick March \n2008, what do you tell a family member of the U.S. military why their \nloved one died or was harmed, knowing that the date killed our efforts \nto be successful? This is irresponsible. This does everything wrong \nthat the Congress could do at a time when things could get better.\n  I cannot promise you success. But I know our last best chance lies \nwith General Petraeus. Our last best chance lies with a reinforcement \nof a country and a military that needs it. The military needs this \nmoney. They deserve this money without strings attached. They deserve a \nchance to turn Iraq around to make us free.\n  The House may be satisfied with this vote on the supplemental, and \nthey may think this is a victory for the Democratic leadership in the \nHouse. I think this is a shameful chapter in the history of the House. \nThese votes to pass this bill were literally bought. There is money in \nthis bill, the supplemental bill, that has nothing to do with the \nmilitary, nothing to do with Iraq, and there was money being spent to \nbuy votes to make sure we drive ourselves out of Iraq without \nconsequence and the thought of what happens.\n  If we do not pass a supplemental soon, Secretary Gates has laid out \nwhat happens in April, May, and June to our military. Because of time \nlimitations, I will not go into detail on what happens to the military, \nbut I can tell you with certainty that the military needs this money \nfor ongoing operations, and every month and week that goes by without \nthis money going into the Department of Defense, major decisions have \nto be made that compromise troop safety, that hurt the quality of life \nof families, and keep this surge from being successful.\n  If your goal is to end this war because you think we have lost, \nchoose an honorable path. The honorable path would be to come to this \nfloor, offer an amendment to stop funding now and get out of Iraq as \nsoon as possible. A date certain a year from now, a year and a half \nfrom now, whatever date you pick, it ensures we lose, and it ensures \nthat the people who are left there to fight until that day comes get \ninjured and die in vain.\n  This is the wrong way to run a war. This is the wrong way to fight \nterrorism.\n  Three weeks ago, I was at Guantanamo Bay listening to Shaikh \nMohammed, the mastermind of 9/11, explaining why he was at war with us. \nHe will be at war with us until his last breath. There are people like \nhim in Iraq measuring us as a nation. Please do not send them the wrong \nsignal. Fund our troops without condition. Stand behind General \nPetraeus because he deserves our support.\n  We sent him off to do a mission. Give him the resources to do it, and \nin time we will figure this out. This is not an open-ended commitment. \nI know as well as everybody else that we are not going to be in Iraq \nforever. But we need to be in Iraq on terms that will empower moderates \nand deflate extremists. I believe the Iraqi political leadership, given \nthe breathing space, will have the ability, with our support, to \nreconcile their country because it is in their best interests. \nLiterally thousands of Iraqis have died for their own freedom. What \nmore can we ask of someone. Political reconciliation is hard. It took \nus 13 years to write our Constitution. We were at civil war among \nourselves. Democracy is hard, but it is worth fighting for.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 643\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, under the previous consent agreement, for \nthe information of all Senators, we are now going to the debate on the \nCochran amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 5 \np.m. is for debate with respect to amendment number 643, with the time \nequally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 12 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia, \nMr. Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the able Senator from Washington.\n  While I oppose the amendment by the Senator from Mississippi, I thank \nhim for his courtesy in bringing this bill to\n\n[[Page S3805]]\n\nthe floor. In order to facilitate Senate action on this critical \nsupplemental bill, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill \nby voice vote on Thursday, March 22. Again, I thank the able Senator \nfrom Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, for his support.\n  In this 2007 supplemental, the Congress is providing nearly $100 \nbillion to support our military and diplomatic efforts in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. This brings total appropriations for the wars to nearly \n$170 billion for this year alone. When Congress approves this \nsupplemental, it will have appropriated $448 billion for the war in \nIraq.\n  As the conflict in Iraq enters its fifth year, more than 3,220 \nmembers of the uniformed services have sacrificed their lives, with \nover 24,000 more wounded, many grievously wounded. The Iraq conflict \nmost certainly has become a civil war. The American people need to know \nwhat we are accomplishing by remaining in Iraq. How much longer will \nCongress continue to blindly write checks for this failed strategy in \nIraq? Supporting the troops means doing all we can to remove them from \nthis violent internal sectarian conflict in Iraq.\n  The American people have made it very clear where they stand on this \nmatter. A large majority of Americans, according to any number of \npolls, wants the troops home, and the sooner the better. I, for one, am \nnot so stubborn that I will keep marching on toward some intangible \nsuccess in Iraq, no matter how many may die, no matter how many may be \nwounded, and no matter how many families are torn apart by grief. A \ncontinued U.S. presence is a catalyst for violence in Iraq and in the \nregion. It is time to remove that spark from this volatile situation \nand pursue a diplomatic track which may lead to a national \nreconciliation for the people of Iraq.\n  The language in this bill encourages a decrease in Iraqi reliance on \nU.S. troops to keep the peace in Iraq and pave the way for the Iraqi \npeople to take steps toward national reconciliation. The language in \nthe bill is not Draconian, nor is it precipitous. It is simply a \nrecognition of the reality of the situation in Iraq. It calls for a \ngradual redeployment of U.S. troops in conjunction with concerted \nefforts to train and equip Iraqi security forces while building \nregional and international support for the Iraqi Government. The \nlanguage permits continued counterterrorism operations by U.S. forces \nand allows a limited number of U.S. forces to remain in order to \nprotect U.S. and coalition personnel and infrastructure. That is not a \nprecipitous withdrawal. It is not cutting and running. Rather, it is a \ncommonsense compromise between those who want all the troops home now \nand those who advocate a continued massive American presence in Iraq.\n  It is time--yes, time--to change course in Iraq before 3,000 more \nAmericans and thousands more Iraqis are killed.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment to strike section \n1315(a) and (b) of the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I yield the distinguished Senator from Louisiana 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to encourage all of my colleagues, \nDemocrat and Republican, to support the Cochran amendment as a \nresponsible action. The situation in Iraq is deeply controversial and \ndivisive. As we debate it, everyone here and in the country say they \nare clearly for supporting our troops in the field and giving them what \nthey need once they are put there to do their mission. That is why just \na week or two ago huge numbers of Members of the Senate supported the \nGregg resolution, 82 Senators saying clearly: We are going to support \nthe men and women in uniform in the field; likewise, they supported in \nhuge numbers the Murray resolution, 96 Senators, to support the men and \nwomen in uniform in the field.\n  I am afraid the path some are urging us to go down today belies that \nstatement, contradicts that statement, and does not support those men \nand women in uniform in the field.\n  We all know the consequences of the Reid language. That language \ninsists that the President pull our troops out of Iraq on a date \ncertain with no regard at all for the conditions on the ground or the \nprogress being made by our troops or the Iraqi Government. It \nmicromanages the war, taking what is in the purview of the Commander in \nChief and bringing it to Congress. The Reid language will absolutely \ndraw a veto from the President. What would that do? It would delay for \na significant amount of time getting aid, money, help, and equipment to \nour troops in the field.\n  We should not go down this path. This language will earn a veto from \nthe President. Indeed, it would earn a veto from any President because \nit micromanages his responsibilities as Commander in Chief, and that \nwill delay getting resources to folks in the field.\n  Our military leadership has said in no uncertain terms that they must \nget this supplemental funding to support the troops in the field by \nmid-April. This language will push all of that well beyond that \ndeadline, will delay it by 5, 6 weeks or more, and endanger our troops \nin the field by not getting them the resources and equipment they need. \nThat is not right. That is exactly contrary to what almost all Members \nof this body have spoken for: supporting our troops in the field.\n  This supplemental appropriations bill also has important help for the \nvictims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the gulf coast, emergency \nmeasures that are supported by the President and the Congress but have \nnot yet been fully funded. Just as we are playing politics potentially \nwith our troops in the field with this veto scenario, we would be \nplaying politics with this language, drawing a veto from the President, \nwith the victims of the worst natural disaster in U.S. history. That is \nnot right. It is politics over people. Worse than that, it is politics \nover our people in uniform. It is politics over our people who suffered \nthe worst natural disaster in history. We should not go down this path. \nWe should not be so cynical and callous. We should put our people in \nuniform first and get them the funds and support they need in the field \nas we promise to do speech after speech after speech.\n  Words are cheap. Actions, votes lead to consequences. That is what \nthis debate and what these votes are all about--supporting our troops \nin the field, supporting the victims of the worst natural disaster in \nU.S. history.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNebraska, Mr. Hagel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, there will be no victory or defeat for the \nUnited States in Iraq. There will not be a military solution to Iraq. \nIraq belongs to the 25 million Iraqis who live there. It does not \nbelong to the United States. Iraq is not a prize to be won or lost.\n  We can help the people of Iraq, as we have been helping them over the \nlast 4 years, with a tremendous amount of our American blood and \ntreasure. We have much invested in Iraq. America has strategic \ninterests in the Middle East. And we will continue to help the people \nof Iraq, as we will continue to protect our interests and those of our \nallies in the Middle East.\n  But the future of Iraq, however, will be determined by the Iraqi \npeople. The future of Iraq will be determined by a political \naccommodation by the people in Iraq, which will result in a political \nresolution that will be supported by the Iraqi people, its regional \nneighbors, and other powers, including the United States.\n  After 4 years in Iraq, America's policy there should be designed to \ngradually pull the United States further away from the day-to-day \nresponsibilities, those day-to-day responsibilities of defending Iraq \nand de facto governance of Iraq, and turning over those \nresponsibilities to the Iraqis, not escalating--not escalating--our \nmilitary involvement in Iraq.\n  Today, we are headed in the opposite direction. I will not support \nsustaining a flawed and failing policy in Iraq.\n  We are now in our fifth year in an active war in Iraq. Iraq is more \ndangerous today than at any time in the last 4 years. And--puzzling--\nthe administration says, we are making real progress in Iraq. So if we \nare making\n\n[[Page S3806]]\n\nreal progress in Iraq, then why are we putting more and more American \ncombat troops into Iraq at the same time our allies are leaving or have \nalready left?\n  The President's strategy is taking America deeper and deeper into \nthis quagmire, with no exit strategy.\n  In January, we were told that 21,500 more U.S. troops would be sent \nto Iraq. This month, we learned that as many as 7,000 more U.S. troops, \nin addition to the 21,500, would be sent to Iraq. The Congressional \nBudget Office has estimated that the President's recent decision to \nescalate our military involvement could require as many as 48,000 \nadditional U.S. troops in Iraq.\n  In January, the administration said progress on the Iraq war would be \nmeasurable by this summer. We have heard that at 6-month intervals for \nthe last 2 years in oversight committee hearings. But now we are being \ntold that additional troops could be required in Iraq well into next \nyear.\n  This strategy to deepen America's military involvement in Iraq will \nnot bring a resolution in Iraq. It will only continue to undermine \nAmerica's standing in Iraq and the Middle East, complicating and \nlimiting our diplomatic options, and doing further damage to our \nmilitary. And we continue to finance and build the most powerful and \nunaccountable mercenary armies in history, like Blackwater.\n  We cannot continue down a path that is destroying our military and \ncontinuing to place our men and women in uniform in Iraq in the middle \nof a civil war.\n  In February, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Peter \nPace, reported to Congress that there is now--his word--a \n``significant'' risk that our military will not be able to respond to \nan emerging crisis in another part of the world. Why did he say that? \nIt is because we are overburdened, overstretched. We are breaking our \nforce structure--third and fourth tours.\n  Recently, the inspector general of the Defense Department issued a \nreport on our National Guard. Our National Guard--our Army National \nGuard in America is broken. The Chief of Staff of the Army, General \nSchoomaker, has made similar, recent comments in open testimony before \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  It is now time for the Congress to step forward and establish \nresponsible boundaries and conditions for our continued military \ninvolvement in Iraq. That is our responsibility. Need I remind our \ncolleagues in this body, the Congress of the United States is a coequal \nbranch of Government with the President of the United States? We not \nonly have moral obligations but we have constitutional \nresponsibilities.\n  To hear some of my colleagues say we should dispense with this \n``frivolous'' debate because the President has threatened a veto--what \na waste of our time--if you logically follow that through, why do we \nneed a Congress? Why don't we let the President make all the choices, \nmake all the decisions? There are some, I suspect, in this \nadministration who would like that, some in this country would like \nthat. But we tried a monarchy once. It is not suited to America. There \nare separations of power. Of course there are. But there are three \ncoequal branches of Government.\n  It is now time for the Congress to step forward, after a disastrous 4 \nyears in Iraq. The language in the Senate supplemental bill does this \nin a responsible way. The Senate language does not cut off funds. It \ndoes not impose a precipitous withdrawal of troops from Iraq. This \nlanguage establishes a limited U.S. military mission in Iraq: \ncounterterrorism, training Iraqi forces, and protecting U.S. personnel. \nThat is not new. We have heard that from this administration over the \nlast 4 years. This was not dreamed up. This idea that somehow you do \nnot support the troops if you do not continue, in a lemming-like way, \nto accept whatever this administration's policy is wrong. That is what \nis wrong, and that is dangerous.\n  This language establishes a limited U.S. military mission in Iraq \nthat focuses on the things we should be doing, we can be doing. This \nnew and responsible mission would pull our troops out of the middle of \nIraq's civil war. Is that wrong? Is there something wrong with that--\nasking these young men and women to put their lives on the line in the \nmiddle of a civil war in Baghdad, kicking down doors, with a bull's eye \non their back--to pull them out of that? Is that wrong? Does that \nsomehow display a cavalier attitude toward the support of our troops? I \nthink not. I think just the opposite.\n  There is a timeline in the Senate language. But it does not establish \na binding date for U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. Let's get that clear. It \nwould establish the goal--those are the terms, goal--a goal that U.S. \nforces not involved in this more limited military mission be redeployed \nby March 2008. Is there something wrong with that? That means March of \n2008 is 5 years we will have been there--5 years. We will have done \nsignificant damage to our Marines and our Army and our National Guard \nby then.\n\n  We have misunderstood, misread, misplanned, and mismanaged our \nhonorable intentions in Iraq with an arrogant self-delusion reminiscent \nof Vietnam. Honorable intentions are not policies or plans or \nresponsible. It may take many years before there is a cohesive \npolitical center in Iraq. America's options on this point have always \nbeen limited.\n  I support the President's decision to initiate a new diplomatic \nstrategy and support a regional diplomatic process on the future of \nIraq that began on March 10 at the regional security conference in \nBaghdad. But the President must devote his attention to foster those \nefforts. As the Baker-Hamilton report made clear, we must develop a \nregional diplomatic strategy to achieve stability in Iraq.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask for 60 seconds to conclude my \nremarks.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield the Senator 60 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. America finds itself in a dangerous and isolated position \nin the world. We are perceived as a nation at war with Muslims. This \ndebilitating and dangerous perception must be reversed as the world \nseeks a new center of gravity for this new century. The United States \nmust begin planning for a phased troop withdrawal from Iraq. The cost \nof combat in Iraq in terms of American lives, dollars, and world \nstanding has been devastating for our country.\n  The American people are demanding that we develop a bipartisan \nconsensus for an honorable and responsible exit strategy from Iraq. If \nwe fail to build a bipartisan foundation for an exit strategy, America \nwill pay a high price for this blunder--one we will have difficulty \nrecovering from in the years ahead.\n  Our actions today in the Congress begin this effort.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune, 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for \nyielding.\n  I rise in support of his amendment and also note that Friday of last \nweek, March 23, was, in my view, a sad day because it was on that day \nthe House of Representatives voted to usurp the responsibilities of the \nPresident of the United States as Commander in Chief of the Armed \nForces. Unfortunately, the Democratic majority in the Senate, rather \nthan reject this ill-conceived and dangerous line of thinking, has \nchosen to endorse it.\n  I believe the phased redeployment language in the supplemental is \nwrong. Today, I ask my colleagues to stop and think about the long-term \neffects the redeployment language is going to have. This language will \ndo more than redeploy troops. It will set a precedent that Congress may \ninterject itself into the military chain of command. This is not a \nslippery slope, it is a straight drop to the bottom.\n  War requires one Commander in Chief. Every civilization, from Greece \nto the British Empire, has understood this basic premise, as did our \nFounders.\n  Wars are unpredictable, and they are fluid. Success in any military \nconflict requires energy, speed, flexibility, and\n\n[[Page S3807]]\n\nadaptability. I thought the Senate understood this, particularly when \nwe unanimously confirmed General Petraeus to be the commander of forces \nin Iraq.\n  What are our commanders in the field supposed to think? What orders \nare they to comply with? Are they going to conduct the surge or are \nthey going to reorganize their forces to comply with redeploying the \ntroops? Should we expect our commanders to read their operations orders \nor congressional conference reports to determine their priorities?\n  This effort, led by the Democratic majority, is simply a bad idea, \nand I hope my colleagues can see that the short-term gain they seek on \nthis bill will lead to long-term consequences for the military.\n  The other reason I oppose the redeployment language is it confuses \nstrategic policy with foreign policy. Both have the same goal: victory \nin Iraq and to bring our troops home. However, that goal is arrived at \nby very different means.\n  Our strategic policy is set by the President and by our military \ncommanders. Conversely, our foreign policy is set by their diplomatic \ncounterparts at the State Department. That is why interagency \ncooperation is important now more than ever. In order for the U.S. \nGovernment to effectively employ the elements of the national power, \nCongress must resist the temptation to intervene and ultimately make \nmatters worse.\n  Redeploying our troops from Iraq on a published timeline is not going \nto end the war on terrorism. To me, the redeployment language in this \nbill is the strategic equivalent of the Maginot line. In World War II, \nthe French built a wall and the Germans went around it. If we publish \nour deployment timeline, then Shia and Sunni insurgents, al-Qaida in \nIraq, and Iranian instigators will all simply wait for us to leave and \nthen begin their efforts to undo all we have worked for over the past 4 \nto 5 years.\n\n  The conflict we are fighting today is unlike any other we have \nfought. That is why I find the Democratic talking points about how the \nwar in Iraq has lasted longer than this conflict or that conflict to be \nso disingenuous. They are right on one point: This is not World War II. \nIt is not Vietnam. It is Iraq. It is the war on terror, and our efforts \nin Iraq cannot be looked at in a vacuum.\n  Iraq is a front in the war on terror, but it is not the front in the \nwar on terror, because this war has no front. If you want to know where \nthe front is in the war on terror, then get in your car and drive 10 \nminutes over to the Pentagon. That is a front. Go to New York and look \nat the gaping holes in the ground. That is a front. Or visit the field \nin Pennsylvania where a group of brave passengers forced a plane to the \nground at the expense of their own lives. That is a front. If any of my \ncolleagues are still wondering where the front is on the war on terror, \nyou are standing on it.\n  In order to deal with this phenomenon, in almost every sector of U.S. \nsecurity policy we are trying to push America's enemies further away. \nPort security is a perfect example. We are putting inspectors in \nforeign ports to inspect cargo before it comes to the United States, \nand we are allowing the Coast Guard to inspect ships further out at \nsea, all for the purpose of putting the enemy farther away from us. Yet \nin this instance, this bill seems to invite our enemies into the very \nheart of our country. To me, it simply does not make sense.\n  Our colleagues on the other side also like to note there were no \nIraqis on the planes that attacked us on September 11. Well, there \nweren't any Afghanis either. In fact, if we follow this line of \nthinking to its logical conclusion about who was on those planes, then \nperhaps this Congress should change the 2002 authorization for the use \nof force and allow the President to attack Saudi Arabia, because the \nmajority of the hijackers were Saudis.\n  Of course, such a line of thinking is ridiculous because this \nconflict is not about national identity, it is about ideology. It is \nabout good versus evil, right versus wrong, freedom versus tyranny, and \nhope versus cynicism.\n  I will concede this administration has not handled Iraq as well as it \ncould have, but I also believe this debate is more about our national \nidentity or resolve than our involvement in Iraq.\n  I still believe that America, for all its faults, is a shining city \non a hill, that our greatest export should be freedom and our greatest \nasset being people and ideas; that we are a beacon of hope to those who \ntoil in the darkness of tyranny and oppression. I also believe if we \npass this legislation, we are saying to the world the United States is \ncommitted to defending freedom only when it is convenient or popular. \nThat is not the America I know. It is not the America my father, a \nWorld War II fighter pilot, taught me about or the country we should \nhope to become.\n  It is my sincere hope my colleagues will vote to support Senator \nCochran's amendment to remove the troop withdrawal language from this \nbill. If we do not, I believe we will be doing more harm than good, \ndespite the intentions to the contrary.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, we gather on another occasion to bring the \nIraq war to its fateful end. While this effort may fall short again, we \nwill continue to try to do what is in the national security of our \ncountry.\n  The Iraq war should never have been authorized. I was proud to say so \nin 2002, but I am even more proud of the plan I have offered that calls \nfor combat to begin redeploying on May 1 with the goal of all combat \ntroops out of Iraq by March 2008.\n  We also must make sure that we are not as careless getting out of \nthis war as we were getting in, and that is why this withdrawal should \nbe gradual, and keep some U.S. troops in the region to prevent a wider \nwar in the region and go after al-Qaida and other terrorists.\n  Those who would have us continue this war in perpetuity like to say \nthat this is a matter of resolve on behalf of the American people. But \nthe American people have been extraordinarily resolved. They have seen \ntheir sons and daughters killed or wounded on the streets of Fallujah. \nThey have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on this effort--money \nthat could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland security and \nour competitive standing as a nation.\n  No, it has not been a failure of resolve that has led us to this \nchaos, but a failure of strategy--a strategy that has only strengthened \nIran's strategic position; increased threats posed by terrorist \norganizations; reduced U.S. credibility and influence around the world; \nand placed Israel and other nations friendly to the United States in \nthe region in greater peril.\n  Iraq has been a failure of strategy and that strategy must change. It \nis time to bring a responsible end to this conflict because there is no \nmilitary solution to this war.\n  Before we send our best off to battle in the future, we must remember \nwhat led us to this day and learn from the principles that follow.\n  We must remember that ideology is not a foreign policy. We must not \nembark on war based on untested theories, political agendas or wishful \nthinking that have little basis in fact or reality. We must focus our \nefforts on the threats we know exist, and we must evaluate those \nthreats with sound intelligence that is never manipulated for political \nreasons again.\n  We must remember that the cost of going it alone is immense. It is a \nchoice we sometimes have to make, but one that must be made rarely and \nalways reluctantly.\n  We must remember that planning for peace is just as critical as \nplanning for war. Iraq was not just a failure of conception, but a \nfailure of execution. So when a conflict does arise that requires our \ninvolvement, we must try to understand that country's history, its \npolitics, its ethnic and religious divisions before our troops ever set \nfoot on its soil.\n  We must understand that setting up ballot boxes does not \nautomatically create a democracy. Real freedom and real stability come \nfrom doing the hard work of helping to build a strong police force, and \na legitimate government, and ensuring that people have food, and water, \nand electricity, and basic services. And we must be honest about\n\n[[Page S3808]]\n\nhow much of that we can do ourselves and how much must come from the \npeople themselves.\n  And finally, we must remember that when we send our service men and \nwomen to war, we make sure we have given them the training they need, \nand the equipment that will keep them safe, and a mission they can \naccomplish. And when our troops come home, it is our most solemn \nresponsibility to make sure they come home to the services, and the \nbenefits, and the care they deserve.\n  The cause to defend our country and our interests around the world \nwill never end. It will be one of our country's constant threads \nthrough the ages. It is our sacred trust to ensure that those moments, \nthose times of great struggle, are the right ones. And when they are \nnot, we must continue to try and end those conflicts for the sake of \nour country, our service men and women, and the ideals we hold dear.\n  For these reasons, I strongly support the provision in the \nsupplemental bill that calls for the withdrawal of American combat \ntroops by March 31, 2008, and I will oppose any efforts to strip that \nprovision from the bill.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, we have arrived at a key moment for \nU.S. policy in Iraq. History recalls Operations Desert Shield and Storm \nin 1990 and 1991. It recalls the no-fly zones we maintained in the \n1990s. It recalls the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998. It recalls our \nsanctions against Saddam Hussein. And when history records Operation \nIraqi Freedom, it will remember whether Congress provided the direction \nnecessary to complete the mission or chose to cut it off prematurely. \nHistory win judge today's vote.\n  The American people await this vote. The Iraqi people await this \nvote. Al-Qaida awaits this vote. The surge is now underway. I did not \nsupport the surge, but I hope it works. The first reports have been \nencouraging, but the fog of war remains thick. Over the next few \nmonths, we will be able to assess whether the surge is working or not. \nNow is hardly the time to set a date for retreat.\n  I am not saying we should have an open-ended commitment, but I am \nsaying that our mission over there--and not politics over here--should \ndrive our policy. I know many of my colleagues believe we have nothing \nto gain by staying. But I believe there is a way forward.\n  Everyone agrees that a political solution is crucial to success. And \nit turns out that the political solution Iraqis ought to pursue is the \nmost American of all: Federalism.\n  Thankfully, in the early days in America, we did not have the kind of \nfactional violence and terrorism we have seen in Iraq. But it certainly \nincluded rivalries between the colonies and different visions of the \nfuture.\n  The great solution chosen by the founding fathers was federalism--\nsomething embodied by the Senate itself. An Iraq with several federal \nregions, with Baghdad as a federal capital represents the best chance \nfor Iraq to achieve stability.\n  If the surge works, federalism can provide the framework necessary to \nstabilize Iraq over the long term. If the surge fails, and Iraq's \nsectarian violence deepens, a federal Iraq will be the only choice \navailable to separate the warring factions while keeping Iraq from \nbreaking apart--something that we cannot allow to occur in such a vital \nregion.\n  I believe that instead of giving the terrorists a reason to be \nhopeful and sending mixed signals to our forces in the field, we should \nbe talking about the possibility of a federal Iraq. The Iraqi \nConstitution calls for it. The Iraqi Parliament passed a law supporting \nit. The Kurdish region proves that it can be successful. Yes, a federal \nIraq may require the presence of U.S. forces for some period of time. \nBut as we have seen in Bosnia, our deployments in support of a \npolitical solution endorsed by all sides can bring lasting peace and a \nchance for a brighter future.\n  For this reason, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Cochran \namendment. We need to stop talking about how to retreat and start \ntalking about winning in Iraq. A conversation about a federal Iraq is \nthe best way for the Senate to contribute to success in Iraq.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the Republican effort to strike \nthe critical section of this bill requiring our troops in Iraq to begin \nto come home in 120 days and that we finish the job in 2008.\n  This is a defining moment for our country. The American people are \nwatching, and the world is watching. The issue is clear. Will we stand \nwith our soldiers by ending their misguided mission and beginning to \nbring them home? Or will we stand with the President and keep our \nsoldiers trapped in Iraq's civil war?\n  History will judge us. We can either continue down the President's \nperilous path or insist on a new direction. If we don't change course, \nwe know what lies ahead--more American casualties, more deaths, more \ndestruction, greater loss of respect for America in the wider world, \nand greater danger to our national security. A new strategy that makes \nIraqis less reliant on our military is the best way forward.\n  More of the same misguided policy will result in more of the same \ntragedy for our military. We need a realistic strategy, and we need it \nnow. Iraq is the overarching issue of our time. Our national security \nitself is at stake.\n  In this debate, we hear echoes of the past: We are accused of cutting \nand running. We are accused of giving comfort to the enemy. We are told \nwe need to be patient and to accept the importance of staying the \ncourse. We are told we have to give the latest escalation a chance to \nsucceed.\n  Listen to this comment from a high-ranking American official:\n\n       It became clear that if we were prepared to stay the \n     course, we could help to lay the cornerstone for a diverse \n     and independent Asia . . . If we faltered, the forces of \n     chaos would scent victory and decades of strife and \n     aggression would stretch endlessly before us. The choice was \n     clear. We would stay the course. And we shall stay the \n     course.\n\n  That is not President Bush speaking. It is President Lyndon Johnson \n40 years ago, ordering a 100,000 more American soldiers to Vietnam.\n  Here is another quotation:\n\n       The big problem is to get territory and to keep it. You can \n     get it today and it will be gone next week. That is the \n     problem. You have to have enough people to clear it . . . and \n     enough people to preserve what you have done.\n\n  That is not President Bush on the need for more forces in Iraq. It is \nPresident Johnson in 1966 as he doubled our military presence in \nVietnam.\n  Here is yet another familiar argument.\n\n       We are not going to tuck our tail and run . . .\n\n  Those are not President Bush's words. Those are the words of \nPresident Johnson in 1966.\n  Here is another familiar argument:\n\n       We are being steadfast in Vietnam because we don't want the \n     next generation of Americans to have to fight another war.\n\n  That is not President Bush, but it sure sounds like him. It is Vice \nPresident Agnew in December 1969.\n  Here is another familiar argument being used in the Iraq debate by \nthe stay-the-course Republicans that we've heard before:\n\n       We think we can bring peace. We will bring peace. The peace \n     that we will be able to achieve will be due to the fact that \n     Americans, when it really counted, did not buckle, did not \n     run away, but stood fast . . .\n\n  That is not President Bush. It is President Nixon in September 1969.\n  And here is another:\n\n       If, when the chips are down, the world's most powerful \n     nation, the United States of America, acts like a pitiful, \n     helpless giant, the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy \n     will threaten free nations and free institutions throughout \n     the world.\n\n  That's not President Bush. Those are the words of President Nixon in \nApril of 1970.\n  These words from the past resonate painfully in today's debate on \nIraq. In Vietnam, the White House grew increasingly obsessed with \nvictory, and increasingly divorced from the will of the people and any \nrational policy. The Department of Defense kept assuring us that each \nnew escalation in Vietnam would be the last. We were told to be \nsteadfast, to stay the course, and not to retreat. There was no \nmilitary solution to that war. But we kept trying to find one anyway. \nIn the end, 58,000 Americans died in the search for it.\n  Echoes of that disaster are all around us today. Iraq is George \nBush's Vietnam.\n  But we have heard all that in the current debate about Iraq as well. \nWe\n\n[[Page S3809]]\n\nhave heard for years that the administration has a plan for success, \nthat progress is just around the corner. But the plans for success keep \ngetting tossed aside for new plans. The administration has benchmarks \nto measure success, but there are no consequences when the benchmarks \nare not met. The timelines for progress keep getting extended. We have \nturned so many corners that we have ended up back where we started--\ntrying to control Baghdad.\n  It is time to change direction. Mr. President, 3,200 members of our \nforces have been killed, and more than 24,000 have been wounded. The \ncasualties keep mounting. The violence continues to spiral upward. Our \ntroops are in the impossible position of trying to stabilize a country \nat war with itself.\n  The recent National Intelligence Estimate confirms the nightmare \nscenario unfolding for our troops. Iraq is sliding deeper into the \nabyss of civil war, and our brave men and women are caught in the \nmiddle of it. Prospects for halting the sectarian violence are bleak.\n  Greater chaos and anarchy are looming ahead. Needless additional U.S. \ncausalities are inevitable.\n  The facts speak for themselves. According to the United Nations, \nnearly 35,000 civilians were violently killed in Iraq last year. Most \nwere killed in Baghdad, where ``unidentified bodies killed execution-\nstyle are found in large numbers daily.''\n  More than 2 million refugees have fled the violence in Iraq, and \nanother 1.8 million have been displaced internally.\n  Our military should not be caught in the middle of this quagmire. \nOnly a political solution can solve Iraq's problems.\n  General Casey, in his testimony to the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee in June 2005, called for a political solution. He said:\n\n       If you look back historically at how insurgencies have been \n     defeated, they have been defeated when the insurgents saw \n     their options as better protected in the political process \n     and their prospects for economic advancement can be better \n     protected by the political process than fighting for them. \n     And that's the essential element here.\n\n  Last August, General Abizaid spoke about the need for a political \nsolution. He said:\n\n       Our troops are the best equipped, the best trained, the \n     best led in the world. And I am enormously proud of them, and \n     I have the utmost confidence in their ability to handle any \n     mission. Yet, sectarian violence is worse than ever in \n     Baghdad in particular. And I wonder about the validity of a \n     strategy that says that less capable troops that are not as \n     well equipped, trained and led as the best troops in the \n     world can handle the security of this country if the upswing \n     in violence has occurred despite the presence of the best \n     troops in the world. It doesn't give me a lot of confidence \n     in our underlying strategy. And it suggests to me that what \n     we need is a political rather than a military solution.\n\n  General Petraeus, the new commander of our forces in Iraq, recently \nemphasized as well that there is ``no military solution'' in Iraq. But \nno one in the administration has been able to clearly articulate a \npolitical solution or how it can take hold in the midst of this chaos.\n  Instead of giving the Iraqis a necessary incentive to get their \npolitical house in order by beginning an orderly redeployment of our \ntroops out of Iraq, the President stubbornly insists on sending more \nand more American troops into Iraq's civil war. Escalation didn't work \nin Vietnam and it won't work in Iraq either.\n  Even worse, the administration has not been honest about the number \nof troops the President plans to send to Iraq for the surge.\n  On January 10, he announced that he had committed ``more than \n20,000'' additional troops to Iraq. Within a few days, we were told the \nnumber was 21,500.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that it would be far higher \nas much as 35,000 to 48,000 troops when support troops are included.\n  On February 6, I asked General Pace and Secretary Gates for the best \nmilitary estimate as to the actual size of the escalation. Their answer \nwas an additional 10 to 15 percent. General Pace said, ``you're going \nto need no more than another 2,000, 2,500 troops on the ground.''\n  Nine days later, the number more than doubled. General Schoomaker \ntold the Armed Services Committee his estimate was somewhere between \n5,000 and 6,000 troops when he included imbedded trainers. Then, on \nMarch 6 Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England told a House \ncommittee ``about 4,000, maybe as many as 7,000.''\n  On March 7, at the request of General Petraeus, Secretary Gates \nauthorized an additional 2,200 military police troops.\n  We still don't have an accurate total for the size of this \nescalation. The administration refuses to speak with clarity and \ncandor.\n  Since the current surge began, Shiite militias in Baghdad may be \nlying low, but violence has increased elsewhere in Iraq.\n  In Diyala province, in just 3 months, American casualties have \nexceeded the number for the entire year of 2006.\n  In January this year, 83 American soldiers were killed, compared to \n62 in the same month a year ago.\n  Eighty more American soldiers were killed in February this year. In \nthe same month last year, we lost 55 soldiers.\n  In March, we have already lost 76 soldiers, compared to 31 in March \n2006.\n  Continuing our open-ended commitment to stay in Iraq will not bring \nvictory. It will not stop the violence, and it will not protect our \nnational security.\n  The administration has outlined military, economic, and political \nbenchmarks to measure success. But it has not given any timeline to \nachieve them, and it has not specified any consequences if the \nbenchmarks are not met.\n  This same administration supported timelines for every Iraqi election \nand for drafting the constitution. Yet it remains emphatically opposed \nto any timeline for the redeployment of our military.\n  The American people have been patient. But America has now been in \nIraq longer than it took us to win World War II. Instead of progress, \nwe continue to see unacceptably high levels of violence, death, and \ndestruction.\n  We are putting too much strain on our Army, especially the Army \nNational Guard. Our forces are overextended. Many soldiers are now on \ntheir third rotation. In the long run, we can't protect our Army if we \ndon't end the war.\n  Our troops have done their part. They have served with great courage. \nWe are proud of their service, and we are ready to welcome them home.\n  It is time to change course. It is time to insist that Iraqis step up \nto the plate and take responsibility for their own future. It is time \nto begin to redeploy our troops out of Iraq. It is time to put the \nIraqis on notice that our military will no longer be a permanent crutch \nfor them to lean on and avoid their responsibility to achieve a \npolitical solution. As General Abizaid told the Armed Services \nCommittee last November:\n\n       I believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own \n     future.\n\n  The only practical way to accomplish the change that is long overdue \nis for American combat troops to begin to come home.\n  Those of us who opposed the war are used to the administration's \nattacks when we disagree with their wrongheaded policy. We have come to \nexpect that.\n  They have questioned our patriotism and called us defeatists.\n  When we challenged the President's misguided policy, they accused us \nof having political motives and being partisan. But all of their \ncriticisms have a hollow ring, because the administration has been so \nconsistently wrong about the war in Iraq.\n  They were wrong about the link between al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein.\n  They were wrong about Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass \ndestruction. They were wrong about America being greeted as liberators. \nThey were wrong about the insurgency being in its last throes. And they \nare wrong to deny that Iraq is in a civil war. The American people are \nfar ahead of the administration. For all of us who oppose this \nmisguided war, our goals have always been clear: to protect the lives \nof our soldiers and to protect our national security.\n  We have an obligation to stand up for our troops and stand up to our \nPresident when he stubbornly refuses to change course in Iraq.\n  This legislation will do that. It will change the mission of our \nmilitary away from combat and require the\n\n[[Page S3810]]\n\nPresident to begin to redeploy American combat troops out of Iraq in 4 \nmonths. The target date for the completion of the redeployment is March \n2008, 1 year from now. A limited number of troops would remain in Iraq \nafter that, to train and equip the Iraqi Security Forces, to conduct \ncounter-terrorism operations, and to guarantee the safety of our \nsoldiers.\n  Legislation is clearly necessary to give the Iraqi Government enough \nincentive to step up to the plate, work out its political differences, \nand take responsibility for Iraq's future.\n  Our proposal is consistent with the bipartisan Iraq Study Group's \nfindings. It is also consistent with the wishes of the American people, \nwho want most of our troops home within a year. How much clearer does \nit have to be before Republicans in Congress and the President finally \nrespond to the voices of the American people? We are meeting our \nresponsibilities by changing the mission of our military. We are not \nmicromanaging the war.\n  Many of us oppose the war, but all of us support our troops. We don't \nwant to keep sending more and more of them into the middle of a civil \nwar. Under no circumstances do we want them to go to war without proper \narmor and equipment. Our troops deserve better. Their families and \nloved ones deserve better.\n  For the sake of our men and women in uniform in Iraq and the American \npeople, it is time for us to take a stand. We need to adopt a new \nstrategy. We need to make clear to the Iraqi Government that the \nmission of our troops must change and that we have a clear timeframe \nfor their departure from Iraq.\n  The Senate will fail our troops unless we vote to change course and \nbegin to bring our soldiers home.\n  At the end of this debate, the American people will know where each \nof us stands. On our side of the aisle, we stand with the American \npeople. The voters told us in November to change course and begin to \nbring our troops home, and that is what we want to do.\n  We stand with our troops. We and we alone are the ones insisting on a \npolicy worthy of their courage and sacrifice.\n  We stand for protecting America's national security. The war in Iraq \nhas been a disaster from the start. It has made America more hated in \nthe world. It has made it harder to win the war against terrorism. It \nhas made it harder to work with other nations on every issue.\n  Peace and progress in Iraq must be earned by Iraqis and their \nneighbors.\n  We must no longer send our brave soldiers to an uncertain fate on the \nstreets of Baghdad.\n  We must begin to bring them home, to the hero's welcome they have \nsurely earned.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the Cochran amendment, \nwhich would strike language in the bill that takes a significant step \ntoward ending our involvement in the war in Iraq.\n  The language I am referring to won the support of 48 Senators just a \nfew weeks ago. I voted for it then and will vote to retain it today. \nWhile it does not go as far or as fast as I would like, it would \neffectively end the President's misguided policies in Iraq by \nterminating, within 120 days, the current open-ended military mission \nin Iraq. At that point, U.S. troops could remain in Iraq for three \nspecified, narrow purposes. The remainder of our troops would be \nredeployed. This provision is binding and it would bring to an end our \ncurrent involvement in perhaps the greatest foreign policy mistake in \nour country's history.\n  Some of my colleagues continue to argue that Congress should defer to \nthe Commander in Chief when it comes to Iraq, that we should give him \nthe opportunity to change course in Iraq, or that we should allow his \nescalation plan the chance to succeed. Those arguments ignore our \ncongressional responsibilities. Congress authorized this war and it is \nin our power to bring it to a close. More importantly, we have not just \nthe power but the responsibility to end a war that is draining vital \nnational security resources in pursuit of a goal that cannot be \nachieved militarily. The political problems that are driving much of \nthe insurgency and sectarian strife in Iraq are tragic and important. \nThey require the attention of U.S. policymakers. They do not require in \nfact, they cannot be solved by a massive and indefinite U.S. military \npresence in Iraq. Our troops continue to perform heroically in Iraq but \nthere is no military solution to Iraq's problems.\n  Some of my colleagues raise the specter of dire consequences if we \nredeploy U.S. forces from Iraq. That is precisely why we need a \nstrategic approach to redeployment, one that addresses ongoing \ninstability and other threats with our intelligence, diplomatic, \neconomic and, in a limited manner, military capabilities. Not only is \nthe continuation of this war not going to end sectarian and insurgent \nviolence, it puts off the day when we develop a comprehensive strategy \nfor Iraq that is sustainable and fits squarely within the larger \nstruggle of fighting al-Qaida.\n  As long as the President's policies continue, our troops will \ncontinue to put their lives on the line, our constituents will continue \nputting billions of their dollars into this war, our military readiness \nwill continue to erode, our Guard and Reserve members will continue to \nface heavy burdens, and our ability to respond to an array of national \nsecurity challenges will continue to suffer. From Somalia to \nAfghanistan to the ongoing fight against al-Qaida, we face threats and \nchallenges that require serious attention and resources. Right now, far \ntoo much of both are being spent on a single country. It is this \nsingle-minded and self-defeating policy that needs to end, and it is up \nto Congress to do so.\n  Time and again, the President has made it clear that nothing not the \nwishes of the American people, not the advice of military and foreign \npolicy experts, not the concerns of members of both parties will \ndissuade him from pursuing policies in Iraq that are not working. Faced \nwith a clear mandate from the voters last November, he stalled for \ntime, before announcing not just a continuation but an escalation of \nhis policies. Congress cannot wait for the President to change course \nwe need to change the course ourselves.\n  The provision that Senator Cochran seeks to strike represents a \nchange of course. It requires redeployment of our troops while \nrecognizing that the U.S. has an ongoing role to play in addressing the \nterrorist threat in Iraq. While Iraq was not a hot-bed of terrorism \nbefore the President led us to war in that country, al-Qaida and its \nallies are trying to use the anger and frustrations unleashed by that \nwar to their advantage. Like Afghanistan and Somalia, Iraq will need to \nbe closely monitored to ensure that it does not become a failed state \nand breeding ground for terrorism. And we must be prepared to pursue \ntargeted missions to take out terrorists. But maintaining 140,000 U.S. \ntroops in Iraq is not the way to defeat al-Qaida. And military \noperations of any size will only succeed if they are combined with \nother measures including diplomatic, economic and intelligence measures \nas part of a comprehensive strategy for defeating the terrorists who \nthreaten our country. Al-Qaida is not a one-country franchise it is a \nglobal threat that requires a global response.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to address the \namendment offered by Senator Cochran. The Senate finds itself in the \nsame position it was in just 2 weeks ago, when it considered an \namendment offered by the majority leader, Senator Reid. Senate \namendment No. 643, offered by the Senior Senator from Mississippi, who \nis the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee, would strike the \nlanguage that is essentially that of S. J. Res. 9, which the Senate \nrejected on March 15, 2007. I draw to the attention of my colleagues my \nstatement in the Record of March 15, 2007, at page 53166.\n  As I stated 2 weeks ago, I would be prepared to cross party lines, as \nI have done in the past when I thought it warranted, if I agreed with \nthe thrust of the resolution. Seven Senators of the minority joined \nwith the majority in voting for cloture several weeks ago to move ahead \nwith the debate and try to come to a resolution on the Iraqi issue. I \nwas one of the seven. I would not hesitate to do so again if I agreed, \nbut I cannot agree with the language requiring that not later than 120 \ndays after enactment to have phased redeployment of U.S. forces, with \nthe goal of redeploying by March 31, 2008, all U.S. combat forces in \nIraq.\n\n[[Page S3811]]\n\n  The thrust of the language in the bill, however, is to leave Iraq in \na year, something that will ensure defeat--as setting a timetable \nsimply enables our opponents to wait us out.\n  I think beyond that, the idea of having the Congress of the United \nStates micromanage the war is simply not realistic, and perhaps it may \neven be unlawful. I note in the case of Fleming v. Page, in 1850, the \nSupreme Court said:\n\n       As Commander in Chief, he is authorized to direct the \n     movements of the naval and military forces placed by law at \n     his command, and to employ them in the manner he may deem \n     most effectual to harass and conquer and subdue the enemy.\n\n  That is a fairly forceful statement that it is not up to the Congress \nto micromanage a war but that it is up to the Commander in Chief, the \nPresident of the United States. That is not to say that the Congress \ndoes not have authority in the premises. I continue to seek hearings by \nthe Judiciary Committee on the relative powers, authority of the \nCongress under the Constitution, with our power of the purse and our \npower to maintain and direct armies, contrasted with the President's \npower as Commander in Chief.\n  I believe, however, it is impractical and of questionable legal \nauthority for us to seek to micromanage the war if the consequences of \ngiving an order to the President would just enable the enemy to wait us \nout. That is not to say that at sometime in the future it may be \nnecessary, and there may be a considered joint judgment by the \nCongress, to use the extraordinary power of the purse to implement our \nconstitutional authority to maintain armies to effectuate a withdrawal.\n  I had one additional thought to the substance of my floor statement \nof March 15. We may find victory, unexpectedly, as Winston Churchill \nsaid in a June 18, 1940 speech, when he was commenting on World War I:\n\n       During the first four years of the last war the Allies \n     experienced nothing but disaster and disappointment. That was \n     our constant fear: one blow after another, terrible losses, \n     frightful dangers. Everything miscarried. And yet at the end \n     of those four years the morale of the Allies was higher than \n     that of the Germans, who had moved from one aggressive \n     triumph to another, and who stood everywhere triumphant \n     invaders of the lands into which they had broken. During that \n     war we repeatedly asked ourselves the question: How are we \n     going to win? And no one was able ever to answer it with much \n     precision, until at the end, quite suddenly, quite \n     unexpectedly, our terrible foe collapsed before us, and we \n     were so glutted with victory that in our folly we threw it \n     away.\n\n  Churchill's words suggest that if we maintain our determination we \ncan win although the path to victory, at the moment, is very uncertain.\n  Furthermore, the President has issued a veto threat should \nlegislation contain the provision Senator Cochran's amendment would \nstrike. Such an action would deprive funds vital to U.S. troops and the \noperations of the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for her \nleadership and floor management.\n  The Cochran amendment would strike the heart of the provision \nrelating to Iraq from this supplemental appropriations bill. The main \npoint of our provision is a requirement that the President commence a \nreduction of U.S. forces from Iraq not later than 120 days after \nenactment. Not included in the reduction would be those forces that are \nessential for force protection, training and equipping Iraqi forces, \nand conducting targeted counterterrorism operations.\n  This language is essential because nothing else has been successful \nin convincing the Iraqis that they have to take responsibility for \ntheir own country and that they must make the political compromises \nthat are necessary to end the sectarian violence and defeat the \ninsurgency in Iraq. Only when the Iraqis realize the mission of U.S. \nforces is going to change and that we are going to reduce the number of \nU.S. forces in Iraq will they realize we cannot save them from \nthemselves, and that they need to act to meet the commitments they made \nto themselves and to us.\n  Commitments are only words unless they are fulfilled. Last month, \nduring our debate on Iraq, I put in the Record Secretary Rice's letter \nto me of January 2007 which had an enclosure of the listing of the \npolitical commitments and the timelines the Iraqis themselves had \nestablished. Virtually none of those commitments has been met, despite \nthe fact most of them were to have been fulfilled last year, and all \nbut one were to have been accomplished prior to this month. They \ncommitted themselves to approve a provincial elections law and they set \na date for a provincial elections law by October of 2006. They set a \ndate to approve militias and other armed formations by December 2006. \nThey set a date for the constitutional review committee to complete its \nwork by January 2007. They made a commitment to conduct a referendum on \nconstitutional amendments which was to have been accomplished by this \nmonth. They violated every single one of those commitments.\n  We need to retain this language. We need to retain the language that \nwe begin to reduce the number of American forces in Iraq beginning in 4 \nmonths because that reduction is the action-forcing mechanism--the sign \nto the Iraqi leaders we cannot save them from themselves, and their \nfuture is in their hands, not our hands.\n  The most graphic demonstration of the importance of our provision is \nthe fact that even our senior leaders in this administration, while \nopposing our position, have used the growing support for our position \nto try to impress upon the Iraqi leaders they have to move promptly to \nsettle their differences and to meet their commitments.\n  Last month while in Baghdad, Secretary Rice used the restiveness in \nWashington to emphasize to the Iraqi leaders the growth of American \nfrustration with the absence of a political settlement in Iraq. She \nsaid she had ``made clear that some of the debate in Washington is \nindicative of the concerns that the American people have about the \nprospects for success'' if Iraq's leaders do not quickly take the steps \nneeded to ensure longer-term stability.\n  Ambassador Khalilzad, in a television interview on March 9, said the \ndebate in Congress:\n\n       Sends a message to the Iraqis that the patience of the \n     American people is running out. And--\n\n  He said, Ambassador Khalilzad said--\n\n     that is helpful to my diplomacy.\n\n  The Iraqi Study Group said:\n\n       The open-ended commitment of American forces does not \n     provide the Iraqi government with the incentive that it needs \n     to take political actions that give Iraq the best chance of \n     quelling sectarian violence. In the absence of such an \n     incentive--\n\n  The Iraq Study Group said--\n\n     in the absence of ending the open-ended commitment that has \n     been made to Iraq, the Iraqi government might continue to \n     delay taking those difficult actions.\n\n  I think perhaps General Casey said it best:\n\n       The longer U.S. forces continue to bear the main burden of \n     Iraq's security, it lengthens the time that the government of \n     Iraq has to take the hard decisions about reconciliation in \n     dealing with the militias.\n\n  General Casey had it right. Let us not sustain the Cochran amendment. \nLet's keep this critically important action-forcing mechanism in the \nbill where it will do some good to force those Iraqi leaders to finally \nrecognize their future is in their hands, not ours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Lieberman.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today the Senate approaches a decisive \nturning point in the history of our engagement in Iraq, a moment that \nwill have repercussions not only for the future of that country but for \nthe security of our country as well.\n  The immediate question before us is direct. Should Congress impose a \ndeadline for the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq? To that question I \nanswer: No, no, no.\n  We all know the circumstances under which this vote is taking place. \nThe administration is politically weak. The war is politically \nunpopular. It has never been easier to advocate a withdrawal. But I \ncannot support it because I believe deeply that it would be wrong. Our \ncause in Iraq remains just and necessary, and we continue to have the \nprospect of achieving success there.\n  If passed, this legislation would order a withdrawal of American \ntroops from Iraq to begin in 120 days, regardless of conditions on the \nground, regardless of whether we are succeeding or failing, regardless \nof the consequences for\n\n[[Page S3812]]\n\nAmerica's security, regardless of the consequences for our allies in \nthe region, and regardless of the recommendations of the man we \nunanimously put in charge of our troops there--GEN David Petraeus. In \nshort, this withdrawal would be ordered by this legislation regardless \nof reality.\n  This congressionally ordered withdrawal of our troops from Iraq would \nessentially be giving up on our cause in Iraq just when our prospects \nare picking up there. It would snatch defeat from the jaws of progress \nin Iraq today--progress that is critically important to our success in \nthe larger war against terrorism.\n  What then are the arguments given to justify such an arbitrary order \nto our troops from this Congress so far away?\n  First, proponents of withdrawal keep returning to the proposition \nthat American soldiers shouldn't be policing a civil war. Surely my \ncolleagues don't mean to say the U.S. military has never or should \nnever police a civil war. That would certainly come as a surprise to \nour soldiers who have been keeping the peace in Bosnia and Kosovo over \nthe past decade, dispatched there wisely and strongly under a \nDemocratic President with the support of Democrats in Congress. \nClearly, our military has policed civil wars in the past and will do so \nand must do so in the future. So why do proponents of withdrawal from \nIraq keep insisting it shouldn't happen now? The answer has to do with \nthe way some people choose to characterize what is happening in Iraq.\n  When they suggest our soldiers are stuck in a civil war there, it \nsuggests the conflict has become hopeless, a pit of violence where \nthere are no heroes, only villains, and where our military cannot \npossibly do any good. Is this the case? I think the facts suggest not. \nThere are more heroes by far than villains in Iraq today and, most of \nall, there is the overwhelming majority of the Iraqi people who are the \ninnocent victims of violence and want nothing more than to live secure \nand free lives.\n  Iraq has a government--a government freely elected by the people; a \ngovernment where every day Iraqis of every ethnicity and sectarian \nidentity come together. That is not a civil war. The Iraqi Government \nhas faults and weaknesses, to be sure, and we should be using every \ninstrument at our disposal to pressure its leaders to make better \nchoices. But there is a world of difference between the moderates who \ncompose the Iraqi Government and the extremists who seek to murder \nthem.\n  The image of Iraq as a country in which everyone is complicit in the \nviolence also overlooks something else. It overlooks the innocent \nvictims of that violence who are the majority. The truth is we are \nconfronted in Iraq today with a deliberated, calculated campaign of \nmurder of civilians, often on the basis of religious identity alone, by \ninsurgents and terrorists.\n  All of us should be able to unite around the proposition, therefore, \nthat we as Americans have a moral responsibility not to pick up and \nwalk away and turn our backs on the slaughter. Like the Serb death \nsquads that tried to ethnically cleanse Kosovo or Hutu extremists in \nRwanda, or the jingaweit today in Darfur, the sectarian violence we are \nwitnessing in Iraq is directed at the extermination of human beings on \nthe basis of nothing more than who they are.\n  It is an awful irony of this debate that many of the same people who \nconsistently and correctly call on the United States to do more to stop \nthe genocide in Darfur now demand we abandon the Iraqis and invite a \ngenocide there.\n  I know some believe the violence in Iraq is inevitable, the outgrowth \nof ancient hatreds that exist outside the bounds of normal politics. We \nheard those arguments before also. We heard them in the 1990s about \nYugoslavia and about Rwanda. Surely, from those conflicts, we should \nknow better than that now.\n  The wanton slaughter of innocent people that our soldiers are trying \nto stop in Baghdad, and now with some success, is not the inevitable \nproduct of ancient hatreds but the consequence of a deliberate, \ncalculated strategy by an identifiable group of perpetrators, first and \nforemost al-Qaida. We know this because al-Qaida itself has said so. \nIts leaders have stated openly that they have worked to foment hatred, \nfear, and violence between Sunnis and Shiites, precisely because al-\nQaida knows it represents their best opportunity to overthrow the \nelected Iraqi Government, to sow the seeds of chaos, to stamp out any \nhope of Middle Eastern democracy, and, sadly, as this debate shows \ntoday, to push the United States of America--the world's superpower, \nthe embodiment of the hopes and dreams of so many for freedom--to the \npoint of retreat from Iraq.\n  This is also why the notion expressed in the supplemental that we can \nseparate the fight against terrorism from the fight against sectarian \nviolence in Iraq simply defies reality. The fact is, the worst \nsectarian violence in Iraq is being committed by al-Qaida and other \nIslamist terrorists.\n  The biggest cause of the violence in Iraq is not the split between \nthe Sunnis and Shiites but a specific ideology--the ideology of Islamic \nextremism--that is trying to exploit that divide for its own evil ends.\n  The success of that ideology is not inevitable. Thanks to General \nPetraeus, his troops, and the new strategy, sectarian violence is down. \nMaqtada al-Sadr has disappeared. The Mahdi army is splintering. \nDisplaced Iraqi families are returning to their homes.\n  Of course, we will not know for some time to what extent the new \nstrategy will succeed, but it is clear that, for the first time in a \nlong time, there is reason for cautious optimism about Iraq. Why would \nwe, at this moment, order a withdrawal of the very troops that are \nbringing greater security and a cause for optimism?\n  Mr. President, the record of the past 2 months shows Prime Minister \nMaliki has allowed and encouraged U.S. forces to sweep into Sadr City. \nHe has worked with General Petraeus to ensure that all of the Iraqi \nArmy units required by the new strategy are available. He has flown to \nthe heart of Al Anbar Province to meet with Sunni leaders. These \nbreakthroughs have happened not in spite of but because of the American \ncommitment to Iraq and because of the presence of General Petraeus and \nhis troops.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider what it will mean if Congress now \norders our troops to pull back from this battle, just at the moment \nthat they are beginning to succeed. Consider the consequences if we \nknowingly and willingly withdraw our forces and abandon one of the few \nstates in the Middle East to have had free, competitive elections as an \nalternative to extremism and violence.\n  I understand the frustration and anger and sheer sense of exhaustion \nso many feel about Iraq. I am acutely aware of the enormous toll this \nwar has taken. But I ask those determined to order a withdrawal to \nthink carefully about the consequences, and not just geopolitical but \nmoral, for the United States. We cannot redeploy from our moral \nresponsibility in Iraq or in our foreign policy, more generally. It is \ncontrary to our traditions. It is contrary to our values. It is \ncontrary to our interests. Yet that is precisely what this Congress \nwill be calling for if we order our troops to withdraw now. That is \nprecisely what the Congress will be calling for if we order our troops \nto withdraw from Iraq now, regardless of what is happening on the \nground.\n  I appeal to my colleagues, don't do this. Give General Petraeus and \nhis troops a chance to succeed for us in Iraq. Strike this language \nfrom this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 12\\1/2\\ minutes. The \nRepublicans have 13 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  We need to change course in Iraq. That is why I support the \nsupplemental bill now before the Senate and oppose the Cochran \namendment that is pending. This underlying bill finally sets a new \ndirection for our mission in Iraq. It begins to redeploy our troops, \nand it helps us refocus our efforts on fighting and winning the war on \nterror.\n  Mr. President, our troops have done everything we have asked them to \ndo. Now it is time to start bringing them\n\n[[Page S3813]]\n\nhome. It is time for the Iraqi people and for the Iraqi Government to \ntake responsibility for their own country. We should not be sending \nmore and more Americans into the middle of a civil war. The conflict in \nIraq is not going to be solved by military force alone. It is going to \nrequire a political solution among Iraqis. So this underlying bill sets \nbenchmarks for the Iraqi Government on the types of progress that we \nall agree they ought to be making. They should not be stricken from \nthis by the Cochran amendment.\n  The President wants to commit more American servicemembers to an \nopen-ended conflict. This bill recognizes that we need a new strategy. \nWe need to do what the Iraqi Study Group and what many generals and \nwhat the American people have called for. We need to redeploy our \ntroops. The bill says a redeployment should begin within 120 days, and \nit sets the goal of having most U.S. forces out of Iraq by next March.\n  Importantly, this bill helps us take care of those who are injured \nfighting for our country. It is time we focused our attention on those \nmen and women who have sacrificed so much, who have come home and have \nendured the hardship we have seen at Walter Reed and other facilities \nacross this country. We need to make sure they get the resources they \nneed, and this bill does that.\n  I am pleased to support the underlying bill. I oppose the Cochran \namendment, and I support this bill because it sets a new direction for \nour policy in Iraq and it provides important new support for our \nservicemembers and veterans who are here at home.\n  I retain the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my long-term friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi. We came to the Senate together \nsome 29 years ago. I commend him for the leadership he has provided \nthroughout his many years and, particularly, on this coming vote, which \nis most important--not just to the Senate but to the whole Congress and \nto the people of the United States and to the world. I strongly support \nthe amendment of the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran.\n  Some many weeks ago, shortly after January 10, when the President \nannounced his new strategy for a surge, I was among those few voices on \nthis side that expressed concern about that initiative. I believed that \nthis Nation had invested so heavily in Iraq, in life, in limb, and an \nextraordinary amount of money, much of that having been spent on the \ntraining of the Iraqi security forces, and that the time had come for \nthose security forces to bear the brunt of the battle. Our group, \nhaving drawn up a resolution, endeavored to try to get it debated, but \nthe record shows that opportunity, and the opportunity to vote on it, \nwas not given. But that is history.\n  At this time, however, I believe the operations of our troops under \nthe new strategy are well underway. We have many men and women of our \nArmed Forces in harm's way, and we must be very cautious as to the \nmessage we send at this time.\n  Mr. President, I say most respectfully that with this current draft \nwe are trying to strike out the language that, if allowed to stand, \nwould send a sound all over the world. It would be the bugle of \nretreat; it would be echoed and repeated from every minaret throughout \nIraq: The coalition forces have decided to take the first step \nbackward.\n  We cannot send that message at this time. I will be among those who \nwill constantly challenge any aspect of the policies of this \nadministration which I believe are not in the best interest. I have two \namendments that, hopefully, will be considered in the context of the \npending bill. One calls for an independent investigation--independent \nof the Department of Defense and all entities of the Federal \nGovernment--of the Iraqi security forces, principally the army and, to \nsome extent, the police, to determine what the status is of those \nforces today.\n  What has been the result of the billions of dollars we have expended \nover 2\\1/2\\ years to train and equip them? Are they now, or in the \nimmediate future, able to carry the burden of this fight to enable the \npeople and the Government of Iraq to have greater security and \neventually achieve the goals and the full reins of a democracy?\n  The other amendment I have calls for a table of benchmarks and a \nreporting sequence from our administration as to whether the Iraqis are \nor are not meeting those benchmarks because any option laid down is \ndependent on the capability of the Iraqi security forces. Early reports \nin the engagements thus far indicate that, in some measures, they have \nmet the commitments they made to have sent battalions, to have engaged \nwith such limited aggression that has been brought against them in the \ncourse of this surge and against the coalition forces. Nevertheless, it \nis the American forces that are primarily in the lead, primarily in the \nsupport role and carrying the greater burden of this battle.\n  So at this time I do not think it is wise to sound that bugle, that \nsound of retreat. Think of the consequences if that nation implodes and \nfractures and the Government and all of the gains that we have gotten \nthus far are lost. Think of the consequences on, for example, the \npotential for other energy sources to be developed in that region--\nenergy that is vital to the world, energy that must flow from that \nregion through the Straits of Hormuz that could be jeopardized if there \nis a convulsion among the border states and the spreading of the \nanarchy that could simply flow from this most distressed land of \nuncertainty we call Iraq, this situation that is so fragile at this \ntime.\n  So I urge my colleagues, with no disrespect to those who put this in \nthe bill, to support the Cochran amendment.\n  Mr. President, while I have the floor, I simply ask unanimous consent \nto send a modification to the desk for an amendment filed, No. 698.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Virginia, I \nwould have to object at this time. We are happy to work with the \nSenator during the vote to deal with the modification.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I respect the manager of the bill, and I \nthank her.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority controls 10 minutes. The minority \ncontrols 6\\1/2\\ minutes. That includes 10 minutes for the leadership.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the amendment which we are going to vote \non very shortly in the Senate is a historic amendment. It is an \namendment which I think will be followed very carefully not just in the \nUnited States but around the world, particularly in Iraq.\n  Understand what this amendment does. The Cochran amendment removes \nthe language which starts to bring American troops home. The Cochran \nlanguage, instead, calls on the President to make periodic reports to \nCongress on the progress in Iraq. With all due respect to those who \nsupport that amendment, periodic reports will not bring this war to an \nend. Periodic messages from the White House will not turn over this war \nto the Iraqis to defend their own country.\n  What we have seen in Iraq is the worst foreign policy mistake in our \ntime. We have paid so dearly in our Nation for this mistake. Over 3,200 \nof our bravest soldiers have given their lives. Over 24,000 have come \nhome injured, some with serious injuries that will haunt them for a \nlifetime. We have spent $500 billion of our treasure in Iraq that could \nhave been spent in the United States for the betterment of our people. \nWe have given to the Iraqi people more than any other Nation could ask \nfor. We have stood behind them, we have deposed their dictator, we have \ngiven them free governance and a chance at a constitution and free \nelections. Now it is time for us to make it clear to the Iraqis that it \nis their country, it is their war, and it is their future.\n  This President recently said we need to continue to send soldiers, \nmore soldiers, into Iraq. Sadly, many of them are being sent to battle \nwithout the equipment, the training, the rest they\n\n[[Page S3814]]\n\nneed, and the time at home with their families. We are pushing these \nbrave men and women to the limit. Voting for the Cochran amendment says \nit is enough that the President sends us every 60 or 90 days a report; \nthat he tells us how things are going; how we are doing. Is that why we \nare in Congress, to receive reports from the President, to put them on \na bookshelf somewhere and hope a staffer has time to read them? I think \nnot.\n  What we are here to do is speak for the American people who want a \nnew direction in Iraq. They want this Congress to stand up once and for \nall and say to this President that this policy has to change. American \nsoldiers must start to come home in an orderly manner and the Iraqis \nhave to stand and defend their own country. A vote for the Cochran \namendment, sadly, will take away any type of incentive for the Iraqis \nto do the right thing for their own Nation.\n  Many have studied this over the last 4 years, a war that has gone on \nlonger than World War II. They have come to the same conclusions--the \nIraq Study Group and many others--it is time for the United States to \nannounce a new policy. The Cochran amendment says we will stay with the \nold policy; we will receive periodic reports from the White House. That \nis not the answer.\n  What we need to do is to stand behind our soldiers by bringing them \nhome as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? That exceeds the Senator's \ntime.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1\\1/2\\ minutes before the 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am going to use about 5 minutes of my \nleader time after Senator Hutchison, and she needs a minimum of 3 \nminutes. I will ask unanimous consent that Senator Hutchison be allowed \nto have 1\\1/2\\ minutes of my leader time, and I will take about 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will not object if we can add an equal \namount of time to the majority side.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, let me ask for 2 minutes. I thought \nthe last time the Chair announced the time it was 6\\1/2\\ minutes after \nSenator Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is 6\\1/2\\ minutes, but the leader gets 5 of \nthose 6\\1/2\\.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I understand. I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed 2 minutes, after which the leader will then be allowed his 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me say that the distinguished deputy leader on the \nother side said that if the Cochran amendment passes, it will be the \nsame strategy, nothing new, nothing changed.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the President heard \nwhat the people said in the elections of last year. The President has \nchanged the policy. We have confirmed a general to go over there and \ndirect a new strategy, which, by all accounts, is beginning to have \nsome hope of success.\n  If we do what is in this bill, by not passing the Cochran amendment, \nit says that the President must commence the phased redeployment of \nU.S. forces from Iraq not later than 120 days after the date of this \nact. That puts a bulls-eye on our troops on the ground. It says we are \nnot committed to do what we said we would do, to stand with Iraq to \nhave a stable democracy in their country. It says that we are just \ngoing to leave.\n  We are not stating any benchmarks; we are not stating any success \nstrategies; we are saying 120 days and we are gone. What do you think \nthat does to our troops on the ground? What does it say to our allies? \nMost importantly, what does it say to the enemy? It says the greatest \ncountry in the world is going to be there as long as it is not very \nhard. But when it gets too tough for America, we will leave and we will \nwalk out.\n  That should not be the message of the greatest country on Earth, and \nI hope we will pass the Cochran amendment and do what is right for our \ncountry for the long term.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, less than 2 weeks ago, a bipartisan \nmajority of Senators put aside disagreements over the war in Iraq and \nagreed on at least one thing and that one thing was that announcing a \nsurrender date for our troops is certainly not in our national \ninterest.\n  It is wrong by the troops who have been risking their lives to bring \nstability and order throughout Baghdad and Iraq. Certainly, they do not \nwant to tell the enemy they intend to run up the white flag 365 days \nfrom today. Setting a date for withdrawal is akin to sending a memo to \nour enemies to rest, refit, and replan until the day we leave. It is a \nmemo to our friends, too, telling them we plan to walk away and leave \nthem on their own, regardless of what we leave behind. We know as well \nas they do that we can expect the following: a Sunni minority exposed \nto the whims of the Shia majority, ethnic cleansing, and regional \ninstability the consequences of which are painful to contemplate but \neasy to predict.\n  It is wrong by the commanders in the field, who have been sent into \nbattle with a mission to fulfill and who know better than we do how to \ncarry out that mission.\n  It is wrong by the Iraqis themselves, who have risked their lives and \nfortunes on the strength of a promise that the United States of America \nwould stand with them and see this struggle through until the end.\n  We voted against setting a surrender date, despite intense political \npressure because common sense tells us that politicians in Washington \ndon't tell the commanders on the battlefield when the fight is won.\n  Common sense told us something else a few months ago. It told us we \nhad to change course, and that is exactly what we have done. We \nrealized the only way we would win this fight would be to secure the \ncity of Baghdad, the seat of the Iraqi Government, and home to a \nquarter of its population. We implemented a strategy to do it.\n  Some have said there is no military, only a political solution to \nending the violence in Iraq. But we can't pretend the Iraqis will forge \na political solution unless they are secure in their homes and on their \nstreets. That is the key to the Petraeus strategy and to our efforts in \nBaghdad.\n  We have been pursuing that new course for the last few months. A \nDemocratic-controlled Senate sent a new commander into the field of \nbattle to carry it out. We have seen early signs of success, enough to \nbelieve this new approach was exactly the right thing to do.\n  Now Congress is being asked to fund it. I agree this is also the \nright thing to do. We are not about to pull the rug out from under our \nsoldiers in the field just as they begin to carry out the mission we \nhave sent them on. We are going to give them everything they need, and \nwe are not going to slip a deadline now into their security package.\n  The Constitution gives those who oppose this war a clear and concrete \nway of expressing their views, and that is to vote against funding it. \nAttempting to have it both ways--by slipping a withdrawal date into \nthis bill and making the support of our troops contingent on a \ndangerous and defeatist surrender date--was wrong a week and a half ago \nand it is wrong now.\n  It is also dangerous. President Bush has repeatedly said he will veto \na bill that includes a surrender date. He said it again this morning. \nHe said this spending bill, in its current form, assumes and enforces \nthe failure of the new strategy even before American commanders are \nable to implement their plans and he will veto it if it reaches his \ndesk.\n  I urge my colleagues not to take us down this path, not to delay the \ndelivery of emergency funding to our troops by forcing a Presidential \nveto. There is no need. Nothing has changed since the majority of us \nvoted against this very same timeline the week before last.\n  Stripping the withdrawal date will not prevent anyone in this Chamber\n\n[[Page S3815]]\n\nfrom expressing his or her views on Iraq. Its only effect would be to \ndelay the delivery of much needed funding and equipment to our soldiers \nin the field. I strongly urge my colleagues to strike this dangerous \nprovision and support the Cochran amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Kennedy has 2\\1/2\\ minutes, but he \nis not here, so I will proceed to wrap up the debate.\n  My friend, the Republican leader, said nothing has changed since the \nlast vote. That is the whole problem, nothing has changed. Nothing has \nchanged in over 4 years of this bloody war in Iraq. One course. That \ncourse has been followed from the very beginning and has never changed.\n  The choice tonight is very clear. It is as clear as it is important. \nIt is a choice between staying the course in Iraq and changing the \ncourse in that faraway land. With their votes, Senators tonight can \nsend a message to the President that it is time to come with us, to \nhelp find a new way and end this intractable civil war or Senators can \nallow this course to continue, allow President Bush to commit more U.S. \ntroops in this open-ended Iraqi civil war.\n  After more than 4 years, the related deaths of 3,250 of our brave \nsoldiers, and the wounded tens of thousands of these men and women, it \nis time we should change. This war is not worth the spilling of another \ndrop of American blood. As it stands, this emergency legislation before \nthis body tonight will send a signal to our President that it is time \nfor a new direction, it is time to set benchmarks, it is time to send a \nsignal to the Iraqi Government that they must take responsibility for \ntheir own people, and it is time to start redeploying our troops and \nrecommitting ourselves to fighting al-Qaida and other terrorists around \nthe world.\n  If this amendment passes, sending a message to the President to \nchange course, that is the right way to go. If, however, Senators \ndecide to allow the President to continue along the line he has \noutlined for more than 4 years, that would be a shame. That is what \nthis amendment is all about, whether this carefully crafted legislation \nwill be stripped from this bill. It would then turn out to be, instead \nof a bill that demands the President change his policy, that we will \nhave a bill that gives the President a blank check and a green light to \ncontinue the failed course we have had in Iraq.\n  Without this language in the supplemental, the President would be \nfree to keep U.S. troops in Iraq indefinitely, serving an impossible \nmission of policing an acknowledged civil war. Staying the course in \nIraq will not lead to success. There are no military solutions. My \nfriend, the Republican leader, said ``some say.'' ``Some say.'' Well, \none person who says the war can't be won militarily is the man we have \ncommanding the troops over there, General Petraeus. He said 20 percent \nof the war is military, the rest is political and diplomatic and \neconomic. That is the way it is.\n  The bill, without this amendment, offers a responsible strategy in \nIraq, which the American people asked for last November, a strategy \nthat will maximize our chances to succeed in Iraq and enhance our \nability to defeat al-Qaida. General after general after general has \nsaid that is the right strategy. A group of patriotic Americans devoted \na year of their lives to giving the American people and this Congress \nand the President the advice of their collective wisdom--and it was \nwisdom--former Secretaries of Defense, Secretaries of State, college \nprofessors, former Members of Congress. They came to the conclusion \nthat we have in this amendment. It is in this bill. The Iraq Study \nGroup agrees with what we have in this legislation.\n\n  It is time for the Senate to put a stamp of approval on people such \nas Secretary Jim Baker. He is a man who is a card-carrying Republican. \nHe served as Secretary of State, Chief of Staff for the President of \nthe United States, and he has held other Cabinet positions. He is an \nexample of what that Iraq Study Group was all about. They did it \nbecause it was the right thing to do. The reason we are having even \nminimal contact right now with Iranians is because of Secretary Baker. \nSecretary Baker said you do not only negotiate with your friends, you \nhave to negotiate with your enemies.\n  I have come to know very well a person who is part of my security \ndetail. He has traveled with me all over the country--has been to my \nhome in Searchlight. He is now headed for his third tour of duty in \nIraq. He has two little children. He is headed for Iraq. He leaves in \nless than a month. I admire James for his courage and his patriotism, \nbut he should not be going back for a third go-around. He is a National \nGuardsman.\n  I understand how some of my colleagues feel. In this Chamber is Joe \nLieberman. There is not a Senator for whom I have more respect than Joe \nLieberman. I know how passionately he feels on this issue.\n  John Warner, seated across from me, is one of my friends. I can say \nthat without any reservation or hesitation. We have served together for \nmany years. I was his subcommittee chairman in the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. I know how he feels about this issue, how torn \nhe is as to what is the right thing to do, what is not the right thing \nto do. I acknowledge the feelings of John Warner and Joe Lieberman, but \nthat does not take away from the way I feel about this issue.\n  I have said on this floor before and I will say it again, the \nsparsely populated State of Nevada has lost 39 soldiers in Iraq. The \nlast one, I called his mother less than 2 weeks ago. Raul Bravo is \ndead. He was 21 years old--a marine on his second tour of duty in Iraq. \nHis mother expressed to me what a tremendous loss this was. He was the \nonly man in her family, she said--she and her three daughters. I admire \nRaul Bravo for going to Iraq twice. He did what he had to do. But we \nhave had too many Raul Bravos dying over there, unnecessarily, in the \nmiddle of a civil war.\n  I listened to my radio yesterday morning, as I do every morning. \nYesterday morning: five dead soldiers the day before.\n  I say sincerely that we should not spill any more blood there. We \nshould start redeploying these troops, have them work in \ncounterterrorism, force protection, training the Iraqis.\n  Every one of my colleagues should understand that the Prime Minister \nof Iraq told the President of the United States to his face the last \ntime they met: Get the American troops out of Baghdad. That is what he \ntold him. This was before the surge that the President came up with. \nThe leader of the country of Iraq told the President of the United \nStates: Get the American troops out of here.\n  The Iraqi people don't want us there. All the polls show \noverwhelmingly the people, Iraqi people, don't want us there. The \nmajority of the people think it is OK to kill and injure Americans. Is \nthat what we want to be involved in? I think not.\n  A lot of people worked very hard on the provision that is subject to \nbeing stricken from this bill. This is a good piece of legislation that \nis in this bill. It is the right thing to do. It is good for America. \nIt is good for our world. And it is good for President Bush.\n  I yield back Senator Kennedy's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to shortly suggest the absence of \na quorum again. I want to tell everybody, it is going to take us a \nlittle while to figure out where we go next. I need to meet with \nSenator McConnell, Senator Byrd, and Senator Cochran. This is not an \neasy proposition. We have cloture in the morning. As we have heard from \nboth sides, this is a very important bill and we have to move as \nquickly as we can. Well over 100 amendments have been filed on this \nbill. That is going to throw a monkey wrench into things. Senator \nMcConnell has worked in good faith for us to get to the point where we \nare today. I hope I have done the same. I represented to Senator \nMcConnell we could have a vote on the Iraq bill, and we have done that. \nI represented to Senator McConnell we could have a vote on the minimum \nwage, and we almost have that worked out. I represented to Senator \nMcConnell there were certain amendments a couple of his Senators wanted \nto offer and we were going to work that out, and I think we have done \nthat.\n  There is something that is wanted on both sides, very important to \nSenator Wyden and Senator Smith, Senator Bingaman and Senator Baucus, \nand others. We are at a point where we can resolve that.\n  Beyond that, it is a legislative mess. Standing here in the well, I \nhave had five Senators come up to me and say they had emergency things \nthey needed done. I asked each of them: Is it in the supplemental? No.\n  It makes it tough to try to be everything to everybody. We need a \nlittle time to see what we can do to work through this. I want to be as \nfair as we can, but this is an unusual piece of legislation. We have a \ncloture vote in the morning. The staff will work during the night to \nfind out which of the amendments that have been filed either are \ngermane or appear to be germane or are not.\n  We will not have a vote in the near future. It will be a little \nwhile. I would say it will probably take us at least 15 minutes before \nwe know where we are going. We have Senator Cochran, Senator Byrd, who \nare as experienced as anyone could be on this most important bill. We \nwill do our best to give everyone an idea of where we are headed.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the majority leader yield for an observation?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I think we are close to sorting out a \nway to go forward, as the majority leader has described. As soon as we \nfinish this colloquy, why don't we get about figuring out how to sort \nthat out.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate that very much. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nreturn to the Kennedy amendment and that a Grassley second-degree \namendment be considered and agreed to; that the Kennedy amendment, as \namended, be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; that on Wednesday, March 28, there be 30 minutes of debate to \nrun concurrently with respect to the Wyden amendment No. 709 and the \nBurr amendment No. 716, with the time equally divided and controlled \nbetween Senators Wyden and Burr or their designees; that the Burr \namendment be modified to be a first-degree amendment; that no \namendments be in order to either amendment; that there then be 30 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on \nH.R. 1591, with the time equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees; that upon the use of time, without further \nintervening action or debate, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation \nto the Wyden amendment, to be followed by a vote in relation to the \nBurr amendment, and then a vote on the motion to invoke cloture; that \nthere be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to each vote; that \non Wednesday, it be in order for Senator Hagel to call up amendment No. \n707 and there be 90 minutes of debate under the control of Senator \nHagel; that upon the use or yielding back of that time, the amendment \nbe withdrawn. That would be whether cloture is invoked or not. And it \nrelates to the Hagel amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have taken, as you know, a long time to \nget to this point. There are a number of other Senators who have \nquestions, and we are still in the process of working our way through \nthat.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that Senator Coburn be recognized to \ncall up six amendments en bloc--Nos. 648, 649, 656, 657, 717, and 718; \nthat once they are reported by number, the amendments be set aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 698, as Modified\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I know there has been a diligent effort on \nboth sides to get the Byrd-Warner amendment cleared. I am hoping to get \nthe final clearance from Senator Stevens. I know where he is, and I \nhave contacted him. If that could just be held in abeyance for a minute \nor two, in the meantime, may I modify one of the amendments that is \nfiled at the desk?\n\n       I ask unanimous consent to modify amendment No. 698.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the amendment is \nso modified.\n  The amendment (No. 698), as modified, is as follows:\n\n                      (Purpose: Relating to Iraq)\n\n       At the end of chapter 3 of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1316. IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On the fourth anniversary of Operation Iraqi Freedom, \n     the regime of a brutal dictator has been replaced by a \n     democratically elected government in the Arab world.\n       (2) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1723, \n     approved November 28, 2006, ``determin[ed] that the situation \n     in Iraq continues to constitute a threat to international \n     peace and security''.\n       (3) More than 137,000 United States military personnel are \n     currently serving in Iraq, like thousands of others since \n     March 2003, with the bravery and professionalism consistent \n     with the finest traditions of the United States armed forces, \n     and are deserving of the support of all Americans, which they \n     have strongly.\n       (4) Many United States military personnel have lost their \n     lives, and many more have been wounded, in Iraq, and the \n     American people will always honor their sacrifices and honor \n     their families.\n\n[[Page S3817]]\n\n       (5) The United States Army and Marine Corps, including \n     their Reserve and National Guard organizations, together with \n     components of the other branches of the military, are under \n     enormous strain from multiple, extended deployments to Iraq \n     and Afghanistan, and these deployments, and those that will \n     follow, will have lasting impacts on the future recruiting, \n     retention and readiness of our Nation's all volunteer force.\n       (6) Iraq is experiencing a deteriorating problem of \n     sectarian and intra-sectarian violence based upon political \n     distrust and cultural differences between some Sunni and Shia \n     Muslims, concentrated primarily in Baghdad.\n       (7) Iraqis must reach political settlements in order to \n     achieve reconciliation, and the failure of the Iraqis to \n     reach such settlements to support a truly unified government \n     greatly contributes to the increasing violence in Iraq.\n       (8) The responsibility for internal security and halting \n     sectarian violence in Iraq must rest primarily with the \n     Government of Iraq, relying on the Iraqi Security Forces \n     (ISF).\n       (9) President George W. Bush said on January 10, 2007, that \n     ``I've made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other \n     leaders that America's commitment is not open-ended'' so as \n     to dispel the contrary impression that exists.\n       (10) It is essential that the Government of Iraq set out \n     measurable and achievable benchmarks and President George W. \n     Bush said, on January 10, 2007, that ``America will change \n     our approach to help the Iraqi government as it works to meet \n     these benchmarks''.\n       (11) According to Secretary of State Rice, Iraq's Policy \n     Committee on National Security agreed upon a set of \n     political, security, and economic benchmarks and an \n     associated timeline in September 2006 that were--\n       (A) reaffirmed by Iraq's Presidency Council on October 6, \n     2007;\n       (B) referenced by the Iraq Study Group; and\n       (C) posted on the website of the President of Iraq.\n       (12) The Secretary of State indicated on January 30, 2007 \n     that ``we expect the Prime Minister will follow through on \n     his pledges to the President that he would take difficult \n     decisions''.\n       (13) The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and \n     the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have testified \n     about, and, or, provided unclassified material to members of \n     Congress on Iraqi commitments and goals.\n       (14) Congress acknowledges that the Baghdad Security Plan \n     is in its initially months and while there are signs of \n     progress, there are also signs of difficulty and uncertainty. \n     For these reasons, and others, Congress must have timely \n     reports to evaluate in performance of roles under the \n     Constitution of the United States.\n       (b) Benchmarks.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) United States strategy in Iraq, hereafter, should be \n     conditioned on the Government of Iraq meeting benchmarks, as \n     told to members of Congress by the President, the Secretary \n     of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff, and reflected in the commitments of \n     the Government of Iraq to the United States, and to the \n     international community, including--\n       (A) forming a Constitutional Review Committee and then \n     completing the Constitutional review;\n       (B) enacting and implementing legislation on de-\n     Bathification;\n       (C) enacting and implementing legislation to ensure the \n     equitable distribution of hydrocarbon resources of the people \n     of Iraq without regard to the sect or ethnicity of \n     recipients, and enacting and implementing legislation to \n     ensure that the energy resources of Iraq benefit Sunni Arabs, \n     Shia Arabs, Kurds, and other Iraqi citizens in an equitable \n     manner;\n       (D) enacting and implementing legislation on procedures to \n     form semi-autonomous regions;\n       (E) enacting and implementing legislation establishing an \n     Independent High Electoral Commission; provincial elections \n     law, provincial council authorities, and a date for \n     provincial elections;\n       (F) enacting and implementing legislation addressing \n     amnesty;\n       (G) enacting and implementing legislation establishing a \n     strong militia disarmament program to ensure that such \n     security forces are accountable only to the central \n     government and loyal to the constitution of Iraq;\n       (H) establishing supporting political media, economic, and \n     services committees in support of the Baghdad Security Plan;\n       (I) providing three trained and ready Iraqi brigades to \n     support Baghdad operations;\n       (J) providing Iraqi commanders with all authorities to \n     execute the Baghdad Security Plan and to make tactical and \n     operational decisions, in consultation with United States \n     commanders, without political intervention;\n       (K) ensuring that there Iraqi Security Forces are providing \n     even handed enforcement of the law against all who break it;\n       (L) ensuring that, according to President George W. Bush, \n     as Prime Minister of Iraq Maliki said ``the Baghdad security \n     plan will not provide a safe haven for any outlaws, \n     regardless of [their] sectarian or political affiliation'';\n       (M) establishing all of the planned joint security stations \n     in neighborhoods across Baghdad;\n       (N) increasing the number of Iraqi security forces units \n     capable of operating independently;\n       (O) allocating and spending $10 billion in Iraqi revenues \n     for reconstruction projects, including delivery of essential \n     services, on an equitable basis; and\n       (2) the achievement of these benchmarks by the Government \n     of Iraq, or the demonstration by the Government of Iraq of \n     satisfactory progress towards achieving these benchmarks, \n     should be viewed as the condition for continued United States \n     military and economic involvement in Iraq.\n       (c) Reports on Benchmarks.--\n       (1) In general.--The Commander, Multi-National Forces-Iraq, \n     in coordination with the United States Ambassador to Iraq, \n     shall submit a report to the Commander of United States \n     Central Command not later than July 15, 2007, and every 60 \n     days thereafter. The report shall detail the status of each \n     of the specific benchmarks set forth in subsection (b), and \n     conclude whether satisfactory progress has been made toward \n     meeting the overall benchmarks as specified in that \n     subsection, in a timely manner.\n       (2) Assessment by commander of central command.--Upon \n     receipt of a report under paragraph (1), the Commander of \n     United States Central Command shall prepare an assessment of \n     the report. The report and the assessment shall be submitted \n     to the Secretary of Defense not later than July 20, 2007, and \n     every 60 days thereafter.\n       (3) Assessment by secretary of defense and secretary of \n     state.--Upon receipt of a report and assessment under \n     paragraph (2), the Secretary of Defense shall, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of State, prepare an \n     independent assessment of the report and submit the report \n     and all assessments, not later than August 1, 2007, and every \n     60 days thereafter, to--\n       (A) the Committees on Armed Services, Appropriations, and \n     Foreign Relations and the Select Committee on Intelligence of \n     the Senate; and\n       (B) the Committees on Armed Services, Appropriations, and \n     Foreign Affairs and the Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the House of Representatives.\n       (4) Report by the president.--If any report or any of the \n     assessments fail to indicate satisfactory progress in any \n     benchmark, the President shall, within 30 days thereafter, \n     submit to Congress a report on those benchmarks that failed \n     to achieve satisfactory progress. The President's report \n     shall provide an explanation of why satisfactory progress was \n     not achieved and describe revisions to the January 10, 2007 \n     strategy that reflect how satisfactory progress will be \n     attained.\n       (5) Termination of superseded reporting requirement.--The \n     reporting requirement in section 1227 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 (Public Law 109-163; \n     119 Stat. 3465; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) is terminated after the \n     reporting period ending May 31, 2007.\n       (d) Reports on Readiness of the Armed Forces.--\n       (1) Reports by service secretaries.--Commencing 60 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretaries \n     of the military departments, in coordination with the Chiefs \n     of the Services, shall report to the Committees on Armed \n     Services and Appropriations of the Senate and the Committees \n     on Armed Services and Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives, not later than 30 days before the date of \n     embarkation, on the deployment of any unit of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States, to include the Reserve Forces \n     and National Guard (hereafter known as ``the unit''), outside \n     the United States and its territories that is not considered \n     fully mission capable of performing reasonably assigned \n     mission-essential tasks to prescribed standards, under \n     anticipated conditions in the theater of operations, of the \n     supported combatant commander.\n       (2) Assessment of risk.--Subsequently, the supported \n     combatant commander, in coordination with the Commander of \n     Joint Forces Command, shall assess the risk of the deployment \n     of the unit as significant, high, medium, or low, and specify \n     to the Secretary of Defense corrective actions to reduce that \n     level of risk from significant, high, or medium to low, not \n     later than 20 days before the embarkation of the unit.\n       (3) Transmittal of assessment.--Thereafter, the Secretary \n     of Defense, in coordination with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \n     of Staff, shall forward the aforementioned risk assessment to \n     the Committees on Armed Services and Appropriations of the \n     Senate and the Committees on Armed Services and \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives, not later \n     than 10 days before the date of embarkation of the unit, with \n     a statement that--\n       (A) the risk associated with the deployment of the unit has \n     been mitigated to satisfaction; or\n       (B) the deployment of the unit has been cancelled, delayed, \n     or determined to be of such significant importance that \n     deployment of the unit is essential and the level of risk of \n     that deployment is vital to the national security of the \n     United States.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will advise the leadership as soon as I \nget a message. I thank the distinguished leaders.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 798 to Amendment No. 680\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I call up six amendments en bloc: 648, \n649, 656, 657, 717, and 718, and I ask that they be set aside after \nthey are reported.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The amendments are pending en bloc.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I have filed amendment No. 670 to H.R. \n1591. This amendment authorizes the Secretary to spend up to $50 \nmillion for the establishment and maintenance of a civilian reserve \ncorps to address postconflict situations and other emergencies \noverseas. The amendment provides the Secretary the flexibility to use a \nportion of the funding in this act to make an urgent effort to recruit \nand train more civilians in planning and managing stabilization and \nreconstruction.\n  The Senate embraced the creation of such a civilian corps when it \nunanimously passed S. 3322 last May. The funding in this amendment \nmatches the level provided in the House version of the emergency \nsupplemental.\n  If enacted, this amendment provides the Secretary with access to \nimmediate funding to recruit and send civilians with the appropriate \nskills to assist in reconstruction and stabilization in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, as well as to emerging trouble spots around the world. The \nUnited States must have the right structures, personnel, and resources \nin place when an emergency occurs. A delay in our response of a few \nweeks, or even days, can mean the difference between success and \nfailure.\n  Both the State Department and the Defense Department are keenly aware \nof the importance of this amendment. They understand that, if we cannot \nwork together better as a government in postconflict and other unstable \nsituations, the United States may come to depend even more on our \nmilitary for tasks and functions far beyond its current role. This \namendment builds on the planning that has already taken place to \ndevelop a civilian reserve and jumpstarts it so that it can be \navailable as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I would like to have printed in the Record at this \npoint a letter from the Secretary of State strongly endorsing the need \nfor the funding contained in this amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           The Secretary of State,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 27, 2007.\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lugar: I am writing to express my strong \n     support for including funding of $50 million in the \n     supplemental appropriations bill to establish a Civilian \n     Reserve Corps. Since our supplemental funding request went \n     forward, we have worked diligently to refine a proposal to \n     jump start the creation of a Civilian Reserve Corps. We are \n     pleased the House of Representatives agrees and has included. \n     $50 million in its supplemental appropriations bill for this \n     purpose. We believe that we are able to justify and to spend \n     wisely these funds in building a reserve capability to \n     complement our internal surge capacity.\n       We have seen the dangers to U.S. interests that can occur \n     from unstable and ungoverned territories that foster the \n     emergence of terrorist organizations. We must find new and \n     better ways to respond to the urgent demands of post-conflict \n     stabilization and reconstruction. The Civilian Reserve Corps, \n     which the President proposed in his State of the Union \n     address, is one way to do just that. We cannot create \n     stability, reconstruct economies, and foster the growth of \n     institutions with military solutions; for these purposes we \n     must call on American civilians who have the necessary \n     expertise to assist in these vital tasks.\n       The Civilian Reserve Corps will tap the creativity, the \n     energy, and the idealism of the American people. I look \n     forward to working with the Congress to advance and refine \n     the legislation which will authorize the use of these funds.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Condoleezza Rice.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on \nFebruary 6, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs Peter Pace talked about the urgent need for civilian expertise \nin the Iraq stabilization effort. General Pace also called for more \ncivilian resources for the broader worldwide effort, people who can \nbuild judicial and rule of law systems, provide engineering expertise, \nand bring clean water and electricity to people ``before a country \ndevolves into a state where the terrorists can find a home.''\n  Passing the amendment will demonstrate that there is a keen \nunderstanding in the Senate that we need to move forward now to \nstrengthen our civilian reconstruction capabilities in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  I recommend this amendment to my colleagues and urge its adoption.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, once again we are debating additional \nwartime funding for Iraq. Once again, we are trying to mitigate the \ndamage caused by the President's utterly failed Iraq policy and the \nfailure to properly plan for and manage the aftermath of Saddam \nHussein's fall. I have spoken many times about how damaging this lack \nof planning has been to our efforts in Iraq and to our standing in the \nworld.\n\n[[Page S3819]]\n\n  For the past 2 months, the spotlight has shone on another \nadministration failure in this war: the shameful conditions our wounded \nsoldiers face as outpatients navigating the military health system when \nthey return from Iraq or Afghanistan. This is another example of gross \nmismanagement and a strained system. As such, I will offer amendment \nNo. 766 to improve the care that members of the Armed Forces and \nveterans receive at Walter Reed and other military medical facilities.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that some of the reasons \nfor concern at Walter Reed do not occur in the future. As the living \nconditions for outpatients at Walter Reed Army Medical Center indicate, \nmoving to private contracts for maintenance can cause problems. After a \nprivate contract was awarded for maintenance and upkeep of buildings on \nthe campus of Walter Reed Army Medical Center, a maintenance crew of \napproximately 300 was whittled down to 50 by the time the contract went \ninto effect. Many of the terrible living conditions found in Building \n18 were a direct result of delays in building repair and maintenance \nbecause of a shortage in manpower. To prevent this situation from \noccurring again, this amendment calls for public-private competitions \nof maintenance services at military medical complexes to stop while our \ncountry is engaged in military conflicts. It also calls for a \nGovernment Accountability Office review of contracting-out decisions \nfor basic maintenance work at military facilities.\n  Other problems discovered at Walter Reed are directly attributable to \nshortages resulting from pressures to cut budgets for military medical \nservices. These cuts cannot be tolerated at a time when military \nmedical services are needed to treat servicemembers who have been \nwounded in Iraq and Afghanistan. As such, this amendment would require \nmedical command budgets to be equal to or exceed the prior year amount \nwhile the Nation is involved in a major military conflict or war.\n  Another issue that the conditions at Walter Reed brought up is \nwhether or not the facility should be closed as the Base Realignment \nand Closure Commission recommended. The Commission recommended building \nnew, modern facilities at the National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda \nand at Fort Belvoir to improve the overall quality of care and access \nto care in this region. Military leaders have indicated that the \nplanned closure has limited their ability to attract needed \nprofessionals to jobs at Walter Reed and there have been concerns \nraised whether adequate housing for the families of the wounded has \nbeen properly planned. To deal with that, this amendment requires the \nDepartment of Defense to submit to Congress within one year a detailed \nplan that includes an evaluation of the following: the desirability of \nbeing able to guarantee professional jobs for 2 years or more following \nthe closure; detailed construction plans for the new facilities and for \nnew family housing; and the costs and benefits of building all of the \nneeded medical treatment, rehabilitation, and housing before a single \nunit is moved.\n  Another major problem and source of frustration for injured soldiers \nis the length of time it takes to receive a disability determination. \nIn order to hasten the disability determination process, we need to \nensure that the Department of Defense has information systems capable \nof communicating with those in the Department of Veterans Affairs. The \nVA has been a leader in implementing electronic medical record keeping, \nbut we have to improve the capability of the Department of Defense to \nsend electronic medical records to the VA to speed up the disability \ndetermination process. Making the disability determination system more \nefficient can reduce the stress on the soldiers and their families \ngoing through the determination process.\n  Caseworkers are also critical. They schedule appointments and make \nsure wounded servicemembers get the rehabilitative and follow-up care \nthey need. As more and more soldiers and marines come home wounded, \nmany military caseworkers are overwhelmed. To improve the care given to \nservicemembers, this amendment requires a minimum ratio of case \nmanagers to patients of 1 to 20, that case managers have contact with \nrecovering servicemembers at least once a week, and that case managers \nbe properly trained on the military's disability and discharge systems \nso they can better assist patients with their paperwork.\n  Currently, many combat veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan \nhave service-related mental health issues like posttraumatic stress \ndisorder, PTSD, and traumatic brain injury, TBI. Many have labeled TBI \nthe ``signature injury'' of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. It is \nestimated that as many as 10 percent of those serving or who have \nserved in Iraq and Afghanistan have brain injuries. That would mean \nabout 150,000 of the 1.5 million soldiers who have served in Operation \nEnduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom have suffered a brain \ninjury. In many cases, these injuries are not diagnosed because there \nis not an external wound. Depending on the severity of these injuries, \nreturning soldiers can require immediate treatment or not have symptoms \nshow up until several years later. This amendment calls for every \nreturning soldier to be screened for TBI. While the VA has announced \nplans to do this, it needs to happen in active-duty military medical \nfacilities too. In addition, the amendment calls for a study on the \nadvisability of treating TBI as a presumptive condition in every \nservice's disability evaluation system, as well as the VA disability \nevaluation system.\n  We often hear about the 25,000 soldiers and marines who have been \nwounded in these wars--but that figure grossly underestimates the \ndemand that the VA health care system faces. Since our country was \nattacked on September 11, 2001, more than 1.5 million soldiers have \nbeen deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq, and other locations. Of these, \n630,000 are now veterans and, according to the Department of Defense, \nmore than 205,000 have already received medical treatment through the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. A recent Harvard study on the long-term \ncosts of treating these new veterans estimates that by 2012 more than \n643,000 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan will be using the VA system, \nan almost three-fold increase of what the system faces now. With a \nsignificant backlog of claims currently existing, the system is in \ndesperate need of an upgrade. To address this concern, my amendment \ndirects the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit to Congress a plan \nfor the long-term care needs for veterans for the next 50 years.\n  In addition to this amendment that I offer today, I am happy to have \nalso joined with my colleagues Senators Obama and McCaskill and offered \nan amendment based on the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act. My \namendment complements the Obama and McCaskill amendment to improve the \ncare our wounded soldiers receive at Walter Reed Army Medical Center \nand other military medical facilities. I believe both amendments will \nmake medical care better for our military personnel and veterans. I \nalso commend the Appropriations Committee for already providing \napproximately $3.1 billion in funding above the President's request for \nhealth programs in the Department of Defense and the Department of \nVeterans Affairs. Providing $1.3 billion for defense health programs \nand $1.767 billion for veterans' health programs is a great step to fix \nsome of the problems we currently face.\n  It is our highest obligation to heal the hundreds of thousands of \nbrave men and women who will bear the physical and emotional scars of \nthese wars for the rest of their lives. While President Bush and his \nadministration may have failed to plan adequately to ensure that these \nsoldiers and veterans receive the care that they deserve, we in \nCongress must act now to improve this situation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts, the chairman of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, in support of amendment No. 680. The \nsubstance of this amendment is what the Senate passed by a 94-to-3 vote \nas the minimum wage and small business tax bill on February 1.\n  This amendment would thus extend to hard-working Americans a long-\noverdue increase in the minimum wage. It is long past time when \nCongress should have increased the minimum wage.\n  Now some worry that an increase in the minimum wage would burden \nsmall\n\n[[Page S3820]]\n\nbusinesses. Smaller businesses employ a disproportionate share of \nworkers earning the minimum wage.\n  Representatives of small businesses have therefore argued that any \nincrease in the minimum wage should be accompanied by tax incentives \ntargeted for small businesses in order to lower their costs.\n  Small business is particularly important in rural States like \nMontana. Rural communities generally do not have large employers. Rural \nfamilies rely on small businesses for jobs.\n  The Finance Committee has jurisdiction over taxes. The committee held \na hearing on January 10 entitled ``Tax Incentives for Businesses in \nResponse to a Minimum Wage Increase.'' The committee heard from a \nvariety of witnesses, including labor economists, small business \nowners, and tax experts.\n  Following that hearing, the committee held a markup on January 17. \nThe committee reported an original bill called the Small Business and \nWork Opportunity Act of 2007.\n  That bill is a revenue-neutral bill containing a number of tax \nincentives for small businesses and businesses that hire minimum wage \nworkers. The committee favorably reported the bill by unanimous voice \nvote. And the majority leader included that bill in its entirety in his \namendment to the House-passed Fair Minimum Wage Act. That bill passed \nthe Senate on February 1.\n  Now the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee and I have included that bill in its entirety in our \namendment to the House-passed supplemental appropriations bill, the \nU.S. Troops Readiness, Veterans' Health, and Iraq Accountability Act.\n  The small business tax provisions included in this amendment will \nhelp small businesses to succeed. These provisions will spur investment \nand thus create jobs. They will provide greater opportunity for workers \nlooking for a job. They all enjoy strong support.\n  To carry out day-to-day activities, small business owners are often \nrequired to invest significant amounts of money in depreciable \nproperty, such as machinery. The amendment would help business owners \nto afford these large purchases for their businesses. To do so, the \namendment would extend for another year expensing under section 179 of \nthe Internal Revenue Code.\n  New equipment and property are necessary to successfully operate a \nbusiness. But large business purchases generally require depreciation \nacross a number of years, and depreciation requires additional \nbookkeeping.\n  Expensing under section 179 allows for an immediate 100-percent \ndeduction of the cost for most personal property purchased for use in a \nbusiness. In 2007, small business owners may deduct up to $112,000 of \nequipment expenses.\n  When small business owners are able to expense equipment, they no \nlonger have to keep depreciation records on that equipment. So \nextending section 179 expensing would ease small business bookkeeping \nburdens.\n  The amendment would also allow small business owners to quickly \nrecover the cost of improvements to their establishments through \nextension and expansion of the 15-year straight-line depreciation \nperiod for leaseholds and restaurant improvements. Without this \nprovision, they would have to depreciate over the course of 39 years.\n  Allowing retailers and restaurants to use a 15-year straight-line \ndepreciation period would help entrepreneurs who open a business or \nremodel their property. The entrepreneur's investment could be \nrecovered over a period of time more closely reflecting wear and tear.\n  The amendment would extend the 15-year recovery period for leasehold \nand restaurant improvements. The amendment would also broaden the \nprovision to allow retail owners and new restaurants to take advantage \nof this shortened depreciation period.\n  The amendment would also help businesses to provide jobs for workers \nwho have experienced barriers to entering the workforce by extending \nand expanding the work opportunity tax credit or WOTC.\n  WOTC encourages businesses to hire workers who might not otherwise \nfind work. WOTC has been remarkably successful. By reducing \nexpenditures on public assistance, WOTC is highly cost-effective. The \nbusiness community is highly supportive of these credits. Industries \nlike retail and restaurants that hire many low-skill workers find it \nespecially useful.\n  The amendment would extend WOTC for 5 years, and the amendment would \nexpand the credit to make it available to employers who hire veterans \ndisabled after 9/11.\n  As of July 2006, nearly 20,000 members of our Armed Forces were \nwounded in action in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring \nFreedom. Many of these soldiers are now permanently disabled. Many do \nnot know what they are going to do. We need to help these young men and \nwomen. A modest tax incentive to help them get back into the workforce \nis one place to start.\n  The amendment would simplify the way that small businesses keep \nrecords for tax purposes. The cash method of accounting is often the \neasiest method of accounting. Allowing small business to use the cash \nmethod reduces the administrative and tax compliance burden of these \nbusinesses.\n  The amendment would let more businesses take advantage of this \nmethod. Businesses with gross receipts up to $10 million would be able \nto use the cash method.\n  The amendment helps small businesses by modifying S corporation \nrules. These modifications reduce the effect of what some call the \n``sting tax.'' These modifications improve the viability of community \nbanks.\n  Senator Grassley, members of the Finance Committee, and I have worked \nto develop a balanced package, and I believe that we have succeeded.\n  The language included in the amendment is a responsible package that \nwill ensure the continued growth and success of small businesses.\n  We have also paid for it. Most of the offsets are proposals that the \nSenate has supported several times before.\n  The offsets include a proposal to end future tax benefits for abusive \nsale in/lease out tax shelters, or SILOs. These deals use foreign tax \nexempt entities to generate sham tax deductions. Even after Congress \nshut these deals down in 2004, some taxpayers continue to take \nexcessive, unwarranted depreciation deductions on German sewer systems \nand the like. The IRS says that it has 1,500 of these deals under \naudit, involving billions, yes, billions, of dollars.\n  The offsets include doubling fines, penalties, and interest on taxes \nowed as a result of using certain abusive offshore financial \narrangements to avoid paying taxes. Taxpayers who hide their money from \nthe IRS through offshore credit cards and other shady financial \narrangements need to get the message that this Congress is serious \nabout ending these abuses.\n  The offsets include closing corporate loopholes for companies who \nreinvented themselves as foreign corporations to avoid paying tax here \nin America. In March of 2002, Senator Grassley and I made it clear that \nthose who put profits ahead of patriotism did so at their own peril. \nThe amendment would treat those who moved offshore after that date like \na U.S. company, and the amendment would make those companies pay U.S. \ntaxes.\n  The hard-working American taxpayers whom we are trying to help in \nthis amendment should not have to pay more in taxes because some \ntaxpayers are abusing the tax system through tax shelters. They also \nshould not have to bear the burden of civil settlements and punitive \ndamages paid by companies who engage in questionable behavior.\n  These are sound tax policy changes. Let us finally enact an increase \nin the minimum wage, and let us also pass this useful package of tax \nbenefits to help America's small businesses. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, along with Senator Bond and Senator \nColeman, I will offer an amendment that addresses an issue about which \nthere has been much news reporting and hearings in both House and \nSenate subcommittees; namely, the situation facing Iraqi and Afghani \ninterpreters and translators who are bravely working on the front lines \nwith our soldiers and diplomats. Such work is vital to our efforts in \nthese two conflicts, yet it often makes them and their families targets \nfor insurgents. This past week, Mr. George Packer wrote a lengthy piece \nin\n\n[[Page S3821]]\n\nthe New Yorker on this that I commend to my colleagues.\n  My interest in this issue, like many of my colleagues, began last \nsummer when I received e-mails from a first lieutenant in the Indiana \nNational Guard who had recently returned from a tour in Iraq and from a \nsergeant in the Army who was at the time serving in a combat support \nhospital, also in Iraq.\n  Aaron Inkenbrandt wrote:\n\n       During my year in Iraq, I served as a military Transition \n     team member. As such, I lived exclusively with Iraqi forces \n     and acted as a mentor and advisor to them. My team and I did \n     much to build and train these forces under very difficult \n     circumstances. However, we could not have achieved success \n     without our Iraqi interpreters. I believe that our Nation \n     must reciprocate the loyalty proved by these men by offering \n     to them sanctuary in the United States.\n       Iraqi interpreters are an outstanding group of people. \n     These men not only act as our communicators but also our \n     cultural advisors and our friends. Our interpreters share \n     with us the dangers of combat and the rigors of military \n     life. While interpreters are generally well paid, the risks \n     associated in assisting Coalition forces are extraordinary. \n     Both at work and at home, interpreters fear for their lives. \n     This fear is often so great that they cannot tell even their \n     closest relatives what they do for a living.\n       The insurgency in Iraq has made clear that they will murder \n     any Iraqi caught assisting Coalition Forces. Interpreters are \n     especially prized by insurgents who often pay high bounties \n     for their killings or capture. Iraqis not associated with the \n     insurgency are also hostile toward interpreters. Many Iraqis \n     believe, though wrongly, that interpreters are snitches or \n     traitors. Such hostility makes life very difficult for Iraqi \n     interpreters.''\n       The withdrawal of Coalition Forces will likely increase \n     rather than decrease the danger posted to interpreters. \n     Without our protection, former interpreters will be left \n     defenseless before their enemies and subject to persecution \n     by their friends. In my opinion, [it] would be immoral and \n     contrary to the precepts of our Constitution to abandon these \n     brave patriots in light of the vast sacrifices that they have \n     made in the cause of freedom. Therefore, I implore you to \n     advocate preferable immigration status to all Iraqi \n     interpreters whose loyalty we reasonably ascertain.\n\n  The e-mails, and a cable that our then Ambassador to Baghdad, Zalmay \nKhalilzad, released regarding the life-threatening conditions our \nForeign Service Nationals were facing prompted me to write to the \nSecretary of State last July about the issue. I encouraged her to \ndevelop a policy to address these various situations and suggest \nlegislative language. The United States has experience and tradition in \nthis respect from past wars that provide precedent and guidance.\n  The amendment I am offering today with Senator Bond and Senator \nColeman is not a conventional amendment for an emergency supplemental, \nbut because it has a direct impact on the missions in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, we are hopeful this can be included in the package.\n  By virtue of a provision crafted by former Congressman John \nHostettler of Indiana, the 2006 Defense authorization bill established \na program to allow 50 Iraqis and Afghans who have worked for the U.S. \nmilitary as translators for at least 12 months to come to the United \nStates on a special visa. The program has been underway now for just \nover a year and has been met with success and approval by all of the \nagencies who work with it.\n  Since instatement, 445 applications have been received. 377 have been \napproved, 10 denied and 58 are pending. Under the current cap of 50 per \nyear, it will take until 2016 to admit those currently in the queued--\nand their families--for entry to the United States.\n  In order to help reduce this wait-time, my colleagues and I have \ncrafted an amendment that expands the program to 300 admissions per \nyear and also makes some other technical changes. We change the \nlanguage to include interpreters as well as translators--as that is the \nproper term for those who translate conversation while translators work \non documents. We also authorize the U.S. Ambassadors in Iraq and \nAfghanistan to nominate non-Department of Defense personnel under this \nprogram, and we exempt those admitted under this program, and their \nfamilies from the numerical cap of immigrants who enter in this same, \nso-called 4th Preference category. Finally, we wish to sunset the \nprogram after 3 years.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, we have before us today a supplemental \nappropriations bill that will finally start the process of bringing our \ntroops home.\n  The United States today is in its fifth year in Iraq. The \nadministration offers no apparent road out of Iraq. It offers only an \nescalation plan that keeps growing, and an open-ended commitment to a \ncivil war.\n  The Congress of the United States has an obligation to express its \nvoice on this matter and to offer a solution.\n  The search for a solution has been difficult. We have come to the \nfloor many times this year, and we have struggled to find the right \ncourse of action.\n  I believe that path is before us today.\n  This legislation would initiate the orderly drawdown of our forces \nand redefine the mission for a small supporting force that would \nremain. It sets benchmarks for the administration and for the Iraqi \nGovernment.\n  This legislation calls for actions which this administration has \nstubbornly resisted, including the prompt phased redeployment of U.S. \nforces from Iraq. This redeployment would begin within 120 days of the \nlegislation being enacted.\n  The legislation sets a goal of March 31, 2008, for redeploying major \ncombat forces from Iraq. A smaller force would be allowed to remain, \nwith its mission limited to protecting American and coalition personnel \nand infrastructure, training and equipping Iraqi forces, and conducting \ntargeted counterterrorism operations.\n  This supplemental also calls for a vigorous ``diplomatic, political, \nand economic strategy.''\n  This strategy would involve ``sustained engagement with Iraq's \nneighbors and the international community for the purpose of working \ncollectively to bring stability to Iraq.''\n  This is the key to ending the violence in Iraq--the recognition that \nthe solution to Iraq lies not in U.S. force but in political \naccommodation among the Iraqis.\n  This legislation also sets benchmarks for the Iraqi Government.\n  These include deploying trained and ready Iraqi security forces in \nBaghdad; strengthening the authority of Iraqi commanders to make \ntactical and operational decisions without political intervention; \ndisarming militias and ensuring that Iraqi security forces are \naccountable only to the central government and loyal to the Iraqi \nConstitution; enacting and implementing legislation to ensure that \nIraq's oil is distributed to all Iraqi citizens in an equitable manner; \nenacting and implementing legislation that reforms the de-\nBa'athification process in Iraq; ensuring a fair process for amending \nthe Iraqi Constitution to protect minority rights; and enacting and \nimplementing rules to protect the rights of minority political parties \nin the Iraqi Parliament.\n  Finally, this supplemental requires that the top U.S. commander in \nIraq report to Congress on progress by the Iraqi Government in meeting \nthese benchmarks--30 days after this act is enacted and every 90 days \nthereafter.\n  Our Nation's present course of action is untenable and unsustainable.\n  Our very purpose for being in Iraq bears little resemblance to the \nreasons Congress authorized the use of military force in October 2002. \nWhat do we have as we enter the fifth year of this war? A terrible \nhuman toll in dead and injured--3,200 Americans killed, more than \n24,000 wounded, with estimates of Iraqi civilian deaths that soar well \ninto the six figures and a toll on our Treasury that is unsustainable.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the Iraq war is \nalready the fourth most expensive war in U.S. history, behind World War \nII, Korea and Vietnam. We are spending roughly $8.4 billion in Iraq a \nmonth--more than $2 billion a week. So far we have spent nearly $400 \nbillion in Iraq. Think of the opportunity costs to this Nation. Wars \ncost money. I understand this. But we cannot continue this level of \nspending on a distant civil war with no exit strategy. If we keep our \ncombat forces in Iraq for years to come--as this administration seems \nintent on doing--it will likely become the second costliest war we have \never waged.\n  Our military cannot continue to bear this heavy burden. This war has \neroded our troop readiness, depleted military equipment, and left our \nfighting forces weary.\n  Consider these developments:\n\n[[Page S3822]]\n\n  Army and Marine officers say the rapid pace of deployments into Iraq \nhas put the readiness of their troops into a ``death spiral''--with 40 \npercent of gear worn out and soldiers and marines left fatigued and \nundertrained. Our Nation owes our fighting forces better than this.\n  The 3rd Infantry Division, scrambling to meet deployment orders, \nreportedly has sent injured troops back to Iraq--including ones so \nbadly injured that they could not put on their body armor. We owe our \nfighting forces better than this.\n  The Army's medical facilities are understaffed and underfunded--not \njust at Building 18 at Walter Reed--and its medical staff is \noverwhelmed. We owe our fighting forces better than this.\n  Some 1,800 Marine Corps reservists will get letters this week \nnotifying them that they are being involuntarily recalled for a year, \nthanks to a shortage of volunteers to fill some jobs in Iraq.\n  This follows news that should make everyone in this Chamber take \nnotice: The 82nd Airborne Division--the storied ``All-American'' \nDivision--is so strained by this war that it can no longer respond on \nshort notice to a crisis.\n  For decades, the 82nd Airborne has kept a brigade on round-the-clock \nalert--ready to respond to a crisis anywhere around the globe within 18 \nto 72 hours. But The New York Times reported on March 20 that the 82nd \nAirborne can no longer meet this standard--a standard it has long held \nwith pride.\n  I believe the supplemental that we have before us today is the \nsolution to the Iraq problem. It provides a vehicle for Congress to \nexpress its sense on Iraq and to require the President to take \nconcrete, measurable steps forward. It sets clear deadlines and \nrequires vigorous regional diplomacy. It sends a message to an \nadministration marked by arrogance and declares to the Iraqi Government \nthat their time has come.\n  Zalmay Khalilzad, the outgoing U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, said as much \nMonday, March 26, in his farewell news conference.\n  Mr. Khalilzad was direct: The Iraqi leadership must understand, he \nsaid, that time is running out.\n  Finally, most importantly, this legislation begins the process of \nbringing our troops home.\n  We have a choice today.

Mr. President, I understand that I am to be able to speak \nas in morning business for up to 1 hour.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are in morning business, and the \nSenator is recognized for up to 1 hour.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, if you go out in our country and you ask, besides the \nwar, what is on people's minds, the No. 1 topic you will hear about is \nhealth care. And what are the questions that you hear? Why can't I \nchoose my own doctor? Why can't I pick my own health insurance plan? \nWhy do my premiums increase every year but my benefits don't increase? \nWhy do I have trouble understanding which benefits my health plan \noffers? Why does my employer get a tax break from my health care but I \ndon't? Who can make the best health care decisions for my family, us in \nWashington, the insurance bureaucrats, other people, my employer, or \nhow about me? How about me getting to make a decision about my health \ncare?\n  There is no question America's health care is broken. It is not that \nwe are getting bad care, it is that we pay a tremendous amount for what \nwe get in our care. The estimates are anywhere from $1 out of every $3 \nto $1 out of every $4 we spend on health care doesn't go to help \nanybody get well in this country and doesn't go to help anybody prevent \nhaving an illness. That is $2.2 trillion, and it will be over $2.3 \ntrillion this year.\n  When you see what happens--and these are not my numbers, by the way; \nthese are Price Waterhouse numbers, a breakdown on health care \ndollars--what you see are some pretty interesting statistics. You see \nthat when we go to spend $1 on health care, 35 percent of it goes to \nhospitals, 21 percent of it goes to doctors, 15 percent goes to \nprescription drugs, and 5 percent goes to equipment.\n  All the rest of that, the medical liability insurance--nobody \nrealizes that is 10 percent. Ten cents out of every dollar we spend \ngoes to medical liability. We are insuring against a problem in health \ncare--10 percent. It costs us 6 percent to process the claims. One-half \nof all the claims filed against all the insurance companies in this \ncountry are denied because the people haven't met their deductible, and \nyet we keep sending the claims, keep spending the money.\n  One out of every three people who works in a hospital, one out of \nevery three people who works in a doctor's office doesn't do anything \nto help anybody get well. Why is that?\n  It is because of the system we have set up. If you add this 10 \npercent for liability insurance, 6 percent for processing, 5 percent \nfor marketing, 23 percent for the insurance industry profit--and I \ndoubt seriously it is that low--what you come up with is 24 percent, as \na minimum, that doesn't have anything to do with helping anybody get \nwell.\n  Now, why is that? Why is it we have this system? It is because we \nhave somebody besides the patient choosing what they will get in terms \nof health care. In Medicaid, it is your State. Oftentimes in Medicaid \nit is your State paying a very low rate, so now you get to choose from \nthose who will accept the lowest rates. In Medicare, they tell you \nexactly what the price is. We spend all our time around here trying to \nchange Medicare, because when we push on the balloon one way, something \nelse pops out.\n  So whether it is the Deficit Reduction Act or some of the other \nthings we have had, what we find is we cannot control this tiger \nbecause we have a bureaucratic maze that nobody understands. When we \ntry to use price controls, when we try to limit expenditures, we end up \nlosing control.\n  So what happens? Who makes your health care decisions? Either CMS, \nthe Center for Medicare Services, in conjunction with your State, \neither for Medicare or Medicaid, your employer, or an insurance \ncompany.\n\n[[Page S3823]]\n\n  Whatever happened to you making decisions about your health care, \nabout which doctor, about which insurance policy, about which hospital \nyou want to go to? And why is it that if you happen to be Medicaid, you \nget to choose less than somebody who doesn't happen to be Medicaid? Why \nis it we are treating in an unequal fashion those who are the poorest \namong us?\n  Why shouldn't we have the right to pick what insurance benefits are \nbest for us? Why shouldn't we have the right to choose who is going to \nbe our caregiver, whether it is a doctor, a nurse practitioner, a \nphysician's assistant, a chiropractor, or an optometrist? Why shouldn't \nwe get to choose that, rather than an insurance company or an employer \ndeciding who we can or cannot see?\n  They also decide the price we are going to pay because we are trying \nto control all these costs. They are also going to decide which \nhospital we go to. But how is it that we have a system now where \neverybody except the patient gets to decide what happens to them in \nterms of their health care?\n\n  We can't afford the health care system we have today. For one thing, \n16 percent of our GDP, the highest of any country in the world by 50 \npercent, is spent on health care. Although we have good health care, we \ndon't have better health care than those countries that are spending \nless. We are spending 16.2 percent, or $2.3 trillion, per year on \nhealth care, so we should be 50 percent better off. We should have a \n50-percent better life expectancy, 50 percent less heart disease, and \n50 percent less cancer. Of the money we spend on health care, fully \nthree-quarters of that is spent on five diseases.\n  Think about that: 75 cents out of every dollar that actually gets \ninto health care, which is only 60 to 70 percent of the money we \nactually pay into health care, 75 cents of that goes for either heart \ndisease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, or \ncancer. Five diseases, most of which are readily preventable--not \npartially preventable but readily preventable--through increased \nprevention activities.\n  This Government this year will spend $20 billion on prevention in 12 \ndifferent agencies, through 27 different programs, none of which are \ncoordinated to try to maximize the education of the American people to \nwhat they need to know about their health care so they can make \ndecisions on prevention. Consequently, we are very ineffective with \nprevention.\n  If you look down the road at what is coming in terms of Medicare and \nMedicaid, what you see is an unfunded liability of over $60 trillion--\n$60 trillion--we are adding. This isn't about health care now. That $60 \ntrillion that is getting ready to hit our kids and grandkids in terms \nof Medicaid and Medicare that we have promised for the future, that we \nhave no way to pay for now, one of the great ways of lessening that \nnumber is to change what we do on prevention. Prevention is the key.\n  Grandma was right: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. \nAs a matter of fact, it is said in 2070 $1 out of every $2 that \nMedicare spends, at our current rates, will be spent on diabetes--$1 of \n$2. So when you look at this Medicare number, with the vast majority of \nthe baby boomers who are going to retire and then their generation is \ngoing to retire, $1 of every $2 that will be spent by Medicare will be \nspent on one disease only, which means we only have $1 to spend on all \nthe rest of health care for seniors, plus any attempts at prevention \nand at early diagnosis or new and modern treatments. We can't continue \nwithout a coherent plan on health care.\n  The other problem that is facing us as a nation is right now we can't \ncompete globally in many areas because of health care costs. When you \ncompare GM and Toyota, there is a four times greater differential for \nwhat goes into a car made in this country by one of the Big Three \nversus what goes into a car made outside of this country by their \ncompetitors. So there is no way that we can, in fact, be competitive \nglobally until we handle health care. There is no way we can handle \nMedicare and Medicaid until we change the health care system.\n  Myself and Richard Burr and several other Members of the Senate will \nbe introducing a bill tomorrow that addresses every problem our health \ncare system faces today, whether it is tort liability, and making sure \npeople get awarded what they need when a mistake is made during the \npractice of medicine, or whether it is immunizations. The fact is, we \nhave very few States where we have achieved 90-percent immunization.\n  We are going to address every problem we face, the liability that \ncomes at us in the future through Medicaid and Medicare, the problems \nwe face on liability, the problems on access, the inequality that \nsomebody, because they happen to work at a very low-paying job, gets \nstamped with something on their forehead that says, you are of less \nvalue than somebody who happens to work someplace that has great \ninsurance and a higher paying job.\n  Our bill changes all of that, and instead of going to the Department \nof Motor Vehicles to wait in line, we are talking about a health care \nsystem where you, the consumer, are No. 1. The government isn't No. 1, \nthe doctor isn't No. 1, the hospital isn't No. 1, the drug company \nisn't No. 1, but you, the patient, become No. 1. You get to choose what \ninsurance you want, you get to choose what kind of insurance you want, \nand you get to choose how much you will pay for it. We create a new \ninsurance market where everybody gets to play by an even set of rules.\n  How do we do that? We do that by giving everybody the same advantage \nin this country when it comes to health care, and that is a refundable \ntax credit, $2,000 for every individual, or $5,000 for every family. \nWhat that means is, if you are earning about $120,000 a year or less in \nthis country, you will gain in terms of your taxes off of this bill. If \nyou are making $120,000 or less, what is going to happen is you are \ngoing to have the option of staying with your employer, if you like \nwhat they have, and that tax credit will be available to your employer. \nBut if you decide you want something different, maybe it offers \nsomething you don't get covered today or doesn't cover a whole lot of \nthings you think you need, you can take that tax credit and buy that \ninsurance and save the difference in the money for your future health \ncare. The Universal Health Care Choice and Access Act provides $2,000 \nfor every one of the 45 million uninsured tomorrow, every one of them \nas an individual.\n  Now, what does that buy? People say: That won't buy much. Well, if \nyou go to Kentucky and you happen to be 35 years of age, you can buy a \n$2,000 yearly deductible policy for $897 and have $1,300 or $1,100 left \nover between that and the deductible. If you try to buy that same \npolicy in the Chair's State, it is almost $6,000 for that identical \npolicy. Why? Because government has decided in New Jersey differently \nthan what government has decided in Kentucky. Therefore, the cost of \ngetting this minimal coverage, because of the mandates put on by \ngovernment--not what a patient wants but by what government says \npatients should have--makes that unavailable in New Jersey.\n  How do we fix that? We allow people to buy insurance anywhere they \nwant, just like they buy their auto insurance today; like they buy \ntheir homeowner's insurance. They can buy it from any company anywhere \nin America, as long as they have a registration with a State. We create \na primary and a secondary location for that. So if you want to buy \nsomething that has a better price, that fits your needs, you have the \ncapability to do that and put the difference into a health savings \naccount, where you can use it for future health care needs, that you \ncan use to apply to any deductible, or if you get enough money in it, \nyou can bring it down to where, if you want to, you can have a zero \ndeductible--if you want--but most people will not want to do that. We \nallow you to select a health plan that truly meets your family's needs, \nnot what some Government bureaucrat says or some Senator says you must \nhave. It is what you want. We allow individuals to choose what they \nwant in terms of their health care.\n\n  What will that do in terms of the market? That is going to create \ninnovation in the health care market all across this country. It is \ngoing to cause competition like crazy for the dollars. Once we truly \nhave competition, which is something we do not have in health care \ntoday, which we tremendously need, then we are going to see a big \nchange.\n\n[[Page S3824]]\n\n  The other thing this does is it gives access for affordable health \ncare for a ton of people who do not have it today. They get to choose \ntheir health care provider. The patient gets to choose who takes care \nof them. Not the Government, not their employer, not the Senate, not \ntheir State insurance commissioner, but they are going to get to choose \nwho is going to take care of them. It is the right to choose who is \ngoing to care for you.\n  How do we do that for the States? We do not mandate anything for \nanyone. We do not say anybody has to do anything. But we create a lot \nof incentives. We tell the States that, if you want to, you can take \nyour Medicaid funds and your disproportionate share funds and anybody \nwho is Medicaid eligible, under the 133 percent of poverty level, you \ncan take their $2,000, plus the Medicaid money, plus the DSH money, and \nyou can help them buy an insurance policy in your State. If you want to \nstay with Medicaid, you can stay with Medicaid. There is no mandate \nfrom the Federal Government other than to get people into coverage.\n  You ask any government tomorrow if they would take $2,000 per \neligible person in their Medicaid program, would they take a deal with \nthem having the freedom to design what is best for their State? Every \nGovernor will tell you yes. Every Governor will tell you yes. Why? \nBecause now we are given the resources there to allow a Medicaid \npatient to be just like everybody else--a Senator, their mayor or \nsomebody who works at the best factory in town. They have an option to \nnot be discriminated against because they show a Medicaid card. Now \nthey have an insurance card. People ask: What about the people who do \nnot want to have insurance? We allow the States the opportunity to have \na default mechanism. If the State of Tennessee--I see the Senator from \nTennessee here. If the State of Tennessee wants to decide we will \noption, if we have people in our State who are going to be so \nirresponsible that they will not even buy themselves coverage and they \nhave an opportunity to take tax money to do that, then we are going to \ncreate a default mechanism whereby the State of Tennessee--if you are a \n25-year-old motorcycle rider and you don't want to buy insurance, they \ncan take your tax credit and buy a high-deductible policy for you so \nwhen you go to the ER, all the rest of us don't have to pay all your \ncosts. What is happening in our health care system is we keep \ntransferring the costs so we have a rationale for jumping up the price \nbecause they are doing something for somebody else at a low price.\n  What the real facts are--and we never hear it--the real facts are, \nwhen you look at the hospitals out there, all--the vast majority of \nthem--and this is a very key, important point--the vast majority are \nnonprofit entities. That means they pay no income taxes, they pay no \npayroll taxes. On order, the vast majority, and on average, offer 10 \npercent of their total billed care as indigent care.\n  But that is not a real number. The reason it is not a real number is \nbecause they bill the highest prices they have for that indigent care. \nIf you look at the cost of that care, it would be far below that. I \nknow in the State of Oklahoma, the hospitals there last year billed \nover $5 billion in revenue, made over $5 billion in profit, and out of \nthat they billed another $400-some-odd million in care that was \nuncollectible to people who did not have insurance or couldn't pay. \nThat was not really their cost. That was their billed price.\n  Remember, we give this nonprofit status to all these entities, this \n$500 million worth of profit in Oklahoma, for example, and they pay no \ntaxes on that. They pay no real estate taxes. In essence, they offer \nabout $100 million worth of charitable care.\n  What this bill does is it takes away all the cost shifting.\n  What are the other things we do? We incentivize high-risk pools. What \nabout the person who gets a chronic illness and they say all of a \nsudden their insurance company drops them. We have incentivized so the \ninsurance company is not going to do that. In every State we give a \nbonus if they set up a high-risk pool and then the high-risk pool is \nfunded out of everybody who is insured in that State. So if you have an \ninsurer insuring someone with complications from diabetes and they say \nwe will drop this person because it is too costly, they go to the high-\nrisk pool. Guess what. That insurance company is going to pay for them \nanyway. There is no benefit for them to drop them. There is all the \nbenefit then for that insurance company to get busy and involved in \nmanaging the chronic disease, where we know we can eliminate \ncomplications, we can improve the quality of life, and we can also \nincrease life expectancy by managing the chronic disease.\n  Here is what we do for Medicaid patients. They get a $2,000 check \nfrom the Federal Government plus from their State. They can go into \nwhatever plan they want. If their State says we want to stay with \nMedicaid and take that in enhanced Medicaid, the State gets to do that. \nThere is not a mandate in anything. What it says is: If you think a \nState Medicaid Program is better for your State, without choice, then \nyou can do it. But all the rest of the States are going to say I think \nI would rather have our Medicaid patients have a true insurance, a real \ncard where they have the same access, the same equality of access as \nanybody else.\n  All of a sudden you have everybody in the marketplace compete. They \ncan stay in a State-run system. They get to save what they don't spend \non their health care for future health care needs.\n  One of our problems is savings in this country. It is important. How \ndo we fix our health care system? We know that, if we look at the \nliability costs that showed 10 percent of the health insurance dollar \ngoing for liability insurance, that is an underestimate. The American \nHospital Association found, recently reestablished by another \norganization, I can't remember who, that repeated the study--what we \nknow is each year, today, besides that 10 percent, providers order \nanother 8 percent of the cost of health care for tests that patients do \nnot need.\n  Why do they do that? They do that because they perceive they need to \nhave everything on the books to defend themselves that they can have, \nso they fire a shotgun at it. We will get this test, this test, this \ntest--knowing they don't need it but they operate under the ``what if'' \nscenario, this adversary system that we have.\n  Finally, we address liability. We give another percentage bonus to \nthe States that will set up what is called a ``health court'' system. \nIt is a real simple system. If you have a complaint against a provider, \na hospital or a doctor, you can go to the health court. You don't have \nto go to the health court. But you can go to the health court and you \ncan be seen in front of three lawyers, three doctors, and a judge who \nhave their own expert witnesses. This judge is schooled in medical \nmalpractice. They can make a decision for you right then.\n  If you accept the decision, then you give up your right to go to \ncourt. If you don't accept the decision, you can't ever come back to \nthat court on that particular issue, but everything you do in court is \nadmissible. We do not take away anybody's right to go to court. But \nwhat we do accomplish is making sure people get made whole quicker and \ncheaper--40 percent now doesn't go to the trial lawyer for you to get \nmade whole.\n  There is no question we make mistakes in medicine every year. But why \nshould we drag it out for 3 to 5 years, No. 1. Why should we pay 40 \npercent of whatever the ultimate award is to somebody who helped us \naccomplish that, where we can set up a system that will arbitrate that \nin front of a nonbiased group of peers, lawyers and doctors who say: \nHere is the right thing, here is the medical case, the legal case, \nlet's make a decision and send it on.\n  What it does is it saves tons of money directly, but what will it do? \nAs soon as you create confidence on the part of providers that they do \nnot have to order this other 8 percent of tests, you are going to see \nthat dropping about half. So we can gain 4 percent in this cost of \nhealth care by setting up health courts, by changing the dynamic under \nwhich we make sure people are made whole when something happens to them \nin the medical malpractice area.\n  Not every State has to do this. But if your State decides to do this, \nyou get a 1-percent bonus on your Medicaid money--out of a large pool.\n\n[[Page S3825]]\n\n  We have lots of ways in which we do not say we want the States to do \nthis and now we are going to tell you how to do it. We are saying here \nare some ways we think you can also do it. Go figure out the best way \nfor you, and by the way, if you do some of the things that we think \nwill save some money, here is some extra money for you.\n  Ultimately, if we do not fix health care--everybody in this Chamber \nknows we are going to go the way of Western Europe and that is the \nfollowing: We are going to decide that we are going to have a single-\npayer system run by the Government. As P.J. O'Rourke says: ``If you \nthink medicine is expensive now, wait until it is free.''\n  We are going to control costs. We are going to do it the same way we \nare trying to control costs with CMS. What happens? What happens is we \nare going to start rationing care.\n  Let's take some real statistics. In England, diagnosis? Cancer. In \nEngland, if you get a diagnosis of cancer right now, the average \nstarting time for your chemotherapy is 10 months after your diagnosis. \nAnybody here who wants that kind of medicine will vote against this \nbill. That is exactly what we get. We get rationing. What it means is \npeople with great potential will not get the treatment in time to \ncapture that great potential. What it means is great suffering. What it \nmeans is loss of innovation. What it means is a lack of available, fair \naccess. It is everything in England in their health care system takes \naway all freedom.\n  It is also interesting to know this past year in Canada there was a \nlawsuit filed, which was won. What this individual said is the Canadian \nlaw says I can't go to anybody except a Canadian doctor who is owned \nand run by the Government. They challenged that. The Canadian supreme \ncourt ruled on the side of the patient: You ought to have the right and \nfreedom to go wherever you want, to whomever you want if you are \nwilling to pay the bill.\n  Paying the bill is the insurance part of this. If you want to be able \nto have that access, then you are going to want to be able to buy a \npolicy that allows you to have it. If you don't want that access, you \ncan buy a policy that says here is a straight HMO, here are the only \nfour doctors you can go to, and here is the hospital you are going to \nget to go to.\n  We are talking about freedom in health care. How do we get to the \nbottom line, away from 16 percent of our GDP, down to 10 percent of our \nGDP? More importantly, how do we create a system that gives us better \nquality, at lower cost, with better value. That is what we are talking \nabout.\n  I yield to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Oklahoma, a dear \nfriend and somebody who has been passionate about health care for \nyears. He and I came to Washington together in 1995. We served on the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee, and we recognized then that changes \nneeded to be made. Every year we have seen the same response in \nWashington. We have seen the end of a calendar year come, the need to \nfind savings in health care. Administrations, Republican and \nDemocratic, turn to Medicare and Medicaid and say we are going to \nextract $60 billion, $70 billion out of savings in these health care \nsystems. We have laughed as they called it ``waste, fraud, and abuse'' \nbecause there is waste, fraud and abuse in it. We just didn't get any \nmoney out of it because we have been reluctant to fix the health care \nsystem in this country.\n  What are we doing? What is this plan? This plan is universal health \ncare. Let me say it again. This plan is universal health care. This is \nproviding affordable, accessible health care, provided by the private \nsector, for every American in this country.\n  This is change in the design of health care that has been \nhistorically, up to this point, employer negotiated, the majority \nemployer paid for, and an employee has very little input into the \nmakeup of the policies that cover them.\n  It doesn't reflect their age, it doesn't reflect their health \nconditions, it does not reflect their income.\n  What we are talking about is shifting it away from employers over \ntime. We are talking about creating real incentives for individuals. We \nare talking about making sure 47 million uninsured Americans today and \ntomorrow have tax credits that can be used for real insurance coverage. \nWhat does that provide for them? For the first time, it creates a \nrelationship between a patient and a health care professional.\n  We have talked in this institution, we have talked in this town, and \nwe have talked in this country about the need to project wellness and \nprevention in health care. Well, this does it. This, for once, \naccomplishes that because we as individuals can negotiate our plans, \nnot through the group plan but as 250 million-plus Americans. We can \nnegotiate what makes sense for us from the standpoint of the scope of \ncoverage that reflects what we are willing to pay as it relates to \npremium--and, by the way, provides States the capability to do the same \nthing with their Medicaid beneficiaries, their Medicaid patients, if, \nin fact, they want to begin to change the way their care is delivered, \nby creating the same relationship between a health care professional \nand them, because they now have the same insurance we do.\n  Medicaid beneficiaries have this big ``M'' on their foreheads. They \ndo not want to be on Medicaid, but they are there because it is the \nlast resort. What we want to do is integrate them into what all of the \nrest of us have; that is, individual insurance.\n  Dr. Coburn hit on a real key; that is, an attempt to bring everyone's \nhealth care costs down. It is not to pick out a group and to say, We \nare going to reduce yours, and pick out a group over here and say, We \nare going to reduce yours. This is an attempt--it is the first real \nattempt--to bring every-body's health care costs down.\n  What we learned when we created Part D Medicare, the drug benefit for \n35 million-plus seniors in this country, was that when we created real \ncompetition between insurers and we brought transparency to price, two \nvery real things happened: In the first year, premiums dropped 28 \npercent over what we had projected, and drug pricing dropped 33 \npercent.\n  We have a model we have already tried that seniors across this \ncountry say: Do not mess with this plan. That, in fact, exemplifies \nwhat we are trying to do. We are trying to create real competition \nbetween insurance for our insurance business; we are not letting one \nemployer negotiate the plan and then dump it on the employees. But the \nquestion is, Can we have the same results as Part D by seeing the cost \nof health care reduced for all Americans? Well, you start that process \nwhen you eliminate cost-shifting. You accelerate that process when you \ninject what this bill does; that is, transparency in the price of \nhealth care that is delivered to you.\n  Imagine the day that you can go online and you can actually see what \nyour doctor's visit is going to cost, what the lab workup is going to \ncost, what a visit to the emergency room at your local hospital is \ngoing to cost. In markets in North Carolina today, some choose not to \ngo to the hospital for the nonemergency care, even though that may be \ntheir primary provider; they choose to go to the community health \ncenter because the community health center actually delivers the same \nif not a better level of care. But one thing is for certain: They know \nexactly what it is going to cost them. And these are individuals who \nare insured.\n  For the first time, all Americans have an opportunity at prevention \nand wellness. What does that mean? It means we can make decisions about \nour health care that have an impact on the cost of our health care to \nus and consequently have a ripple effect across the marketplace, that \nas more and more Americans make healthy decisions, the cost of health \ncare overall comes down.\n  It means we have freed up those valuable health care dollars to make \nsure they are there for the individuals who are going to be susceptible \nto disease--chronic or terminal illness.\n  It means the relationship we have now established between patient and \nhealth care professionals means we have recognized we can accumulate \nthe data we need so that Medicare reimbursements are no longer a shot \nin the dark where we pull a number down that may not be reflective of \nthe cost of delivering the service, may not be reflective of the value \nof the service.\n\n[[Page S3826]]\n\nThe reality is that when we create that relationship, we are able to \naccomplish the accumulation of data that tells us what things really \nshould cost.\n  In health care, those healthy decisions allow individuals to make \ndecisions about disease management. The most costly part of the U.S. \nhealth care system is the chronic diseases that exist and our inability \nto manage those diseases. The most expensive is diabetes.\n  Today, we have electronic capabilities for diabetics and for coronary \nheart patients where, at different periods during the day, their vital \nsigns can be transmitted over a telephone line to their doctor. The \ndoctor can instantly know whether, if it is a diabetic, they are \nmanaging their insulin. If it is a coronary heart patient, they can \ndetermine whether the fluid buildup means they need to adjust their \nmedication. What does that give us the ability to do? It means we can \ntake a patient who up to that point got too much fluid on the heart, \nmade an emergency room visit, and in all likelihood was admitted for 3 \ndays as they get the medicine back in balance. Now, a doctor, 24 hours \na day, as these reports come in, can change their diuretic, can work \nwith a diabetic on checking their blood sugar and what their insulin \nintake is, can detect whether they took the right medication. We can \nextrapolate that across every disease because technology now lets us do \nit in a real way. If we are not able to do this, then we are not able \nto recognize the value of new technology.\n\n  So much technology today that would benefit us in the Medicare \nmarketplace is not reimbursable by Medicare. It is a decision they make \nbecause it is not tested in the marketplace; therefore, it has no value \nbecause they do not know how to reimburse for it. Well, the reality is, \nwhen you have a health care system that responds to the benefits to \nindividuals, all of a sudden you have the market that creates a value \nfor the technologies and for the innovations.\n  So I am delighted to be here. There is so much to this bill. This \nbill is the most comprehensive transformation of the health care system \nin my lifetime.\n  One might say it is difficult to do so big a bite at one time. I made \nthat mistake. The reality is that when you look at the timeline we are \nup against every year we do not adopt this type of transformation of \nour health care system, more Americans become uninsured, more \nindividuals with preexisting conditions no longer can afford health \ncare, and the cost of everybody's health care in America goes up \nbecause we have not eliminated cost-shifting.\n  With disease management we could do today if, in fact, people had \nincentives in their system to take the time to monitor their health, to \ntake their medication, to counsel with health care professionals about \nchanges they could make, the more money we can save not only for each \none of us but for the total system.\n  I am convinced that if you could only pick one thing out of this plan \nthat you highlighted for the American people, it would be this: For the \nfirst time, we are presenting a very real way to insure 47 million \nAmericans, the people who are most at risk in this country. If all of \nus were the beneficiaries in some way of reduced prices, more access, \nthe ability to have transparency in pricing, the accumulation of data, \nelectronic medical records that enable us to find savings, if that is \nthe byproduct of us finding a way to use savings in the system to \ninsure 47 million Americans, I believe that is the right thing to do.\n  The President came out in the State of the Union and he presented a \nvery similar plan. Our plan expands on what the President said. Our \nplan goes to the heart of the health care system and says: If we are \ngoing to change it, then we have to go through total transformation. \nThis is that total transformation that at the end of the day empowers \nevery individual in this country to have custom health care coverage \nfor themselves, for everyone in their family, for their health \nconditions, for their income and, more importantly, for their security.\n  So I commend the Senator for his work. I now look forward to working \nwith him as we go through what I think will be a very intellectual \ndebate about the future of health care in this country. As some look at \nEurope and look at other countries and say, Maybe we ought to do that \nin the future, I believe if we adopt this method we are going to have \nevery country in the world looking at this model and saying, How do we \ndo this? How fast can we do that?\n  Mr. COBURN. People may be saying: Well, how do you know this will \nwork? There is a great little company named MedEncentive. They have \nbeen running pilot programs all across the country. Let me explain what \nthey do. They get doctors to agree to follow a certain set of protocols \ncalled best practices, and they sign up communities, municipalities, \nand their employees, and then they do a couple of things. They take \nthem under coverage, and they reward the employee--i.e, the patient--if \nthey will use those doctors.\n  What is unique about this system? One is, after the patient has \nfinished their office visit with the doctor, they have a patient-doctor \ninteractive form they fill out that says: The doctor wants me to take \nthis medicine. I understand this. Here is the reason he wants me to \ntake this. So they have to fill out the form to say they really \nunderstood.\n  The other thing is, on the professional side, the practitioner side, \nthey agree to follow the best-practice model in how they treat these \npatients. That was actually developed by Vanderbilt, where they \nfollowed a best-practice guideline which helps them decide what to \norder, what not to order, what to do, what not to do in terms of what \nis best for that patient. They can get off if they choose to, if they \nthink in their medical judgment that they need to.\n  What has been the result? The three published results that I know of, \nin all three communities, in the first year of operating this where \nthere was this competitive model, best-practice quality outline, \npatient followup, because the insurance company is involved in making \nsure the patient does that--what happened to their health care costs? \nOne down 18 percent, one declined 22 percent, and one declined 12 \npercent. Now, that is just in three. Each one of them had 300 or 400 \npatients and took all comers, chronic disease or not.\n  How did their costs go down? The costs went down for a lot of \nreasons. One is they were practicing not defensive medicine, they were \npracticing real medicine. They were not throwing tests at a patient \nbecause they were worried but because they had the background of the \nexcellence of Vanderbilt University as a practice guideline at their \ndefense.\n  So what we know is that in the various test models where true \nmarketing, true competition, true transparency as far as price, true \nconcern for the patients' well-being, not just at the office visit but \nthereafter, wellness and prevention were modified, what happens is \ncosts go down.\n  That is just in three cities in Oklahoma. It has been done all across \nthis country. But what we do know is that if we attack it in a \nnonbureaucratic way, but we allow competitive forces--which would you \nrather have, an insurance company that is invested to try to make your \nhealth better or one that just wants to make a dollar on you and turn \non you?\n  So going back, let me just kind of summarize. The system we have \ntoday limits our ability to do what we as Americans do well; that is, \ndiscern value for what we have purchased--discern whether we get value \nfor it, discern how to do it, and we discern that on an individual \nbasis.\n  Our health care is not designed on an individual basis. In many \nplaces, we get one-size-fits-all; what the Government says you will \nhave or what the State says you must have, you must buy this. I believe \na lot of our problems have come because we have tried to micromanage it \nfrom Washington and from the statehouse. What we are talking about is \ngiving freedom of choice, not just to patients and providers but to \ninsurance industries.\n  Imagine the tremendous possibilities that will come into a market \nthat says: This is a new day. I get to market all sorts of different \nthings that might match up with different people. All of a sudden, now \nI will have to compete not only with people in my State but all across \nthe country for the best plan that gives me the best value that meets \nmy needs. Why would we not want that? We have that in every other\n\n[[Page S3827]]\n\nthing. Why would we not want to capture the best aspect of the American \nconsumer, which is discernment?\n  Not long ago I was sitting with some friends and put forth the fact \nthat I believe Americans are smart enough to know what they want in \nhealth care. The idea got pooh-poohed. I thought, how insulting. We can \nfigure out what computer to buy and how much memory we want and how big \na hard drive we want and whether we want a photo section on it or a \nprint lab. We can figure out all of those things--as a matter of fact, \nour 10-year-old kids can figure that out--but we can't figure out how \nto buy health care. We are going to say to the American people: You are \nnot sophisticated enough, you are not smart enough to know what is good \nfor you or to know what you need. So, therefore, the Government is \ngoing to tell you what you need. That is what we have today, whether it \nis the Government or your employer or somewhere else.\n  This bill changes all that. This is a bill that will create \ntransparency so you as a consumer can know what something is going to \ncost. It is going to create a situation where you can perceive whether \nyou have value. It is going to create an incentive to save for health \ncare for the future and an incentive for wellness, not just by what the \ninsurance company will come to sell you but by the $20 billion that we \nare now spending, of which less than $2 or $3 billion makes any \ndifference at all in somebody's health care. We are going to focus that \non true prevention. We are going to direct that the HHS relook at every \none of these programs and develop a model to where we educate the \nAmerican people about the risk.\n  Let me give a personal story. I am a colon cancer survivor. What we \ndo know is with good prevention and good screening, one out of every \ntwo people who are going to get colon cancer we can keep from getting \nit. Why wouldn't we do that? Why wouldn't we prevent half the colon \ncancer in this country? We don't have a good reason. One of the reasons \nis because we have an ineffective prevention program.\n  I am a small government person; I admit that. But there is a \nlegitimate role for the Federal Government when it comes to teaching \nAmerica about our health needs, prevention, and wellness. We have \nplenty of money to do it if we take the same money we have now and \nredirect it in a way that educates the American people. Innovation \nworks. We know that. Competition works.\n  Take, for example, a year ago a 46-inch plasma TV cost $11,526. Today \nyou can buy the same thing for $2,300. Next year you will be able to \nbuy it for $1,400. The next year you will be able to buy it for $700. \nWhy? Competition. Competition breeds quality and value, only if you \nhave a market under which you can operate. We don't have that today in \nhealth care. Innovation also works in health care.\n  Look at Lasik. Here is a procedure that is not paid for by the \nGovernment. It is not paid for by any of the insurance industry. But if \nyou are nearsighted and you want to be able to look far away, you can \nget that done. When it first started, it was $4,000 an eye. Now there \nare places you can get it done--the same piece of equipment, the same \ncomputer--for $500 an eye. Why won't that work? It will work in health \ncare. It will work. Innovation will come as a result of that.\n  What happens when we innovate. What we get is better quality at a \nlower price and better value. I am hopeful that as the American people \nlook at this, they will be reminded of a couple things. This is \nuniversal coverage. Everybody in America gets treated the same by the \nFederal Government when it comes to health care. Everybody in America \nis on equal footing as far as the Income Tax Code is concerned when you \ngo to buy your health care. No longer do we advantage the very rich \nwith $2,700 a year in tax benefit and the very poor with $100. We \ntotally neutralize that and say: Everybody ought to be treated the same \nunder the Tax Code for health care. It is universal coverage.\n  No. 2, it takes away discrimination. Because you are poor, because \nyou don't have the ability to have a job that has insurance coverage \ntoday, and if, in fact, you are at 133 percent of poverty, why should \nyou be discriminated against because you are on the Medicaid Program? \nThis is no offense to any practicing professional out there because \nthere are great professionals who are taking care of Medicaid patients. \nBut if you look at the marketeering, the ones with the best doctors, as \na rule, because Medicaid pays so low, do they have time to take care of \nMedicaid patients? No. What happens is, somehow they don't have time. \nSo what we have done is discriminated down with Medicaid patients.\n  Why shouldn't a Medicaid patient get the best doctor every time, just \nlike a Senator? Why shouldn't they have access to capability? Why \nshould they be discriminated against by having a Medicaid stamp on \ntheir forehead? We are talking about universal access, equality of \ncare, and personal freedom and choice. You get to decide what is best \nfor you and your health care and your family.\n  By the way, when you get this money and you haven't spent it all, you \nget to save it for next year and the year after and the year after. You \ncan buy what is best for you with that money.\n  This money also goes to retirees. If you retire at 60 and are not \neligible for Medicare, you still get your tax credit. We don't \ndiscriminate against anybody. Everybody gets the tax credit.\n  The final thing I would say, it doesn't cost the American taxpayer \none additional dollar in income tax. There will be no increased cost \nwith this plan. Actually, we have tried to make it revenue neutral. My \nworry is that it will save us money. We have tried to make it where it \ndoes not. We have tried to make it the most generous thing we can to \nget the most coverage for everybody out there. Again, prevention first, \nfree choice, freedom, and liberty. You get to decide who cares for you, \nwhat insurance, what hospital, and every American gets that. It is the \nGovernment not telling you what you must do but saying here is what you \ncan do if you want.\n  I yield to the Senator from North Carolina if he has any additional \ncomments.\n  Mr. BURR. I would only use that time to thank the Senator from \nOklahoma. This is a crucial debate that this country needs to have, \nthis institution needs to have. More importantly, we are at a point \nwhere we have to stop talking about what we are going to do and \nactually start doing something. The Senator from Oklahoma has stated it \nvery well. What we can do is bring a higher level of care to all \nAmericans--not just some Americans, to all Americans. Through that \neffort, all Americans receive a financial benefit. Our system prospers \nbecause we are able to take care of more, and we are able to provide an \nunlimited opportunity in the future because we unleash innovation and \ntechnology in health care.\n  I have wondered what it would be like if we had innovation at the \nsame level in health care as, say, in cell phones; that we would have a \nnew platform every 6 years, and that platform would provide an array of \nopportunities to us that we are not forced to take, but they are \navailable to us if, in fact, we want them. Health care has been starved \nof innovation, in large measure because it treats every American \ndifferently. This is the first real opportunity for universal coverage, \nuniversal access, where every American has an opportunity at the best \ncoverage available.\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BROWN). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

This important organization has been \nformed recently by local community leaders and will provide a \nsignificant service to northern Nevada. I am pleased to recognize the \ngroup here today.\n  The Reno-Tahoe area has been growing swiftly for the past decade. The \nregion enjoys a strong and relatively diverse economy, offering a range \nof jobs\n\n[[Page S3828]]\n\nand professional opportunities. Reno-Tahoe also offers a wonderful \nquality of life and some of the finest recreational opportunities in \nthe Nation.\n  Despite the overall growth and undeniable lures to the region, it has \nnot succeeded as well in attracting and retaining young professionals, \na demographic critical to its continued and future economic growth. To \naddress this issue, the Economic Development Authority of Western \nNevada, EDAWN--through the leadership of Chuck Alvey, Michael Thomas, \nand consultant Stacey Crowley--wisely recognized the need to provide \nyoung local professionals with an opportunity to meaningfully engage \nwith regional business and community leaders and participate in \ndirecting the region's future.\n  Toward that end, EDAWN launched the RTYPN, an organization designed \nto teach valuable skills, provide networking and leadership \nopportunities and participate in the regional discussion about how to \ncapitalize on the region's assets to grow a better community and \neconomy for the future. With the partnership of organizations such as \nEDAWN and the Reno Sparks Chamber of Commerce, the creation of RTYPN \nshows the vision and resourcefulness of the Reno-Tahoe community and I \nam eager to learn of RTYPN's future successes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/27/senate-section/article/S3828-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, on January 17, 2007, Senator Inouye and I \nintroduced S. 310, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of \n2007 to extend the Federal policy of self-governance and self-\ndetermination to Hawaii's indigenous people. This measure is of \ncritical importance to the people of Hawaii. It would, at long last, \nclarify the existing legal and political relationship of Native \nHawaiians with the United States, allowing for the formation of a \ngovernment-to-government relationship.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am very well aware of the support of the \nSenator from Hawaii for this measure and his determination to see it \nenacted. As a result of the hard work by Senator Akaka as well as his \ncolleague, Senator Inouye, on behalf of this legislation, every Member \nof this body should know how important this bill is to the people of \nHawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator for his recognition of our continuing \nperseverance and unwavering resolve to move this measure forward. At \nits core, S. 310 is about equity. It is about establishing parity in \nthe Federal policies towards Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and \nNative Hawaiians. Our U.S. Constitution is clear in the means by which \nit addresses the status of the indigenous, native people of this land. \nIt is a status based not on consideration of race or ethnicity, but \nrather on the political relationship that existed between the United \nStates and the native people who occupied and exercised sovereignty \nover lands that later became part of the United States.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, the senior Senator from Hawaii is \nabsolutely correct, and I appreciate both his comments and that of our \nmajority leader about my efforts to date. I first introduced this bill, \ntogether with the members of Hawaii's Congressional Delegation, in \n1999. And, I have introduced a similar bill every Congress. In each \nCongress, the bill has been favorably reported by the Senate Committee \non Indian Affairs, and its companion measure has been favorably \nreported by the House Committee on Natural Resources.\n  During the 109th Congress, Senator Inouye and I were successful in \nfiling a cloture motion to proceed to the bill. This procedural action \nrequired 60 votes to bring the bill, S. 147, to the Senate floor for a \nfull debate and vote. Falling four votes short of the required 60 \nvotes, cloture was not invoked. As a result, the Senate has not yet \nvoted on the substance and merits of this bill. In fact, the cloture \nvote demonstrated that if the measure was considered on an up-or-down \nvote, the votes are here to pass it by a simple majority.\n  Senator Inouye and I are currently working to have S. 310 considered \nby the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in the near future, and brought \nto the Senate floor shortly thereafter. In the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, the companion measure, H.R. 505, was scheduled for \nmarkup by the House Natural Resources Committee, but Hawaii Congressman \nAbercrombie was not able to be present. At Congressman Abercrombie's \nrequest, H.R. 505 is being rescheduled for committee consideration \nshortly.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through his position on the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, the senior Senator from Hawaii has demonstrated leadership \non and knowledge of Indian issues. He has been second to no Member in \nthis body with his empathetic advocacy for fair and equitable treatment \nof Native Americans. I can clearly understand what drives both Hawaii \nSenators to secure some measure of fairness and self-determination for \nthe indigenous people of their beautiful home State. Senator Akaka's \ndescription of events here in the Senate culminating with a failed \ncloture vote was accurate.\n  However, I want to be very clear to every Member of this body: As a \nSenator from Nevada, I strongly support S. 310. As majority leader, I \nam committed to ensuring Senate consideration of S. 310 and will work \nwith the Senators from Hawaii to gain the support of members from both \nsides of the aisle. This is my commitment to the gentlemen from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. We thank you, the leader. Native Hawaiian programs and \ninstitutions continue to be under attack in the courts. Hence, there is \nan urgency to act and to clarify that the status of Native Hawaiians is \na political question best left to the political arena, namely the \nCongress, to resolve.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I deeply appreciate the leader's commitment and support. \nHawaii is the only homeland of the Native Hawaiian people, and I remain \ncommitted to empowering the people of Hawaii and our Nation to preserve \na Hawaii that respects Native Hawaiians and the contributions made by \nthose who have made Hawaii their home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/27/senate-section/article/S3828-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I voted against the budget resolution \nfor the 2008 fiscal year because it contained record-breaking tax \nincreases on hard-working American families in a time when we should be \nputting more money back into the pockets of taxpayers, not taking it \nout. This year's budget resolution is historical because it proposes \nthe largest tax increase ever--$916 billion in tax increases on the \nbacks of the American people. This is almost four times the amount of \nthe second largest tax hike in history, $240 billion proposed in 1993. \nBy letting progrowth tax policies expire, this resolution reaches deep \ninto the pockets of hard-working families and seeks to reduce the take-\nhome pay of a family of four earning $50,000 by as much as 6 percent.\n  Additionally, this budget ignores the concerns of future generations. \nProposed tax hikes would slow the economy, and stifle investment and \njob creation. Since 2003, over 7 million new jobs have been created. \nThe U.S. economy is experiencing 5 uninterrupted years of growth, and \nsince the tax cuts of 2003, the rate of economic growth has more than \ndoubled. Tax increases move us in the wrong direction and that is why I \nam opposing this budget resolution--because it is wrong for the \neconomy, wrong for hard-working families, and wrong for America.\n  Despite the inclusion of funding for several essential programs in \nthis budget resolution, it is imperative that we realize the effect of \nthis proposal as a whole. When we examine closely the entire package, \nit is clear that the tax increases on Americans included in this budget \nwill serve to stunt our continued economic growth. Therefore, I opposed \nthis budget resolution. We simply cannot afford to appease short-term \npriorities at the expense of long-term stability and prosperity. The \nsuccess of our economy depends on and demands from us fair tax policies \nwhich enable hard-working Americans to prosper, leading us as a country \nto fiscal stability.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/27/senate-section/article/S3828-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3828-S3829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       SERGEANT WAYNE R. CORNELL\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Army SGT \nWayne R. Cornell of Holstein, NE.\n  Sergeant Cornell will be remembered as a dedicated husband and \nfather.\n\n[[Page S3829]]\n\nHaving been deployed to Iraq earlier this year, Sergeant Cornell made \ncertain he would be allowed to take his 2 weeks' leave in July. He was \ndetermined to make it home to Holstein, NE, in time to see his wife \nPatricia give birth to their third child.\n  With both his father and grandfather having served in the military, \nenlisting had always been a top priority for Sergeant Cornell. While at \nSilver Lake High School in Roseland, no matter what branch of service \nwas making a recruiting visit to his school, Sergeant Cornell was \nalways the first in line to meet with the military recruiter. In \naddition to his desire to enlist, Sergeant Cornell was also a skilled \nmartial arts student and is remembered by his teachers as a kindhearted \nand well-meaning individual.\n  Shortly after graduating from high school in 1999, Sergeant Cornell \nchose to enlist in the Nebraska Army National Guard. During 4 years \nwith the Guard, he served twice in Bosnia and once in Afghanistan. In \naddition to his service to his country, Sergeant Cornell also served \nhis community as a volunteer firefighter. Last year he enlisted in the \nArmy; he was deployed to Iraq when called up in February. On March 20, \n2007, while serving with the Army's 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry, 4th \nBrigade, 1st Infantry Division, based out of Fort Riley, KS, Sergeant \nCornell passed away when the vehicle he was traveling in was struck by \na roadside bomb in Baghdad.\n  ``He did it all for his family,'' said his wife Patricia. ``He was an \nawesome father, and he just made every sacrifice for us.'' In addition \nto his wife Patricia, Sergeant Cornell is survived by his two children, \nDameion, 5, and Zoie, 3, of Holstein; mother Patricia Perrie of \nHolstein; father Larry Cornell of Fairmont, NE; and sisters Jadeen \nCornell of Blue Hill, NE, and Janalle Gowlovech, of Sioux Falls, SD.\n  I offer my sincere condolences to Sergeant Cornell's family. Not only \ndid he sacrifice for his family, he made the ultimate and most \ncourageous sacrifice for his Nation. Every American and all Nebraskans \nare proud of the service of brave military personnel such as SGT Wayne \nCornell.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof U.S. Army SGT Wayne Cornell of Nebraska. Sergeant Cornell was killed \nin Baghdad when an improvised explosive device detonated near his \nvehicle. He was 26 years old.\n  Sergeant Cornell grew up in the small town of Holstein, NE. A 1999 \ngraduate of Silver Lake High School, his teachers had little doubt that \nhe would serve his country after graduation. He enlisted with the Army \nNational Guard soon after graduation and was deployed to Bosnia and \nAfghanistan.\n  In 2006, Sergeant Cornell decided to continue his career in the Armed \nForces and enlisted with the Regular Army. He was deployed to Iraq in \nFebruary 2007 with the 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment, 4th \nBrigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division based at Fort Riley, KS.\n  Sergeant Cornell was a deeply committed father and husband. He always \nput his family first in the decisions he made. The Army was his means \nto provide for his family, as well as serve his country. He and his \nwife Patricia had two children, Dameion and Zoie, and the family is \nexpecting a third child in July.\n  In addition to his wife and children, Sergeant Cornell is survived by \nhis father Larry Cornell, his mother Patricia Perrie, and sisters \nJadeen Cornell and Janalle Gowlovech.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring SGT \nWayne Cornell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/27/senate-section/article/S3829-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MARCH MADNESS\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to spend a few minutes \ntalking about March Madness. Millions of Americans are glued to their \ntelevisions to watch basketball this time of year, and I want to talk \nabout a No. 1 seed that wasn't closely followed nationwide.\n  Everyone knows how Florida, Georgetown, UCLA, and Ohio State are \nfaring in their tournament games, but the Winona State Warriors may not \nbe on everyone's radar. Well, they should be. The Warriors set a \nDivision II record by winning 57 straight games over the last two \nseasons. This breaks the previous record of 52 games which has been \nintact since 1946. Over this stretch, the Warriors have dominated most \nteams that they met with the average margin of victory being almost 20 \npoints--including one victory by 81 points. Unfortunately, this streak \nended on Saturday as they came just a few points short of winning back-\nto-back Division II championships when their opponents made a buzzer-\nbeating shot.\n  I commend Coach Mike Leaf for his accomplishments. In the 9 years he \nhas coached at Winona State, he has lead the Warriors to five regular-\nseason Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference titles, four tournament \nconference titles, four Division II tournament appearances, and the \n2006 national title. He was also named national coach of the year after \nleading his team to the national championship last year.\n  It takes a great deal to bring together a championship basketball \nteam. Coach Leaf has done this while serving as an inspiration to his \nplayers and the entire Winona community. He has taught his players to \nwork hard and enjoy themselves while winning with class.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Coach Leaf, his \nstaff, his players, the students of Winona State, and all the Warrior \nfans. I look forward to the continued successes of Coach Leaf and his \nteam next year. Go Warriors!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/27/senate-section/article/S3829-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3829-S3830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            S. CON. RES. 21\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the budget \nresolution that the U.S. Senate adopted last Friday.\n  Every year, Congress considers a budget resolution, setting the \nGovernment's priorities for the coming year. For the past 2 years since \nmy election to the Senate, I have been compelled to vote against budget \nresolutions that I believed were out of touch with our fiscal realities \nand national priorities. This year, I was proud to support the \nresolution.\n  I commend the outstanding leadership of Chairman Conrad, who helped \nto produce a resolution that makes great progress getting our Nation's \npriorities back on track. Instead of deepening our fiscal hole with \nirresponsible tax giveaways to the wealthy, this budget makes an \nimportant departure from the Republican budgets of the recent past and \nbrings our budget back into balance. Instead of gutting programs that \nhelp our most vulnerable citizens and communities, this budget allows \nthese programs--like the State Children's Health Insurance Program, the \nLow-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, Medicare, COPS, and others--\nto keep serving those who rely on the important moral commitments our \nNation has made. Instead of budget gimmicks and deferred \nresponsibility, this budget brings greater transparency and \nresponsibility back to Washington.\n  It does so first by reinstating pay-go. In a Democratic Senate, new \nmandatory spending, just like new tax cuts, must be paid for by \noffsetting spending reductions or revenue increases. Pay-go will \nrequire tough choices and difficult tradeoffs. We will not be able \nsimply to pass along the debt to future generations for the choices we \nmake today. We will have to be accountable for paying our own bills and \ncollecting our own revenue. Pay-go by itself will not bring our budget \nback to balance, but it will prevent deficits from getting worse. Pay-\ngo by itself cannot resolve our Nation's long-term liabilities, but it \nwill restore the budget discipline that has been lacking in Washington \nfor too long.\n  When I travel around the country or talk to families in Illinois, I \nhear about the same priorities again and again. People from all walks \nof life--farmers and small businesspeople, teachers and veterans, \nsalespeople and service workers, doctors and senior citizens, people \nprospering and those struggling at the margins--all share a common set \nof concerns and aspirations. They want affordable health care for \nthemselves and their children. They want a quality education for their \nchildren. They want to retire with dignity. They are concerned about \nour national security and our domestic security.\n  Unfortunately, many Americans are not convinced that their voices are \nheard here in Washington. They are not convinced because the President\n\n[[Page S3830]]\n\nproposed a budget that ignores their priorities. They are not convinced \nbecause they don't see enough serious efforts to reduce their health \ncare costs or to improve educational opportunities. They are not \nconvinced because it appears that for too long no one in Government has \nbeen held accountable for incompetent leadership and neglect of the \npublic interest.\n  Fortunately, the budget resolution we adopted last week responds to \ntheir voices. It demonstrates to families across the Nation that we are \nonce again paying attention to their concerns. They have a reason to \nstart once again to have confidence in their Government.\n  Let me give a few reasons, why I supported this resolution.\n  The failure of our Nation to guarantee access to affordable health \ncare for children is shameful, and the President's budget threatened to \nworsen the situation for children in working families. This budget \nrejects the President's proposed cuts to the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program, extends care to 6 million additional eligible \nchildren, and makes children's healthcare a priority for Congress.\n  This budget also makes progress to ensure that preschool children \nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds will receive quality care and education; \nthat children, no matter where they go to school, will have an equal \nopportunity for quality education; and will make college more \naffordable so that our children can compete in a global marketplace. By \nrejecting the President's proposed cuts in education and training, this \nbudget shores up the Federal end of the bargain to support No Child \nLeft Behind and support programs that educate individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  This budget also includes $100 million for grants to establish summer \nlearning programs in local school districts through the Summer Term \nEducation Program. I thank Chairman Conrad for his assistance in \ngetting my amendment to fund these programs included in the final \nresolution. These grants will help students in early elementary grades \nby supporting their participation in 6 weeks of summer school. Teachers \ntell us that students return to school each September at levels below \ntheir successes of the previous spring. Educators know this as ``summer \nlearning loss,'' and research has shown that students, on average, lose \nmore than 1 month of reading skills and 2 months of math skills during \nthe summer. The impact of summer learning loss is greatest for children \nliving in poverty, children with learning disabilities, and children \nwho do not speak English at home. The achievement gap in education \nbegins early in life and remains a burden for too many throughout their \ntime in school. The Summer Term Education Program funded by this \nresolution will help to bridge this gap through structured summer \nlearning opportunities.\n  The security of our Nation at home and abroad is also a critical \npriority, and honoring our veterans should be considered a sacred \nobligation. This budget fully funds our defense and homeland security \nfunding needs and respects our duty to support our veterans. These \nbrave men and women have sacrificed so much for us and for our Nation. \nSadly, as uncovered by the Walter Reed scandal, our Government is \nfailing them. This budget makes it possible to provide the quality \nhealth care and services that our veterans deserve. We cannot ignore \nthe reality that there are financial and human costs to war. This \nbudget recognizes that reality.\n  I am also pleased that the budget resolution includes an important \nbipartisan amendment that I offered with my colleagues, Senators \nBunning, Bingaman, Lugar, and Boxer, to triple the administration's \nrecommendation for carbon sequestration. This amendment provides an \nadditional $200 million for Department of Energy efforts on carbon \nsequestration, for a total of $279 million in that account. Both \nenvironmental groups and the coal industry acknowledge the importance \nof better technology for carbon sequestration and control. The \nInternational Panel on Climate Change, environmental groups like NRDC, \nand the mining industry all are on record that the long-term deep \ngeological storage of carbon is possible and is happening now on a \nsmall scale. But for it to occur on a far larger scale, we must \nredouble Federal efforts to make technologies widespread and economical \nin the next 15 years. A recent report by the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology recommended a $5 billion program over the next 10 years to \nachieve that goal. My amendment today provides a significant increase \ndown that path.\n  Too many Americans say they lack confidence in our tax system because \nthey hear about well-connected individuals and corporations getting \naway without paying their fair share. I believe this budget will begin \nto restore the confidence necessary for a fair and effective tax \nsystem. Instead of reaching deeper into the pockets of hard-working \nAmericans, this budget will collect taxes where taxes are due. This \nbudget calls for strong new measures to close the tax gap, shut down \ntax scams, and address offshore tax havens. I am proud of my efforts \nwith Senator Levin and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to \nstop tax haven abuses, and I look forward to working with my colleagues \nin the 110th Congress to improve the fairness of our Tax Code.\n  The budget resolution we passed last week demonstrates that we can \nrise above ideology and gimmicks and begin tackling the serious \nchallenges we face as a nation. It demonstrates that vision matters and \nleadership matters. I am grateful for Chairman Conrad's extraordinary \nleadership and the terrific work of his talented, dedicated, and hard-\nworking staff. They worked well in committee and on the floor to help \nassemble a budget resolution that a majority of us in the Senate could \nvote for in good conscience and with confidence that America's fiscal \npolicies have a chance, at long last, to get back on track.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/27/senate-section/article/S3830-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3830-S3831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMENDING MAJOR GENERAL GALE S.

Pollock, a nurse, is in \ncharge of the Army Medical Department and leading the way in improving \norganizational efficiencies and streamlining the care of our wounded \nwarriors.\n  Major General Pollock was born in Kearny, NJ, and entered the Army \nNurse Corps in 1976 after earning her BSN from the Walter Reed \nInstitute of Nursing through the University of Maryland. She also \ncompleted a master of business administration from Boston University, a \nmaster in health care administration from Baylor University, and a \nmaster in national security and strategy from the National Defense \nUniversity. Major General Pollock also attended the U.S. Army Nurse \nAnesthesia Program and is a certified registered nurse anesthetist, \nCRNA, and a fellow in the American College of Healthcare Executives.\n  Major General Pollock's military education includes Senior Service \nCollege at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, the U.S. Air \nForce War College, the Interagency Institute for Federal Health Care \nExecutives, the Military Health System CAPSTONE program, the Principles \nof Advanced Nurse Administrators, and the NATO staff officer course.\n  On March 20, 2007, Major General Pollock, Chief of the Army Nurse \nCorps, was officially named Commander of the U.S. Army Medical Command \nand the Acting Army Surgeon General. Her previous military assignments \ninclude, Commander, Pacific Regional Medical Command and Tripler Army \nMedical Center, Honolulu, HI; Special Assistant to the Surgeon General \nfor Information Management and Health Policy; Commander, Martin Army \nCommunity Hospital, Fort Benning, GA; Commander, U.S. Army Medical \nDepartment Activity, Fort Drum, NY; Staff Officer, Strategic \nInitiatives Command Group for the Army Surgeon General; Department of \nDefense, DoD, Healthcare Advisor to the Congressional Commission on \nServicemembers and Veterans Transition Assistance; Health Fitness \nAdvisor at the National Defense University; Senior Policy Analyst in \nHealth Affairs, DoD; and Chief, Anesthesia Nursing Service at Walter \nReed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC.\n  Major General Pollock brings extensive leadership, education, and \nexperience to her new position as the Acting Army Surgeon General.

He was a member of UNC's \ncheerleading squad.\n  I have seen Jason perform at the school's sporting events. I admired \nhis unmatched school spirit and his animated, energetic interaction \nwith the Tar Heel fans.\n  The University of North Carolina community lost a dear friend in \nJason on Monday. However, he left a legacy that will certainly last for \nthe many generations of fans that watched him perform. College \nbasketball holds a special place in North Carolinians' hearts. Jason's \nteam spirit and dedication helped make rooting for UNC basketball a \ncommunity tradition.\n  I send my thoughts and prayers to his family, teammates, classmates, \nfans, and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/27/senate-section/article/S3831-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COLLEGE NATIONAL CHAMPIONS\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a college \nbasketball team that this past weekend won a national title.\n  I am speaking of Barton College in Wilson, NC, which beat the \ndefending champion Winona State to win the Division II Basketball \nChampionship.\n  Through their win, Barton College also ended Winona State's Division \nII record 57-game winning streak.\n  Now I have seen a lot of college basketball games over the course of \nmy life, especially representing the State of North Carolina, where \nbasketball is not just a game but a way of life, but this one ranks \nclose to the top when it comes to exciting endings.\n  With only 45 seconds left to play in the game, Barton down by 7 \npoints--a deficit that would be extremely difficult to overcome by any \nteam--and assisted by the stellar performance of his teammates, \nBarton's Anthony Atkinson scored an unbelievable 10 points in the \nremaining 39 seconds, included a buzzer-beating lay-up, to win the \nDivision II national title by a score of 77 to 75.\n  If you didn't see the game live, I would suggest you go on the \nInternet and watch the ending to this fantastic game.\n  It is simply unbelievable and is reminiscent of Christian Laettner's \ngame-winning last-second jump shot in Duke's dramatic 104 to 103 \nvictory over Kentucky in the East regional final of the 1992 NCAA \nTournament.\n  For Barton College, a small private school with a student body of \nonly 960 students, this win over Winona State, a relatively large \nschool with an enrollment of over 8,000 students, represents a ``David \nand Goliath'' story for a smalltown North Carolina basketball team.\n  Again, I congratulate the NCAA Division II National Champion Barton \nBulldogs and head coach Ron Lievense on an extremely exciting end to an \nextraordinary season.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/27/senate-section/article/S3831-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          BIOFUELS FOR ENERGY SECURITY AND TRANSPORTATION ACT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, over 18 months ago, the President signed \ninto law the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The enactment of that \nlegislation was a watershed event in structuring sound energy policy \nfor this Nation's future. One of the linchpins of that act is its \ncommitment to the development of ethanol and other alternative fuels \nthat will move us toward greater energy security by displacing foreign \nsources of energy for our transportation fuels.\n  Since EPACT was enacted, we have seen a surge of interest in the \ndevelopment of infrastructure for production and distribution of \nethanol and other biofuels. I am proud that the Energy Policy Act of \n2005 is greatly responsible for that. EPACT is creating American energy \nand American jobs in America's heartland.\n  Just as I am proud of the new world of alternative fuels created in \nEPACT, I am also very proud of the bill Senator Bingaman and I have \nintroduced to build on the renewable fuels provisions of that Act--the \nBiofuels for Energy Security and Transportation Act, the BEST Act--of \n2007.\n  The Energy Policy Act established the first renewable fuels standard, \nwhich required the production of 7.5 billion gallons of ethanol \nannually by the year 2012. Private industry responded, and today we are \non course to exceeding significantly the levels set in the Energy. \nSince August 2005, construction has begun on more than 70 new ethanol \nbiorefineries, creating more than 160,000 new jobs, and last year, this \ncountry produced nearly 5 billion gallons of ethanol.\n  Building on that success, the BEST Act that Senator Bingaman and I \nhave introduced increases the renewable fuels standard, RFS--beginning \nat a level of 8.5 billion gallons next year and increasing to 36 \nbillion gallons in 2022. We get this ambitious RFS with the \nunderstanding that promotion and enhancement of advanced biofuels, such \nas cellulosic ethanol, will be essential to making this new goal a \nreality.\n\n  In his recent State of the Union speech, the President laid out an \nambitious but worthy goal to reduce our consumption of gasoline by 20 \npercent in 10 years. The President envisioned biofuels as a key \ncomponent to meeting this goal. In addition to implementing the 2005 \nEnergy Bill, the BEST Act is another step, and a very significant one, \nin achieving that mark. By increasing our production and consumption of \nbiofuels in the United States, we can decrease our reliance on foreign \noil, while at the same time creating American jobs in a growing \nbiofuels industry.\n  To complement the increase in the renewable fuels standard, our bill \nincludes several measures to help promote the establishment of a \nbiofuels infrastructure, including grants to States and localities to \nbuild biofuels corridors.\n  Another enhancement to speed production and distribution of these \nfuels is Federal loan guarantees specifically for these projects. I am \npleased that we appear to be getting on the right path to implementing \na significant loan guarantee program as envisioned in the title 17 of \nEPACT. This provision is absolutely essential to starting up some of \nthe domestic clean energy investments we so urgently need to ensure our \nenergy security. The BEST Act further refines those provisions to \nreflect the realities of commercial project finance.\n  Finally, the bill increases our investment in bioenergy research and \ndevelopment by 50 percent. This research is essential to developing \nmethods to produce advanced biofuels, such as cellulosic ethanol, that \nwe will need to meet our long-term goals.\n  Several weeks ago, Senator Bingaman and I sponsored a biofuels \nconference in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to explore all \nof the issues related to this important piece of our energy policy. We \nheard from numerous government and private sector scientists, industry \nproject developers, and the financial community. We explored every \nfacet of the issues related to increased biofuels production and \ndevelopment. The BEST Act we have introduced is the culmination of our \ndeliberations. I am very pleased with this effort and hopeful that it \nwill be every bit as successful as the effort we spawned in the 2005 \nEnergy bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/27/senate-section/article/S3831-4", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3831-S3832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         RETIREMENT OF JOE DART\n\n Mr. KERRY.

A resolution adopted by the California State Lands \n     Commission urging the Senate to pass Senate Resolution 151; \n     to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n       Whereas, U.S. Senators Boxer and Feinstein have introduced \n     S. 151 to prohibit new oil and gas leasing in federal waters \n     off California; and\n\n[[Page S3833]]\n\n       Whereas, California's 1,100 mile coastline, with its \n     beautiful beaches, wild cliffs, abundant fish stocks and \n     fragile environment is a national treasure and a valuable \n     state resource, which is at the heart of a tourist industry \n     that generates nearly five billion dollars in state and local \n     taxes each year; and is the heart of the state's $43 billion \n     ocean economy; and\n       Whereas, the citizens of California have long opposed new \n     oil and gas drilling off their coastline and support \n     protecting the fragile and valuable coastal environment over \n     development of the relatively small amounts of oil and gas \n     offshore California; and\n       Whereas, California initiated protection of its coast from \n     oil and gas development when the California Legislature in \n     1955 and 1963, prohibited oil and gas leasing in the State \n     waters off Monterey and Santa Cruz counties and portions of \n     Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Humboldt, and \n     Mendocino Counties; and\n       Whereas, the California State Lands Commission has not \n     issued any offshore oil and gas lease for new areas since the \n     1969 spill from a well in Federal waters off Santa Barbara \n     that released over three million gallons of crude oil, \n     coating Santa Barbara County's ocean beaches; and\n       Whereas, the California Legislature continued the State's \n     efforts to restrict oil and development in its own waters by \n     enacting the California Coastal Sanctuary Act in 1994, which \n     codified the Commission's earlier administrative prohibition \n     of new offshore leases and created a statutory statewide \n     coastal sanctuary that prohibits future oil and gas leasing \n     in all State coastal waters, from Mexico to the Oregon \n     border, in perpetuity; and\n       Whereas, the U.S. Congress has protected California \n     coastline from expanded offshore drilling for more than \n     twenty years, renewing this protection in the form of a \n     legislative moratorium contained in the annual appropriations \n     bill for the Department of the Interior; and\n       Whereas, the need for new oil development can be reduced by \n     improving automobile fuel efficiency and energy efficiency, \n     utilizing and further researching renewable energy and \n     alternative fuels, and fully funding energy conservation and \n     efficiency programs, including solar and renewables, \n     weatherization, and other initiatives; thus increasing energy \n     independence and reducing the reliance on foreign oil; and\n       Whereas, in spite of the steady opposition to new oil and \n     gas leasing off California, various proposals have been made \n     in the last five years to end the federal moratorium or to \n     take steps, such as oil and gas inventories, that are \n     intended to lead to new leasing; and\n       Whereas, the Commission has adopted six resolutions since \n     2001 supporting the existing moratorium on new federal leases \n     and opposing the new initiatives to open the California coast \n     to new oil and gas development and leases; and\n       Whereas, S. 151, recently introduced by Senator's Boxer and \n     Feinstein would permanently ban new oil and gas leasing in \n     federal waters, consistent with the state's own prohibition \n     of new leasing in state waters; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the California State Lands Commission, That it \n     supports S. 151 and the prohibition it proposes for new oil \n     and gas leases in federal waters off California and urges \n     Congress to adopt this measure; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Congress of the United States and the \n     Federal government be encouraged to explore options to \n     increase energy independence and reduce reliance on foreign \n     oil, such as incentives to improve energy efficiency, \n     requirements to improve automobile fuel efficiency, provide \n     funding for research into renewable energy and alternative \n     fuels, and fully funding energy conservation and efficiency; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Commission's Executive Officer transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Governor of California, to the \n     Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, to \n     the Speaker and Minority Leader of the United States House of \n     Representatives, to the Chairs and Ranking Minority Members \n     of the House Committee on Natural Resources, the House \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce, the Senate Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources, and the Senate Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works and to each Senator and \n     Representative from California in the Congress of the United \n     States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-50. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     urging Congress to enact the Great Lakes Asian Carp Barrier \n     Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 17\n\n       Whereas, two species of Asian carp are on the verge of \n     invading the Great Lakes. Silver carp and bighead carp have \n     advanced up the Mississippi River since their escape from \n     southern fish farms in the early 1980s, and now have been \n     identified within miles of Lake Michigan in the Illinois \n     River near Chicago; and\n       Whereas, Asian carp pose a significant risk to the ecology \n     and economy of the Great Lakes region. Asian carp can grow as \n     large as 100 pounds and are voracious feeders. They compete \n     with native fish for food and degrade water quality by \n     disturbing sediments. They could become a dominant species in \n     the Great Lakes, threatening a $4.5 billion commercial and \n     recreational fishery. Silver carp can also jump up to 10 feet \n     out of the water when disturbed, posing a risk to \n     recreational boaters; and\n       Whereas, Asian carp are the latest in a long line of exotic \n     species to threaten the Great Lakes. Over 180 exotic species \n     have invaded the Great Lakes since European settlement. The \n     most harmful exotic species, zebra mussels and sea lampreys, \n     have cost an estimated $100 million per year to control \n     during the 1990s. Scientists project that Asian carp could \n     have a similar impact on the Great Lakes; and\n       Whereas, the only thing preventing the movement of Asian \n     carp into the Great Lakes is a temporary electrical barrier \n     in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal operated by the United \n     States Army Corps of Engineers. In addition, the Army Corps \n     and the state of Illinois are constructing a permanent \n     electrical barrier to replace the temporary barrier; and\n       Whereas, to date, over $12 million has been spent on \n     construction and operation of the electrical barriers. To \n     help match federal funding, the state of Michigan has \n     contributed nearly $70,000 toward the completion of the \n     permanent electrical barrier; and\n       Whereas, current funding is insufficient to complete \n     construction of the permanent barrier and only finances \n     operation of the temporary barrier through the first half of \n     fiscal year 2007. In addition, there is no funding to \n     renovate the temporary barrier as a permanent backup to the \n     new barrier; and\n       Whereas, The Great Lakes Asian Carp Barrier Act (H.R. 553 \n     and S. 336) would provide funds to upgrade the current \n     barrier and complete construction of the permanent barrier; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the United States Congress to enact the Great \n     Lakes Asian Carp Barrier Act (H.R. 553 and S. 336) to protect \n     the Great Lakes from Asian carp; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-51. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the State of \n     Kentucky urging Congress to repeal the Government Pension \n     Offset and the Windfall Elimination Provision; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 45\n\n       Whereas, the intent of Congress in the enactment of the \n     Government Pension Offset (GPO) and the Windfall Elimination \n     Provision (WEP) was to protect the Social Security program \n     and eliminate perceived abuses in the payment of dual \n     benefits to certain beneficiaries; and\n       Whereas, the GPO and WEP, have resulted in devastating, \n     unintended consequences for hundreds of thousands of teachers \n     and other public employees nationwide; and\n       Whereas, the GPO affects teachers and other public \n     employees in Kentucky and other states who are participants \n     in public retirement systems but who do not participate in \n     the Social Security retirement program; and\n       Whereas, under the GPO, a teacher who receives benefits \n     under the Kentucky Teachers' Retirement System will suffer at \n     least a two-thirds reductions in the Social Security survivor \n     benefits the teacher would otherwise receive from a spouse's \n     private-sector earnings; and\n       Whereas, teachers in fifteen states, including Kentucky, do \n     not participate in the Social Security program; and\n       Whereas, the WEP reduces the Social Security benefits of a \n     teacher or other public employee who has participated and \n     received earnings sufficient to qualify for Social Security \n     retirement benefits as well as the benefits procured under \n     the Kentucky Teachers' Retirement System or other public \n     retirement system; and\n       Whereas, the GPO and WEP unfairly target public employees, \n     especially our highly valued teachers who sacrifice lucrative \n     earnings in the private sector to educate our children; and\n       Whereas, Kentucky has a significant teacher shortage and \n     loses more than 2000 teachers annually to retirement and must \n     actively recruit new teachers to meet growing enrollment \n     demands; and\n       Whereas, a federal proposal to repel both the GPO and WEP, \n     the Social Security Fairness Act of 2007, has been introduced \n     in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate and \n     clearly indicates an awareness and acknowledgment of the \n     devastating impact of these provisions on teachers and other \n     public employees; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:\n       Section 1. The House of Representatives of the Commonwealth \n     of Kentucky urges the Congress of the United States to enact \n     the Social Security Fairness Act of 2007 or similar \n     legislation to repeal the GPO and WEP provisions of the \n     Social Security law.\n       Section 2. The Clerk of the House of Representatives shall \n     transmit copies of this Resolution to the President and Vice \n     President of the United States to the Speaker of the U.S. \n     House of Representatives, the Majority Floor Leader of the \n     U.S. Senate, and\n\n[[Page S3834]]\n\n     to each Senator and Representative from the Commonwealth of \n     Kentucky in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-52. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     urging the President and Congress to appropriate additional \n     funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program; to \n     the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 33\n\n       Whereas, Home heating is a fundamental necessity in \n     northern climate states during the months from October \n     through March, However, low-income households in Michigan and \n     across the nation struggle to pay for this basic necessity. \n     High energy bills in winter force many low-income households \n     into difficult situations, such as forgoing medicine or food \n     in order to pay energy bills or putting themselves in danger \n     by using stoves and portable heaters to provide warmth; and\n       Whereas, In the early 1980s, Congress recognized the need \n     for heating and other home energy assistance when it enacted \n     legislation to create the Low Income Home Energy Assistance \n     Program (LIHEAP). The LIHEAP program has become a crucial \n     safety net for low-income households and families across the \n     nation, especially in northern climate states. LIHEAP \n     assistance has helped millions of families keep their homes \n     at safe and healthy temperatures; and\n       Whereas, Last year Congress appropriated a record level \n     $3.2 billion in LIHEAP funding. In spite of this, only a \n     fraction of eligible low income households received \n     assistance. According to the United States Department of \n     Health and Human Services, last winter only 15 percent of 38 \n     million eligible low-income households actually received \n     assistance from the LIHEAP program; and\n       Whereas, This year, with the adoption of a September 29th, \n     continuing resolution, Congress has appropriated only $1.98 \n     billion for LIHEAP. The President's proposed FY 2008 budget \n     calls for funding to be reduced further to $1.78 billion. \n     Under these funding proposals, it is estimated that Michigan \n     will receive as much as $47 million dollars less than last \n     year. This will surely mean that state energy assistance \n     programs will be forced to shut down programs and turn needy \n     people away. Last year, even with the record level funding, \n     only 35 percent of eligible low-income households in Michigan \n     received LIHEAP assistance; and\n       Whereas, such inadequate LIHEAP funding could be disastrous \n     for Michigan. The state is struggling through one of the \n     nation's worst economic situations. Currently, nearly one \n     third of Michigan households are at or below 60 percent of \n     the state's median income, and the unemployment rate, which \n     is already much higher than the national average, keeps \n     growing. Clearly, such tough economic times coupled with a \n     cold, harsh winter, and high heating fuel prices, make LIHEAP \n     funding vital for the state of Michigan; now, therefore be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives. That we urge the \n     President and the Congress of the United States to \n     immediately increase funding for LIHEAP to at least last \n     year's level of $3.2 billion; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Office of the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-53. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     urging Congress to enact the Employee Free Choice Act; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 21\n\n       Whereas, In 1935, the United States established, by law, \n     that workers must be free to form unions. The freedom to form \n     or join a union is internationally recognized as a \n     fundamental human right; and\n       Whereas, Union membership provides workers better wages and \n     benefits, and protection from discrimination and unsafe \n     workplaces. Unions benefit communities by strengthening tax \n     bases, promoting equal treatment, and enhancing civic \n     participation; and\n       Whereas, Even though on paper America's workers have the \n     freedom to choose for themselves whether to have a union, in \n     reality, workers across the nation are routinely denied that \n     right. More than 40 million United States workers say they \n     would join a union now if they had the opportunity; and\n       Whereas, When the right of workers to form a union is \n     violated, wages fall, race and gender pay gaps widen, \n     workplace discrimination increases, and job safety standards \n     disappear; and\n       Whereas, Many thousands of workers in our country are \n     routinely threatened, coerced, or fired each year because \n     they try to form a union. Most violations of workers' freedom \n     to choose a union occur behind closed doors, and each year \n     millions of dollars are spent to frustrate workers' efforts \n     to form unions; and\n       Whereas, A worker's fundamental right to choose a union is \n     a public issue that requires a public policy solution, \n     including legislative remedies; and\n       Whereas, The Employee Free Choice Act (H.R. 800) has been \n     introduced in the United States Congress in order to restore \n     workers' freedom to join a union; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the United States Congress to enact the Employee \n     Free Choice Act, which would authorize the National Labor \n     Relations Board to certify a union as the bargaining \n     representative when a majority of employees voluntarily sign \n     authorizations designating that union to represent them; \n     provide for first contract mediation and, arbitration; and \n     establish meaningful penalties for violations of a worker's \n     freedom to choose a union; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-54. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan urging the President and \n     Congress to increase funding for the Low Income Home Energy \n     Assistance Program and to facilitate the establishment of \n     programs that provide information about responsible energy \n     use; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 10\n\n       Whereas, Each winter, public and private programs offering \n     help to low-income families trying to heat their homes \n     usually find their budgets stretched thin; and\n       Whereas, Fortunately, there is a federally funded program \n     that provides energy assistance to low-income households. The \n     Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is a \n     federal block grant program that provides billions of dollars \n     annually to help low-income households pay energy bills. \n     LIHEAP funds have averted numerous tragedies by enabling \n     needy families to keep their homes at healthy and safe \n     temperatures during the bitter cold months of winter; and\n       Whereas, Utility companies, government agencies, and \n     nonprofit organizations often make information available to \n     low-income families to help reduce their heating bills. Such \n     information often recognizes the need for reducing home \n     energy costs through the use of conservation technologies and \n     flexible bill payment practices designed to help empower low-\n     income consumers to pay their utility bills on a discounted \n     basis; and\n       Whereas, Coordinated and efficient consumer education \n     programs of federal, state, and local agencies could help \n     consumers take responsibility for their winter heating bills. \n     Educational programming on things such as how to set proper \n     temperatures in the home, the use of programmable \n     thermostats, tips on household budgeting, how to weatherize a \n     home, and energy efficiency training could better prepare \n     low-income households with the skills needed to control their \n     winter heating costs; and\n       Whereas, The President's proposed budget for next year \n     would reduce the percentage of eligible needy families that \n     receive LIHEAP assistance. The President is requesting only \n     $1.782 billion for LIHEAP in FY 2008. This is far less than \n     the $5.1 billion that is authorized for the program under the \n     U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 and a dramatic 44 percent \n     reduction from FY 2006 funding levels. According to the \n     National Energy Assistance Directors' Association (NEADA), \n     the President's proposed cut to LIHEAP would force states to \n     eliminate energy assistance to more than a million \n     households; and\n       Whereas, The President's proposal would hit Michigan \n     particularly hard. No other northern climate state is \n     suffering through such tough economic times. Michigan \n     finished last year with one of the nation's worst \n     unemployment rates, second only to Mississippi. Since 2003, \n     the unemployment rate in Michigan has exceeded the national \n     rate by an ever-widening margin. As the number of unemployed \n     persons in the state grows, so, too, does the number of \n     households seeking energy assistance. In spite of this, under \n     the President's proposal, it is estimated that the state \n     would receive nearly $50 million less than it did last year. \n     Clearly, we should educate customers on how to use energy \n     wisely and we should adequately fund the LIHEAP program to \n     ensure that low-income families in Michigan and across the \n     nation receive the help they need during the bitter cold \n     months of winter; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the President \n     and the Congress of the United States, particularly the \n     Michigan congressional delegation and the chairman of the \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce, to do all they can to \n     provide additional funding for the Low Income Home Energy \n     Assistance Program and facilitate the establishment of \n     programs that provide information on responsible energy use; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Office of the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/27/senate-section/article/S3834-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3834-S3835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. INOUYE, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation, with an amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute:\n       S. 39.

A bill to establish the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad \nFoundation under the authorities of the Mutual Educational and Cultural \nExchange Act of 1961; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have spoken many times about one of our \nNation's greatest public servants, the late Senator Paul Simon. He was \nan honorable man who devoted his life to working for the public good.\n  In the months before his untimely death, Senator Simon returned to \nWashington to talk to his former colleagues about the need to \nstrengthen our Nation's international understanding and our ability to \nremain a world leader in the 21st century. His desire to promote peace \nand security through mutual understanding and sensitivity to the rest \nof the world was borne out of the tragic events of September 11, 2001.\n  Senator Simon struggled with the question of how America could lead \nwhen so few of our citizens have the proper knowledge and understanding \nof the world beyond our borders. He knew that America's security, \nglobal competitiveness, and diplomatic efforts in working towards a \npeaceful society rest on our young people's global competence and \nability to appreciate languages and cultural and social realities \nbeyond what they may have experienced in the United States. He \nenvisioned a United States populated by a generation of Americans with \na greater knowledge and understanding of the world--a generation of our \nNation's future leaders that have been abroad and have a personal \nconnection to another part of the world.\n  Senator Simon's tireless efforts led to Congress's establishment of \nthe Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Commission. I was honored to serve on \nthis bipartisan Commission, and it was a privilege for me to introduce \nlegislation last year that brought Senator Simon's dream one step \ncloser to reality. The bill, based on the Commission's recommendations, \nwould have established a study abroad program for undergraduate \nstudents that would help build global awareness and international \nunderstanding.\n  I am once again proud to stand here today and introduce legislation \nthat embodies Senator Simon's vision. The bill has been renamed the \nSenator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act so that all future \ngenerations will remember Senator Simon's commitment to international \neducation.\n  The goal of this legislation remains the same: to encourage and \nsupport the experience of studying abroad in developing countries--in \ncountries whose people, culture, language, government, and religion \nmight be very different from ours. This bill aims to have at least 1 \nmillion undergraduate students study abroad annually within 10 years \nand to expand study abroad opportunities for students who are currently \nunderrepresented.\n  The Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act would establish \nstudy abroad as a national priority and provide the catalyst for the \neducation community to commit to making study abroad an institutional \npriority.\n  This legislation would create an independent public-private entity, \nthe Senator Paul Simon Foundation, that would award grants to carry out \nthe goal of making study abroad in high-quality programs in diverse \nlocations around the world the routine, rather than the exception, for \ncollege students. Students who were previously unable to study abroad \ndue to financial constraints would be eligible for grants. Grants also \nwould provide colleges, universities and nongovernmental institutions \nwith the financial incentive to develop programs that make it easier \nfor college students to study abroad.\n  The future of our country depends on having globally literate \ncitizens--those who are able to look at other points of view and \nincorporate those ideas into their thinking and manner of interacting \nwith others. I have shared this\n\n[[Page S3838]]\n\nPaul Simon quote before, and I will do so again because it is the most \npoignant example of Paul's vision in his own words:\n\n       A nation cannot drift into greatness. We must dream, and we \n     must be willing to make small sacrifices to achieve those \n     dreams. This major national initiative can lift our vision \n     and responsiveness to the rest of the world.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me and with Senator Coleman in \nsupport of this legislation and to see to it that Senator Paul Simon's \ndream of building a stronger and more culturally aware nation is \nrealized.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 991\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Senator Paul Simon Study \n     Abroad Foundation Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to President George W. Bush, ``America's \n     leadership and national security rest on our commitment to \n     educate and prepare our youth for active engagement in the \n     international community.''.\n       (2) According to former President William J. Clinton, \n     ``Today, the defense of United States interests, the \n     effective management of global issues, and even an \n     understanding of our Nation's diversity require ever-greater \n     contact with, and understanding of, people and cultures \n     beyond our borders.''.\n       (3) Congress authorized the establishment of the Commission \n     on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program \n     pursuant to section 104 of the Miscellaneous Appropriations \n     and Offsets Act, 2004 (division H of Public Law 108-199). \n     Pursuant to its mandate, the Commission has submitted to \n     Congress and the President a report of its recommendations \n     for greatly expanding the opportunity for students at \n     institutions of higher education in the United States to \n     study abroad, with special emphasis on studying in developing \n     nations.\n       (4) Studies consistently show that United States students \n     score below their counterparts in other advanced countries on \n     indicators of international knowledge. This lack of global \n     literacy is a national liability in an age of global trade \n     and business, global interdependence, and global terror.\n       (5) By numbers ranging from 77 to more than 90 percent, \n     Americans believe that it is important for their children to \n     learn other languages, study abroad, attend a college where \n     they can interact with international students, learn about \n     other countries and cultures, and generally be prepared for \n     the global age, according to a December 2005 national survey \n     commissioned by NAFSA: Association of International \n     Educators.\n       (6) In today's world, it is more important than ever for \n     the United States to be a responsible, constructive leader \n     that other countries are willing to follow. Such leadership \n     cannot be sustained without an informed citizenry with much \n     more knowledge and awareness of the world than most Americans \n     currently possess.\n       (7) Study abroad has proven to be a very effective means of \n     imparting international and foreign-language competency to \n     students.\n       (8) In any given year, only approximately one percent of \n     all students enrolled in United States institutions of higher \n     education study abroad.\n       (9) Less than 10 percent of the students who graduate from \n     United States institutions of higher education with bachelors \n     degrees have studied abroad.\n       (10) Far more study abroad must take place in the \n     developing countries. Ninety-five percent of the world's \n     population growth over the next 50 years will occur outside \n     of Europe. Yet in the academic year 2004-2005, 60 percent of \n     United States students studying abroad studied in Europe, and \n     45 percent studied in four countries--the United Kingdom, \n     Italy, Spain, and France--according to the Institute of \n     International Education.\n       (11) The Final Report of the National Commission on \n     Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (The 9/11 Commission \n     Report) recommended that the United States increase support \n     for ``scholarship, exchange, and library programs''. The 9/11 \n     Public Discourse Project, successor to the 9/11 Commission, \n     noted in its November 14, 2005, status report that this \n     recommendation was ``unfulfilled,'' and stated that ``The \n     U.S. should increase support for scholarship and exchange \n     programs, our most powerful tool to shape attitudes over the \n     course of a generation.''. In its December 5, 2005, Final \n     Report on the 9/11 Commission Recommendations, the 9/11 \n     Public Discourse Project gave the government a grade of ``D'' \n     for its implementation of this recommendation.\n       (12) Investing in a national study abroad program would \n     help turn a grade of ``D'' into an ``A'' by equipping United \n     States students to communicate United States values and way \n     of life through the unique dialogue that takes place among \n     citizens from around the world when individuals study abroad.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to significantly enhance the global competitiveness and \n     international knowledge base of the United States by ensuring \n     that more students in United States institutions of higher \n     education have the opportunity to acquire foreign language \n     skills and international knowledge through significantly \n     expanded study abroad;\n       (2) to enhance the foreign policy capacity of the United \n     States by significantly expanding and diversifying the talent \n     pool of individuals with non-traditional foreign language \n     skills and cultural knowledge in the United States who are \n     available for recruitment by United States foreign affairs \n     agencies, legislative branch agencies, and nongovernmental \n     organizations involved in foreign affairs activities;\n       (3) to ensure that an increasing portion of study abroad by \n     United States students will take place in nontraditional \n     study abroad destinations such as the People's Republic of \n     China, countries of the Middle East region, and developing \n     countries; and\n       (4) to create greater cultural understanding of the United \n     States by exposing foreign students and their families to \n     American students in countries that have not traditionally \n     hosted large numbers of American students.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to achieve emission reductions and cost savings \nthrough accelerated use of cost-effective lighting technologies in \npublic buildings, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \n``Public Buildings Cost Reduction Act of 2007.'' I am joined by my \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee colleagues Senators Inhofe, \nLautenberg, Alexander, Cardin, Lieberman, Clinton, and Klobuchar. This \nbill will reduce air pollution and save taxpayer money by accelerating \nthe use of cost-effective technologies that reduce energy use in public \nbuildings.\n  The goal of this legislation is to have the government lead by \nexample. This bill will help to ensure less polluting and more cost-\neffective General Services Administration, or GSA, buildings. Under \nthis legislation, the GSA, which is the Nation's largest public real \nestate organization, must establish a program to speed the use of cost-\neffective and energy-efficient technology and other actions, called \n``cost-effective technologies and practices'', in its buildings. GSA \nalso must assure that a manager is named who is responsible for \naccelerating the use of cost-effective technologies and practices for \neach GSA building.\n  In addition, the GSA must review current and available highly-\nefficient lighting within 90 days, and complete a plan within 6 months \nfor installing highly-efficient lighting in GSA buildings. Within 1 \nyear after enactment, GSA must issue a detailed timetable to replace \nall existing inefficient lighting in GSA buildings as quickly as \nfeasible, within 5 years, using available funds.\n  A second provision in the bill requires GSA to complete a broader \nplan that will: (1) achieve a 20-percent reduction in operating costs \nat GSA facilities to the maximum extent feasible within 5 years after \nenactment through the application of cost-effective, highly efficient \ntechnologies and practices, using available funds; (2) describe the \ncurrent and needed funding for these programs and any issues that may \ninhibit their implementation; (3) recommend uniform standards for \nfederal agencies for highly efficient technologies; and (4) recommend \nways to allow federal agencies to keep their savings from using \nefficient technologies and practices, to use them for additional \ninvestments and other purposes.\n  The bill also creates an EPA grant program to help local governments \nmake their buildings more efficient. This $20 million per year matching \ngrant program at EPA will help local governments renovate their \nbuildings to make them more cost-effective and energy efficient. The \ngrant program will require a 40 percent match from the local \ngovernment, and will require grantees to show they will cut utility \nbills by 40 percent through renovations of a building or buildings that \nuse highly efficient technologies and practices. Further, EPA will have \nto verify the efficiency and savings and issue guidelines for the \nprogram. Grants of up to $1 million will be allowed. In addition, the \nbill requires reports to Congress on progress under the program, \nsavings achieved, and recommendations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 992\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve pediatric research; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Pediatric \nResearch Improvement Act, legislation to reauthorize the Pediatric Rule \nand extend it permanently. I believe that doing so is critically \nimportant to ensure that the drugs designed for children are safe and \neffective for children. This legislation will result in better health \noutcomes for our children, grandchildren, and many generations of \nchildren to come.\n  In 1998, the FDA issued a regulation called the pediatric rule, which \nallowed the agency to require companies to perform pediatric clinical \ntrials on medications used by children. It is important to note that \nthis requirement does not slow the drug approval process. If a drug is \nnot likely to be used in the pediatric population, it is not subject to \nthis testing. Companies can also apply for a deferral, so that they can \nperform necessary tests after a drug has been approved and is being \nused in the adult population.\n  In October 2002, a U.S. District Court found that the FDA had \nexceeded its statutory authority when it promulgated the Pediatric \nRule, and that Congress needed to explicitly award the FDA the power to \nrequire these clinical trials.\n  In response, I worked with my colleagues in Congress to pass the \nPediatric Research Equity Act, legislation that codified the Pediatric \nRule, and which was signed into law on December 3, 2003.\n  Since 2003, over 100 drugs have been evaluated under PREA--and since \n1998, more than 1,000 drugs have fallen under the authority of the \npediatric rule. The legislation has successfully resulted in increased \npediatric evaluations. We've been able to collect data on drugs \ncommonly used in children--like azithromycin, an antibiotic used to \ntreat bronchitis, pneumonia, and other respiratory infections--as well \nas drugs that may not be so commonly used, but that help keep children \nalive, like emtriva, one of the newer drugs we have to treat AIDS.\n  But unless we act to reauthorize this legislation now, the pediatric \nrule is set to sunset on September 30 of this year, placing in jeopardy \nthe ability of the agency to require these safeguards for our children.\n  In order to address this, I am introducing the Pediatric Research \nImprovement Act to remove the sunset for the pediatric rule, so that we \nwill never again be in danger of losing the authority to make sure that \nthe drugs designed for children are safe for children.\n  In addition to making the rule permanent, this reauthorization would \ndo the following:\n  Improves Coordination between Pediatric Specialists and Others at the \nFDA. In order to improve coordination with the pediatric exclusivity \nprovisions of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA), PRIA \nwould expand an internal FDA committee to review all issues of \npediatric-related labeling and assessments. Doing so ensures that a \ndrug that falls under PRIA or BPCA is reviewed not only by experts for \nthat particular drug, but those with pediatric expertise.\n  Streamlines the process for obtaining pediatric data on already-\nmarketed drugs. If a company chooses not to pursue pediatric \nexclusivity for an already marketed drug under the Best Pharmaceuticals \nfor Children Act, the Secretary has the authority to require the \nsubmission of pediatric data for the drug. This authority has never \nbeen utilized, in part due to the lengthy administrative process \nrequired. PRIA would streamline this administrative process and help \nget essential data on drugs for which it is vitally needed, while \npreserving the ability of companies to have a fair review of the \nagency's decisions.\n  Increases Data about the Use and Applicability of PRIA. PRIA would \nrequire two reports--one from the Institute of Medicine and one from \nthe GAO--that would allow us to have better data on the number and ways \nin which the pediatric rule is used, and evaluate its contributions to \nensuring overall pediatric drug safety.\n  This legislation is supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics, \nElizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, Ambulatory Pediatric \nAssociation, American Pediatric Society, Association of Medical School \nPediatric Department Chairs, and the Society for Pediatric Research.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to pass this \nvital piece of legislation as quickly as possible, and help to ensure \nthat our pediatricians and other health professionals have the tools \nthey need to provide safe and effective treatment to our Nation's \nchildren.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TESTER (for himself and Mr. Salazar):\n  S. 994. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to eliminate \nthe deductible and change the method of determining the mileage \nreimbursement rate under the beneficiary travel program administered by \nthe Secretary of Veteran Affairs, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce legislation \nthat will go a long ways toward meeting our Nation's obligations to our \nrural veterans. The Disabled Fairness Act will make a real improvement \nin the lives of America's rural veterans--more than 17,000 of whom live \nin my State.\n  For many veterans who live far from a VA hospital or community health \ncenter, transportation remains the single biggest obstacle to care. \nToday, disabled veterans are eligible to have only a small fraction of \ntheir transportation costs reimbursed. They must pay the first $18 per \nmonth out of their own pocket. And after that, they receive \nreimbursement at the rate of just 11 cents per mile--less than one-\nquarter of the current rate of 48.5 cents per mile for Government \nemployees. The reimbursement rate has not been changed since 1977. That \nis unacceptable.\n  In Montana, we have several very good VA health clinics, as well as \none of the best hospitals in the VA system, the Ft. Harrison Hospital \nin Helena. But the smaller clinics simply cannot provide all the \nservices that Ft. Harrison offers. That is no complaint against these \nclinics, it is just a fact.\n  So when a disabled veteran in my State gets in his car and drives 200 \nmiles from Havre to the Ft. Harrison VA hospital in Helena to receive \ntreatment for an injury he suffered while defending our country, he \nwill be reimbursed $4. On the way back, he will be eligible to be \nreimbursed $22. That is $26 total for a trip that the Federal \nGovernment estimates will actually cost $194. That is a slap in the \nface to someone whose life has been fundamentally altered by the wounds \nthey suffered on the field of battle.\n  In the last month, AAA reports that the price of gas in Montana has \nincreased 36 cents over the last month. That means disabled veterans \nare spending much more of their own money to get to a VA hospital, \nespecially in places like Montana, where a trip to the hospital can \nmean a journey of hundreds of miles.\n  The Disabled Veterans Fairness Act ends this practice. My bill \nrepeals the $18 per month deductible that disabled veterans must \nsatisfy before they can be eligible for reimbursement for mileage \ntraveled to and from a VA hospital for treatment. The bill also raises \nthe reimbursement rate from the current level of 11 cents per mile to \nthe prevailing rate for Federal employees, as determined by the General \nServices Administration.\n  I also want to thank Senator Salazar for his advice on this \nlegislation. I am proud to have him as a cosponsor. He has worked so \nhard to improve the lives of rural veterans, and I look forward to \nsupporting his efforts in the coming months as well.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 996. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to expand \npassenger facility fee eligibility for certain noise compatibility \nprojects; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto allow the Los Angeles World Airports\n\n[[Page S3843]]\n\nto provide the Lennox and Inglewood School Districts, which lie \ndirectly in the Los Angeles International Airport's flight path, with \nnoise reduction funds.\n  This bill would authorize the Los Angeles World Airports to allow the \nuse of passenger facility fees for noise reduction projects at these \nschools.\n  In 1980, the Lennox School District and the City of Los Angeles \nsettled a lawsuit, allowing aircraft carrying up to 40 million people \nper year to fly overhead the schools. The City also agreed to provide \napproximately $2.5 million to the Lennox School District.\n  Currently, an airplane flies a few hundred feet above the Lennox and \nInglewood schools about every three minutes. The noise is deafening. It \nrattles windows, disrupts lessons, and makes it very difficult for \nthese students to learn.\n  In February 2005, the Lennox and Inglewood School Districts settled a \nlawsuit with the Los Angeles World Airports under which the Los Angeles \nInternational Airport agreed to provide the School Districts with more \nthan $110 million in noise mitigation funds over 10 years. These funds \nare essential for the improvement of conditions at these schools.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Aviation Administration interpreted the \n1980 agreement and Federal law in a way that prevents the payment of \nthe funds under the 2005 agreement.\n  Thus, Federal legislation is necessary to allow the use of passenger \nfacility fees for noise reduction projects at the Lennox and Inglewood \nschools. I am introducing legislation to do just this.\n  This bill was drafted with the assistance of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, and it has the support of the Lennox and Inglewood \nSchool Districts, the Los Angeles World Airports, and the Los Angeles \nMayor, Antonio Villaraigosa. My colleague in the House of \nRepresentatives, Congresswoman Jane Harman, will introduce this same \nbill today.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this non-controversial \nlegislation that will allow for the use of passenger facility fees for \nnoise reduction projects in the Lennox and Inglewood School Districts. \nI ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 996\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enhance the Federal Telework Program; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator Landrieu in \nintroducing the Telework Enhancement Act of 2007. This legislation will \nbuild on the existing Federal telework program to ensure maximum \nparticipation in the program among those in the Federal workforce. This \nmeasure will improve the cost-efficiency of the Federal Government and \nwill also serve to reduce traffic congestion and thereby save fuel and \ngreenhouse gas emissions. It will also enhance efforts by the Federal \nGovernment with respect to continuity of operations, COOP, provide \nemployee incentives to attract and retain highly skilled Federal \npersonnel, and provide a model for the private sector.\n  In 2000, the key legislation affecting telework in the Federal \nGovernment was signed into law as part of that year's highway bill. The \nenacted provision provided that ``each executive agency . . . establish \na policy under which eligible employees of the agency may participate \nin telecommuting to the maximum extent possible without diminished \nemployee performance.'' The measure was intended to apply to 25 percent \nof the Federal workforce, and to an additional 25 percent of the \nworkforce each year thereafter.\n  The objective of that measure, as outlined in the bill's conference \nreport, was to ``reduce traffic congestion'' and to allow Federal \nemployees to telework to the maximum extent possible. The Report also \nmade clear that each Federal agency was to establish telework criteria, \nand remove any ``managerial, logistical, organizational, or other \nbarriers to full implementation and successful functioning of the \npolicy. . . and provide for adequate administrative, human resources, \ntechnical, and logistical support for carrying out the policy.''\n  The lead agencies that have carried out this telework mandate are \nOffice of Personnel Management, OPM, and the General Services \nAdministration, GSA. Together these agencies formed a common Web site \nwww.telework.gov to facilitate the advancement of the program, which \nhas had a degree of success. As of 2004, of the 1.7 million Federal \nemployees in the 82 agencies, 752,337 had been deemed eligible for \ntelework, which was an increase from 521,542 in 2001. But despite a \nvery loose definition of ``telework,'' which only requires that an \nemployee work from home 1 day per week to be considered a \n``teleworker,'' 140,694, or 19 percent of those eligible, were deemed \nas having teleworked in 2004. Critics argue that this low percentage of \nteleworkers comparable to the much larger pool of telework-eligible \nemployees can be attributed to insufficient employee education, program \ncoordination, and workforce culture issues.\n\n  While OPM and GSA should be commended for the strides they have made \nin implementing the Federal telework program, there are several \nenhancements to the program that can be made legislatively to \nfacilitate the original goal of maximizing telework among eligible \nFederal employees.\n  The bill we introduce today would, among other things: invert the \ntelework eligibility presumption to make all Federal employees eligible \nunless expressly determined otherwise; revise the definition of \n``telework'' to be an arrangement where the employee regularly works at \nan alternate site at least 2 business days per week in order to reduce \nhis/her commute, the current definition only requires 1 day; require \nthat each agency designate a full-time Telework Managing Officer, TMO, \nwithin the agency's chief administrative office, or comparable agency \noffice, to oversee the respective agency's telework program; require \nthat the TMO coordinate the telework policy for the agency or office, \nserve as the liaison between employees and managers, and keep employees \ninformed of their telework eligibility; require the TMO to work to \nexpand the agency's telework program, oversee the COOP program, and \ndevelop a telework performance and accountability system; require the \nTMO to submit a report to the head of the agency annually with an \nanalysis of measures in place to carry out the telework policy; and \nrequire the Government Accountability\n\n[[Page S3844]]\n\nOffice, GAO, to evaluate each agency's telework policy, and publish a \nreport that rates each policy and the level of employee participation.\n  The events of September 11, 2001, the anthrax attacks that occurred \nshortly thereafter, and the recent severe weather experienced across \nthe country have focused our attention on the importance of energy \nindependence, as well as our need to be prepared in the event of a \ndisaster.

Mr. President, stroke is a devastating disease that \naffects young and old, women and men, regardless of their race or \nethnic background. The physical, emotional, and financial toll of \nstroke on individuals and their families is enormous.\n  Fortunately, we have achieved major advances in the prevention and \ntreatment of stroke in recent years that have reduced the high toll of \ndeath and disability. The Nation's investment in research through the \nNational Institutes of Health has led to many of\n\n[[Page S3845]]\n\nthese advances, and it's tragic that so many stroke patients do not yet \nhave access to these advances.\n  That's why Senator Cochran and I have introduced the bipartisan \nStroke Treatment and Ongoing Prevention Act in Congress, to help bring \nwhat we've learned in the laboratory to the bedside of the patient more \nquickly. Both Houses of Congress know the importance of this issue, and \nidentical legislation has been introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives. This bill is intended to become a national commitment \nto end the suffering from stroke. It will also be a promise that every \nAmerican can lead a better and healthier life.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mr. Brown, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n        Biden, Mr. Levin, Mr. Menendez, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Feingold, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S.J. Res. 10. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relative to equal rights for men and \nwomen; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join my colleagues in \nreintroducing the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution. Our \nstrong commitment to equal rights for men and women should be clearly \nreflected in the Nation's founding document.\n  The ERA is essential to guarantee that the freedoms protected by our \nConstitution apply equally to men and women. From the beginning of our \nhistory as a Nation, women have had to wage a constant, long and \ndifficult battle to win the same basic rights granted to men. That \nbattle goes on today, since discrimination still continues in many \nways.\n  Despite passage of the Equal Pay Act and the Civil Rights Act in the \n1960s, discrimination against women continues to permeate the workforce \nand many areas of the economy. Today, women earn about 77 cents for \neach dollar earned by men, and the gap is even greater for women of \ncolor. In 2004, African American women earned only 67 percent of the \nearnings of white men, and Hispanic women earned only 56 percent.\n  Women with college and professional degrees have achieved advances in \na number of professional and managerial occupations in recent years. \nYet more than 60 percent of working women are still clustered in a \nnarrow range of traditionally female, traditionally low-paying \noccupations, and female-headed households continue to dominate the \nbottom rungs of the economic ladder.\n  A stronger effort is clearly needed to finally live up to our \ncommitment of full equality. The Equal Rights Amendment alone cannot \nremedy all discrimination, but it will clearly strengthen the ongoing \nefforts of women across the country to obtain equal treatment.\n  We know from the failed ratification experiences of the past that \namending the Constitution to include the ERA will not be easy to \nachieve. But its extraordinary significance requires us to continue the \nbattle to finally see it approved by Congress and ratified by the \nStates. The women of America deserve no less.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the resolution be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 10\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of \n     each House concurring therein), That the following article is \n     proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as \n     part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of \n     three-fourths of the several States:\n\n                              ``Article--\n\n       ``Section 1.

Res. 125\n\n       Whereas in the United States and around the world, more \n     than 1,000 species are officially designated as at risk of \n     extinction and thousands more also face a heightened risk of \n     extinction;\n       Whereas the actual and potential benefits derived from many \n     species have not yet been fully discovered and would be \n     permanently lost if not for conservation efforts;\n       Whereas recovery efforts for species such as the whooping \n     crane, Kirtland's warbler, the peregrine falcon, the gray \n     wolf, the gray whale, the grizzly bear, and others have \n     resulted in great improvements in the viability of such \n     species;\n       Whereas saving a species requires a combination of sound \n     research, careful coordination, and intensive management of \n     conservation efforts, along with increased public awareness \n     and education;\n       Whereas two-thirds of endangered or threatened species \n     reside on private lands;\n       Whereas voluntary cooperative conservation programs have \n     proven to be critical for habitat restoration and species \n     recovery; and\n       Whereas education and increasing public awareness are the \n     first steps in effectively informing the public about \n     endangered species and species restoration efforts: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 18, 2007, as ``Endangered Species Day''; \n     and\n       (2) encourages--\n       (A) educational entities to spend at least 30 minutes on \n     Endangered Species Day teaching and informing students about \n     threats to, and the restoration of, endangered species around \n     the world, including the essential role of private landowners \n     and private stewardship to the protection and recovery of \n     species;\n       (B) organizations, businesses, private landowners, and \n     agencies with a shared interest in conserving endangered \n     species to collaborate on educational information for use in \n     schools; and\n       (C) the people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution to \nestablish the second annual ``Endangered Species Day'' on May 18, 2007. \nI am submitting this resolution with Senators Collins, Feingold, Levin, \nSnowe, Kerry, Biden, Cantwell, Lieberman, Wyden, Clinton, Crapo, and \nSanders whose co-sponsorship I appreciate.\n  I want to commend my constituent Mr. David Robinson, who first \nsuggested the establishment of an ``Endangered Species Day.'' \nIndividuals like Mr. Robinson do make a difference.\n  The designation of an ``Endangered Species Day'' provides a multitude \nof opportunities for young people, students, and the general public to \nlearn more about endangered species both in our country and abroad.\n  Last year, thirty-six events were held across the country to \nhighlight endangered species success stories. The Governor of Maine, \nthe Rhode Island State legislature, and the cities and counties of \nSanta Barbara, San Diego, and San Francisco also declared State and \nlocal Endangered Species Days. Zoos and aquariums across the country, \nsuch as the Roger Williams Zoo and the San Diego Zoo, also held \neducational events.\n  Endangered Species Day 2006 provided an opportunity for schools, \nlibraries, museums, zoos, aquariums, botanical gardens, agencies, \nbusinesses, community groups, and conservation organizations to educate \nthe public about the importance of protecting endangered species and to \nhighlight everyday actions that individuals and groups can take to help \nprotect our nation's wildlife, fish, and plants.\n  Based on the success of last year, I believe that ``Endangered \nSpecies Day'' fosters increased communication and awareness about many \nof the most endangered species by encouraging such activities as school \nfield trips to the\n\n[[Page S3846]]\n\nzoo or attending a lecture at the local library.\n  In my home State of California, I am especially proud of the \nconservation and management efforts that have helped significantly \nrestore populations of California condor, winter run chinook salmon, \nthe least Bell's vireo songbird, and the California gray whale.\n  Despite these success stories, we need to be aware that more can be \ndone. At this time, we have more than 1,800 species in the U.S. and \nabroad, which are designated as ``at risk'' for extinction.

Mr. WARNER submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the bill H.R. 1591, making emergency supplemental appropriations \nfor the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007, and for other purposes; \nwhich was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       On page 94, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       Sec. 2904. (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress authorized the 2005 Defense Base Closure and \n     Realignment (BRAC) process in the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (Public Law 107-107) \n     as the only fair and objective way for the Department of \n     Defense to reduce excess military base infrastructure and to \n     obtain savings from these reductions.\n       (2) In order to ensure a fair and objective process, the \n     President was required to present to Congress a list of bases \n     to be closed or realigned, as determined by the BRAC \n     Commission, in a totality without any changes or alterations.\n       (3) The President submitted to Congress the decisions of \n     the BRAC Commission under the 2005 round of defense base \n     closure and realignment on September 15, 2005, two and a half \n     years after the commencement of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n       (4) As part of the BRAC process, the Secretary of Defense \n     was required by law to assess the probable threats to \n     national security and, as part of such assessment, determine \n     the potential, prudent, surge requirements to meet those \n     threats.\n       (5) The Department of Defense and the BRAC Commission were \n     required by law to determine whether each decision accounted \n     for the ability to accommodate contingency, mobilization, \n     surge, and future total force requirements at both existing \n     and potential receiving locations to support operations and \n     training.\n       (6) Congress took no action to disapprove the decisions of \n     the Commission, thus allowing the totality of the 2005 round \n     of defense base closure and realignment to become law on \n     November 20, 2005.\n       (7) Contained within the totality of the 2005 BRAC \n     decisions was the realignment of the Walter Reed Army Medical \n     Center in Washington, D.C., which would result in the closure \n     of the main post and the relocation of--\n       (A) all tertiary (sub-specialty and complex care) medical \n     services, Legal Medicine, and a Pathology Program Management \n     Office to National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland;\n       (B) all non-tertiary (primary and specialty) patient care \n     functions to a new community hospital at Fort Belvoir, \n     Virginia;\n       (C) the Armed Forces Medical Examiner, DNA Registry, and \n     Accident Investigation to Dover Air Force Base, Delaware; and\n       (D) the Combat Casualty Care Research sub-function and the \n     enlisted histology technician training to Fort Sam Houston, \n     Texas.\n       (8) The decision to close Walter Reed Army Medical Center \n     is estimated to save the Department of Defense over \n     $170,000,000 annually after 2011.\n       (9) The cost to maintain and renovate current facilities at \n     Walter Reed Army Medical Center and in the national capitol \n     region was estimated by the Department of the Army to exceed \n     $13,000,000,000 over the next 13 years.\n       (10) A delay in the closure or realignment of a military \n     installation would cause further disruption and uncertainty \n     for the workforce supporting the installation and the local \n     community surrounding the installation until the action is \n     complete.\n       (11) The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 \n     (part A of title XXIX of Public Law 101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 \n     note) requires the Secretary of Defense to complete all such \n     closures and realignments no later than September 15, 2011, \n     in order minimize to the negative impact on military \n     operations and local communities by establishing clear, \n     specific goals for the realignment and closure activities.\n       (12) The inadequate conditions and processes recently \n     identified at Walter Reed Army Medical Center are, in part, \n     due to antiquated facilities spread over a 113-acre campus, \n     which was not initially designed for processes necessitated \n     by current military operations.\n       (13) The BRAC decision will allow the Department of Defense \n     to transform legacy medical facilities into a premier, \n     modern, state-of-the-art joint operational medical facility \n     that will combine the best military practitioners, medical \n     practices, and medical research efforts from both the \n     Department of the Army and the Department of the Navy under \n     one roof working side-by-side for wounded servicemembers.\n       (14) The acceleration of the construction at the receiving \n     locations from the closure of Walter Reed Army Medical Center \n     will allow for a quicker transition of functions and patient \n     services to newer, more modern facilities, significantly \n     improving the capability to care for our Nation's wounded \n     service members.\n       (15) Any action by Congress to delay or reverse the BRAC \n     decision to close Walter Reed Army Medical Center will result \n     in an unprecedented disruption to the BRAC process and \n     introduce a level of uncertainty in every other BRAC \n     decision, which could paralyze the efforts of the military \n     and local communities to faithfully carry out the decisions \n     made under the 2005 round of defense base closure and \n     realignment.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the realignment of \n     functions from Walter Reed Army Medical Center, as prescribed \n     under the 2005 round of defense base closure and realignment, \n     should be accelerated to minimize the uncertainty faced by \n     the dedicated professionals serving at the Center, and to \n     ensure the quickest possible completion of facilities and the \n     immediate transfer of functions from the Center.\n       (c) There are authorized to be appropriated $123,000,000 \n     for an additional amount to be deposited into the Department \n     of Defense Base Closure Account 2005 established under \n     section 2906A(a)(1) of the Defense Base Closure and \n     Realignment Act of 1990 (part A of title XXIX of Public Law \n     101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note) for the purpose of accelerating \n     construction activities related to the closure of Walter Reed \n     Army Medical Center. Any funds so appropriated shall remain \n     available until expended.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 696.

Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. Byrd, Ms. Collins, Mr. Nelson of \nNebraska, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Salazar, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. Smith) \nsubmitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill H.R. \n1591, making emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 2007, and for other purposes; which was ordered to \nlie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF CAPABILITIES OF THE IRAQI \n                   SECURITY FORCES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The responsibility for Iraq's internal security and \n     halting sectarian violence must rest primarily with the \n     Government of Iraq, relying on the Iraqi Security Forces \n     (ISF).\n       (2) In quarterly reports to Congress, and in testimony \n     before a number of congressional committees, the Department \n     of Defense reported progress towards training and equipping \n     Iraqi Security Forces; however, the subsequent performance of \n     the Iraqi Security Forces has been uneven and occasionally \n     appeared inconsistent with those reports.\n       (3) On November 15, 2005, President Bush said, ``The plan \n     [is] that we will train Iraqi troops to be able to take the \n     fight to the enemy. And as I have consistently said, as the \n     Iraqis stand up, we will stand down''.\n       (4) In testimony to Congress, on November 15, 2006, U.S. \n     Central Command Commander General John Abizaid said, ``I \n     believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own \n     future''.\n       (5) On January 10, 2007, the President announced a new \n     strategy, which consists of three basic elements: diplomatic, \n     economic, and military; the central component of the military \n     element being an augmentation of the present level of the \n     U.S. military forces with more than 20,000 additional U.S. \n     military troops to Iraq to ``work alongside Iraqi units and \n     be embedded in their formations. Our troops will have a well-\n     defined mission: to help Iraqis clear and secure \n     neighborhoods, to help them protect the local population, and \n     to help ensure that the Iraqi forces left behind are capable \n     of providing the security that Baghdad needs''.\n       (6) The President said on January 10, 2007, that ``I've \n     made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders \n     that America's commitment is not open-ended'' so as to dispel \n     the contrary impression that exists.\n       (7) The latest National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on \n     Iraq, entitled ``Prospects for Iraq's Stability: A \n     Challenging Road Ahead,'' released in January 2007, found: \n     ``If strengthened Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), more loyal to \n     the government and supported by Coalition forces, are able to \n     reduce levels of violence and establish more effective \n     security for Iraq's population, Iraqi leaders could have an \n     opportunity to begin the process of political compromise \n     necessary for longer term stability, political progress, and \n     economic recovery''.\n       (8) The NIE also stated that ``[d]espite real improvements, \n     the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF)--particularly the Iraqi \n     police--will be hard pressed in the next 12-18 months to \n     execute significantly increased security responsibilities''.\n       (9) The current and prospective readiness of the ISF is \n     critical to (A) the long term stability of Iraq, (B) the \n     force protection of U.S. forces conducting combined \n     operations with the ISF; and (C) the scale of U.S. forces \n     deployed to Iraq.\n       (b) Independent Assessment of Capabilities of Iraqi \n     Security Forces.--\n       (1) In general.--There is hereby authorized to be \n     appropriated for the Department of Defense, $750,000, that \n     the Department, in turn, will commission an independent, \n     private-sector entity, which operates as a 501(c)(3) with \n     recognized credentials and expertise in military affairs, to \n     prepare an independent report assessing the following:\n       (A) The readiness of the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) to \n     assume responsibility for maintaining the territorial \n     integrity of Iraq, denying international terrorists a safe \n     haven, and bringing greater security to Iraq's 18 provinces \n     in the next 12-18 months, and bringing an end to sectarian \n     violence to achieve national reconciliation.\n       (B) The training; equipping; command, control and \n     intelligence capabilities; and logistics capacity of the ISF.\n       (C) The likelihood that, given the ISF's record of \n     preparedness to date, following years of training and \n     equipping by US forces, the continued support of US troops \n     will contribute to the readiness of the ISF to fulfill the \n     missions outlined in subparagraph (A).\n       (2) Report.--Not later than 120 days after passage of this \n     Act, the designated private sector entity shall provide an \n     unclassified report, with a classified annex, containing its \n     findings, to the House and Senate Committees on Armed \n     Services, Appropriations, Foreign Relations, and \n     Intelligence.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 698. Mr. WARNER submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the bill H.R. 1591, making emergency supplemental appropriations \nfor the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007, and for other purposes; \nwhich was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n     SEC. 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING IRAQ.\n\n       Whereas on the fourth anniversary of Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom, the regime of a brutal dictator has been replaced by \n     a democratically elected government in the Arab world;\n       Whereas, the United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1723, approved November 28, 2006, ``determin[ed] that the \n     situation in Iraq continues to constitute a threat to \n     international peace and security;''\n       Whereas, over 137,000 American military personnel are \n     currently serving in Iraq, like thousands of others since \n     March 2003, with the bravery and professionalism consistent \n     with the finest traditions of the United States armed forces, \n     and are deserving of the support of all Americans, which they \n     have strongly;\n       Whereas many American service personnel have lost their \n     lives, and many more have been wounded, in Iraq, and the \n     American people will always honor their sacrifices and honor \n     their families;\n       Whereas the U.S. Army and Marine Corps, including their \n     Reserve and National Guard organizations, together with \n     components of the other branches of the military, are under \n     enormous strain from multiple, extended deployments to Iraq \n     and Afghanistan, and these deployments, and those that will \n     follow, will have lasting impacts on the future recruiting, \n     retention and readiness of our nation's all volunteer force;\n       Whereas Iraq is experiencing a deteriorating problem of \n     sectarian and intra-sectarian violence based upon political \n     distrust and cultural differences between some Sunni and Shia \n     Muslims, concentrated primarily in Baghdad;\n       Whereas Iraqis must reach political settlements in order to \n     achieve reconciliation, and the failure of the Iraqis to \n     reach such settlements to support a truly unified government \n     greatly contributes to the increasing violence in Iraq;\n       Whereas the responsibility for Iraq's internal security and \n     halting sectarian violence must rest primarily with the \n     Government of Iraq, relying on the Iraqi Security Forces \n     (ISF);\n       Whereas the President said on January 10, 2007, that ``I've \n     made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders \n     that America's commitment is not open-ended'' so as to dispel \n     the contrary impression that exists;\n       Whereas it is essential that the Government of Iraq set out \n     measurable and achievable benchmarks and President Bush said, \n     on January 10, 2007, that ``America will change our approach \n     to help the Iraqi government as it works to meet these \n     benchmarks;''\n       Whereas according to Secretary of State Rice, Iraq's Policy \n     Committee on National Security agreed upon a set of \n     political, security, and economic benchmarks and an \n     associated timeline in September 2006 that were (a) \n     reaffirmed by Iraq's Presidency Council on October 6, 2007; \n     (b) referenced by the Iraq Study Group; and (c) posted on the \n     President of Iraq's website;\n       Whereas the Secretary of State indicated on January 30, \n     2007 that ``we expect the Prime Minister will follow through \n     on his pledges to the President that he would take difficult \n     decisions.''\n       Whereas the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, \n     and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have testified \n     about, and, or, provided unclassified material to members of \n     Congress on Iraqi commitments and goals.\n       Whereas Congress acknowledges that the Baghdad Security \n     Plan is in it's initial months and while there are signs of \n     progress, there are also signs of difficulty and uncertainty. \n     Now therefore be it\n       Resolved that\n\n[[Page S3888]]\n\n       (1) The United States strategy in Iraq, hereafter, should \n     be conditioned on the Iraqi government meeting benchmarks, as \n     told to members of Congress by the President, the Secretary \n     of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff, and reflected in the Iraqi \n     Government's commitments to the United States, and to the \n     international community, including:\n       (a) forming a Constitutional Review Committee and \n     completing the Constitutional review;\n       (b) enacting and implementing legislation on de-\n     Bathification;\n       (c) enacting and implementing legislation to ensure the \n     equitable distribution of hydrocarbon resources to the people \n     of Iraq without regard to the sect or ethnicity of \n     recipients, and ensuring that the energy resources of Iraq \n     benefit Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, Kurds, and other Iraqi \n     citizens in an equitable manner;\n       (d) enacting and implementing legislation on procedures to \n     form semi-autonomous regions;\n       (e) enacting and implementing legislation establishing an \n     Independent High Electoral Commission; provincial elections \n     law; provincial council authorities; and a date for \n     provincial elections;\n       (f) enacting and implementing legislation addressing \n     amnesty;\n       (g) enacting and implementing legislation establishing a \n     strong militia disbarment program to ensure that such \n     security forces are accountable only to the central \n     government and loyal to the constitution of Iraq;\n       (h) establishing supporting political media, economic, and \n     services committees in support of the Baghdad Security Plan;\n       (i) providing three trained and ready Iraqi brigades to \n     support Baghdad operations;\n       (j) providing Iraqi commanders with all authorities to \n     execute this plan and to make tactical and operational \n     decisions, in consultation with U.S. commanders, without \n     political intervention;\n       (k) ensuring that the Iraqi Security Forces are providing \n     even handed enforcement of the law against all who break it;\n       (l) ensuring that, the Baghdad security plan is not \n     providing a safe haven for any outlaws, regardless of their \n     sectarian or political affiliation; as Prime Minister Maliki \n     stated to President Bush.\n       (m) establishing all of the planned joint security stations \n     in neighborhoods across Baghdad;\n       (n) increasing the number of Iraqi security forces units \n     capable of operating independently;\n       (o) allocating and spending $10 billion in Iraqi revenues \n     for reconstruction projects, including delivery of essential \n     services, on an equitable basis;\n       (2) The Iraqi government achieving, or demonstrating \n     satisfactory progress towards achieving these benchmarks \n     should be viewed as the condition for continued United States \n     military and economic involvement in Iraq;\n       Sec. 2.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING BUDGETING FOR OPERATION \n                   IRAQI FREEDOM AND THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The global war on terrorism began in September 2001 and \n     military operations in Iraq began in March 2003, and United \n     States military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan no longer \n     represents unforeseen, unpredictable, or unanticipated \n     events.\n       (2) Since the beginning of the global war on terrorism and \n     the military operations in Iraq, Congress has provided \n     $503,000,000,000 in budget authority to carry out Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom and the global war on terrorism, including \n     funding for military operations and other defense activities, \n     indigenous security forces, diplomatic operations, and \n     foreign aid.\n       (3) The President has requested $98,000,000,000 in \n     additional fiscal year 2007 supplemental appropriations to \n     carry out Operation Iraqi Freedom and the global war on \n     terrorism, bringing the total appropriated upon the date of \n     the enactment of this Act for that purpose to \n     $601,000,000,000.\n       (4) The President has requested $145,000,000,000 in fiscal \n     year 2008 supplemental appropriations to carry out Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom and the global war on terrorism.\n       (5) During the past few years, both the President and \n     Congress have consistently underestimated the future costs of \n     carrying out Operation Iraqi Freedom and the global war on \n     terrorism in budget requests and in congressional budget \n     resolutions.\n       (6) The President and Congress have provided funds to carry \n     out Operation Iraqi Freedom and the global war on terrorism \n     largely through the use of supplemental appropriations bills \n     that escape the budget limitations imposed on regular \n     appropriations.\n       (7) As a result of insufficient budget projections and \n     exemption of supplemental appropriations from budget rules, \n     Congress and the President have provided the public with \n     erroneous information regarding the true impact of Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom and the global war on terrorism on future \n     budget deficits and the growth of the national debt.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) fiscal year 2008 should be the last fiscal year for \n     which Congress provides funding to carry out Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom and the global war on terrorism through the use of \n     supplemental appropriations that generally are not subject to \n     budget limitations; and\n       (2) beginning in fiscal year 2009, Congress should include \n     funding to carry out Operation Iraqi Freedom and the global \n     war on terrorism in the regular budget and appropriations \n     processes so that the public is able to recognize and \n     understand the costs of carrying out such activities and \n     Congress may consider whether additional spending and revenue \n     policies should be enacted to offset such costs.\n\n[[Page S3899]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 715.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 126.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 126) designating April 2007 as \n     ``Financial Literacy Month.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased I have submited a resolution \ndesignating April of this year as Financial Literacy Month. I thank my \ncosponsors, Senators Dodd, Clinton, Cochran, Durbin, Kohl, Kennedy, \nMenendez, Schumer, Inouye, Stabenow, Cardin, Levin, Crapo, DeMint, \nFeinstein, Baucus, Thomas, Lincoln, Allard, and Enzi. I am glad to work \nonce again with my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to advance \nfinancial and economic literacy for all Americans.\n  As we enter into the month of April, I wish to recognize those \norganizations that released information last April shedding light on \nfinancial literacy in our country. This includes Junior Achievement's \nannual poll of teenagers on issues of personal finance, the Jumpstart \nCoalition for Personal Financial Literacy's survey of the financial \nliteracy of high school seniors, and the Employee Benefit Research \nInstitute's Retirement Confidence Survey. These surveys present deeply \ntroubling figures that underscore the need for increased financial \nliteracy. For instance, while 84 percent of teens with credit cards \nreported paying off their balance in full each month, 16 percent \nadmitted that they were just making the minimum payments according to \nthe Junior Achievement poll. Further, the Jumpstart survey found that \nmost high school seniors failed a test about credit cards, retirement \nfunds, insurance, and other personal finance basics, and the Employee \nBenefit Research Institute found that despite modest savings, over two-\nthirds of Americans are confident in their retirement. In addition to \nthese valuable surveys, I would like to acknowledge the biennial Survey \nof the States published by the National Council on Economic Education. \nIt was last released in 2005 and provided a useful update on the status \nof financial and economic education nationwide.\n  The resolution I have submitted today designates April 2007 as \nFinancial Literacy Month, and highlights the need to promote financial \nliteracy. To this extent, I would like to mention a few efforts that \ngive a sense of the variety of approaches being taken to highlight \nfinancial and economic education. Here in Washington, the National \nFoundation for Credit Counseling will award a winner for its national \nposter contest later in the month. With a theme of ``Plant the Seed of \nSaving to Grow Your Future,'' the contest encourages first through \ntwelfth grade students to start thinking about how to best manage their \nfinances. On public television, a new show, called ``What's up in \nFinance?,'' created by station WNET in New York City, will premiere \nthis April. It will help to make financial and economic education more \naccessible to young adults and introduce them to the range of job \nopportunities in finance and economics. In Santa Barbara, California, \nthe Money Camp, in coordination with Junior Achievement and BizWorld, \nwill host a Financial Literacy Training Intensive program. The event is \nintended to be the first of an annual event to provide advanced \ntraining to professionals in the area of financial education. In New \nJersey, the state departments of Education and of Banking and Insurance \nare coordinating with banks and credit unions to bring staff from \ngovernment and financial institutions who will make presentations on \nbudgeting, saving, and credit at high schools in the State. I applaud \nthese and other efforts taking place in April to address the need for \ngreater financial literacy among Americans.\n  Increased financial and economic literacy can help people navigate \naround the countless pitfalls found in the marketplace. Consumers with \na variety of credit histories can easily find credit in many different \nforms. Lenders' aggressive marketing campaigns encourage families to \ntake on substantial debt for indulgences and luxuries, which may be \nharmful if families are already saddled with debt and not saving toward \nan education or retirement nest egg. Taking on substantial or \nadditional debt that they cannot effectively pay back is irrational, \nbut abusive marketing efforts have resulted in unprecedented levels of \nborrowing.\n  Although the availability of credit has grown dramatically, the \nunderstanding of financial matters has not. Consequently, we are \npresented with a number of worrisome statistics. During the last 2 \nyears, Americans have on average spent more money than they make. The \nlast year this occurred was in 1933 at the end of the Great Depression. \nMoreover, the household debt service ratio, which gives a sense of the \nproportion of disposable income people are using to pay off their debt, \nincreased to record levels again in 2006. These findings suggest a \nserious problem exacerbated by the fact that most workers have not \ncalculated how much they need to save for retirement, even if they \nbelieve they are behind schedule in their retirement.\n  As policymakers, we need to focus on these issues year round. \nHowever, focusing on Financial Literacy Month in April means that we \nhave a designated part of the year when we can reassess our efforts to \nhighlight those that worked and improve on those that have not. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this resolution.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table; that any statements relating to this matter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 127.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 127) designating April 8, 2007 as \n     ``National Cushing's Syndrome Awareness Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to have proudly introduced a \nresolution designating April 8, 2007, as ``National Cushing's Syndrome \nAwareness Day.'' I have long been dedicated to quality health care and \ntherefore seek to raise awareness of this debilitating disorder that \naffects an estimated 10 to 15 people per million.\n  I seek your help in raising awareness of Cushing's Syndrome, which is \nan endocrine or hormonal disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the \nbody's tissue to high levels of the hormone cortisol. Though it can \nlead to death, Cushing's Syndrome often goes undiagnosed or \nmisdiagnosed because the initial symptoms are shared with a number of \nmilder ailments. These symptoms include, but are not limited to, \nabnormal weight gain, skin changes, fatigue, diabetes, high blood \npressure, depression, and osteoporosis.\n  Cushing's Syndrome can take a variety of forms. Normally, the \nhypothalamus, a part of the brain which is about the size of a small \nsugar cube, stimulates the pituitary gland, the adrenal glands, and \nthen the kidneys, which release cortisol into the bloodstream. High \nlevels of cortisol can result from overproducing cortisol or from \ntaking glucocorticoid hormones, which are routinely prescribed for \nasthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other inflammatory diseases.\n  Doctors can detect Cushing's Syndrome through a series of tests, \noften using x-rays to examine adrenal or pituitary glands to locate \ntumors. However, since awareness of the syndrome is low, doctors do not \nalways run these tests, and patients do not know to ask for them. \nTherefore, treatment often comes later than it should for victims of \nCushing's Syndrome. Potential treatments for Cushing's Syndrome include \nsurgery, radiation, chemotherapy, cortisol-inhibiting drugs, or \nreducing the dosage of glucocorticoid hormones.\n  The need for heightened awareness of Cushing's Syndrome was brought \nto my attention by constituents who suffer from this dangerous disease. \nFor the sake of these individuals and for the benefit of sufferers in \nyour own State and around the Nation, I ask you to join me in this \neffort to raise awareness of Cushing's Syndrome.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 127) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 127\n\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome annually affects an estimated 10 \n     to 15 people per million, most of whom are currently between \n     the ages of 20 and 50;\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome is an endocrine or hormonal \n     disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the body's tissue to \n     high levels of the hormone cortisol;\n       Whereas exposure to cortisol can occur by overproduction in \n     the body or by taking glucocrticoid hormones, which are \n     routinely prescribed for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, \n     or as an immunosuppressant following transplantation;\n       Whereas the syndrome may also result from pituitary \n     adenomas, ectopic ACTH syndrome, adrenal tumors, and Familial \n     Cushing's Syndrome;\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome can cause abnormal weight gain, \n     skin changes, and fatigue and ultimately lead to diabetes, \n     high blood pressure, depression, osteoporosis, and death;\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome is diagnosed through a series of \n     tests, often requiring x-ray examinations of adrenal or \n     pituitary glands to locate tumors;\n       Whereas many people who suffer from Cushing's Syndrome are \n     misdiagnosed or go undiagnosed for years because many of the \n     symptoms are mirrored in milder diseases, thereby delaying \n     important treatment options;\n       Whereas treatments for Cushing's Syndrome include surgery, \n     radiation, chemotherapy, cortisol-inhibiting drugs, and \n     reducing the dosage of glucocorticoid hormones;\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome was discovered by Dr. Harvey \n     Williams Cushing, who was born on April 8th, 1869;\n       Whereas the Dr. Harvey Cushing stamp was part of the United \n     States Postal Service's ``Great American'' series, initiated \n     in 1980 to recognize individuals for making significant \n     contributions to the heritage and culture of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas President Ronald Reagan spoke on April 8, 1987, in \n     the Rose Garden at a White House ceremony to unveil the \n     commemorative stamp honoring Dr. Harvey Cushing;\n       Whereas following the ceremony, President Reagan hosted a \n     reception in the State Dining Room for Mrs. John Hay Whitney, \n     Dr. Cushing's daughter, and representatives of the American \n     Association of Neurological Surgeons; and\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise \n     awareness in the general public and the medical community of \n     Cushing's Syndrome; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 8, 2007, as ``National Cushing's \n     Syndrome Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes that all Americans should become more \n     informed and aware of Cushing's Syndrome;\n       (3) Calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     the date with appropriate ceremonies and activities; and\n       (4) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the Cushing's Understanding, Support & \n     Help Organization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/27/senate-section/article/S3981-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3981-S3982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AUTHORIZING LEGAL COUNSEL REPRESENTATION\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee \non Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs be discharged from further \nconsideration of S. 474 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 474) to award a congressional gold medal to \n     Michael Ellis DeBakey, M.D.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today the Senate will unanimously pass \nS. 474, a bill I introduced to award a Congressional Gold Medal--the \nhighest civilian award which may be bestowed by the United States \nCongress--to my dear friend, Dr. Michael DeBakey. I thank my colleagues \nfor joining me in recognizing and honoring Dr. Deakey for his lifetime \nof medical achievement and public service. I would especially like to \nthank my friend and colleague from Louisiana, Senator Mary Landrieu. \nShe joined me in circulating a letter to our Senate colleagues on this \nbill, and she was very helpful in gathering key co-sponsors needed to \npass this legislation today.\n  Dr. DeBakey is currently in Texas recovering from the very type of \nheart operation he pioneered. At the age of 98, he is the oldest \nsurvivor of the operation he developed to repair a damaged aorta, the \nmain artery from the heart. I certainly wish him well as he continues \nto recover from this major operation. I would also like to take this \nopportunity to thank him once again for his lifetime of commitment and \nservice not only to the medical community but to the world and strongly \nencourage my colleagues in the House of Representatives to pass this \nlegislation as soon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Dear Colleague letter \nfor S. 474 be printed in the Record, and I request that Senator \nLandrieu be added as an original cosponsor of this bill because without \nher help, this bill would not have passed.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2007.\n       Dear Colleague: Please join us in recognizing Dr. Michael \n     DeBakey, a public servant and world-renowned cardiologist, \n     for his many outstanding achievements in the field of \n     medicine. We encourage you to co-sponsor S. 474, a bill to \n     award Dr. DeBakey the Congressional Gold Medal. This is the \n     highest award which may be bestowed by the United Stated \n     Congress, and Dr. DeBakey is most deserving.\n       Dr. Michael DeBakey, a native of Louisiana and graduate of \n     the Tulane University School of Medicine, is a pioneer in \n     every sense of the word. His long and distinguished career \n     has impacted nearly every aspect of modern medicine.\n\n[[Page S3983]]\n\n       When he was just 23 years old and still attending medical \n     school, Dr. DeBakey developed a roller pump for blood \n     transfusions--the precursor and major component of the heart-\n     lung machine used in the first open-heart operation. During \n     his service in World War I1, Dr. DeBakey observed soldiers \n     dying on the battlefield who he believed could be saved. From \n     that experience he made numerous recommendations to improve \n     the military's medical procedures, including the development \n     of mobile army surgical hospitals, better known as MASH \n     units. These efforts earned him the Legion of Merit in 1945. \n     Dr. DeBakey later helped establish the specialized medical \n     and surgical centers system for treating military personnel \n     returning from the war, which subsequently became the \n     Veterans Affairs Medical Center System.\n       In 1948, Dr. DeBakey joined the Baylor University College \n     of Medicine, where he started its first surgical residency \n     program and was later elected the first President of Baylor \n     College of Medicine. Adding to his list of accomplishments, \n     Dr. DeBakey performed the first successful procedure to treat \n     patients with aneurysms, performed the first successful \n     coronary bypass surgery, and he was the first to successfully \n     implant a partial artificial heart.\n       Dr. DeBakey continued to amaze the medical world when he \n     pioneered the field of telemedicine by performing the first \n     open-heart surgery transmitted over satellite and later when \n     he supervised the first successful multi-organ transplant, \n     where a heart, both kidneys and a lung were transplanted from \n     a single donor into four separate recipients. Most recently, \n     Dr. DeBakey worked with NASA engineers to develop the DeBakey \n     Ventricular Assist Device, which may eliminate the need for \n     some patients to receive heart transplants.\n       These accomplishments have led to national recognition. Dr. \n     DeBakey has received both the Presidential Medal of Freedom \n     with Distinction from President Lyndon Johnson and the \n     National Medal of Science from President Ronald Reagan.\n       Dr. DeBakey's efforts and innovative surgical techniques \n     have saved the lives of thousands, if not millions, of \n     people. We hope you will join us in recognizing Dr. DeBakey's \n     profound impact on the field of medicine and how we care for \n     our veterans, by co-sponsoring legislation to award him the \n     Congressional Gold Medal. If you wish to co-sponsor or have \n     any questions about this legislation, please contact Chad \n     Heflin at (202) 224-5922.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kay Bailey Hutchison.\n     Mary Landrieu.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to this matter be printed \nat the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 474) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 474\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Michael Ellis DeBakey, M.D., was born on September 7, \n     1908, in Lake Charles, Louisiana, to Shaker and Raheeja \n     DeBakey.\n       (2) Dr. DeBakey, at the age of 23 and still a medical \n     student, reported a major invention, a roller pump for blood \n     transfusions, which later became a major component of the \n     heart-lung machine used in the first successful open-heart \n     operation.\n       (3) Even though Dr. DeBakey had already achieved a national \n     reputation as an authority on vascular disease and had a \n     promising career as a surgeon and teacher, he volunteered for \n     military service during World War II, joining the Surgeon \n     General's staff and rising to the rank of Colonel and Chief \n     of the Surgical Consultants Division.\n       (4) As a result of this first-hand knowledge of military \n     service, Dr. DeBakey made numerous recommendations for the \n     proper staged management of war wounds, which led to the \n     development of mobile army surgical hospitals or ``MASH'' \n     units, and earned Dr. DeBakey the Legion of Merit in 1945.\n       (5) After the war, Dr. DeBakey proposed the systematic \n     medical follow-up of veterans and recommended the creation of \n     specialized medical centers in different areas of the United \n     States to treat wounded military personnel returning from \n     war, and from this recommendation evolved the Veterans \n     Affairs Medical Center System and the establishment of the \n     Commission on Veterans Medical Problems of the National \n     Research Council.\n       (6) In 1948, Dr. DeBakey joined the Baylor University \n     College of Medicine, where he developed the first surgical \n     residency program in the city of Houston, and today, guided \n     by Dr. DeBakey's vision, the College is one of the most \n     respected health science centers in the Nation.\n       (7) In 1953, Dr. DeBakey performed the first successful \n     procedures to treat patients who suffered aneurysms leading \n     to severe strokes, and he later developed a series of \n     innovative surgical techniques for the treatment of aneurysms \n     enabling thousands of lives to be saved in the years ahead.\n       (8) In 1964, Dr. DeBakey triggered the most explosive era \n     in modern cardiac surgery, when he performed the first \n     successful coronary bypass, once again paving the way for \n     surgeons worldwide to offer hope to thousands of patients who \n     might otherwise succumb to heart disease.\n       (9) Two years later, Dr. DeBakey made medical history \n     again, when he was the first to successfully use a partial \n     artificial heart to solve the problems of a patient who could \n     not be weaned from a heart-lung machine following open-heart \n     surgery.\n       (10) In 1968, Dr. DeBakey supervised the first successful \n     multi-organ transplant, in which a heart, both kidneys, and \n     lung were transplanted from a single donor into 4 separate \n     recipients.\n       (11) In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Dr. \n     DeBakey to the position of Chairman of the President's \n     Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer and Stroke, leading to \n     the creation of Regional Medical Programs established ``to \n     encourage and assist in the establishment of regional \n     cooperative arrangements among medical schools, research \n     institutions, and hospitals, for research and training''.\n       (12) In the mid-1960s, Dr. DeBakey pioneered the field of \n     telemedicine with the first demonstration of open-heart \n     surgery to be transmitted overseas by satellite.\n       (13) In 1969, Dr. DeBakey was elected the first President \n     of Baylor College of Medicine.\n       (14) In 1969, President Lyndon B. Johnson bestowed on Dr. \n     DeBakey the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction, \n     and in 1985, President Ronald Reagan conferred on him the \n     National Medal of Science.\n       (15) Working with NASA engineers, he refined existing \n     technology to create the DeBakey Ventricular Assist Device, \n     one-tenth the size of current versions, which may eliminate \n     the need for heart transplantation in some patients.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate \n     shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on \n     behalf of the Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate \n     design, to Michael Ellis DeBakey, M.D., in recognition of his \n     many outstanding contributions to the Nation.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a \n     gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions \n     to be determined by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 3.

AUTHORITY TO USE FUND AMOUNTS; PROCEEDS OF SALE.\n\n       (a) Authority To Use Fund Amounts.--There is authorized to \n     be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise \n     Fund such amounts as may be necessary to pay for the costs of \n     the medals struck pursuant to this Act.\n       (b) Proceeds of Sale.--Amounts received from the sale of \n     duplicate bronze medals authorized under section 3 shall be \n     deposited into the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/27/senate-section/article/S3983-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3983-S3984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       OLDER AMERICANS REAUTHORIZATION TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1002 submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1002) to amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 \n     to reinstate certain provisions relating to the nutrition \n     services incentive program.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Older Americans Technical Corrections \nAct of 2007 that I introduced today with Senator Enzi and Senator \nRoberts will restore States' ability to obtain Department of \nAgriculture commodities under the Nutrition Services Incentive Program. \nThrough this program seniors obtain their meals through organizations \nin the community such as Meals on Wheels.\n  Last year, during the Older Americans Act Reauthorization \nnegotiations, the Department of Agriculture asked\n\n[[Page S3984]]\n\nCongress to make a change to this program. It was not made clear to us \nat the time that, under this change, States could not continue to \nreceive commodities through the Department of Agriculture.\n  Without this correction, thousands of seniors in Massachusetts and a \nnumber of other States will be affected. Department of Agriculture \ncommodities are much less expensive than what States can purchase on \nthe commercial market and are of higher quality. And they're less \nexpensive. The State distributing agency in Massachusetts has \ncalculated that purchasing similar commodities would cost $1 million \nmore a year which would lead to 500,000 fewer meals served.\n  Six States in addition to Massachusetts have been obtaining USDA \ncommodities for several years. The program is especially important to \nour States, to their partners, and to the seniors who obtain their \nmeals through this program.\n  I urge our colleagues in both the Senate and the House to pass this \nlegislation without delay.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements relating to this matter be printed in the \nRecord, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
