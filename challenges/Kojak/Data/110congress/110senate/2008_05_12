Mr. President, following leader time, the Senate will \nproceed to a period of morning business, with the time until 5:30 this \nevening equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their \ndesignees. As has been previously announced, there will be no rollcall \nvotes today. There will be votes, though, tomorrow, as early as 11 \na.m.--probably about 11:10 a.m.--and we will begin voting in relation \nto the following items: McConnell amendment on energy, with a 60-vote \nthreshold; the Reid amendment on energy, with a 60-vote threshold--of \ncourse, my name is on the amendment because I offered it as part of my \nleadership responsibilities, but that is an amendment that has been \nworked on very hard by Senator Dorgan of North Dakota--and passage of \nthe flood insurance legislation. I say, Mr. President, it will be a \ngood day for America when we pass that. That will affect millions of \nAmericans. The Banking Committee did an outstanding job of getting it \nhere ready for passage. Senators Dodd and Shelby did a wonderful job in \ncompleting that legislation. And we will also have, tomorrow, a cloture \nvote on the motion to proceed to H.R. 980, first responders collective \nbargaining. With that being the case, we will probably complete our \nlast vote--let's see, we have four votes an hour--maybe about 12:15, \nsomething like that, we will start the last vote, give or take a few \nminutes.\n  So between now and the Memorial Day recess, we have a tremendous \namount of work to do. There is so much unfinished business. But let me \nmention a few of the things we are going to complete or give it our \nvery best.\n  The first responders collective bargaining bill: We will be on that \ntomorrow. The farm bill conference report: We expect the House to \nconsider the conference report as early as Wednesday. We need to \ncomplete it before we leave this week, which brings me to the point: We \nare going to do everything we can to see that we can complete our \nbusiness by noon on Friday. But that is no guarantee. There will have \nto be some cooperation among Senators; otherwise, we are going to have \nto work--I know this is difficult because people have responsibilities \nother places outside Washington, but we very likely could have some \nwork Friday afternoon, hopefully not very late in the day. But I do not \nknow. Everyone should be prepared and arrange their schedules \naccordingly.\n  We have this week and next week. One of the things we need to do is \nappoint conferees to the budget resolution. The House is expected to \nappoint conferees this week. There is a statutory 10-hour limitation on \ndebate to go to conference. As Senators know, motions to instruct are \nin order. I will work with the Republican leader on an agreement to \nmove the process forward in an orderly fashion; otherwise, we will do \nit in a disorderly fashion, and we will have only 10 hours to be \ndisorderly.\n  We also have a statutory direction to complete a resolution of \ndisapproval, either yes or no, regarding FCC media ownership \nrulemaking. The reason we are able to do this, Senator Don Nickles of \nOklahoma and I worked in the early 1990s to pass--and we did--a piece\n\n[[Page S3988]]\n\nof legislation that says if the administration or an agency promulgates \na regulation, and we do not like it, we can overturn it. We have done \nthat in the past, and that is what this is all about. It is a \nnondebatable motion to proceed to the resolution, and there are 10 \nhours of debate with no amendments in order.\n  We also have--even though we can say it quickly, it is going to take \nsome time--the emergency supplemental, which will be on the floor next \nWednesday. We need to complete this before the recess. We are not going \nto be panicked into completing this. We know there is enough money to \nfund the troops for a considerable period after the Memorial Day \nrecess. We want to get it done, and we will do our best to get that \ndone, but we are not going to be pushed into doing something we do not \nthink is appropriate.\n  On judges, I committed to Senator McConnell that I would use my best \nefforts to have the Senate consider three court of appeals nominees \nbefore the Memorial Day recess. I have been working with Senator Leahy \nto meet that pledge. The nomination of Steven Agee to be a Fourth \nCircuit judge should be available for debate late this week or early \nnext week.\n  We are also trying to move forward on two court of appeals nominees \nfrom Michigan. The problem we have had with that is Republicans on the \nJudiciary Committee complained that Chairman Leahy is moving these too \nquickly. So, Mr. President, they cannot have it both ways. If I am \ngoing to do what I said I would do, we need some cooperation from the \nRepublicans. I cannot push the committee to take up nominees they do \nnot want. It is my understanding these two appeals court nominees from \nMichigan have been worked out over a period of 6 years. It has taken a \nlong time to get to where we are now. So I would hope the Republicans \nwould back off their slow-walking this. Otherwise, we are not going to \nbe able to complete these nominations before the Memorial Day recess.\n  Finally, we are going to do our utmost to get a vote on an energy \npackage before we leave for the Memorial Day recess. I repeat, we will \nlikely have to have votes on this Friday. We will do them as quickly as \nwe can. There will be no votes on Monday. We have had a number of \nrequests over many months for people who have things to do in their \nhome States on that day. There will be no votes on Monday. So that is \ngoing to make everything very difficult next week because I have \noutlined the many different things we have to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/12/senate-section/article/S3988-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TRAGEDY IN BURMA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, over the past several days, we have seen a \nterrible tragedy unfold in Burma. The official death toll from that \ncyclone is unknown. But we know the number is in the tens of thousands. \nWe have tens of thousands missing.\n  International aid organizations fear we are still in the beginning \nstages of this catastrophe. It is estimated that more than a million \nand a half people remain in desperate need of help. They are becoming \nmore desperate every day.\n  Without international aid and expertise, many of these men, women, \nand children will likely lose their lives to starvation, dehydration, \nand disease--cholera, typhoid are two among them.\n  The relationship between the Burmese regime and the global community \nis complicated, and that is an understatement. In this hour of \nstaggering desperation, the junta must put politics aside and accept \nthe outstretched hand the world is extending to them.\n  Burma is a government run by dictators. They are nondemocratic. We \nhave had problems with them for years. Senator McConnell has spoken on \nthis floor over the years focusing attention on the nondemocratic \nprocess in Burma and how the international community should join the \nUnited States in doing something about this.\n  Today, finally, one American plane was allowed to land in the \ncountry--one. This is a start, but it is far few too many loads of \nsupplies. Not only are the supplies having difficulty getting in, but \nthe military folks in Burma are not allowing the international \ncommunity to help, and they are the ones who have the expertise.\n  Each day that goes by is a sad day in that country. We have seen the \npictures over the weekend of the children lying dead, having died from \ntyphoid.\n  The junta must allow more supplies, provide visas to aid workers from \naround the world, and allow those workers access to regions and \ncommunities that are suffering very much.\n  Senator McConnell and I join together to say to the junta: Let the \nworld in. Let us help.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/12/senate-section/article/S3988-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3988-S3989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONSUMER FIRST ENERGY ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on Friday, oil hit yet another record high. \nI do not know what it is today. It dropped 50 cents last night to more \nthan $125 a barrel. But on Friday it was above $126 a barrel. If it \ndrops--which we hope it does--to $110, $105, $100, $90, $95, it should \nnot be a day of celebration. Oil is a difficult problem for our \ncountry.\n  The average price of a gallon of gasoline in America today is now \nabove $3.60 a gallon. That is the average. In Nevada, it is more than \n$3.80 a gallon. Diesel--the fuel that moves the goods we buy--has hit \n$4.15, on an average, around the country.\n  Seven years ago, when President Bush took office, the average price \nfor a gallon of gasoline was about $1.50. Now it is 2\\1/2\\ times more \nthan that.\n  At first, the steady rise of gas prices was a nuisance. Then it \nbecame a burden. Now it is a full-blown crisis. More than 7 in 10 \nAmericans now say gas prices have created financial hardships in their \nlives. Nevadans are paying, on average, $3,000 more per year for \ngasoline than they did 7 years ago.\n  Millions of working people all across America are now spending the \nfirst few hours of their workday earning back what they paid for their \ncommute. It costs more than ever to heat and cool our homes. Everything \ncosts more. We have a problem with these people who are paying--in \nNevada, $3,000--more than they did 7 years ago for gasoline. It affects \ntheir house payments, car payments, their medicine, whether they can \nsend their kids to college. It is very difficult--what kind of \ngroceries they buy. It wipes out most vacations.\n  School districts in Nevada and around the country are forced to make \ncutbacks in the classroom because the cost of school buses has never \nbeen higher. I met with the officials of commercial airlines in the \nUnited States a short time ago in my office across the hall. They said \nalmost 50 percent of the cost of flying an airplane in America today is \nfuel. It is not that way in Europe because the dollar is so weak they \nget it much cheaper than we do.\n  Small businesses are struggling under the burden of record-high \nshipping costs. The $60, $80 or more Americans are paying at the pump \nmeans less money for other necessities--I have mentioned some of them--\nbut the gas pump is just the tip of the iceberg. Almost every part of \nthe economy is weighed down by the price of oil and gas.\n  The American people deserve both short-term and long-term ends to \nthis crisis. Last year, Congress took the first step by passing new \nenergy legislation that raised fuel economy standards for the first \ntime in almost 30 years and required the Bush administration to \ninvestigate market price manipulation. But Republicans blocked our \nefforts to include a mandate for clean, renewable electricity, and we \nhave seen very little action from the White House on market \nmanipulation.\n  It is clearly time to take the next step by passing the Consumer \nFirst Energy Act, which will help lower prices in the short term and \ncontinues to curb our addiction and invest in renewable energy to avoid \nan even greater crisis in the long term.\n  First, this legislation includes a provision that ends the billions \nof dollars in tax breaks for oil companies whose executives have been \nhauling record profits while we pay record prices. Oil executives are \nmaking fortunes. The oil companies--these international cartels is what \nI call them--are making more money than any companies in the history of \nthe world. Seven years ago, Vice President Cheney invited oil \nexecutives to the White House to write our national energy policy. Is \nit any surprise that 7 years later the only ones who have benefited \nfrom that policy are the oil companies?\n  The second piece of our legislation forces the oil companies to do \ntheir part by investing some of their profits\n\n[[Page S3989]]\n\nin clean and affordable alternative energy. If we aggressively promote \ninnovation in solar, wind, biofuels, and geothermal energies, we can \nhelp lower energy costs, create hundreds of thousands of new jobs right \nhere in America, and strengthen our national security by reducing our \ndependence on oil-producing nations.\n  The third provision: We protect the American people from price \ngougers and greedy oil traders who manipulate the market. Part of the \nreason for the record-high prices of oil is that market traders are \nbidding prices up for their own amusement and profit. If you go buy a \nshare of General Motors stock, you pay a margin of 50 percent. If you \nbuy 100,000 gallons of fuel or barrels of oil, you pay a 3- to 5-\npercent margin. They have pushed these prices up remarkably with their \nspeculation. They make out like bandits, but the rest of us have to \nface the real-life consequences of their recklessness.\n  Now, we also have a provision to temporarily stop filling the \nnational Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is already 97 percent full, \nto increase supply and lower prices. We are told it increases prices by \nas much as 5 cents a gallon. When oil prices come down significantly \nfrom their current levels, we can continue filling the Reserve. For \nnow, 97 percent capacity is sufficient.\n  Tomorrow for our vote, we are going to take this fourth provision out \nof our energy package and we are going to vote on that. That will be \nour second vote. It is important that everyone vote for this. This \nshould be bipartisan. The Republicans wrote a letter to the President--\nsome Republican Senators--saying: Mr. President, stop pumping that oil \ninto the Reserve. I hope they will join with us tomorrow so we can get \npast the 60-vote margin that is required here to pass legislation.\n  Finally, our plan stands up to OPEC and countries that are colluding \ntogether to keep oil prices sky high. This is a provision that has been \npushed by Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin for a long time, and that is \nin our legislation. Global commerce requires global leadership. Oil-\nproducing nations are earning billions of dollars from American \nconsumers. For most of these countries, the oil trade is their \noverwhelming source of income. It is time to use some diplomatic \npressure to increase production and lower prices.\n  Our legislation does exactly what it promises: It ends more than 7 \nyears of Bush-Cheney energy policy that has lined the pockets of \nmodern-day oil barons and left the American people to pay the bill. Is \nit a silver bullet? Of course not. Is it a bill that will solve all of \nour energy problems? Of course not. But it is a good piece of \nlegislation.\n  The United States has less than 3 percent of the oil reserves in the \nworld. That counts ANWR and offshore. So we can't produce our way out \nof it. Should we produce more out of the 3 percent we have? Of course. \nWe are going to continue to work on that. But we consume 25 to 30 \npercent of all of the oil in the world, even though our population \nprobably doesn't justify that.\n  This legislation is an important step, one that will make a \ndifference in the short term and in the long term. It offers new \nthinking, new investment, and a new direction, not more of the same. So \nI urge my Republican colleagues to join us in passing this important \npiece of legislation starting tomorrow by passing a law that will tell \nthe President: No, you can no longer pay $125 a barrel to put oil into \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Save that for later.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we are going to vote tomorrow on an important \npiece of legislation. Woven deep within our collective memory of every \nmajor American disaster is the image of first responders who risk their \nlives to save others. September 11 is graphically illustrative of that \nfact. The firefighter who goes back into a burning building saving an \nelderly man or woman, the medic who tends to victims as ambulances race \nto the scene, the police officer who cordons off an area and redirects \nthose in danger to safety--every one of those first responders is a \nhero. Yet far too often their heroism is overlooked. This week, we are \ngoing to have an opportunity to honor their service with legislation \nthat will keep them safe and will save lives and will also allow them \nto receive the fair pay and benefits they deserve.\n  Senator Kennedy and Senator Gregg have done an outstanding job \nwriting this bipartisan bill. Their work is a model for what we can \naccomplish when we abandon partisanship and embrace the common good.\n  This legislation is a bill all Senators can and should support. This \nlegislation provides first responders the dignity and respect they have \ngreatly earned by guaranteeing them the right to collectively bargain. \nThat is a right most private sector employees and public sector \nemployees in 29 States plus the District of Columbia already have. It \nwill mean better wages, hours, working conditions, and benefits for \nthose we count on in a time of crisis. We may never be able to put a \nfair price on heroism, but this legislation is certainly a start.\n  Firefighters--not just those from New York but from surrounding \nareas--suffered the greatest losses on September 11. The recent \ntragedies such as the fire last summer in Charleston, SC, that took the \nlives of nine firefighters or the senseless loss of two firefighters in \nRoxbury, MA, last September serve as a reminder of the dangers these \nmen and women face every time they go to work.\n  Last Friday, I was in Philadelphia, and I was going to a place called \nthe Free Library. It was a rainy day. Of course, that cut the crowd \ndown a little bit. But the thing that cut the crowd down more than \nanything else, that brought traffic to a standstill was the funeral of \na police officer. He stopped some people who had robbed a bank, and one \nof them stepped out of the car with an assault rifle, an automatic \nweapon--not a semiautomatic weapon but an automatic weapon--and he was \nshot many times and killed.\n  Police officers put their lives on the line all the time. They do it \nfor us. There is not much we can do usually to put a fair price on that \nheroism, but tomorrow we can do that. This legislation is the start of \nthat.\n\n  This right to collectively bargain respects States rights. The 29 \nStates already providing the right to collective bargaining for public \nsafety officers would not be affected. The 21 States that don't provide \nfor collective bargaining would have the opportunity to establish their \nown systems or they may ask the Federal Labor Relations Authority to \nassist in the process.\n  This legislation guarantees fairness in public safety by expressly \noutlawing strikes, lockouts, and all forms of work stoppage. That is \nwhy this is a good bipartisan bill. By guaranteeing collective \nbargaining and providing better wages and working conditions, this will \nimprove public safety.\n  It is without any question that first responders who are paid fairly \nand treated with respect will keep their jobs longer and perform more \nefficiently and save the taxpayers money. Communities across America \ncan rest more easily knowing their local police, firefighters, \nparamedics, and other first responders have long and sustained ties to \nthe neighborhoods in which they work.\n  I met with police and firefighters from Nevada and around the country \nto discuss this legislation. They, along with their brothers and \nsisters across all of America, are just the same as those in Nevada to \nwhom I have spoken. They want us to do everything we can to urge all \nSenators to take action. They welcome this opportunity to receive \nsupport to do their jobs more effectively and to help them provide for \ntheir families and protect our families. I urge my colleagues to stand \nwith America's brave first responders by supporting the Public Safety \nEmployer-Employee Cooperation Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/12/senate-section/article/S3989-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I understand I have 20 minutes, and I wish \nto cover two topics during that period of time.\n  First of all, the topic of this week and the topic for me for the \nlast year and a half has been the molding, shaping, putting together, \nand finally passing, going to conference, and having in conference for \nabout 3 months the farm bill, or what is presently called the farm \nbill. Later this week, hopefully on Wednesday, the Senate will take up \nand hopefully pass by a wide margin the final farm bill conference \nreport, which we have called the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of \n2008. I wish to briefly go over why this bill is so critically \nimportant to farming families, to rural communities, and to the Nation \nas a whole.\n  This is a strong, bipartisan farm bill. It benefits every American \nfrom my hometown of Cumming, IA, population 162, to New York City, \npopulation 8 million. This bill provides a strong farm income safety \nnet, so it is good for our farmers, ranchers, and producers. Consumers \nwill like it because it will increase the number of farmers' markets \nand ensure a safe, dependable supply of high-quality, affordable food. \nIt expands the initiative providing fresh fruits and vegetables to \nAmerica's schoolchildren, while reforming and expanding other Federal \nnutrition programs. As production increases, the farm bill will ensure \nthat our precious land and water resources are protected.\n  The final farm bill conference report significantly reforms \ntraditional farm income support programs.\n  First, it eliminates the direct payments to producers with high \nadjusted gross farm incomes and it eliminates all payments to those \nwith high nonfarming incomes.\n  On Wednesday, when we get to debating this bill, we will probably get \ninto more, but I wish to point out that we have come a long way on this \nfarm bill, although maybe not as far as some people want. In fact, I \ninitially voted for the Grassley-Dorgan and Klobuchar amendments on the \nSenate floor, but they didn't win. These amendments would have cut the \nlevel of support to high-income farmers even more. So we had to work in \na spirit of compromise with the House, and I believe we have come up \nwith a good compromise.\n  Think of it this way: Prior to this farm bill, if you had $2.5 \nmillion in income, but 75 percent of that income was from farming, you \nwould still qualify for farm programs. It was only after you had over \n$2.5 million that you wouldn't qualify. This bill reduces that to \n$500,000 of nonfarm income. That is a substantial cut, I would submit \nto anyone. In previous years, if you had farm income, there was no \nlimit. You could have $5 million, $10 million, $20 million in farm \nincome or whatever, and you would still get payments. This bill reduces \nthat to $750,000. So if you get over $750,000 of farm income, you don't \nget any more direct payments. I submit that is significant, significant \nreform.\n  It also improves transparency and accountability. We directly \nattribute each farm program payment to an individual--direct \nattribution. That means no more hiding behind shields or any kind of \npartnerships, multiple entity rules, that type of thing. We have done \naway with the three-entity rule. No more three-entity rule, which has \nbeen in existence for 20 or 25 years. So again, direct attribution, \nplus we put some pretty tight payment caps in there.\n  The conference report also includes a new option for farmers, \nbeginning with the 2009 crop year, to choose to participate in a State-\nlevel revenue protection system. This is a new option for farmers. If \nyou want to get in it, participants will take a 20-percent cut in \ndirect payments and a 30-percent cut in loan rates. In return, they \nwill be eligible for a State-based revenue guarantee equal to 90 \npercent of the State average yield times the national average price. \nNow, this was an ingenious proposal that was first brought to us by the \nNational Corn Growers Association. We worked it over in our committee \nin the Senate. We took it to conference. I believe we have a good \noption here for farmers. I also add that Senator Brown from Ohio, a \nvaluable member of our Agriculture Committee, proposed this in our \ncommittee. It was at his urging--and I know also Senator Durbin's. \nAlthough not a member of the Committee, he was also instrumental in \nproposing and pushing for this option.\n  The farm bill also strengthens the Milk Income Loss Contract Program \nand continues it for the duration of the farm bill. Again, here I have \nto thank the former chairman of our committee, Senator Leahy, who has \nbeen on this Agriculture Committee since before I came to the Senate--\nnow over 25 years ago. Senator Leahy has been the point person in \nmaking sure our family dairy farmers are protected and to make sure \nthey have a seat at this table. In the previous farm bill, in 2002, we \nhad set the percentage of support under the Milk Income Loss Contract \nProgram at 45 percent--45 percent of what, I can tell you later. That \nwas knocked down to 34 percent. We have brought it back up to the 45-\npercent level in this bill, where it was, by the way, 6 years ago. We \ndidn't increase it; we just brought it back up to that level it had \nbeen. We also used an existing formulation the Department of \nAgriculture uses for the average monthly cost of dairy rations, to \nadjust this in the future, so we won't have to have these erosions in \nthe future, so if the price of feed goes up, that support for dairy \nproducers will go up. It makes eminently good sense. I think it is \nreasonable in terms of economics, and also I think it is supportable in \nterms of having a reasonable price when the feed prices are low. So it \nis, in a way, kind of a counter-cyclical program for dairy farmers. I \nthank Senator Leahy for making sure we included that.\n  The new farm bill includes two new titles focusing on livestock and \nspecialty crops. In the last farm bill--which I was privileged to chair \nin 2002--we added a new title on energy. We added two new titles this \ntime, livestock and specialty crops. This bill provides $1 billion for \nspecialty crops in this title, and much more for specialty crops \nthroughout the rest of the bill, investing more in the promotion of \nspecialty crops than any previous farm bills, including funding for \nmarket research as well as supports for producers who transition from \nconventional production into organics. Organic agriculture is one of \nthe fastest growing sectors of American agriculture. We have recognized \nthat by putting more funds in there for transition support for farmers' \nmarkets, and for aggregation of commodities from small farmers. The new \nlivestock title promotes animal health, market opportunities, \ncontracting fairness, and stepped-up enforcement and oversight under \nthe Packers and Stockyards Act. So it is good for our livestock \nproducers.\n  In a time of economic downturn and rapidly rising prices for food \nstaples, millions of low-income Americans have joined the ranks of the \nhungry and ``food insecure.'' For that reason, basically, all of the \nmoney we added on this goes to the nutrition title, bringing the new \nmoney into nutrition, which is nearly $10.4 billion in this bill. We \nare $10 billion over baseline.\n  The new money we basically got through the Finance Committee--$10 \nbillion--basically was all put into the nutrition program. We took \nanother $400 million from inside the farm bill and added to it. I can \nhonestly say all the new money we put in the bill went into nutrition.\n  This new funding will reform and strengthen nutrition assistance. We \nraised the standard deduction. Keep in mind the standard deduction was \nfrozen in 1996, and has wreaked havoc on\n\n[[Page S3991]]\n\nour low-income people since then. So the standard deduction in 1996 was \n$134 a month. If it had not been frozen in 1996, the standard deduction \ntoday would be $188 a month, not $134 a month. We could not go to $188. \nWe didn't have enough money. So we raised it to $144 a month, but we \nindexed it for the future so we won't have this benefit erosion in the \nfuture. It gives you some idea of what is happening to low-income \nfamilies.\n  Think about this. If we had not frozen that benefit level in 1996 at \n$134, it would be $188 a month right now. Yet, we could only raise it \nto $144. We did our job with the money we had. We also provide more \nmoney to families with childcare expenses by removing entirely the cap \non childcare deductions. We also raised the minimum benefit by almost \n50 percent and indexed that also to future inflation, and the asset \nlevel is indexed forward. We were unable to raise it because of money \nconcerns, but we did index it for the future. No longer will erosion \ntake place because of inflation.\n  We increased the food bank supplies by adding some $1.2 billion to \nthe Emergency Food Assistance Program. We provide $1 billion in new \nfunding over the next 10 years for the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable \nProgram for kids in schools. This program, which I started in the 2002 \nfarm bill, when fully implemented, will serve nearly all children in \nour poorest elementary schools--that is, the schools that have at least \n90 percent of their kids eligible for free and reduced-price meals. In \nthose schools that would fully implement this, almost every poor kid \nwill get free fresh fruits and vegetables during the day.\n  To meet the soaring worldwide demand for food and energy crops, \nmillions of acres of land are being brought into production. A lot of \nthis land is environmentally fragile. To address that challenge, we \nauthorize nearly $4.5 billion in additional funds for the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program and the Conservation Stewardship Program \nover the next 10 years. Again, these are payments to farmers, to \nincentivize and encourage them to be even better stewards of our soil, \nwater, air, and wildlife habitats on working lands--rather than taking \nland out of production. Combined spending for these two programs, the \nEQIP program and the CSP program, will total more than $27.7 billion in \nthe next 10 years.\n\n  With this support, the Conservation Stewardship Program will enroll \nnearly 13 million acres each year. To participate, producers will have \nto maintain and expand environmental benefits by adopting rigorous \nconservation and management practices.\n  The Wetlands Reserve Program also gets a number of improvements, with \nan additional $1.3 billion to implement those improvements. We have \nsimplified and streamlined the process of valuing property and getting \ninto the Wetlands Reserve Program. Over the next 5 years, this money \nwill provide for a total enrollment in the Wetlands Reserve Program of \nover 3 million acres.\n  This bill also creates a new and interesting focus on restoring the \nChesapeake Bay. This money covers the Chesapeake Bay watershed. This is \nvery important to Members of Congress and the Senators from Virginia, \nDelaware, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. We put $438 million of new money \ninto the environmental and conservation needs of the Chesapeake Bay \nInitiative.\n  On the energy side, all-time gasoline prices, as we know, are \nwreaking havoc with family budgets. But as studies have shown, without \nthe inputs of ethanol, prices at the pump would be as much as 40 cents \na gallon higher. Well, this new farm bill will dramatically ramp up the \nagricultural sector's capacity to produce clean, renewable energy. We \nprovide more than $1 billion to expand the supply of biofuels made from \nbiomass and crop byproducts other than grain. We also provide new \nassistance to farmers who would grow energy crops, and to entrepreneurs \nwho will build biorefineries to convert the biomass into biofuel.\n  Like any compromise bill resulting from hard bargaining among \nregional and other interests, this farm bill, I suppose, is far from \nperfect--perfection being in the eye of the beholder, of course. I \ndon't think anyone, on either the Democratic or Republican sides, would \nsay they love every little thing in this bill. As the chair of this \nconference committee, I can tell you it has been a long and difficult \nroad, but the end product is a bill with significant reforms, urgent \nnew investments in nutrition, conservation, energy, and the health of \nour school kids.\n  That is why I was disappointed last week when Agriculture Secretary \nEd Schafer held a news conference to say the President would veto the \nbill. The administration said we didn't cut payments to farmers in \ntimes of high farm income. But this administration itself actually \nproposed increasing direct payments, which are least responsive to high \nprices in income.\n  By contrast, Congress determined that it makes more sense to ensure \nthe programs that help producers manage risk are as effective as \npossible if farm revenue is disrupted because of price or production \nshortfalls. We have only added to the income support if prices or \nrevenue declines. That is the right approach. The administration said, \nno, we will put more money in there even if you have high prices. We \nsaid that is the wrong approach. The right approach is counter-\ncyclical. That is what we do. We have the support in place so it is \navailable if needed.\n  What the administration and USDA proposed would have increased \npayments regardless of the prices. Congress correctly rejected the \nadministration's proposal.\n  Finally, when the Senate passed the farm bill in December on the \nSenate floor, the bill was approved with 79 votes--the largest majority \nvote any farm bill has received since 1949. I was proud of that vote, \nbeing chairman of the committee. The bill was further strengthened in \nthe conference process. And we went, I believe, over halfway to \naccommodate the President's wishes and concerns. He said the income \nlimits weren't low enough. The administration proposed $200,000. As I \nsaid earlier, for nonfarm income it used to be $2.5 million. We brought \nit to $500,000. That is way over halfway in meeting what the President \nhad proposed. So, again, like any compromise bill, this bill has things \nin it that I suppose any one of us could say is not quite right. But as \na compromise bill, it includes real reforms, major advances in \nconservation, renewable energy, rural economic development, nutrition, \nand help for our kids in schools.\n  I am proud of this bill. I hope we have a strong vote in the Senate. \nI still hope the President will sign it. If he doesn't, I am hopeful we \nwill have the votes to override the veto and put the bill in place for \nthe future of our country.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to discuss briefly the matter of \nthe collective bargaining for our firefighters and public safety \nemployees. I am an original cosponsor of S. 2123. Decker Ploehn, the \ncity administrator in Bettendorf, Iowa, wrote me:\n\n       I have represented both sides of the table [he was police \n     chief at one time] and for the last 18 years have \n     successfully negotiated 5 contracts with our police union \n     because of strong good collective bargaining laws in Iowa. \n     This system has great checks and balances with binding \n     arbitration and a ``no strike'' clause. It causes both sides \n     to come to the table and to make meaningful concessions. We \n     have done so in Bettendorf quite successfully. That is all \n     we're asking for with this legislation--to give public safety \n     officers elsewhere this kind of opportunity.\n\n  Many of our Federal workers, such as Capitol Police, Border Patrol \nagents, Customs agents, immigration enforcement officers, have the \nright of collective bargaining. It helps them to serve our Nation's \nsecurity interests.\n  Again, it is time that we provide this now to the 21 States where our \npublic safety people are not allowed to bargain collectively. This bill \npassed the House by 314 to 97. Hopefully, it will pass the Senate with \nan equally large vote.\n  If you ask any safety officer, they will tell you that they want the \ntools to do the best job that they can do. These are not the kinds of \njobs that people take to get rich. Public safety workers have a \ndifferent calling--they want to serve their communities. These are the \nkind of people who showed up from all over the country to help the \nvictims of the attacks on September 11, 2001. Without concern for\n\n[[Page S3992]]\n\ntheir personal safety or compensation, our Nation's first responders \nare always there for us. That is why they need a seat at the table to \ndiscuss their equipment, training, and staffing needs in order to do \nthe best possible job.\n  That is why I am an original cosponsor of S. 2123, Public Safety \nEmployer-Employee Cooperation Act. Not only will this legislation allow \npolice officers and firefighters to band together and share their ideas \nabout how to improve their workplace and therefore our safety, but when \nthey can negotiate for good pay and benefits, we are able to attract \nthe best possible workforce to most ably serve its citizens. This bill \nwould only affect the 21 states that don't already provide their public \nsafety officers with the right to bargain collectively. States that do \nnot currently provide these protections can choose to establish their \nown collective bargaining systems, or may ask the assistance of the \nFederal Labor Relations Authority in doing so.\n  As I mentioned, Decker Ploehn is the city administrator in \nBettendorf, IA. I followed him around on a work day back when he was \nthe chief of police there. He contacted my office last week to talk \nabout this bill. He said:\n\n       I have represented both sides of the table and for the last \n     18 years have successfully negotiated 5 contracts with our \n     police union because of strong good collective bargaining \n     laws in Iowa. This system has great checks and balances with \n     binding arbitration and a ``no strike'' clause. It causes \n     both sides to come to the table and to make meaningful \n     concessions. We have done so in Bettendorf quite \n     successfully.\n\n  That's all we are asking for with this legislation--to give public \nsafety officers elsewhere this kind of opportunity.\n  I would also like to point out that this bill doesn't create a new \nright to strike. I know there will be some vehement antiunion forces \nout there scaring people into thinking that somehow this legislation \nwill reduce public safety by creating a situation where police and \nfirefighters will be leaving their posts in labor disputes. It is \nsimply not true.\n  We must ensure that we have seasoned, dedicated officers by giving \nthem a voice in the workplace. The best way to do that is to uphold \ntheir freedom of association, which will enhance the safety of millions \nof Americans who rely on their services every day. As I said, similar \nlegislation has passed the House by a vote of 314 to 97, and I am \nhopeful that Congress will soon approve this issue of basic fairness \nand freedom.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to speak about energy prices \nbecause this is a national crisis; it is a matter this Congress needs \nto deal with.\n  Prices are at record highs. According to AAA, the average price of \nregular unleaded gasoline this morning was $3.71 a gallon. For an \naverage family with two cars, that could well mean $70 to $100 a month \nextra money out of their budget to get the same number of gallons they \nbought 2 or 3 years ago. This is particularly troubling since 60 \npercent of the oil we import comes from abroad, and a big portion of \nthat money the American family pays is going to foreign governments \nhostile to the United States, in some instances. And, it is just not \nhealthy. In my view, it also cannot be disputed that this wealth \ntransfer is a major factor in the economic slowdown we are experiencing \ntoday.\n  The question we in Congress have to ask is, What are we going to do \nabout it? I believe there is a simple answer with many complex parts. \nThe simple answer is, let's get busy doing what works, what we know \nwill work. Certainly, let's not do things that make the situation \nworse, that is going to drive up the price of energy even more, and \nthat is being proposed in this Senate. It is time to take a long road \nback to a sound energy policy that can and will bring down the price of \ngasoline. Permanently? I don't know. We see economies around the world \ngrowing, nations such as China that have about one automobile for every \n20 people, and we average two automobiles per family in the United \nStates. They are coming into that. They are going to continue to grow, \nhave more cars. South America is growing. Other areas of the world are \ngrowing. They are utilizing more energy. They have bigger houses and \nthey have more automobiles and the supply is not going to be able to \ncontinue to increase.\n  I want to talk about the reality today and the fact that I believe \nenergy prices are higher than they need to be, and there are some \nthings we can do to improve them.\n  Congress has done some things. We increased fuel efficiency. Last \nyear we passed, and the President signed into law, the Energy \nIndependence and Security Act. Among its provisions, this measure \nraises the CAFE standards, the automobile mileage standards, to 35 \nmiles per gallon for an automobile manufacturer's entire fleet by 2020. \nThat is moving. We think we can do that. I supported it. I believe we \ncan get to that goal. I am confident we can.\n  Prior to this step of going to 35 miles per gallon, CAFE standards \nwere just 27.5 miles per gallon for automobiles and 22 miles for light \ntrucks and SUVs. So raising the standard to 35 miles overall will \ncertainly reduce oil demand by ensuring that we travel further per \ngallon of gas, we get more benefit from each gallon of gas.\n  I hope Americans, looking at the prices and looking at our national \ninterest and not being so dependent on foreign oil, will seek ways in \ntheir own families to save money for themselves and help America by \nreducing unnecessary utilization of energy. Yet reducing demand through \nincreased efficiency is not the only solution. Our population is \ngrowing, and other factors are at work. We are not going to be able to \nconserve our way out of this problem. We use more energy as the \npopulation grows and as people make more money. In order to produce \nthis additional energy, more must be done to increase clean American \nproduction of energy. We can do that. The United States has significant \nreserves of oil at home, and this Congress has the ability to allow \nthese reserves to be produced.\n  According to the Department of Interior and the U.S. Geological \nSurvey, approximately 119 billion barrels of oil exist on and offshore \nin the United States. Remember, we produce 40 percent of the energy we \nutilize today for automobiles. That is liquid energy, and we can \nproduce more of it. It will have an impact on the global price if we \nincrease in the months to come the amount of oil we produce at home.\n\n  Developing traditional energy sources of oil is not the only way to \nincrease the supply and reduce the cost of gasoline. The United States \nhas an immense supply of unconventional oil called oil shale. The \nCongressional Research Service--that is our independent research \nservice in Congress--estimates this country's oil shale reserves to be \nthe equivalent--hold your hat--the equivalent of approximately 2 \ntrillion barrels of oil--trillion barrels. We utilize about 5 billion a \nyear. That is eight times the amount of Saudi Arabia's oil reserves. \nAnd we also have an abundant supply of coal which can be converted into \ngasoline using technology currently proven in South Africa.\n  This is a step we need to work on and to take. We realize we have to \ndo clean coal, we have to do clean technology in the oil shale area, \nand we have to understand that it will probably create more \nCO2 than just producing a barrel\n\n[[Page S3993]]\n\nof oil from Saudi Arabia and burning it in our automobiles because it \nhas to be heated. But in the short term, we are very unwise, as we \ntransition away from oil, if we do not consider coal to oil and shale \nto oil, both of which, I am told, can be brought in for around $50 a \nbarrel, less than half the world price. We simply have to consider that \nas we go forward.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the U.S. Government, \nthe people of the United States, spent $237 billion on imported oil in \n2007. It is estimated this year, 2008, we will spend $412 billion on \nimported oil, and the price seems to continue to go up. Indeed, 12 \nmonths from today, it may well be over $500 billion for imported oil. \nThis is money that could be churned in our economy paying American \nworkers good wages.\n  Yet Congress has consistently blocked the development of this \nNation's oil resources. I have been here for 12 years. I know how it \nwent down. I have been part of the debate over ANWR and gulf offshore \ndrilling. We finally, 2 years ago, were able to open some areas in the \nGulf of Mexico. But we have huge reserves of oil and gas off our coasts \nthroughout America, and we need to do a better job of allowing that to \nbe available so we don't have to buy so much from abroad.\n  Biofuels can play an important role in keeping the cost of energy \ndown. Despite the claims of detractors, ethanol and biodiesel do reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil to a significant degree. They keep money \nat home because this energy is generated here and, as I indicated with \nSenator Harkin, it creates jobs in Iowa, in Alabama, and keeps that \nwealth at home.\n  The American people may ask: Why aren't we producing American energy \nif it can reduce the price of gas? And I think improved efficiency and \nconservation, combined with an increase of supply, can have more of an \nimpact in breaking this boom of oil prices than a lot of people think. \nIt does not have to be unprecedented reserves of oil coming on the \nmarket in a short period of time, but a lot of this is speculation, a \nlot of this is a shortage of supply, and if the demand drops down \nbecause people conserve and we can get the supply up a measurable \ndegree and get above that demand with our supply, the ability of these \nforeign nations and oil companies and speculators to manipulate the \nprice falls completely. The reason they are successful in seeing prices \nsurge is because we have too tight a margin between demand and supply.\n  The opposition to producing more oil and gas at home has been \nhypocritical, frankly. While opponents of American energy--the same \nones who complain the loudest about high energy costs--they also object \nto producing more gas and oil in the United States, but they do not \nobject to producing it, apparently, in places such as Saudi Arabia or \nVenezuela. It is all right to import it and buy it from them. And while \nthey object to production--and by a narrow margin we were able to open \nthe gulf this summer, finally, some--but while they object to \nproduction offshore in so many areas of our country and in Alaska, \nciting environmental concerns that I don't think are realistic and I \nthink are exaggerated, they show no regard, I suggest, for the \nproduction of oil offshore in places such as Nigeria or Indonesia or \nproduction in the Caspian Sea or the Persian Gulf or the North Sea or \noff Venezuela and in a lake in Venezuela.\n  Indeed, we have a great record of environmental stewardship, far \nsuperior than most of these countries. Our oil companies would operate \ntheir production under the strictest environmental rules in the world.\n  Even during Hurricane Katrina, not too far from my hometown of \nMobile, AL, out in the gulf, not one of the oil platforms leaked. Their \nsafety systems worked as they were designed to, safely shutting off the \nwells below the surface. Most of them are back up and running today. \nProducing American energy creates funding for environmental projects \nthroughout America, throughout Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and \nTexas. These are the four States that have agreed to offshore \nproduction. Our States are able to obtain environmental moneys as a \npart of that agreement we approved 2 years ago. In Alabama, this \nfunding has been used for wetlands preservation, restoration, and \neducational purposes. Instead of sending our wealth to foreign \ncountries to build palaces for rich sheiks, and hotels that have few \noccupants that are some of the finest in the world, and skyscrapers, we \nare using funds from American offshore production to fully fund the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund and to complete other much needed \nenvironmental projects.\n  Tomorrow, this Senate will vote on the American Energy Production Act \nof Senator Pete Domenici. This measure--and I cosponsored it, and \nothers have--is a step in the right direction. It is not the complete \nsolution, but it is something we can do now.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 1 \nadditional minute to wrap up.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This is a step in the right direction. It would suspend \nfilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, invest money in establishing \nnew batteries that will allow us to move to more fuel-efficient \nelectric automobiles--plug-ins, hybrids--utilizing nuclear power. It \nwill produce more offshore and in Alaska and help reduce that $400 to \n$500 billion wealth transfer that is occurring in our country today and \nthat is impacting adversely our national economy and impacting \nadversely the family budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I believe there is 30 minutes reserved \nfor me to speak. I ask that when I have 2 minutes remaining, the Chair \nadvise me of that, please.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/12/senate-section/article/S3993-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3993-S3996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              FUEL PRICES\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the pending business that will be before \nthe Senate is S. 2284. That is a bill to reauthorize the Federal law \ngoverning flood insurance. Our next scheduled vote, as my colleague \nfrom Alabama just pointed out, does not relate to that bill. Our next \nscheduled vote does, in fact, not relate to the subject of flood \ninsurance at all. The next vote will be on an amendment which the \nRepublican leader has filed, allegedly to deal with the high price of \noil and the high price of gasoline at the pump. I will oppose that \namendment tomorrow when the vote is cast, and I urge my colleagues to \ndo the same.\n  The high price of oil and gasoline and diesel that are refined from \nthat oil is creating a very substantial economic burden on the American \nconsumer and on the U.S. economy. At the close of business Friday, the \nprice of oil stood at about $126 per barrel on world markets. The \naverage price of gasoline in this country was around $4 per gallon. \nThis reflects a dramatic increase over prices a year ago. The increased \ncost is difficult for many Americans to avoid because many Americans \ncommute to work or they otherwise need to travel substantial distances \nwhere there is no ready alternative to the use of their private \nvehicles. To the extent Congress and the administration can take action \nto reduce the burden of this increased cost, we should do so.\n  Unfortunately, the amendment of the Republican leader is not a \ncredible proposal for reducing that burden. We should be honest with \nthe American people about this so-called debate on high gas prices. \nThis is an election-year effort. This is election-year politics in its \nclassic form. It is Washington finger-pointing. Unfortunately, it is \nvery little else.\n  Let's be clear. The President set the tone for the debate. On April \n29, 2 weeks ago, the President went to the Rose Garden to express his \nconcern about the price of gas and to blame the Congress for it. While \nhe was there in the Rose Garden, he also took the occasion to blame the \nCongress for the rise in food prices. Unfortunately, as far as I know, \nthere has been no effort by the President to sit down with the leaders \nof Congress and to work out a consensus on constructive actions that \nmight actually help, either with the high price of gas or with the high \nprice\n\n[[Page S3994]]\n\nof food. The amendment of the Republican leader, which will come up for \na vote tomorrow, continues with this same old ``blame the other guy'' \napproach.\n  Let's talk about the facts of why oil and gas prices are so high. In \nmy view, there are supply and demand factors in world oil markets that \nexplain some of what we have seen, and some of those factors are \noutside our control--at least in the short term. The simple fact is \nthat the market for oil is a global market. The price of oil is \nreflected on that market.\n  The United States is the largest purchaser of oil in that market. \nChina is rapidly gaining on us in that regard. We are not even close to \nbeing the largest producer of oil for that market. In fact, we import \nabout 60 percent of the oil we consume. If we want to affect the price \nof oil either by reducing world demand or increasing our supply, our \nability to do so is limited.\n  By far the most significant step we can take to reduce demand in the \nshort and medium term is to improve vehicle fuel efficiency in our cars \nand our trucks. Last fall, we did just that. Many of us believed the \nincrease in required miles per gallon was too modest, but it was a \nsubstantial improvement over what had prevailed for the three previous \ndecades. We need to look at other ways to reduce demand for oil in the \nshort and the medium and the long term.\n  On the supply side, our ability to affect world prices is even more \nlimited. That is simply because of our limited reserves. We have about \n3 percent of the world's oil reserves. Also because most experts \nbelieve that U.S. production in the coming years will do well to \nmaintain its current level. We can affect that production somewhat by \nadopting enlightened policies, but its impact on world markets and \nconsequently on the world price of oil will be limited.\n  When we look at issues that we in the U.S. Government can most \ndirectly and immediately affect, I would cite two. We can reduce the \nincentives for speculation in the oil market--that is No. 1--and \nsecond, we can strengthen the dollar by showing some commitment to \ngetting our own fiscal house in order. Let me comment briefly on each \nof these issues.\n  The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which I am privileged \nto chair, has held several hearings on oil and gasoline prices and \nmarkets this year. Other committees in the House of Representatives had \nsimilar hearings. Current high prices are a result of several factors. \nOne of them is certainly the tight global supply-demand balance. One \nthing stands out from all the testimony both the Senate and House has \nheard: A key factor pushing oil prices into the triple digits in recent \nmonths is a dysfunctional energy market.\n  Here is what a senior vice president of a major oil company said at \none of these hearings on the House side:\n\n       When you look at the fundamentals of our business, \n     Congressman, the supply/demand fundamentals, our assessment \n     would be the price should be somewhere around [$]50 [or $]55 \n     a barrel. There is a disconnect. To me, there are three \n     factors that contribute to that. One is the monetary issue, \n     the weaker dollars we've already talked about. The other is \n     geopolitical political risk. And the third, we believe, is \n     speculation.\n\n  Other key analysts in the Government and the private sector have made \nsimilar statements, although their assumptions about what exact price \nlevel was supported by supply and demand fundamentals have differed. \nBut it would be fair to say that key energy analysts are in general \nagreement that around $30 of the current price of a barrel of oil is a \nresult of market pressures unrelated to supply and demand for physical \nbarrels of oil.\n  This general assessment of a significant cause of high oil and gas \nprices is broadly shared. One noted energy economist put it this way \nrecently in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Crude futures prices have decoupled from the forces \n     controlling the underlying physical flows of the commodity.\n\n  In plain English, that means crude oil prices are not connected to \nsupplies. If oil prices are not being driven by supply and demand, then \nby what are they being driven? We heard some strong testimony on this \nin our committee from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, the firm \nheaded by Daniel Yergin, who is a leading oil expert, well known to all \nin this field. Here is what their analyst had to say in early April:\n\n       Crude oil futures trading activity on the New York \n     Mercantile Exchange--the largest in the world--is currently \n     about 350 percent higher than in 2002. Noncommercial \n     investors have contributed to this increase. . . .\n       New fundamentals--new cost structures and global financial \n     dynamics--are behind the momentum that pushed oil prices to \n     record highs, around $110 a barrel.\n\n  That was $110 a barrel in early April.\n  If we want to get at the real question why oil today is around $125 a \nbarrel and why gasoline is closing in on $4 a gallon across the \ncountry, we will not find the answer in the Republican leader's \namendment. We are witnessing a substantial influx in speculative money \ninto energy markets. It is bidding up the price of oil beyond any \nreasonable level that could be explained by supply and demand. Every \nconsumer can see it at the pump. But do we have any serious effort to \nregulate that speculation or even to notice it?\n  A Commodity Futures Trading Commission witness told our committee \nthey did not see any evidence that speculation was a factor in oil \nprices. I thought they were alone in that view because the amendment of \nthe Republican leader seems to agree in that it fails to acknowledge or \ndeal with this significant part of the problem.\n  If we are going to protect consumers, we need to have a Federal \nGovernment as an effective overseer to start policing these markets. \nThere is a proposal Senator Reid has introduced that will begin to \naddress the issue. That bill requires the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission to start doing the job Congress intends for it to do; that \nis, to make sure oil trading is done with adequate transparency and to \nmake sure limits on speculation apply across the board. Right now, it \nis entirely possible for hedge funds or traders to evade the \nprotections put in place for trading oil in the United States. They \nsimply trade U.S. crude oil in foreign markets that the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission has decided it will not regulate. The \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission could regulate these so-called \ndark markets, but it has decided not to. Instead of turning a blind eye \nto this offshore oil trading, Senator Reid's bill will ensure that the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission makes a priority of protecting \nAmerican energy consumers. The majority leader's approach is aimed at \nbringing down the price of oil in the near term by having effective \nregulation of speculation. Some big hedge funds will not like that, but \nit will help the average consumer.\n  Let me talk for a minute about the second issue which both the \nCongress and the administration ought to be addressing. If we are going \nto get commodity markets of all kinds to act in a more rational way, we \nalso need to do something serious about our overall fiscal policy in \nthis country.\n  The United States is borrowing money on world financial markets \nbecause we cannot summon the political will to actually pay for the \nthings we want our Government to do. We are fighting a war in Iraq on \nborrowed money, to the tune of over a half trillion dollars since 2002. \nA number of us have proposed to strengthen and to extend tax incentives \nto spur energy production from renewable sources, but those are being \nopposed by others here in the Senate for the simple reason that we are \nproposing to pay for those, the extension of those tax provisions, \ninstead of borrowing even more money from overseas to cover their cost.\n  Because of the mismanagement of the economy and our high borrowing \noverseas, the value of the dollar has fallen dramatically. The price we \nare paying for international commodities such as oil is rising. That is \nanother major factor driving up the price of oil. We need to face up to \nit here in the Senate. If Senators want to lower high oil prices, \ngetting our budget house in order will do much more to strengthen the \ndollar and to lower gasoline prices--and sooner than any of the new \ndrilling called for in the amendment of the Republican leader.\n  I have covered two of the most important things we can do to address \nhigh oil and gas prices; that is, curbing oil market speculation and, \nsecondly, getting our budget and fiscal policy in order.\n  Now, let me turn more specifically to the Republican leader's \nproposal. The\n\n[[Page S3995]]\n\namendment is a grab bag of energy-related provisions which have little \nconnection either to the current or future price of oil or gasoline. \nAlthough the amendment contains various other disconnected proposals, \nthe main thrust of the amendment is to increase the amount of Federal \nland available for leasing for oil and gas exploration and production \nin the areas proposed for leasing:\n  First, the Outer Continental Shelf off the Atlantic and the Pacific \ncoasts of the country. And, second, a portion of the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge. The underlying assumption on the proposal is that our \nlack of supply is a result of our refusal to permit exploration and \ndrilling on Federal lands, that changing the law to permit drilling in \nthese two specific areas will solve the problem.\n  Well, what about that basic assumption? Is our ability to produce oil \nand gas domestically being held back because of our unwillingness to \nlease the Outer Continental Shelf off the east coast and the Outer \nContinental Shelf off the west coast and the area known as the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge? Well, let's look at the facts. What is \nhappening on the supply side for oil production in the United States?\n  Last year, we saw the amount of crude oil produced in the United \nStates remain constant, instead of falling. That may not sound like a \nbig achievement, but it is an improvement on previous trends. It is no \ndoubt a reaction to higher prices, but it also reflects bipartisan \nsupport to increase production on Federal lands in places where it is \nappropriate. I have three charts that illustrate the general trend of \nwhat has been going on, and all of these relate to onshore oil and gas \ndrilling and production.\n  This is acreage of new national oil and gas leases in millions of \nacres. Last year, we leased 4.6 million acres of Federal land for oil \nand gas production onshore in the United States. That is the column on \nthe right.\n  That is in places such as my State of New Mexico and Wyoming and \nColorado. That is almost double the 2.6 million acres we put up for \nleasing in the year 2000. So the trend is for leasing of more acres of \nFederal land for oil and gas production onshore.\n  And, of course, these figures do not include all the leasing we did \nlast year in the Outer Continental Shelf. Let me show another chart. \nThis chart is approvals of applications for permits to drill, APDs. In \nthe business they are referred to as APDs. Last year, we approved 7,124 \npermits to drill oil and gas wells on Federal land. Again, this is all \nonshore. That is the right-hand column. That is more than double the \nnumber approved in 2000.\n  This is partly due to the direct funding stream we put in place for \nthis process as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Now, let me show \nyou one other chart. This one relates to drilling activity initiated on \nFederal lands. As a result of the increased number of drilling permits, \nand that was the previous chart, we had actual drillings start last \nyear on 5,243 new wells, both oil and gas wells. That is approaching a \ndoubling of the number that were drilled in 2000, which was 2,861.\n  So these are three charts that make the case for what has been \nhappening onshore. Similar positive trends are underway in the Gulf of \nMexico, although the overall results today are more modest. According \nto the latest report by the Minerals Management Service, total \nproduction of oil in the Gulf of Mexico was up slightly in 2007 to 1.3 \nmillion barrels per day.\n  That is an increase of about 10,000 barrels per day of oil over 2006 \nlevels. We have gone from drilling 134 deepwater wells in the Gulf of \nMexico in 2006 to 142 new deepwater wells last year. There were also \neight announced deepwater discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico in 2007.\n  We are certainly not in decline in oil production in the Gulf of \nMexico, but the increase in activity painted by these statistics is not \noverwhelming either. So there is still much more we could be doing to \nsupport domestic production of oil and gas.\n  The most effective strategy we could pursue, I believe, is something \nthat is not in the Republican leader's amendment. To understand where \nour greatest opportunity for making progress on increased domestic \nproduction lies, we need to focus on a significant problem in the \nmanagement of oil and gas on Federal lands, including in the Outer \nContinental Shelf.\n  Simply put, all the policy emphasis has been on having more lease \nsales, but not enough emphasis has been placed on encouraging diligent \ndevelopment of Federal lands once they are leased.\n  While it is generally true that leases must be produced within \ncertain time parameters, Federal agencies have substantial discretion \nin managing those provisions. I am concerned we may not be following \nthe correct policies to bring about production in the most timely \nfashion. I have asked the Government Accountability Office to examine \nthis topic.\n  Let me illustrate my concern with the following charts. Here, first, \nwith regards to onshore production. This pie chart on the left shows \nall the leased acreage on Federal land for oil and gas development \nonshore in the lower 48 States.\n  As you see, about three-quarters of all of this in red, three-\nquarters of the Federal land we have leased onshore is not currently \nbeing produced. Of the over 45.5 million acres of land that have been \nleased, oil companies are sitting on 31 million acres on which no \nproduction is occurring. A similar story can be told in terms of the \nOuter Continental Shelf. This is the chart on the right. This is \noffshore.\n  Of a total of 41 million acres that have been leased offshore, 33 \nmillion of that 41 million are not being produced. The Republican \nleader's amendment proposes to open the entire Atlantic and Pacific \ncoast to leasing and development. Although the amendment speaks to \npetitions from Governors to lease in specific areas, the way the \namendment is written, the Secretary can open for leasing even areas \nwhere no such request is pending, by including them in the next so-\ncalled 5-year-plan from the Minerals Management Service.\n  Here is a map of all the leases in the Outer Continental Shelf in the \nGulf of Mexico. To get an idea of what we are talking about, the blue \nsquares represent areas that have producing leases. As we can see, \nthere are many of those. The much more numerous yellow squares \nrepresent leased blocks where nothing is happening. The red blocks, \nwhich are also scattered around, represent new areas that have been \nadded through recent lease sales.\n  For all the increases in drilling activity I have mentioned earlier \nin the talk, you will see we still have a great many areas where no \nexploration or production is ongoing, even though those areas have been \nleased. We recently have added even more leased areas to this map.\n  Here is a second map of the oil-and-gas-producing regions on the \nNorth Slope of Alaska. In the middle is the private and State land, the \ntan-colored area. This small area to the right over here is area 1002, \nthe 1002 area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge which the \nRepublican leader's amendment would open to leasing.\n  The large area on the left, this yellow area, is the National \nPetroleum Reserve-Alaska. This area was specifically set aside to be \nexploited for oil and gas development. The National Petroleum Reserve-\nAlaska totals 23.5 million acres, most of which can be developed and \ndrilled. The mean estimate of oil resources in the National Petroleum \nReserve-Alaska is 9.3 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil. \nThat is significantly more oil than is estimated to be contained in the \nnational portion of the Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge.\n  To date, 3.8 million acres of this NPRA have been leased. That is \ntwice the size of the portion of the Arctic Refuge that is being talked \nabout in the Republican leader's amendment. Here is a slightly more \ndetailed version of that chart that shows where those leased areas are. \nYou can see that a large portion of the leased areas--those are the \nareas in red--is on the eastern side of the Petroleum Reserve, very \nclose to the Alpine field which is tied into the Trans-Alaska Pipeline \nSystem. So the infrastructure to take oil from the Petroleum Reserve in \nAlaska, on the North Slope of Alaska to the lower 48 is very close at \nhand.\n\n  So with all those favorable factors in place, you would wonder how \nmany production wells do we have operating on the 3.8 million acres of \nthe Petroleum Reserve that we have leased? And\n\n[[Page S3996]]\n\nthe answer is zero. Zero current production from these leases should be \na substantial cause for concern. It illustrates a basic problem with \nour domestic production of oil and gas. It is not that we have not \nleased Federal land for exploration and production. We have leased \nlarge tracts of Federal land. We are leasing more all the time.\n  Oil and gas companies certainly benefit by having these leases on \ntheir books and claiming the potential oil as part of their reserves. \nBut we need to get these oil and gas resources out of the reserves \ncolumn and into the production column.\n  What does the Republican leader's amendment do about any of this? \nAbsolutely nothing. He is calling for more leases in areas that are \nmuch more remote from oil and gas transmission infrastructure than the \nacreage we have already leased.\n  It would take a decade or more for those resources to come into \nproduction at the very best. Why should we expect oil and gas companies \nto rush into new areas to begin production when they are sitting on \nliterally millions and millions of acres of existing leases without \ndoing any production on those?\n  The fact is, having a lease sale in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge will not do a single thing to bring down gasoline prices anytime \nsoon. Opening offshore areas such as off the east coast and off the \nwest coast, where there is no infrastructure, is also a very \nineffective response to the prices that consumers are seeing today. \nThese are not real solutions to what is wrong in energy markets today.\n  If we are serious about doing something to boost domestic production, \nwe need to focus on better management of Federal leases. Let me \ndescribe two concrete suggestions in that regard.\n  First, we might consider imposing a production incentive fee on all \nthe Federal acres that are under lease, a fee that would increase over \ntime but which would be cancelled by royalty payments. That would \nprovide a disincentive for sitting on leases for purposes of inflating \na company's reserve estimates.\n  Second, we enacted some specific provisions in the Energy Policy Act \nof 2005 that reduced pressure on the leaseholders in the National \nPetroleum Reserve-Alaska, in terms of their responsibilities to develop \nthe oil resources there. We changed the law to allow oil companies with \na lease in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska to hold it for 30 \nyears or more, without producing.\n  I opposed those changes to the law but was unable to prevail on that \npoint. Provisions that allow for decades of additional delay in \ndeveloping oil on Federal lands that are dedicated for production of \noil make no sense when that oil is selling at $126 a barrel.\n  If anyone in this Chamber wants to advocate for oil production in \nAlaska or anywhere on Federal land, then the threshold test is whether \nthey are willing to change the incentive structure that currently \nrewards delay and inaction. That dysfunctional incentive structure was \nput in place in the law we passed in 2005.\n  If we are not willing to take action to bring the 3.8 million acres \nalready leased in Alaska into production, then there isn't much \ncredibility to the argument that somehow one more lease sale up there \nwill greatly add to energy security.\n  There is another area in which the Republican leader's amendment \nmisses the mark on promoting domestic oil and gas production. His \namendment leaves out the one place offshore where it would be easiest \nand fastest to get additional production, and that is in the Gulf of \nMexico. His amendment opens the entire Atlantic and Pacific coastlines \nfor new oil and gas production but leaves in place the oil and gas \nmoratoria in the Gulf of Mexico. That is out of touch with reality. The \nGulf of Mexico is the first place we should be looking to for expanded \nproduction, not the one place we should leave off the list.\n  Let me put up this chart. When we last debated offshore oil and gas \nproduction in this Chamber in 2006, we made what I consider to be a \nvery bad bargain. We put off limits--that is the yellow area on the \nchart--10 times the amount of natural gas that we opened to exploration \nand drilling. We made available for lease 2 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas in the Gulf of Mexico while putting off limits 22 trillion \ncubic feet of natural gas. We also put new areas of the Gulf of Mexico \nunder moratorium for the first time, including portions of the lease \nsale 181 area that were closest to the existing oil and gas \ninfrastructure. The area now under current law is off limits until 2022 \nbecause of that provision we passed into law in 2006. The portion of \nthe lease sale 181 area we put under moratorium for the first time \ncontains a half billion barrels of oil and 4 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas.\n  The available infrastructure to take it to market is already there. \nThe interest by industry in these resources is intense.\n  This weekend I was reading the current edition of Barron's, the Dow-\nJones business and financial weekly. There is a column in there by Jim \nMcTague where he quotes President Bush's former economic adviser, Al \nHubbard, as saying:\n\n       If the other 49 states realized what Florida is doing to \n     them, they'd be up in arms.\n\n  McTague goes on to lament the fact that President Bush does not \nsupport revoking the lease sale moratoria on the outer continental \nshelf that were first imposed by his father in the early 1990s.\n  He then states:\n\n       Bush, during the 2000 presidential contest, promised his \n     brother Jeb, Florida's governor at the time, that he'd \n     maintain the drilling ban.\n\n  So there you have it. If we are really serious about increasing \ndomestic production and repealing existing moratoria, the place to \nstart is here in the gulf. The Republican leader's amendment leaves \nthat out, much to its detriment.\n  I have additional comments that I do not have time to go through. \nThere is one area where I very much compliment the minority leader, and \nthat is including in his amendment the proposal to suspend the filling \nof the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the remainder of this year. \nSenator Dorgan has been pushing this legislation for many months. I \nhave been glad to be a cosponsor. I know Senator Domenici recently \nindicated he now supports this position. This is a proposal that is in \nMajority Leader Reid's proposal. It is proposed legislation. It is also \nin the Republican leader's amendment. I congratulate him for that.\n  Right after we vote on the Republican leader's amendment, the large \ncomprehensive amendment I have been talking about, the vote right after \nthat will be on the proposal to suspend the filling of the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve.\n  I hope will get a strong bipartisan vote. Clearly, it would be a step \nin the right direction. It is something we should do. I hope we can at \nleast include that positive action before the Congress has to turn to \nother business tomorrow as it plans to, when we get back to discussing \nthe flood insurance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I understand the minority leader is on his \nway to make a few remarks.

Mr. President, I would like to address the \nheartbreaking humanitarian crisis in Burma and the actions of the \nmilitary junta there which have shocked our consciences over these last \ndays.\n  A govrnment that was swift to mobilize last year against a peaceful \nprotest by unarmed monks has astonished us with its sluggish response \nto the devastating May 3 storm.\n  With thousands dead and perhaps 2 million now at risk of further \nsuffering, the military junta has treated the cyclone as more of a \npolitical inconvenience than a national tragedy, focusing on a sham \nconstitutional referendum instead of relief efforts. And\n\n[[Page S3997]]\n\nthe consequences of this callous response are tragic. As precious time \nwas wasted, what was already a terrible natural disaster became a \nmanmade disaster of spreading hunger and disease. We have heard reports \nof aid workers being turned away and of visas for aid workers being \nrefused on the grounds that consulates were closed for the weekend.\n  Today, finally, an American C-130 was permitted into Burma carrying \ndesperately needed supplies. Two more flights are expected tomorrow. \nThis is a positive development, but it is also an extremely modest \nconcession.\n  It is my hope that these halting steps by the regime in the last day \nor so augur a greater openness to humanitarian assistance.\n  The people of Burma should know that, if permitted, America stands \nready to help.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/12/senate-section/article/S3997-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL DAY AND POLICE WEEK\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, all across the country this week, \nAmericans will honor the law enforcement officers who keep our Nation \nsafe and paying solemn tribute to those who have lost their lives in \nthe line of duty. Peace Officers' Memorial Day and Police Week is a \ntime to thank all those who keep us safe, and a time to be grateful for \nall who have served.\n  As the Jefferson County Judge Executive in Louisville, KY, I had a \nstrong relationship with the local police force. I was always proud of \nthe department and its leadership and the rank and file officers who \nworked hard to protect and defend Louisville. I remember the pride we \nfelt when we brought county and city police together to create the \nCrimes Against Children Unit, and the pride the officers felt when they \nmade it a model for the rest of the country.\n  Louisville has changed a lot since then, and so has America. On \nSeptember 11 we awoke to an enemy that has no regard for human life and \nthat has repeatedly expressed its intent to destroy our Nation. We have \nseen the horror these people can inflict on our cities. And we take \nthem at their word when they say that they plan to do it again. It is \nbecause of this threat that today we have an even deeper appreciation \nfor the men and women who enforce our laws, not just as first \nresponders to crime, but as a first line of defense against potential \nterrorist attacks.\n  During this Peace Officers' Memorial Day and Police Week, we honor \nthe contributions of our police officers and other keepers of the \npeace. We remember the sacrifice of those who have fallen in the line \nof duty, including Officer Jacob Chestnut and Detective John Gibson, \nwho gave their lives right here in the Capitol ten years ago. It was \nJuly 24, 1998) when they, as it now says on the plaque commemorating \ntheir heroism, ``bravely gave their lives defending the United States \nCapitol.''\n  We express our gratitude to the families of America's peace officers \nand police, who make sacrifices large and small so their loved ones can \nkeep the rest of us safe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor again to talk about \nenergy prices. Each week we must finally be at the tipping point where \nDemocrats are at least willing to address high energy prices. \nUnfortunately, although energy prices remain at an all-time high, it \nseems we are not there yet. The average American uses 500 gallons of \ngasoline every year, with the average gas price at $3.61 per gallon. \nThat means the average American will spend more than $1,800 this year \non gasoline. That is almost $300 more than they would have spent a year \nago. But let's look at a slightly longer period. Let's look at the \nperiod since Democrats took control of the Congress and insisted that \nthey had all the answers.\n  On January 4, 2007, a gallon of gas cost $2.33. That means the \naverage American has spent $960 more on gasoline in the year and a half \nsince Democrats took over. The question is, Why are we not producing \nthe domestic oil available in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge known \nas ANWR? The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that the potential oil in \nANWR would exceed that which is currently being produced in the lower \n48 States. We hear a lot of moaning about how we should not open ANWR \nbecause that oil would not be available for 10 years. But I remember \nhearing that exact same argument about 10 years ago. If we had opened \nANWR to domestic oil production 10 years ago, we would be less reliant \non foreign sources for about 1 million fewer barrels each and every \nday.\n  The question is, Why are we not producing in the Outer Continental \nShelf? Currently, 58 percent of this area is off limits to production. \nThe National Petroleum Council estimates if congressional restrictions \nwere lifted, we would have access to more than 300 trillion cubic feet \nof natural gas. This is enough gas to meet all of the current U.S. \nneeds for more than 13 years. Current levels of production in the Outer \nContinental Shelf employ over 45,000 people. To those of us concerned \nabout employment figures, opening additional areas offshore will lead \nto more jobs in addition to increased domestic energy.\n  The question is, Why are we not producing domestic oil from oil shale \nin Colorado, for example? The Democrats ensured that BLM could not \nwrite commercialization regulations by placing a spending prohibition \nin the fiscal year 2008 omnibus bill which is being applied this year \nfrom last year's action. Commercialization regulations do not authorize \nproduction or even lease. These regulations simply allow the department \nto set out the rules of the road for companies so they can make \ninvestment decisions--matters such as the length and requirements for \noil shale leases, the royalty rate, and reclamation requirements that \nwould be set by commercialization regulations.\n  Considering there is well over 1 trillion barrels of oil locked in \nthe shale beneath Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming, this is not an \ninconsequential amount of energy. One trillion barrels of oil would \nprovide for the current consumption levels of 20 million barrels a day \nfor over 136 years. If the numbers seem staggering, that is because \nthey are. The question is, Why are we not addressing the restrictive \npolicies on the construction of new refineries that have led to no new \nrefinery capacity in this country since the 1970s?\n  We must encourage companies to build new refineries so not only can \nwe produce more oil domestically, but we can refine it into a usable \nproduct as well.\n  The law of supply and demand tells us with high demand and low \nsupply, prices will increase. This seems to have escaped the notice of \nthe Democrat-controlled Congress, however. Oblivious to prices at the \npump, this Congress is failing in its duty to the American public.\n  Each attempt to implement commonsense solutions to current energy \nproblems is met with loud and vehement objections. At this point, these \nobjections can only mean Democrats want energy prices to continue to \nincrease. I can think of no other explanation.\n  The facts are rather simple. The Congress has blocked efforts to \nproduce trillions of cubic feet of natural gas, trillions of barrels of \noil, and prevent the construction of new refineries, nuclear \npowerplants, and hydroelectric facilities.\n  The longer we deny access to domestic supplies, the more our current \nenergy shortages will climb. And the less energy we produce \ndomestically, the more we will rely on foreign--and possibly hostile--\nsources for it.\n  It is time--it is time--for Congress to step to the plate and ensure \nthis country remains one of the safest and most prosperous nations on \nEarth. That means increasing domestic energy production and decreasing \nour dangerous reliance on foreign energy sources.\n  We will vote in a very short time on whether to increase domestic \nenergy production or whether to maintain the status quo. I can only \nhope each of us does the right thing and votes in favor of the \nMcConnell amendment to stop the status quo and to ensure we can produce \nmore of the energy we need right here at home.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, have I been assigned a specific amount of \ntime?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has been assigned 20 \nminutes.\n\n[[Page S3998]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, day after day, record-high oil and gasoline prices are \nhurting millions of American consumers and businesses. Unless something \nis done to make energy more affordable, the record-high prices will \ncontinue to reverberate throughout our economy, increasing the prices \nof transportation and food and manufacturing and everything in between. \nSkyrocketing energy prices are a threat to our economic and national \nsecurity, and the time is long past for action.\n  My Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has conducted four \nseparate investigations into how our energy markets can be made to work \nbetter. Most recently, last December, we had a joint hearing with the \nSenate Energy Subcommittee on the role of speculation in rising energy \nprices. As a result of these investigations and hearings, I have been \nadvocating a variety of measures to address the rampant speculation and \nlack of regulation of energy markets which have contributed to sky-high \nenergy prices.\n  Some of those measures are: First, put a cop back on the beat in the \nenergy markets to ensure these markets are free from excessive \nspeculation and manipulation, and that cop has to be a regulatory \nagency; stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve until prices are \nlower; develop alternatives to fossil fuels to lessen our dependence on \noil; and impose a windfall profits tax on oil companies that have \nprofited from the massive price increases.\n  Now, there is not much we can do about some causes of these sky-high \ngas prices, but there are a number of causes that can be addressed. One \nkey factor in the price spikes of energy is rampant speculation in the \nenergy markets. Traders are trading contracts for future delivery of \noil in record amounts, creating a paper demand that is driving up \nprices and increasing price volatility, solely to take a profit. \nOverall, the amount of trading of futures in oil on the New York \nMercantile Exchange has risen sixfold in recent years.\n  As this chart shows, from 500,000 contracts for future delivery of \noil to 3 million contracts just since 2001. Now, much of this increase \nin the trading of futures has been due to speculation. Speculators in \nthe oil market do not intend to use crude oil. Instead, they buy and \nsell contracts for crude oil just to make a profit from changing \nprices.\n  The number of futures and options contracts held by speculators has \ngone from around 100,000 contracts in 2001--which at that time was 20 \npercent of the outstanding futures and options contracts--and has risen \nto 1.2 million futures contracts currently held by speculators. That \nrepresents now about 40 percent of the outstanding futures contracts in \noil on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n  That increase can be seen on this chart: the doubling in the \npercentage of futures contracts, which is represented by purchases by \nspeculators on the New York Mercantile Exchange, from this level--15 to \n20 percent in January of 2001--to almost double that amount currently. \nThat is a massive increase in speculation.\n  As a matter of fact, as this next chart shows, there is now 12 times \nas much speculation as there was in 2001, while the purchase of \nnonspeculative futures is up but three times. This chart shows the \ndifference. As shown on this chart, these are the purchases of \ncontracts for future delivery of oil bought by speculators versus \nnonspeculators.\n  As shown on the chart, the speculator increase in purchases is that \nwhite line, with that dramatic increase, starting in 2003, going all \nthe way up to where it is currently; and the relatively flatter yellow \nline represents the purchases of future delivery of oil by the \nnonspeculators since 2001.\n  Now, not surprisingly, this massive speculation the price of oil will \nincrease has, in fact, helped increase the price of oil to a level far \nabove that justified by traditional forces of supply and demand.\n  Let me quote some experts about the role of speculation. Some people \nsay: Well, speculation does not have much of an effect. Well, listen to \nsome of the experts.\n  The president and CEO of Marathon Oil said recently:\n\n       $100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the \n     market. It has to be speculation on the futures market that \n     is fueling this.\n\n  Mr. Fadel Gheit, oil analyst for Oppenheimer & Company, describes the \noil market as ``a farce.''\n\n       The speculators have seized control and it's basically a \n     free-for-all, a global gambling hall, and it won't shut down \n     unless and until responsible governments step in.\n\n  In January of this year, as oil hit $100 a barrel, Tim Evans, oil \nanalyst for Citigroup, wrote the following:\n\n       [T]he larger supply and demand fundamentals do not support \n     a further rise and are, in fact, more consistent with lower \n     price levels.\n\n  At the joint hearing I made reference to on the effects of \nspeculation we held last December, Edward Krapels, a financial market \nanalyst, said the following:\n\n       Of course financial trading, speculation affects the price \n     of oil because it affects the price of everything we trade. . \n     . . It would be amazing if oil somehow escaped this effect.\n\n  Dr. Krapels added that as a result of this speculation, ``there is a \nbubble in oil prices.''\n  A fair price for a commodity is a price that accurately reflects the \nforces of supply and demand for the commodity, not the trading \nstrategies of speculators who only are in the market to make a profit \nby the buying and selling of paper contracts, with no intent to \nactually purchase, deliver, or transfer the commodity.\n  As we all too often have seen in recent years, when speculation grows \nso large that it has a major impact on the market, prices get distorted \nand stop reflecting true supply and demand.\n  Excessive market speculation is a factor that we can and should do a \nbetter job of controlling. There are other long overdue actions as well \nthat, if taken as part of a comprehensive plan, can combat rising \nenergy prices.\n  But as to reining in the speculators, the first step is to put a cop \nback on the beat in all of our energy markets to prevent excessive \nspeculation, price manipulation, and trading abuses.\n  In 2001, my Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations began \ninvestigating our energy markets. At the time, the price of a gallon of \ngasoline had spiked upwards by about 25 cents over the course of the \nMemorial Day holiday. We subpoenaed records from major oil companies \nand interviewed oil industry experts, gas station dealers, antitrust \nexperts, gasoline wholesalers and distributors, and oil company \nexecutives. We examined thousands of prices at gas stations in \nMichigan, Ohio, California, and other States. In the spring of 2002, I \nreleased a 400-page report and held 2 days of hearings on the results \nof the investigation.\n  The investigation found that increasing concentration in the gasoline \nrefining industry, due to a large number of recent mergers and \nacquisitions, was one of the causes of the increasing number of \ngasoline price spikes. Another factor causing those spikes was the \nincreasing tendency of refiners to keep lower inventories of gasoline. \nWe also found a number of instances in which the increasing \nconcentration in the refining industry was also leading to higher \nprices in general. Limitations on the pipeline that brings gasoline to \nmy home State of Michigan was another cause of price increases and \nspikes in Michigan. The report recommended that the Federal Trade \nCommission carefully investigate proposed mergers, particularly with \nrespect to the effect of mergers on inventories of gasoline.\n  In March of 2003, my subcommittee released a second report detailing \nhow the operation of crude oil markets affects the price of not only \ngasoline but also key commodities such as home heating oil and diesel \nfuel. The report warned that U.S. energy markets were vulnerable to \nprice manipulation due to a lack of comprehensive regulation and market \noversight.\n  Following this report, I worked with Senator Feinstein on legislation \nto put the cop back on the beat in the energy markets that had been \nexempted from regulation pursuant to an ``Enron loophole'' that was \nsnuck into other commodities legislation in December of 2000. For 2 \nyears, we attempted to close that ``Enron loophole,'' but efforts to \nput the cop back on the beat in these markets were unsuccessful, due to \nopposition from the Bush administration, large energy companies, and \nfinancial institutions that trade energy commodities.\n  In June of 2006, I released another subcommittee report called ``The \nRole\n\n[[Page S3999]]\n\nof Market Speculation in Rising Oil and Gas Prices: A Need to Put a Cop \non the Beat.'' This report found that the traditional forces of supply \nand demand no longer accounted for sustained price increases and price \nvolatility in the oil and gas markets. The report determined that in \n2006 a growing number of energy trades occurred without regulatory \noversight and that market speculation had contributed to rising oil and \ngasoline prices, perhaps accounting for $20 out of a then-priced $70 \nbarrel of oil.\n  The subcommittee report I released in June of 2006 again recommended \nnew laws to increase market oversight and stop market manipulation and \nexcessive speculation. I again coauthored legislation with Senator \nFeinstein to improve oversight of the unregulated energy markets. Once \nagain, opposition from the Bush administration, large energy traders, \nand the financial industry prevented the full Senate from considering \nthat legislation.\n  In 2007, my subcommittee addressed the sharp rise in natural gas \nprices over the previous year and released a fourth report, entitled: \n``Excessive Speculation in the Natural Gas Market.'' Our investigation \nshowed that speculation by a single hedge fund named Amaranth had \ndistorted natural gas prices during the summer of 2006 and drove up \nprices for average consumers. The report also demonstrated how Amaranth \nhad traded in unregulated markets to avoid the restrictions and \noversight in the regulated markets, and how the price increases caused \nby Amaranth could have been prevented if there had been the same type \nof oversight in the unregulated markets as in the regulated markets.\n\n  Following that investigation, I introduced a bill, S. 2058, to close \nthe Enron loophole and regulate the unregulated electronic energy \nmarkets. Working again with Senators Feinstein and Snowe and with \nmembers of the Agriculture Committee in a bipartisan effort, we finally \nmanaged to include an amendment to close the Enron loophole in the farm \nbill that was then being considered by the Senate. The Senate \nunanimously passed this amendment to close the Enron loophole last \nDecember. Last week, the House and Senate conferees on the farm bill \nreached agreement to include our legislation in the final farm bill, \nand we hope the Congress will finally pass that important legislation \nsoon.\n  Although our legislation to close the Enron loophole is vitally \nimportant for the energy market oversight as a whole, and for our \nnatural gas markets in particular, because energy traders have recently \nmoved a significant amount of United States crude oil and gasoline \ntrading to the United Kingdom, beyond the direct reach of United States \nregulators, we have to address that second loophole now as well.\n  The key energy commodity market for United States crude oil and \ngasoline trading is now located in London, regulated by the British \nagency called the Financial Services Authority. However, the British \nregulators do not have any limits on speculation as we do here in the \nUnited States, and the British do not make public the same type of \ntrading data we do. That means traders can avoid the limits on \nspeculation in crude oil imposed on the New York exchanges by trading \non the London exchange. It also makes the London exchange less \ntransparent than the New York exchange. The legislation I introduced in \n2007 would have required United States traders on the London exchange \nto provide United States regulators with the same type of trading \ninformation they are already required to provide when they trade on the \nNew York Mercantile Exchange. Unfortunately, this provision was dropped \nfrom the ``close the Enron loophole'' legislation in the farm bill.\n  The Consumer First Energy Act, which the majority leader and others \nintroduced last week to address high gas prices and reduce speculation, \nincludes a provision to stop speculation and to increase our access to \ntimely and important trading information and to ensure there is \nadequate market oversight of the trading of U.S. energy commodities no \nmatter where the trading occurs. This legislation that was introduced \nlast week, and which I am proud to cosponsor, would require the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission--the CFTC--to ensure a foreign \nexchange imposes comparable speculative limits and comparable reporting \nrequirements on speculators that the CFTC imposes on U.S. exchanges \nprior to allowing traders in the U.S. trading U.S. energy commodities \ndirect access to that exchange through a terminal located in this \ncountry. So the bill introduced last week will close that second \nloophole which I have identified.\n  I believe this issue is so important that I have also introduced that \nsection to close that second loophole as a separate bill. Senator \nFeinstein is a cosponsor of that bill. I ask unanimous consent that a \nsummary of the bill be printed in the Record after my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. In addition to finding that the energy markets needed \nbetter regulation and oversight, the report issued by my subcommittee \nin 2003 also found that the Bush administration's large deposits of oil \ninto the Strategic Petroleum Reserve--SPR--were increasing prices but \nnot overall U.S. energy security. We found that in 2002, the Bush \nadministration, over the repeated objections of its own experts in the \nDepartment of Energy, had changed its policy and decided to put oil \ninto the SPR regardless of the price of oil or market conditions. By \nplacing oil into the SPR while oil prices were high and oil supplies \nwere tight, the administration's deposits into the SPR were reducing \nmarket supplies and boosting prices, with almost no benefit to national \nsecurity, given the fact that the SPR is more than 95 percent filled. \nThe DOE experts believed that in a tight market, we are better off with \nkeeping the oil on the market rather than putting it into the ground \nwhere it cannot be used.\n  Following the issuance of this report, in early 2003 I asked the \nDepartment of Energy to suspend its filling of the SPR until prices had \nabated and supplies were more plentiful. DOE refused to change course \nand continued the SPR fill without regard to market supplies or prices.\n  After DOE denied my request, I offered a bipartisan amendment with my \ncolleague Senator Collins to the Interior Appropriations bill, which \nprovides funding for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve program, to \nrequire DOE to minimize the costs to the taxpayers and market impacts \nwhen placing oil into the SPR. The Senate unanimously adopted our \namendment, but it was dropped from the conference report due to the \nBush administration's continued opposition.\n  The next spring, I offered another amendment, also with Senator \nCollins, to the budget resolution, expressing the sense of the Senate \nthat the administration should postpone deliveries into the SPR and use \nthe savings from the postponement to increase funding for national \nsecurity programs. The amendment passed the Senate by a vote of 52-43. \nThat fall, we attempted to attach a similar amendment to the homeland \nsecurity appropriations bill that would have postponed the SPR fill and \nused the savings for homeland security programs, but the amendment was \ndefeated by a procedural vote, even though the majority of Senators \nvoted in favor of the amendment, 48-47.\n  The next year, the Senate passed the Levin-Collins amendment to the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005 to require the DOE to consider price impacts \nand minimize the costs to the taxpayers and market impacts when placing \noil into the SPR. The Levin-Collins amendment was agreed to by the \nconferees and is now law.\n  Unfortunately, passage of this provision has had no effect upon DOE's \nactions. DOE continues to fill the SPR regardless of the market effects \nof buying oil, thereby taking oil off the market and reducing supply by \nplacing it into the SPR. In the past year, no matter what the price of \noil or market conditions, DOE has consistently found that the market \neffects are negligible and no reason to delay filling the SPR.\n  Currently, at the same time the President has urged OPEC to put more \noil on the market to reduce supplies, the administration is continuing \nto take oil off the market and place it into the SPR. The DOE is \ncurrently depositing about 70,000 barrels of crude oil per day into the \nSPR, much of it high-quality crude oil that is ideal for refining into \ngasoline. It simply defies common sense for the U.S. government\n\n[[Page S4000]]\n\nto be acquiring oil at $120 barrel, in a time of tight supply, just \nbefore the peak driving season, and put it into the SPR. That is why I \nhave co-sponsored Senator Dorgan's bill to suspend the SPR fill for 1 \nyear, or until prices fall to more acceptable levels, whichever comes \nfirst. Passing this legislation will save the taxpayers money and \nrelieve some of the pressure on the oil markets that is driving prices \nrelentlessly higher. A similar provision is also included in the \nDemocrats' Consumer-First Energy Act.\n  The recent SPR fill has exacerbated yet another problem in our oil \nmarkets--the fact that the standard NYMEX futures contract that sets \nthe benchmark price for U.S. crude oil requires a particular type of \nhigh quality crude oil known as West Texas Intermediate, WTI, to be \ndelivered at a particular location--Cushing, OK. The standard NYMEX \ncontract price, in turn, has a major influence on the price of fuels \nrefined from crude oil such as gasoline, heating oil, and diesel.\n  Because the price of the standard contract depends upon the supply of \nWTI at Cushing, OK, the supply and demand conditions in Oklahoma have a \ndisproportionate influence on the price of NYMEX futures contracts. \nThat means when the WTI price is no longer representative of the price \nof U.S. crude oil in general, the prices of other energy commodities \nare also thrown out of whack. In other words, we have an oil futures \nmarket that reflects the supply and demand conditions in Cushing, OK, \nbut not necessarily the overall supply and demand situation in the \nUnited States as a whole.\n  I have long called for reform of this outdated feature of the \nstandard NYMEX crude oil contract. In 2003, the PSI report recommended \nthe CFTC and NYMEX to work together to revise the standard NYMEX crude \noil futures contract to reduce its susceptibility to local imbalances \nin the market for WTI crude oil. The subcommittee report suggested that \nallowing for delivery at other locations could reduce the volatility of \nthe contract. It is truly disappointing that since our report was \nissued, no progress has been made for allowing for delivery at other \nplaces than Cushing, OK. As the price of oil has increased, the \ndistortions and imbalances caused by the atypical nature of the \nstandard contract have gotten worse. It is essential NYMEX repair its \ncrude oil contract.\n  Putting the cop on the beat in our energy markets, strengthening \naccess to key oil trading information, stopping the SPR fill, and \nfixing the NYMEX crude oil contract all focus on problems caused by \nrising energy prices. These consistently rising gas prices also \nunderscore the need to develop advanced vehicle technologies and \nalternative energy sources that will significantly reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  I have long advocated advanced automotive technologies such as hybrid \nelectric, advanced batteries, hydrogen and fuel cells and promoted \ndevelopment of these technologies through Federal research and \ndevelopment and through joint government-industry partnerships. We need \na significant infusion of Federal dollars into these efforts to make \nrevolutionary breakthroughs in automotive technologies. Such an \ninvestment will make technologies such as plug-in hybrid vehicles \naffordable to the American public, and reduce our dependence on oil and \nreduce prices at the pump.\n  We need an equally strong investment in development of alternative \nfuels that can replace gasoline. I have strongly supported efforts to \nincrease our production of renewable fuels and to do that in a way that \nwill also reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. We need a strong push \ntoward biofuels produced from cellulosic materials, which requires a \nsignificantly greater Federal investment in biofuels technologies. \nCellulosic ethanol has enormous potential for significant reductions in \ngreenhouse gas emissions but additional Federal support is required to \nmake this technology financially viable. We need expanded Federal \nresearch and development grants as well as increased tax incentives and \nFederal loan guarantees to make cellulosic ethanol a viable replacement \nfor gasoline. The Federal Government must do its part first to develop \nthese technologies so that they will then in turn be within reach of \nthe American public.\n  One more point. The burden of higher energy prices is not being \nshared equally. To the contrary, it is falling hardest upon those who \ncan least afford it. Large oil companies are reaping record profits at \nthe expense of the average American who ultimately bears the full \nburden of these price increases. At the same time that average \nAmericans are having to devote a greater and greater portion of their \nincome to pay for basic necessities, such as gasoline, household \nutilities, and food, the major oil companies are reporting record \nprofits, and their executives are taking home annual paychecks of \nhundreds of millions of dollars. Many of these profits have been \ngenerated without any additional investments into energy production. \nRather, these companies have seen their profits rise with the flood of \nspeculation. What is a high tide of profits for the oil companies, \nthough, is a tsunami that is overwhelming millions of Americans.\n  And what are these oil companies doing with these record profits? Are \nthey investing in new technologies? The answer is that the oil \ncompanies are not increasing their exploration and development \ninvestments by nearly as much as their profits are increasing. Instead, \nthey are devoting large amounts of their profits to acquiring other \ncompanies and buying back their own shares. On May 1 of this year, the \nWall Street Journal reported that in the first quarter of 2008 \nExxonMobil spent $8 billion to buy back company shares, which ``boosted \nper-share earnings to stratospheric levels,'' whereas it spent less on \nexploration and actually reduced oil production.\n  For these reasons, we need to institute a windfall profits tax on the \noil companies. We should incentivize big oil companies to invest their \nwindfall profits into things that will increase our own domestic energy \nproduction by reducing the amount of the tax for such investments. If \nthey don't make these investments, a portion of that profit should be \nrecouped by the public to help offset the outrageous prices they are \nfacing at the pump.\n  I have supported a windfall profits tax numerous times when we have \nvoted on it in the Senate. The Consumer-First Energy Act imposes a 25 \npercent tax on windfall profits of the major oil companies. Windfall \nprofits invested to boost domestic energy supplies would be exempt from \nthe tax, which would encourage investments in renewable facilities and \nthe production of renewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. It \nwould also encourage oil companies to increase their domestic refinery \ncapacity. Proceeds from the tax would be put toward measures to reduce \nthe burdens of rising energy costs and increase our energy independence \nand security.\n  Mr. President, let me summarize. Skyrocketing energy prices are tying \nour already weak economy in knots and causing financial pain to working \nfamilies throughout this country. Congress cannot just stand by. We \nshould act now to stop the pain.\n  Immediate steps include putting the cop back on the beat in our \nenergy markets, strengthening our access to key oil trading data in \nLondon, fixing the key NYMEX crude oil contract, stopping the senseless \nfilling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, investing in advanced \nvehicle technologies and alternative energy sources, and imposing a \nwindfall profits tax on the oil companies. Longer range steps include \nfixing the fiscal policies undermining the strength of the U.S. dollar, \nincluding by eliminating tax cuts for the wealthiest among us, reducing \nthe $12 billion a month spending that is taking place in Iraq, closing \nthe tax loopholes such as the use of tax havens to avoid payment of \ntaxes to Uncle Sam. Those tax havens and that loophole that allows the \nuse of those havens is costing the Treasury in the range of $100 \nbillion a year. We can fight back against exorbitantly high energy \nprices, but it will take all of our energy and determination to do it.\n\n                Summary of Oil Trading Transparency Act\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       The Levin-Feinstein Oil Trading Transparency Act would \n     direct the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to \n     ensure that any foreign exchange operating a trading terminal \n     in the United States for the trading of a U.S. energy \n     commodity meets two regulatory requirements that already \n     apply to U.S. exchanges: (1) imposition of speculative \n     trading limits to prevent price\n\n[[Page S4001]]\n\n     manipulation and excessive speculation, and (2) the mandatory \n     daily publication of trading information from the exchange to \n     ensure market transparency. The bill would also require the \n     CFTC to obtain information from the foreign exchange to \n     enable it to determine how much trading in U.S. energy \n     commodities is due to speculation.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       Currently, a key foreign exchange (ICE Futures Europe) that \n     recently began trading trades futures contracts for crude oil \n     produced in the United States is allowed by the CTFC to \n     operate trading terminals in the United States.\n       ICE Futures Europe is owned by the Intercontinental \n     Exchange (ICE), a U.S. company based in Atlanta, Georgia, \n     which also operates the largest electronic energy trading \n     platform in the United States outside of the NYMEX exchange \n     in New York.\n       ICE Futures Europe trades two types of crude oil, Brent \n     crude oil produced in the North Sea, and West Texas \n     Intermediate (WTI) crude oil produced in the United States. \n     It is the only foreign exchange that trades U.S. crude oil. \n     ICE Futures Europe bases the settlement price of its WTI \n     contract price on the settlement price of the WTI contract \n     traded on the NYMEX exchange, so the price of both WTI \n     futures contracts are virtually identical.\n       For a number of years the CFTC has allowed ICE Futures \n     Europe to operate trading terminals in the United States. At \n     first, only Brent contracts could be traded on U.S. \n     terminals, but in 2006 ICE began trading WTI contracts in \n     London. This 2006 development allowed U.S. traders to trade \n     WTI futures contracts in London as well as in New York. This \n     means that crude oil produced and used in the United States \n     can be traded by U.S. traders on an exchange that is beyond \n     the reach of U.S. regulators. Approximately 30 to 40% of WTI \n     futures trades--which are key to setting U.S. oil prices--now \n     occur in London, beyond U.S. oversight.\n       Although the CFTC has a data sharing agreement with the \n     U.K. regulatory authority, the Financial Services Authority \n     (FSA), to obtain trading data from the London exchange, the \n     FSA does not collect or provide data that would enable the \n     CFTC to determine how much WTI futures trading is due to \n     speculation. Absent this information, CFTC weekly reports on \n     speculation in U.S. crude oil futures are incomplete and \n     inaccurate. The FSA also does not impose position limits on \n     traders to limit speculative trading. The absence of these \n     position limits means that a U.S. trader can avoid U.S. oil \n     speculation limits on U.S. exchanges simply by routing its \n     trades through London.\n       The bill would correct these market deficiencies by \n     disallowing the operation of foreign exchange terminals in \n     the United States, unless the foreign exchange meets \n     comparable requirements for market transparency and \n     speculative limits as now apply in the United States.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is so important that we as Members \nof the Senate, Members of the Congress, are on the floor discussing the \nNo. 1 issue--the No. 1 domestic issue certainly in the minds of \nAmericans--and that is the price of energy. The folks back home want to \nknow: What are you going to do to fix it? What is the Congress going to \ndo?\n  Tomorrow we are going to have an opportunity to vote on a couple of \ndifferent proposals. I rise this afternoon in support of the passage of \nthe American Energy Production Act. This is a comprehensive energy bill \nthat was introduced last week by the ranking member of the Energy \nCommittee, Senator Domenici.\n  Americans are at a point where I think their patience is wearing \nthin, their frustration is showing, but it goes beyond just \nfrustration. I think it is fair to say that many across the country are \nin true economic distress over the prices they are paying now for \ngasoline, for their home heating oil, many for their natural gas that \nthey are seeing coming into their home and, unfortunately, the \nprognosis for the future doesn't look much more consoling to the \nconsumer. All estimates indicate these prices will continue to rise in \nthe future.\n  Look at some of the events of last week in terms of what was \nhappening around the world. The rebel disturbances in Nigeria, concerns \nabout the relations with Iran and production disruptions over there, \nproduction disruptions in Iraq--all of this plus many other factors, \nincluding the price of the dollar, and what is happening with the \nChinese and Indian economies in terms of additional consumers coming \non. So many of these factors keep driving the price of oil to the point \nwhere last week's closing crude oil price topped out at $126, down to \n$125 per barrel over the weekend. That hike in price is going to \ncontinue to drive the retail prices for refined product even higher, \nabove the $3.62 national average for unleaded regular we reached last \nweek; 52 cents higher than last year.\n  Talking to the folks back home, it is literally one horror story \nafter another in terms of what people are paying. I know there are many \nplaces in the country today where fuel is hovering right at $4 a \ngallon, but in Alaska we are looking at prices that are much higher \nthan that. In Athaca, fuel was costing $8.65 a gallon last week. This \nis about a dollar higher than the folks there were paying last year. \nThey are used to paying high prices, but I am here to tell you 8 bucks \nand 65 cents a gallon is really high. In the community of Kiana, it is \n$6.25 a gallon. It is exactly $1 higher than they paid last year. At \nthese prices, Alaskans and all Americans are having great difficulty \nmaking ends meet. Americans need relief from high fuel prices and they \nare asking for it now.\n  I have so many opportunities, coming from a State such as Alaska that \nis a producing State, a lot of opportunities to talk about how we can \nproduce more as a nation. But I also am very insistent when we talk \nabout an energy policy for this country that we also focus on promoting \nenergy conservation, we also focus on greater energy efficiency and \ndeveloping the alternative energy so critical for this Nation.\n  But we also have to make sure when we talk about an energy policy, we \nrecognize there are different components. I liken it to a three-legged \nstool. You have the conservation and efficiency, you have the \nrenewables and alternatives, but you also have increased production and \nincreased production in traditional energy sources that are done in an \nenvironmentally sensitive manner.\n  The amendment Senator Domenici has introduced, the American Energy \nProduction Act, does that in many ways. It proposes to open a couple \nthousand acres, 2,000 acres--I don't come from a farming State \nnecessarily, but my colleagues from South Dakota and some of the big \nfarm States tell me that 2,000 acres is pretty much the size of a small \nfarm there--of the Arctic Coastal Plain to oil and gas development. We \nbelieve this area, the 1002 area of ANWR, is the site with likely the \nlargest onshore oil and gas deposits left in North America. We know if \nwe were to act today to open ANWR tomorrow, it is not going to bring \nnew North Slope oil to the markets tomorrow, but it will affect the \npsychology of the oil markets. It will show that America is getting \nserious--finally getting serious--about producing the 40 billion \nbarrels of oil and the hundreds of trillions of cubic feet of natural \ngas we believe exist in the current moratoria areas.\n  I think we need to recognize--and so many of my colleagues have \nstated this already on the floor--ANWR is about the long term. I can't \ntell my colleagues how many times I have heard on this floor: If we had \nonly opened ANWR 10 years ago when President Clinton vetoed it, we \nwould have that pipeline today. That pipeline would now be full instead \nof half full as we currently see it. But ANWR is about the bridge, if \nyou will. It is a bridge to an energy future that can get us to the \nalternatives and to the renewables we keep talking about, and those who \nare so focused on making sure we have a solid environment and a solid \nenvironmental base. This is what so many of my Democratic colleagues \nare talking about. We need to get to the future of energy, which I \nagree is absolutely the alternatives and the renewables. But you can't \nflip a switch and have this Nation powered 100 percent by wind or solar \nor geothermal or ocean energy. We have to allow for that transition, \nand ANWR, the oil from ANWR, can help us to do that.\n  We have had many hearings in the Energy Committee on the issue of \nproduction. But earlier this year we heard from witnesses who said the \ncurrent runup in world oil prices is due to so many of the factors I \nmentioned a few minutes ago; clearly, the hike in world demand for oil \nis led by China and by India; what is happening with the weakening of \nthe U.S. dollar, which is used to pay for all of the oil sales; and oil \nbecoming the new gold--a commodity of interest to investors because of \nthe tightness of the world supplies.\n\n[[Page S4002]]\n\n  Essentially, what it comes down to--so much of the discussion we are \ntalking about--is supply and demand. I suggest that as we look to all \nthese factors that are influencing price right now, one of the ways we \ncan deal with that, one of the ways we can tell the American consumer \nwe are working on this is to produce more energy from non-OPEC nations, \nto help increase our global supplies, and to help drive down world \nprices.\n  Robert Samuelson, a columnist, said in a column, which I will submit \nfor the Record, that we need to exert long-term influence on the global \nbalance of supply and demand for energy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the column be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Start Drilling\n\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       What to do about oil? First it went from $60 to $80 a \n     barrel, then from $80 to $100 and now to $120. Perhaps we can \n     persuade OPEC to raise production, as some senators suggest; \n     but this seems unlikely. The truth is that we're almost \n     powerless to influence today's prices. We are because we \n     didn't take sensible actions 10 or 20 years ago. If we \n     persist, we will be even worse off in a decade or two. The \n     first thing to do: Start drilling.\n       It may surprise Americans to discover that the United \n     States is the third-largest oil producer, behind Saudi Arabia \n     and Russia. We could be producing more, but Congress has put \n     large areas of potential supply off-limits. These include the \n     Atlantic and Pacific coasts and parts of Alaska and the Gulf \n     of Mexico. By government estimates, these areas may contain \n     25 billion to 30 billion barrels of oil (against about 30 \n     billion barrels of proven U.S. reserves today) and 80 \n     trillion cubic feet or more of natural gas (compared with \n     about 200 tcf of proven reserves).\n       What keeps these areas closed are exaggerated environmental \n     fears, strong prejudice against oil companies and sheer \n     stupidity. Americans favor both ``energy independence'' and \n     cheap fuel. They deplore imports--who wants to pay \n     foreigners?--but oppose more production in the United States. \n     Got it? The result is a ``no-pain energy agenda that sounds \n     appealing but has no basis in reality,'' writes Robert Bryce \n     in ``Gusher of Lies: The Dangerous Delusions of `Energy \n     Independence.' ''\n       Unsurprisingly, all three major presidential candidates \n     tout ``energy independence.'' This reflects either ignorance \n     (unlikely) or pandering (probable). The United States imports \n     about 60 percent of its oil, up from 42 percent in 1990. \n     We'll import lots more for the foreseeable future. The world \n     uses 86 million barrels of oil a day, up from 67 mbd in 1990. \n     The basic cause of exploding prices is that advancing demand \n     has virtually exhausted the world's surplus production \n     capacity, says analyst Douglas MacIntyre of the Energy \n     Information Administration. Combined with a stingy OPEC, the \n     result is predictable: Any unexpected rise in demand or \n     threat to supply triggers higher prices.\n       The best we can do is to try to exert long-term influence \n     on the global balance of supply and demand. Increase our \n     supply. Restrain our demand. With luck, this might widen the \n     worldwide surplus of production capacity. Producers would \n     have less power to exact ever-higher prices, because there \n     would be more competition among them to sell. OPEC loses some \n     leverage; its members cheat. Congress took a small step last \n     year by increasing fuel economy standards for new cars and \n     light trucks from 25 to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. (And \n     yes, we need a gradually rising fuel tax to create a strong \n     market for more-efficient vehicles.)\n       Increasing production also is important. Output from older \n     fields, including Alaska's North Slope, is declining. \n     Although production from restricted areas won't make the \n     United States self-sufficient, it might stabilize output or \n     even reduce imports. No one knows exactly what's in these \n     areas, because the exploratory work is old. Estimates \n     indicate that production from the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge might equal almost 5 percent of present U.S. oil use.\n       Members of Congress complain loudly about high oil profits \n     ($40.6 billion for Exxon Mobil last year) but frustrate those \n     companies' desire to use those profits to explore and produce \n     in the United States. Getting access to oil elsewhere is \n     increasingly difficult. Governments own three-quarters or \n     more of proven reserves. Perversely, higher prices discourage \n     other countries from approving new projects. Flush with oil \n     revenue, countries have less need to expand production. \n     Undersupply and high prices then feed on each other.\n       But it's hard for the United States to complain that other \n     countries limit access to their reserves when we're doing the \n     same. If higher U.S. production reduced world prices, other \n     countries might expand production. What they couldn't get \n     from prices they'd try to get from greater sales.\n       On environmental grounds, the alternatives to more drilling \n     are usually worse. Subsidies for ethanol made from corn have \n     increased food prices and used scarce water, with few \n     benefits. If oil is imported, it's vulnerable to tanker \n     spills. By contrast, local production is probably safer. \n     There were 4,000 platforms operating in the Gulf of Mexico \n     when hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit. Despite extensive \n     damage, there were no major spills, says Robbie Diamond of \n     Securing America's Future Energy, an advocacy group.\n       Perhaps oil prices will drop when some long-delayed \n     projects begin production or if demand slackens. But the \n     basic problem will remain. Though dependent on foreign oil, \n     we might conceivably curb the power of foreign producers. But \n     this is not a task of a month or a year. It is a task of \n     decades; new production projects take that long. If we don't \n     start now, our future dependence and its dangers will grow. \n     Count on it.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. That means we have to actually produce more energy in \nthis country. How do you get from here to there in increased energy \nproduction?\n  I wish to take a few minutes this afternoon and talk about ANWR. ANWR \nhas 10 billion to 16 billion barrels of economically recoverable oil, \naccording to the USGS estimates, and 10 trillion cubic feet of natural \ngas. We recognize that, by itself, that infusion into the energy market \nis not going to change the world's energy equation. But pair it with \nthe other things we are talking about in this energy legislation \nSenator Domenici introduced and pair it with the additional barrels \nthat could come from OCS development in current moratoria areas, and \nthe 80 to 100 trillion cubic of natural gas there, and pair it with the \nfuel from coal-to-liquids development and the oil from U.S. oil shale \ndeposits. Together, all these can start to break the stranglehold OPEC \nhas on us and help to lower the prices.\n  Now, back to ANWR. I had said that--and I have said this throughout \nmy public life--if opening ANWR was going to come at the expense of our \nenvironment and our wildlife, I would have to oppose it. But we have \ntechnology we have utilized up north in the past 30 years, since we \nhave been in active production pulling oil from the North Slope, that \nhas truly revolutionized what happens in the Arctic when it comes to \ndevelopment of our resources.\n  This chart is a New York Times science chart. It is essentially \noutlining some of the latest drilling technology in an effort to reduce \nenvironmental damage from the oil drilling. Directional drilling. It \nused to be that you would sink your drilling rig and drill straight \ndown. Under the new directional drilling, what you are literally able \nto do is you sink it but you ``spider'' out, or ``spaghetti'' out \nunderneath the surface. And you can take this in a direction of up to \nalmost 8 miles in every direction around you, with no disturbance to \nthe surface. So you don't see what is going on down below the caribou \nthat are wandering around and are oblivious to the activity up top. But \nit is a technique that is in place in the Arctic that helps to \nliterally provide about 100 square miles of habitat for the caribou and \nmusk oxen that are between the well pads.\n  This technology has made the difference for us not only in Alaska in \nArctic conditions but truly as we develop our technology for oil \nexploration around the country. It is difficult to see a lot of the \ndescriptions on this chart, so I will use other maps to show you the \nice roads, the pads on the ground, how you utilize a crossing over a \nriver, the 3D seismic technology, how we have been able to reduce the \nwell pads paths.\n  Initially, when drilling in the 1970s, the well pads were about 13 \nacres in size. Through the use of this technology, you can limit that \nfootprint to about 5 acres. I wish to show you a picture of how we \ntravel across the tundra so we don't disturb it, you don't see man's \nfootprint or the trucks that are going over it. This is a composite mat \nthat is literally laid on top of the tundra in the summer months, so \nyou don't damage the fragile tundra below. Look at a picture of the ice \nroads. We do not explore in the summer months. Exploring is in the \nwintertime. This is a picture of exploratory drilling in Alpine in the \nwinter. You will see around the exploration site--you cannot see the \nice road from here, but there are no roads around this. There are no \nroads that will take you to this site. The way you get there is you \nbuild out roads on the ice. It is like a big Zamboni machine making an \nice road that will take you across the tundra in the wintertime only--\nyou cannot go out there during the summer--and lay down the\n\n[[Page S4003]]\n\nice road, so when summertime comes, you have this.\n  This is Alpine during the summer months. The photo is grainy, and I \napologize for the quality of it. You can see you don't have any roads \nthat lead to the exploration site in the tundra there. This is a \npicture that was taken in the fall. This white box is the well site \nthat is awaiting actual development.\n  We have a picture of rendezvous well No. 2. This is located in the \nNational Petroleum Reserve Alaska. This is done in the winter. You can \nsee this is the ice road I am talking about, which literally goes 4 \nmiles, connecting this site to a road system miles away. We have a \npicture of the same site. This is in the summer, the same site. We have \ncapped off and removed the rig. So the first one was the exploration, \nand then once the exploration is complete, they cap it off. There is no \nsign of impact to the area except for this ``Christmas tree'' valve \nstem that can be removed if, in fact, there is no production that is \never likely in that area.\n  Again, you may look at this and say: How do you get there? We get \nthere because we are utilizing techniques that allow us and require us \nto protect the environment, so the impact is as minimal as absolutely \npossible.\n  The last picture I wish to put up in this series is this one. \nEveryone talks about the caribou. I think no picture of ANWR is \ncomplete unless we have a picture of the caribou wandering around at \nPoint McIntyre Field while drilling is underway. The caribou--the \nwildlife--have learned to coexist with the level of development that \ngoes on in the area there.\n  Again, I think it is important to point out we have gotten smart over \nthe past 30 years. We figured out how to utilize technology so we can \ngain access to a resource, while at the same time preserving and \nprotecting an area, a part of the country that we know is fragile. That \ntundra is fragile territory, and we have to treat it right, with \nrespect, and be able to allow a level of subsistence harvest for the \nNatives who live up there and live off the land. We have to figure out \nhow we balance it. We have worked very hard to do that.\n  The chairman of the Energy Committee, a colleague for whom I have a \ngreat deal of respect and who has worked very hard on so many energy \nissues spoke a little while ago, and he made the point that to the west \nof the Prudoe fields, and to the south, we have an area that is known \nas the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. His point was, why do we need \nto open ANWR if we have all this area that is potentially available for \noil exploration and development? There are a couple things going on \nwith NPRA. It is a huge area. It is larger than the ANWR area itself. \nAs a consequence, the pockets of oil--the areas that would be conducive \nfor exploration and drilling--are further from the infrastructure, the \nexisting pipelines. So that adds enormous costs to already very \nexpensive operations up north.\n  You also have some very environmentally sensitive areas in the NPRA, \naround the Shirukak Lake, where you have a great deal of waterfowl that \ncome through. So we are sensitive to making sure we are not disrupting, \nto the furthest extent possible, the wildlife, the waterfowl. That, \ntoo, is a point of concern. We also recognize the potential in ANWR for \ngreater intensity, in terms of the oil finds, is that much more real. \nIt is estimated that in ANWR we could get approximately 6,860 barrels \nper acre as opposed to only 480 barrels per acre in the NPRA. Those are \nfactors to consider when we are talking about NPRA and ANWR.\n  I think it is helpful to put up a map of ANWR, so people can put it \ninto context. The ANWR portion of this bill limits exploration to 2,000 \nacres of the 19.6 million acres of wildlife refuge. This is just one \n10,000th of 1 percent of the refuge. It allows the establishment of \ncritical habitat zones. It requires the use of the best commercially \navailable technology to produce the oil, no matter what the cost is to \nthe company. We believe, truly, this new technology can limit the \nenvironmental impact in the north.\n  Look at what we are talking about, the refuge itself. When people \ntalk about ANWR, some might get the impression we are talking about \ndeveloping in all of the wildlife refuge, all the 19.6 million acres. \nThat is incorrect. The area we are talking about developing is within \nthe ANWR Coastal Plain. That acreage is 1.5 million acres. Still, look \nat what you have within the refuge. You have a wilderness area, which \nhas absolutely no development of anything at all, 8.5 million acres \nthat is fully established in the wilderness area. In the balance is \nabout 10 million acres and it is the refuge area. So this is the area--\nthe 1002 we are talking about opening for potential exploration and \ndevelopment. Of that, this tiny little red dot on this map represents \n2,000 acres out of the 1.5 million acres. So it is important to put \nthat into context.\n  We have not had the ANWR debate in some months, so I think it is \nalways nice to refresh people's memories of what ANWR is. You will \nnotice ANWR itself is about the size of the State of South Carolina. We \nare talking big territory here.\n  The amendment that was offered by Senator Domenici and members of the \nEnergy Committee does more than just open ANWR. ANWR is not the sole \nanswer to the high price of oil. ANWR is not the sole answer to a \nbalanced energy policy. ANWR is just one piece of that puzzle.\n  The amendment also permits revenue sharing with States that decide to \nallow OCS development off their coastlines. For the States that do not \nwant it, this also provides new moratoria powers to prevent drilling, \npowers that could be gone in just 4 years. This is actually a plus for \nthose who are somewhat concerned about OCS development off their coast.\n  With the new technology we have, the old fears of well blowouts from \noffshore development should be satisfied. The fear of subsea pipeline \nleaks should be alleviated by the performances we saw in the Gulf of \nMexico during Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma in 2005, category 5 \nhurricanes, which resulted in no major spills. The fear of water \ncontamination by drilling rigs should be resolved since nontoxic \nchemicals can now be used.\n  The amendment also removes the moratorium that is imposed on oil \nshale production in the West. There is great new technology that \npermits production from in situ piping, not requiring open-pit mining \nof the oil shale. We recognize we have so much oil shale in this \ncountry. They say America is the Saudi Arabia of oil shale, holding 2 \ntrillion barrels of potential oil production.\n  Also, the provision in the legislation regarding coal-to-liquids sets \na goal of America producing 6 billion gallons of such fuels by 2022, \none-sixth of what we theoretically will produce from biofuel by then. \nBut it requires that the fuel not produce more life-cycle carbon \nemissions than gasoline and allows for waivers to protect the \nenvironment. Given that Alaska alone holds the world's largest \npotential coal deposit and that America contains about 60 percent of \nthe world's total reserves of coal, it is vital that we find some way \nto utilize the fuel. Coal is the only fossil fuel we can develop where \nwe know we have the technology currently to capture and store any \ncarbon produced and to keep it out of the atmosphere.\n  We believe that bill could produce another 24 billion barrels of \noil--enough to meet our Nation's total needs for 5 years. That will \ndampen world prices. But if we don't take these steps, we will continue \nto be in this exact same position of being held hostage by the world's \noil cartel for decades until we have new alternative technologies. We \nhave to stop letting ourselves be held over the proverbial barrel by \nthe world's nationally owned oil companies.\n  We understand in this country that there is no good reason, with our \ntechnology, our environmental advancements, not to be producing more of \nthe energy that it needs.\n  I do want to add a caveat because I have been talking about ANWR, \noffshore, and coal-to-liquids, that by passing this amendment, it does \nnot mean we shouldn't move full speed ahead to promote noncarbon-\nemitting nuclear power, that we shouldn't do everything possible to \nproduce more power from wind, biomass, hydropower, solar, geothermal, \nocean energy, and all the other technologies. We need them all. What it \ndoes mean is America will finally show the world that we are willing to \ndo our part in meeting our energy needs.\n\n[[Page S4004]]\n\n  There used to be a mantra, if you will, that nations should think \nglobally but act locally. In this country, we should produce more of \nthe energy we consume rather than expect other nations to supply it to \nus. We have the ability to reduce our dependency on imported energy \nsources. We just need to get on doing it. I think this amendment will \nhelp us cut our prices now, but especially looking out for the long \nterm, help us to avoid higher prices for the years to come.\n  Over the weekend, I was reading through the local columnists in the \nAnchorage paper. One guy had it right. He said: I think the Republicans \nneed to be more supportive of alternatives and renewables, the \nDemocrats need to be more supportive of increased domestic production, \nand the American consumer needs to just conserve more. Sounds like \npretty sage and wise advice to me.\n  With all of those components--increased domestic production, focus on \nthe future of energy, which is renewables and alternatives, and focus \non conservation and efficiency--we have ourselves the start of a pretty \ngood energy policy for this country.\n  I appreciate the time of my colleagues. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/12/senate-section/article/S4004-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4004-S4005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NOMINATION OF JUDGE ROBERT CONRAD\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, anniversaries are usually a time of joy, a \ntime to celebrate, a time to remember happy occasions in one's life. \nThis weekend, my sons celebrated Mother's Day with my wife, their mom, \nBrooke. Many know this is the 100th anniversary of Mother's Day.\n  Speaking of their mom, she and I will celebrate our 26th wedding \nanniversary this August. It is an anniversary that is very special, and \nit is something I intend to celebrate every day.\n  But today we mark an anniversary that is more troubling than \ncelebratory. Today marks the 300th day since Judge Robert Conrad was \nnominated to serve on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals--the 300th \nday. Judge Conrad was nominated in July 2007. It has been almost a \nyear, and he still has yet to receive a hearing from the Judiciary \nCommittee. Advise and consent. I don't think it said 300-plus days; it \nsays advise and consent.\n  This is an anniversary of which I personally am not quite proud and, \nquite frankly, of which the Senate should be ashamed. We are telling \nthe American people we are unable to fulfill one of the most important \nresponsibilities for which they elect us as Senators. We are telling \nthe American people that we cannot follow through with our \nconstitutional responsibility of advise and consent on Federal judges.\n  I am not going to spend my time today pointing fingers and placing \nblame on one party or another. That would be a waste of everybody's \ntime. I am here for quite the opposite reason. We need to encourage our \nfellow colleagues to better utilize our limited time left in this \nCongress and start confirming judges to the bench.\n  The unfortunate reality is that our Federal bench is suffering and, \nmost importantly, vacancies on the bench hurt the American people. I \nhave often said there is no area of daily life that is not affected by \njudges. Judges make decisions every day that have a long-lasting and \nsignificant impact on the entirety of the American people.\n  Unfortunately, our society has become so extremely comfortable with, \nif not aggressive about, filing lawsuits, and we must try to reduce \nthat problem in and of itself. But in the meantime, we need to fill \nthese lingering vacancies in order to give judges on the bench the help \nthey desperately need to adjudicate their rapidly increasing caseloads.\n  Today, we have a great opportunity for this Congress to stop pointing \nfingers, to stop placing blame, and reverse the dreadful trend of \nunderperformance on Federal judges. I encourage my colleagues to rise \nabove the bickering and come to an understanding that confirming judges \nshould be about legal qualifications and experience.\n  Judge Bob Conrad now waits for the 300th day for his nomination for a \njudiciary hearing. He is clearly qualified to serve on the Fourth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. It is almost impossible to think of a more \nqualified candidate. He has an excellent reputation as a knowledgeable \nand fair district court judge from the Western District of North \nCarolina.\n  Bob has twice--twice--been confirmed by the Senate, once in 2001 to \nbecome U.S. attorney and once in 2005 to be a U.S. district court \njudge--a candidate that has been confirmed by this body twice who \ncannot even get a Judiciary Committee hearing.\n\n  Bob received a unanimous--let me repeat that--a unanimous ``well \nqualified'' rating by the American Bar Association. Not every nominee \nreceives a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating.\n  Bob's nomination to the Fourth Circuit Court has been endorsed by the \nCharlotte Observer, the Asheville Citizen-Times, and the Charleston \nPost and Courier. It is not the papers keeping him out of office; it is \nthe Senate and, specifically, the Judiciary Committee.\n  Judge Conrad's nomination is also extremely important to North \nCarolina. My home State must get more representation on the Fourth \nCircuit Court. Our State has just one seated judge, even though we are \nthe most populous State in the circuit.\n  Judge Conrad has been nominated to the Fourth Circuit Court seat. \nThis is a seat that has been vacant for 14 years. Let me say that \nagain. This is a judicial seat that has been vacant for 14 years. This \nSenate cannot fulfill its obligations to put a judge on this bench. It \nis now a judicial emergency by the Administrative Office of the Courts.\n  I could continue to list Judge Conrad's outstanding credentials and \nqualifications and, more importantly, why it is critical that he be \nconfirmed to the Fourth Circuit Court, but really, this distinguished \nbody could use a little less talk and a little more action. It is time \nto act on this nomination. It is time to give Judge Conrad a hearing \nand a vote on the Senate floor. He has been waiting patiently for over \n300 days, and that is inexcusable.\n  Some may think they are helping their political party by blocking \nqualified Presidential nominees from being considered for the Federal \nbench, but what they are really hurting is our country and the American \npeople. It is not just 1 or 2 of us or 100 U.S. Senators who suffer \nfrom this lack of progress, it is all of us.\n  I remind all of my colleagues that they should not celebrate this \n300-day anniversary; they should act on it, they should act to get Bob \nConrad a hearing and to get him a vote on the Senate floor. I ask my \ncolleagues to do this for Judge Conrad, but, more importantly, do it \nfor the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, along with my \ncolleague, to speak on the pending nomination of Robert J. Conrad, but \nI also wish to speak about the nomination of Thomas Alvin Farr to be a \ndistrict court judge in the Eastern District of North Carolina.\n  As my great friend and colleague, Senator Burr from North Carolina, \nhas pointed out, these nominations have reached a number of troublesome \nand frustrating milestones in the past few weeks. Bob Conrad has now \nbeen waiting more than 300 days--300 days--for a hearing, and Tom \nFarr's nomination has languished for a nearly unprecedented duration of \nover 500 days--500 days--without a hearing. In fact, he now holds the \nunenviable distinction of being the longest current pending district \ncourt nominee.\n  Bob Conrad and Tom Farr have both received the American Bar \nAssociation's highest rating of unanimously ``well qualified'' and \nstill they await a hearing.\n  Bob Conrad and Tom Farr have the full support of their home State \nSenators. Both of their blue slips were long ago returned, and still \nthey await a hearing.\n  The Eastern District seat to which Tom is nominated and the Fourth \nCircuit seat to which Bob Conrad has been nominated have been declared \njudicial emergencies by the Judicial Conference. I would add that North \nCarolina, the most populous State in the Circuit, has historically been \nsignificantly underrepresented on the court and presently can claim \nonly one judge, the Honorable Allyson Duncan,\n\n[[Page S4005]]\n\nwhen we should have four or five. And still, these accomplished and \ncapable candidates continue to wait hundreds of days without receiving \na hearing.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont, has taken time to meet both Tom Farr and Bob Conrad, and \nwe thank him for the courtesy. Despite the chairman's having met these \ntwo thoughtful and impressive men, having heard them pledge their \ncommitment to the law and its impartial administration, they have faced \ninaction by the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n  Tom Farr and Bob Conrad are two of the most distinguished and \nrespected legal professionals in the State of North Carolina. For his \npart, Tom graduated at the top of his class, summa cum laude from \nHillsdale College, and went on to receive his J.D. from Emory \nUniversity and his Masters of Law in Labor from the Georgetown \nUniversity Law Center. Tom spent a year as the late U.S. Senator John \nEast's Labor Committee Counsel. He also has clerked for Judge Frank \nBullock of North Carolina's Middle District; served as an Adjunct \nProfessor of Labor and Employment Law; chaired the Magistrate Judge \nMerit Selection Committee in North Carolina's Eastern District; and is \na permanent member of the Fourth Circuit Judicial Conference.\n  Tom Farr has spent the majority of his career practicing employment \nlaw in Raleigh with two of our State's most important law firms. \nRecognized as a leader in his practice area, Tom has been selected as a \nTop 100 Super Lawyer for 2 years running by his colleagues and as \n``Legal Elite'' for 5 years running by Business North Carolina. He is \nlisted in the Martindale Hubbell Law Directory, the listing of the \ncountry's leading attorneys, and has maintained their preeminent \nranking for more than a decade.\n  And regarding the impressive qualifications of Judge Bob Conrad, he \nis a magna cum laude graduate of Clemson University and received his \nlaw degree from the University of Virginia. His career and credentials \nare known to many in this body. The Senate confirmed him by a \nnoncontroversial voice vote as a Judge in North Carolina's Western \nDistrict, and he has served since 2006 as that court's chief judge. Bob \nConrad is recognized as a judge and judicial scholar of the first order \nby the attorneys who appear before him and the judges with whom he \nworks.\n  Indeed, both the Conrad and Farr nominations are supported by a wide \narray of their colleagues, both Republican and Democrat, many of whom \nhave written the chairman to express their support for these nominees \nand belief in their fitness for the Federal judiciary.\n  In this body, we often speak of judicial nominations in terms of \nnumbers: Number of nominees confirmed; number of days pending. And \nwhile these numbers are important, let us not lose sight of the fact \nthat these nominees are real people with careers and families; real \npeople who have made sacrifices in those careers, in time spent with \nthose families, all for the opportunity to serve their country as a \nFederal judge. Yes, appointment to these high offices is an honor \nrepresenting the entrustment of an awesome responsibility. And the \nSenate's constitutional duty of advice and consent is not to be \ndischarged lightly. But our duty must be discharged by allowing an up \nor down vote on these nominees.\n  I ask my colleagues to move forward and bring some measure of relief \nto the people of North Carolina's Eastern District and the Fourth \nCircuit. It is a simple and reasonable request. And action on the \nnominations of Tom Farr and Bob Conrad is long overdue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am going to speak about energy and \nrespond to a couple of things I heard on the Senate floor and talk \nabout what we are going to be doing tomorrow. But first let me say I \nfinished 2 hours of chairing a Democratic policy committee hearing in \nwhich three people testified: two previously serving with the U.S. \nState Department in the country of Iraq, and one, Major General Nash, \nwho has a great deal of experience internationally.\n  I come away from that hearing after listening 2 hours to some very \npatriotic Americans, Judge Brennan and Mr. Mattil, who talked about \ntheir experience working for the State Department in Baghdad.\n  What I heard was unbelievable--almost unbelievable. They were there \nto try to be supportive of the anticorruption efforts that were \nunderway by our Government and by Judge Radhi al-Radhi, who headed the \nCommission on Public Integrity in the country of Iraq. What they told \nme makes me almost furious.\n  They told me our State Department--yes, our State Department here in \nthe United States--did everything they could to undermine the efforts \nof Judge al-Radhi and the Commission on Public Integrity and the \nsection in the State Department that was in Iraq trying to root out \ncorruption and support those who were engaged in anticorruption \nactivity. Billions and billions of dollars have literally been stolen. \nThe witnesses today who worked for our State Department in Iraq told us \nmoney that has gone through the hands of the Iraqi Ministries, an \nunbelievably corrupt government, ends up in the hands, among other \nplaces, of the insurgents, which then fuels the war against our \nsoldiers. Our State Department, they say in testimony--and I encourage \npeople to write to us and get a copy of this testimony--they say our \nGovernment and those in charge in Baghdad not only did nothing about \nit, but tried--because the Iraq Government, full of corrupt Ministries, \nwas upset with the Commission on Public Integrity investigating them--\nit was our Government that decided to be helpful to throw Judge al-\nRadhi out of that country.\n  This is a man whom they tried to kill. They didn't like him \ninvestigating corruption in Iraq so they tried to kill him. Yet our \nGovernment paved the way for the Iraqi Government to get rid of him, to \nthrow him out of the country.\n  On Thursday of this week we are going to write a bill in the \nAppropriations Committee. I believe the President asks for $172 \nbillion--that is with a ``b''--$172 billion additional, mostly for the \nwar in Iraq and Afghanistan. The question is, how much of that $127 \nbillion going through our Defense Department and then coming into the \nIraqi Ministries, how much of that is going to be wasted? How much of \nthat is going to stick in the hands of corrupt officials in the country \nof Iraq?\n  If we could dye that money purple and track it through those who \nstuff it in their pockets in Iraqi Ministries and then pass it along to \nthe insurgents as part of the take, who would we see stealing this \nmoney from the American taxpayers, and who would we see undermining the \nwork, every day, of soldiers in Iraq?\n  We can't leave the country of Iraq, we are told by this \nadministration, until there is stability. There is not going to be \nstability until we address the issue of corruption. As long as we will \nturn a blind eye to corruption--which two people from the State \nDepartment who worked in Iraq told us today--as long as we turn a blind \neye to corruption, which has been done; as long as we betray--yes, \nbetray--those who were standing up in Iraq and risking their lives to \nget rid of corruption, we don't stand a chance of making an inch of \nground in Iraq. In fact, the witnesses today said the Special Inspector \nGeneral in Iraq, in reporting to us, the Congress, and the American \npeople about progress made in routing out corruption, that Special \nInspector General was given information from those in charge in our \nGovernment in Iraq that was inaccurate because those responsible for \nproviding the information sent the right information to the Inspector \nGeneral and then it was pulled back by the State Department and they \nsanitized it and rewrote it to give a completely different message.\n  We are not even getting the truth. We are being deceived. I want \neveryone to read the testimony that came today from Judge Brennan and \nothers and understand what is happening.\n\n[[Page S4006]]\n\n  As we start on Thursday on this issue of whether we are going to \nprovide another $172 billion, we ought to understand how much of that \nmoney is being stolen, how much of that money is going to actually \nsupport the insurgency, and what is being done about it. I am going to \nsend letters, as a result of the hearing that I and my colleagues held \ntoday, to officials in the State Department, to Secretary Rice, and \nothers demanding to know what she knows and what they know and who is \ndoing something about this and demanding accountability from those in \nthe State Department relative to the testimony that was given today.\n  Mr. President, I didn't come to talk about that, but I just came from \nchairing that hearing for 2 hours. It is an unbelievable tale that is \nvery distressing and very disappointing and just cries out for action \nby the Congress and action by the President and this administration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/12/senate-section/article/S4006-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4006-S4010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE PRICE OF OIL\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I want to talk about oil prices a bit. I noticed today \nthat some of my colleagues were talking about drilling in Alaska. They \nsaid that we should drill in ANWR. That has become the hood ornament \nfor every conversation about energy. If we just drill in ANWR, then \nthings will be fine.\n  ANWR is one of those pristine areas we have set aside. There are some \nwho want to drill there as a first resort. If ever there is drilling in \nsome part of the world that we have set aside as one of the few \npristine areas left, then it ought to be a last resort. Why would you \ngo there as a first resort?\n  If you take a look at the Outer Continental Shelf and where the \nreserves of oil and gas really are, You have on that list the Gulf of \nMexico, the West Coast, and the Outer Continental Shelf of Alaska. They \nrank in that order. No. 1 is the Gulf of Mexico; No. 2 is California \nand the west coast; and No. 3 is the Outer Continental Shelf of Alaska.\n  I was there with three of my colleagues, Senators Domenici, Bingaman, \nand Talent, in the 109th Congress who introduced the legislation to \nopen Lease Sale 181 off the Gulf of Mexico to get new oil and natural \ngas production. I am proud to say that became law. We got that passed \nin the 109th Congress.\n  It was narrowed when we passed it, so I have actually introduced \nanother bill to expand that. I think we should be in the eastern Gulf \nof Mexico producing more, and we have made progress as a result of my \npast efforts with Senators Domenici, Bingaman, and Talent. So don't \ntell me about ANWR is going to solve all our problems. We are trying to \nopen even more in the Gulf of Mexico for additional production.\n  With respect to the price of oil at this point, it's been bouncing \naround at the top like a roller coaster. But here is what is happening \nwith the price of oil. It has nearly doubled in the last year. That \nshould be no surprise to people. If you drive a car you know what is \ngoing on. It nearly doubled in the last year.\n  In my judgment there is nothing that justifies that, and I want to \ntalk about that a little bit. There is nothing with respect to the \nfundamentals of supply and demand that would justify doubling the price \nof oil in one year. Take a look at what Stephen Simon, senior vice \npresident of ExxonMobil, a company making enormous profits, said. By \nthe way, they have permagrins. They can't help but smile all the way to \nthe bank with their record profits, some of the highest profits in \nhistory. Mr. Simon, said on April 1:\n\n       The price of oil should be about $50-$55 a barrel.\n\n  Clarence Cazalot, CEO of Marathon Oil, said,\n\n       $100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the \n     market.\n\n  Fadel Gheit, Senior Energy Analyst with Oppenheimer & Company who has \nmore than 30 years in this business said to the Star-Telegram on \nOctober 26, 2007,\n\n       There is absolutely no shortage of oil. I'm absolutely \n     convinced that oil prices should not be a dime above $55 a \n     barrel.\n\n  He is talking about the futures market.\n\n       I call it the world's largest gambling hall. . . It's open \n     24/7. . . . Unfortunately, it's totally unregulated. ... This \n     is like a highway with no cops and no speed limit, and \n     everyone is going 120 miles an hour.\n\n  New Jersey Star Ledger:\n\n       Experts, including the former head of ExxonMobil, say \n     financial speculation in the energy markets has grown so much \n     over the last 30 years that it now adds 20 to 30 percent or \n     more to the price of a barrel of oil.\n\n  Here is an example of increases in the speculation in the futures \nmarket as opposed to commercial contracts. Speculation has rapidly \nincreased. You can see it has gone up near the 40 percent mark. You \nwill see where it has gone just in recent years, up, up, way up. What \nhas happened is we have much more speculation in the futures market \nthat determines the price of this commodity.\n  Who is making money with all this? I said the other day, I don't know \nthis guy from a cord of wood. His name is Andrew Hall. There is a story \nin the Wall Street Journal: ``Trader Hits Jackpot In Oil As Commodity \nBoom Roars On.''\n  My guess is this fellow doesn't actually want to buy oil or actually \nacquire oil. He is just speculating in the futures market. Will Rogers \nsaid:\n\n       You will buy things you will never get from people who \n     never have had it.\n\n  Right? And you make money all along the way. You have the speculators \nin neck deep and hedge funds in neck deep in the futures market \nspeculating. Here is a guy who made a quarter of a billion dollars in \nthe last five years speculating in the futures market.\n  Some say the futures market, you need that. I agree you need that. \nYou need that for liquidity, and you need it for hedging. That's \nabsolutely true. But you don't need a futures market and should not \nallow a futures market for energy that ratchets up the price of energy \nin an unbelievable way, solely due to speculation. The fact is, it does \ngreat damage to our economy and does great damage to industries in this \neconomy.\n  I believe we have had five airlines go bankrupt in the last month. We \nhave trucking firms threatening to go belly up because they can't \npossibly afford to pay for the fuel and make a decent profit. This has \nan unbelievable impact in our country. It severely damages our economy.\n  I come from a State that is 10 times the size of Massachusetts.\n  So you can put ten Massachusetts in my State. We do not have a very \nlarge population, but we drive a lot. We are an agricultural state so \nwe use a lot of fuel. Incidentally, per person we use twice as much \nfuel as New Yorkers use. We use twice as much fuel per person per \ncapita as New Yorkers do, so when this shoots way up through the \nstratosphere, it hurts us much more than other areas of the country. We \nknow this in a very personal way.\n  Now, what do we do about that? Well, I have talked about the \nunbelievable orgy of speculation in the commodity markets. We ought to \ndampen that speculation by increasing the margin requirements. Buy a \nstock on margin, you have to put up 50 percent of the money to buy the \nstock. Buy an oil futures contract, in most cases, you put up 5 to 7 \npercent to buy an oil futures contract.\n  If you have too much speculation in that marketplace which is well \nabove that which is needed for liquidity and hedging and normal \ncommercial functions, then you have too much speculative capability, \nand there is too much speculative activity. Thus, we ought to wring \nthat out. I think there is a way to do that, and that is by increasing \nthe margin requirements.\n  Now I want to go to the next piece of information, and that is the \nbill I introduced three months ago to suspend filling the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. I was thinking today about the movie ``Dumb and \nDumber.'' I actually watched a little bit of it because it was so dumb. \nDumb and dumber represents a policy of putting oil underground at a \ntime when oil prices are up around $128 a barrel. I know ``dumb'' is \nnot a term of art, but I cannot think of anything that would be dumber \nthan continue a policy that makes no sense. Oil is going through the \nroof so let's stick oil underground by taking it out of supply, store \nit underground, and thereby increase the price.\n  Well, here is what we should do instead. This administration is now \nputting about 70,000 barrels of oil every single day, 7 days a week, at \nlocations like Bryant Mound, Big Hill, and West Hackberry. These are \nplaces on the Gulf Coast with salt domes where we\n\n[[Page S4007]]\n\nstore oil. What is the purpose? It is called the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. We call it the SPR for short. Because if we run into some \ntrouble some day, we want oil preserved in an SPR, and we can call on \nthat oil.\n  Here is what it looks like. It includes big old tubes that pump oil \nin the ground. This is the oil that ought to be in the supply pipelines \nright now so, when you drive up to the gas pump, you are paying a \nlittle bit less than you are now paying. Instead of it being available \nat the gas pump, it is being put underground in the SPR.\n  We are required as a country by international treaty obligations to \nhave at least a 90-day reserve. We are at about 118 days if you take \npublic and private stocks into account. We are well above our \ninternational requirement.\n  From what I can tell, there are 67 Senators who have signed letters \nor made statements to the President saying: Stop it. Do not stick oil \nunderground at this time. This is oil that comes off the Gulf of Mexico \nas a royalty-in-kind oil. Instead of putting it in supply, they are \nsticking it underground. Furthermore, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nis 97 percent filled. It is 97 percent full. And when oil is $128 a \nbarrel, we are sticking it underground. It makes no sense; it defies \nall common sense.\n  Yet 51 Democratic Senators sent a letter to the President, and 15 \nRepublicans Senators sent a letter to the President. Also, the \nRepublican Presidential candidate, John McCain, and said ``stop it.'' \nThat's at least 67 Senators.\n  Last week, Doug Steenland, the President and CEO of Northwest \nAirlines testified before the Congress. He said:\n\n       Certainly with the prices at this level, and given the \n     demand out there, we don't need to be filling the Strategic \n     Reserve at $122 per barrel.\n\n  Now, obviously he has a vested interest, because he and others are \nengaged in the airline industry.\n  Here is a quote from James May, President and CEO of the Air \nTransport Association of America:\n\n       One of the most important and immediate steps that the \n     government can take to help the economy is to stop filling \n     the SPR.\n\n  Why do we hear from airlines? We are hearing from airlines, truckers, \nor any number of industries or families and businesses. The airlines \nare hurt unbelievably by these prices and so are trucking firms. \nAmerican families are pulling up to a gas pump trying to figure out how \ndo I manage to pay for this tank of gas. It is not unusual to hear \nindustry officials say: Stop it.\n  John McCain, Senator McCain:\n\n       With oil at over $100 a barrel and an adequate supply in \n     the [Strategic Petroleum Reserve], it is time to suspend \n     purchases.\n\n  Now, why is it that everyone can hear this message except the \nPresident and the Vice President? I am told the Vice President is the \none who is absolutely insistent that we keep putting oil underground. \nWhy is it that everyone can understand and hear this message loud and \nclear except the President and his Vice President?\n  Is it not probably time for all of us to insist that we do that which \nwe know should be done? Fifteen Senators from the minority sent a \nletter to the President on April 29, 2008, and said:\n\n       We write today to request that the U.S. Department of \n     Energy immediately halt deposits of domestic crude oil into \n     the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\n  Now, having said all of that, we are going to vote tomorrow on a \npiece of legislation I introduced in early February. I have spoken \nabout it on the floor until people fall asleep when bring it up. I know \nrepetition is difficult around here, but it is important to understand \nhow urgent this is.\n  The fact is, we all have one thing in common: None of us has ever \nseen nearly $128 oil until now. We have never seen the price of a \nbarrel of oil go up to $120, $124, or $128 a barrel for oil. None of us \nhas ever experienced that before. So what does it mean to this economy? \nDo we know? I guess not, but we are witnessing it. I guess we know what \nit means to the five airlines that are bankrupt.\n  Do we know what it means to a trucking company? A guy called me the \nother day. He is running a trucking company in North Dakota that his \ndad started many years ago. They have a good operation. They are a good \nfamily company. They have made a good living for their family over many \nyears. He said you know what. I do not see how we can avoid shutting \nthis company down. We cannot afford the fuel costs. We just cannot \nafford it any longer.\n  Now, what are the consequences of all of this, a family driving up to \nthe gas pump and spending $50 or $60 to fill their tank?\n  Here is what is happening: The speculators in the oil futures area \nare making a massive amount of money. No question about it. Take a look \nat hedge fund compensation. It is unbelievable.\n  The OPEC countries, oh, man, they are going to the bank. They are \ngoing to the bank with our money. You pull up to the pump, you are \nlining the pockets of the OPEC and other oil producing countries. You \nare lining the pockets of the major integrated oil companies too.\n  By the way, the major integrated oil companies now all have two \nnames, because they all got married. They liked each other a lot, liked \nthe bottom line. Now, it is ExxonMobil, and it is ConocoPhillips. They \nhave all got two names.\n  People say to me: what are you talking about? Why do you not let the \nfree market work? Let the free market work. Don't you understand \nanything? Well, I actually used to teach a little economics in college. \nBut this is not a free market at work. There is nothing about a free \nmarket here.\n  No. 1, you have a cartel, a cartel of countries that makes decisions \nbehind a closed door, and they have the capability to make those \ndecisions stick. In fact, Saudi Arabia is now pumping 800,000 fewer \nbarrels a day than they did two years ago. Does that decision have an \nimpact on price? You bet your life it does. So you have a cartel. It is \nillegal to have a cartel in this country. You would go to jail for that \nin this country. But we have a cartel for oil producing nations.\n  Then you have the major oil companies which are bigger and much \nstronger, with much more muscle in the marketplace. Why? Because \neverybody was shaking pom-poms while they wanted to merge. You want to \nmerge? Absolutely. No problem. Get bigger. Fine.\n  We are supposed to have 2,000 people working for this U.S. Government \non antitrust enforcement. You cannot find one of them. I know they are \ngetting paid, but you cannot find one of them. All of these mergers are \napproved. So now we have got the OPEC cartel, we have got the major \nintegrated oil companies with more muscle in the marketplace. Finally, \nwe have a futures market which has become an orgy of speculation.\n  Then we are told just let the free market work. What is wrong with \nyou? The free market is fine. I guess it is fine if you are on the \nreceiving end of these policies. If you are the one who is the \nbeneficiary, it is not fine. If you are the one who is going to the \nbank to make deposits, boy, this works out pretty well for you.\n  But if you are on the receiving end of oil, gas, jet fuel prices or \ndiesel prices, then you are in deep trouble. The fact is, this is \ndamaging our economy, and it is going continue to damage our economy \nuntil we find ways to address it.\n  I serve on the Energy Committee. I am also Chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water, so I spend a lot of \ntime thinking about energy. I understand that in order to address our \nenergy needs we need to do a lot of things, do them right and do them \nwell. We need to produce more. I understand that. I described the need \nto produce more in the Gulf of Mexico, and what we are trying to do \nthrough legislative efforts. We need to produce renewable fuels, and we \ncan and should do that. I think there is great capacity in renewable \nfuels in the U.S.\n  We need to conserve more. We waste an unbelievable amount of energy \nin this country. We need to be much more efficient with all of the \nthings we do. We get up in the mornings and never think. We flick a \nswitch from ``off'' to ``on'' and everything comes on. We put a key in \nthe ignition and turn it and somehow the engine starts, and we go to \nwork. We do not think much about all of those issues, and make sure \nthat conservation and efficiency are unbelievably important.\n\n[[Page S4008]]\n\n  So we need to consider production, conservation, efficiency, and \nrenewables as important elements of an energy policy. But, again, when \nmy colleagues come to the floor of the Senate and say: Well, you know, \nif we could have drilled in ANWR, boy, things would be terrific. That \nis all nonsense. I mean, we can produce much more without going to that \nwhich we ought to go to as a last resort, rather than a first resort.\n  That is why many of us are trying to go beyond Lease Sale 181 in the \nGulf of Mexico. We ought to be producing off Cuba as well where China \nis now allowed to drill and produce. So there is so much we can do. \nLet's take the first baby steps in the right direction and stop doing \nthings that make no sense. Let's stop putting oil underground into the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  My hope is that, while we might disagree on a lot of things on energy \npolicy, the one thing we can and I hope should agree on is to stop \nputting oil underground when it is going from $120, to $125, to $145 a \nbarrel. I think there are at least 67 and probably 75 Senators who have \nexpressed themselves on that. While we might disagree on other parts \nof energy legislation, we should not disagree on that, if a \nsubstantial, overwhelming majority of the Senate believes it.\n\n  You know, one of the regrets I have had in the Senate in recent times \nis we often get the worst of what each party has to offer rather than \nthe best of both. The fact is we have got two grand political parties \nin our country. I know on some things we have different beliefs, and we \nhave differences of opinion. There are some things from time to time \nwhere we agree. This is an area where we agree right now. It is time to \nstop filling the SPR at this point. Not forever but at this point. That \nis an area of broad agreement in this Chamber. I hope we can manifest \nthat agreement tomorrow when we cast a vote on legislation that I \nintroduced three months ago. I have introduced amendments that \nRepublicans like Senator Domenici and Senator Snowe have cosponsored. \nMany other Senators have signed letters. Senator McCain has expressed \nhimself strongly and positively in support of this position. So let's \ndo what we can achieve.\n  Will it reduce the price of gasoline? Absolutely. Will it reduce it a \nlot? I do not know. Probably not a lot, but some. Dr. Philip Verleger, \nan economist and energy analyst, testified before the Energy Committee \nlast year and pointed out that we are taking certain oil from the Gulf \nof Mexico and putting underground. This is sweet light crude, a subset, \nthe most valuable subset of oil. He said that it had an impact of about \n10 percent on the price of sweet light crude oil.\n  Let's do what we can do to put some downward pressure on the price of \noil.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, tomorrow we are going to be voting on a \ncouple of different bills, one of which was discussed by my colleague \nfrom North Dakota. The other is called the Domenici bill for the senior \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  I believe that while the Domenici bill does not answer all of the \nquestions with regard to energy production, it is a very good start \nbecause, first and foremost, it addresses the production side. We know \nthere is a huge demand and not enough supply of energy. In many \nrespects, the Domenici bill seeks to remedy that imbalance and provide \nfor more production.\n  In the last 30 years, U.S. consumption of oil has grown moderately. \nOur dependence on foreign oil has doubled to more than 13.4 million \nbarrels per day, but our domestic production has remained relatively \nflat. Whether oil is purchased domestically or from foreign sources, we \nare feeling the negative effects of high prices more than ever.\n  We have to do something to help bring down the price of oil and gas \nat the pump, and today's average was $3.78. What the Domenici amendment \ndoes is open up new production, for example, 2000 acres of the 19 \nmillion acres of the Arctic Plain which was specifically designated for \noil and gas leasing so that with its new environmentally sound \ndirectional drilling, very low footprint, at least a million barrels of \noil could be made available, roughly 1 million barrels a day for 20 \nyears. That would make a big difference. It also allows that States on \nboth the Atlantic and Pacific could petition the Federal Government to \nopt out of the current broad moratorium on drilling and, in a \nresponsible, environmental manner unlock potentially millions of \nbarrels of crude oil.\n  The Domenici amendment streamlines and consolidates the refinery \npermitting process since frequently that is the bottleneck in getting \nrefined gasoline to the consumer. It eases difficulties usually \nencountered when they want to build or expand refineries. We haven't \nbuilt a new refinery in about 30 years.\n  The amendment suspends delivery to the SPR, echoing comments of my \ncolleague from North Dakota. This is not a magic bullet. Simply not \nbuying some oil and putting it in the SPR, while it won't hurt anything \nand might actually help a little bit, is a very modest proposal and \ndoes nothing to actually add to the supply of energy. But the Domenici \namendment includes this provision as well. It is not going to do any \nharm, and it could do some good. The amendment also allows for the \nlong-term procurement of synthetic fuels by repealing section 526 of \nlast year's energy bill which placed certain emissions requirements on \nAir Force fuels, for example, and repeals a provision of last year's \nbill that stipulated a moratorium on oil shale development. U.S. \ndomestic oil companies are doing a lot of research into the potential \nfor shale converted to oil. If we were able to accomplish this, we \ncould produce much more oil in the United States as a result.\n  The Domenici amendment is not perfect. I would, for example, not have \nincluded a coal mandate though, obviously, it would be good if we could \nconvert coal to a liquid fuel that could be put into our transportation \nneeds. I would have included a domestic oil royalty provision that \nwould have required that new leases include price thresholds limiting \nroyalty relief when gas and oil prices are high. That would improve our \nenergy situation. I also believe it is important to look at some of the \ncauses of the high oil and gas prices and some of the potential \ninitiatives that will lessen our reliance on oil which reached $125 a \nbarrel today. I will talk briefly about the weakness of the American \ndollar which has something to do with that.\n  The bottom line is, there are very good provisions in the Domenici \namendment. While I think it did not go far enough in some areas and had \none mandate which is unfortunate, it is an amendment which I will \nsupport because it will actually produce oil. Much of what comes from \nthe other side sounds good, but it doesn't produce a single drop of \noil. Without that, we are not going to decrease demand to more match \nsupply.\n  I mentioned that one of the costs of oil for American consumers is \nthe fact that our dollar has decreased in value relative to other \ncurrencies. There was a recent editorial in the Wall Street Journal \nwhich showed that the price of oil based upon gold or the value of the \nEuro has remained relatively constant, whereas compared to the price of \na dollar, it has increased dramatically, because the dollar is worth \nless money. If a dollar doesn't buy you as much, you have to have a lot \nmore of them to buy the same quantity of gasoline. I filled up two cars \nthis weekend. In both cases, I could see the fact my dollars weren't \ngoing as far as they used to. That was one of the reasons I paid more \nfor the gas I purchased.\n  European and Asian nations are shielded from this because their \ncurrencies, like the Euro and the yen, have maintained their value. \nEuropeans pay 80 Euros for a barrel of oil, while Americans are paying \nmore than $125 as of today. So returning the United States to a strong \ndollar policy would greatly reduce the price U.S. consumers pay for \noil. The Federal Reserve should switch its focus from maintaining \neconomic stability to fighting inflation, its primary goal. In periods \nof slower economic growth, the Federal Reserve traditionally responds \nby reducing short-term interest rates, but that can exacerbate \ninflation which has increased substantially. The Federal Reserve needs \nto refrain from\n\n[[Page S4009]]\n\nreducing interest rates further. Our currency is the foundation for our \neconomy. Without a strong dollar, our economy will not be able to \nachieve the stability that is necessary to control oil prices for the \neconomy.\n  Something else we can do, as well as reducing our reliance on foreign \noil and promoting reliable and affordable energy sources for the \nfuture, is to acknowledge that the mandates we imposed in the last two \nenergy bills aren't actually helping to reduce oil prices but actually \nhave caused them to increase.\n  I support the development of cost-effective alternatives to fossil \nfuels, but the alternatives should not increase the already burdensome \ncosts of energy and food on American families. As we know, last year's \nenergy bill effectively mandated that fuel marketers blend $15 billion \nof corn ethanol. I support efforts to reduce the ethanol mandate \nincluded in the Energy bill. That will lower gas prices and help to \nlower food prices as well. Instead, I believe we should be focusing on \nother and better sources of renewable energy already available, \nspecifically nuclear energy.\n  Dr. Patrick Moore, one of the founders of Greenpeace, stated in a \nWashington Post op-ed 2 years ago:\n\n       Nuclear energy is the only large-scale, cost-effective \n     energy source that can reduce . . . emissions while \n     continuing to satisfy a growing demand for power.\n\n  We all know that other countries have relied significantly on nuclear \npower. Today, France meets 80 percent of its total energy needs with \nnuclear power and is even able to export surplus energy to Britain and \nItaly. On top of the clear benefits for France, the country has also \nexperienced a steady decline in per capita emissions of CO2 \nsince the 1970s. On the other hand, we rely for electricity production \non 600 coal-fired electric plants that ultimately produce, according to \nDr. Moore, 36 percent of U.S. emissions or nearly 10 percent of global \nemissions of CO2. As the public increasingly becomes \ninformed on the advantages of nuclear power, its misgivings about this \nrenewable energy source should diminish.\n  The benefits to Americans could be great--a clean and renewable \nsource of energy that is produced right here in the United States.\n  Finally, a word about the majority's energy proposal to increase \ntaxes on domestic oil energy. According to a 2005 report by the \nnonpartisan Tax Foundation, oil companies have paid $2.2 trillion in \nFederal, State, and local taxes over the last 25 years. While it is \nimportant that tax policies be reviewed from time to time to ensure \nthey still make economic sense, we must be careful not to take actions \nthat would result in even higher prices for consumers. It is hard to \nimagine that raising taxes on the oil industry would not be passed on \nto consumers in the form of higher prices. Let's get to expanding our \nproduction so we can meet the demand for oil. Let's increase our use of \nnuclear energy which can make a big difference in providing electricity \nprimarily for electricity production. Let's get back to a strong dollar \nwhich is one of the first things we could do without producing a drop \nof energy to reduce the cost of gasoline we put into our vehicles.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am pleased our colleagues have come to \nthe floor to talk about the energy crisis. Energy prices are soaring. \nThe Bush administration is doing virtually nothing to help consumers. \nCongress must act.\n  I am pleased to hear so many of my colleagues come to the floor to \ntalk about ways in which we can act to try to help the consumer. \nAmericans are hurting today. In my own State of Maryland, my \nconstituents are not only suffering from increased gasoline prices, but \nelectricity prices rose by 72 percent in 2007. For a typical family in \nMaryland, they have seen a huge increase in their energy costs. For \ngasoline alone, the average Maryland family spends in excess of $4,500 \na year. They have seen an increase in gasoline prices of 153 percent \nduring the Bush administration. If you are a small business, you are \nvulnerable. Small businesses spend 20 to 30 percent more on energy to \nproduce the same product as a larger company; 62 percent of small \nbusinesses have to use a vehicle as part of their business. They don't \nhave the same options larger companies have to invest in energy \nefficiency as far as equipment is concerned. They certainly don't have \nthe same financing that large companies have. So in these difficult \ntimes they have to put mortgages on their homes or, in some cases, even \nuse credit cards. When they use their credit cards, it is the highest \npossible interest rates they can get. So Marylanders are hurting. \nAmericans are hurting on the energy cost.\n  The first thing we should have done and we should do today is have an \nenergy policy that makes us energy independent. I have heard a lot of \nmy colleagues talk about it. We have taken some steps in that direction \non energy legislation that we passed, but we certainly can do a lot \nmore on the area of energy independence.\n  We need to be energy independent first and foremost for the security \nof America. We should not be depending on some country halfway around \nthe world which we disagree with on their international policies \nbecause we need their oil and we are dependent on their oil, and we \ncan't do everything we wish to do with that country on foreign policy \nissues. Secondly, we have to become energy independent for the sake of \nthe environment.\n  The environmental risks are real. To give one example of global \nclimate change and what greenhouse gas emissions are doing because of \nthe use of petroleum and fossil fuels, I met with my Maryland watermen \nover the last week and talked about the fragile condition within the \nChesapeake Bay and how it is difficult for the different species, \nincluding oysters and clams and rockfish, to survive. One of the \nreasons is the water at the surface is too warm. This is not conducive \nto good, healthy aquatic life. So the health of the bay is impacted by \nour dependency and use of oil.\n  I could talk a lot about our coastal lines in Maryland with the \nrising sea level and what that is doing as far as the safety of the \npeople who live in my State. So for the sake of our environment, we \nneed to become energy independent and use less fossil fuels.\n  As we have learned in this economic time, for the sake of our \neconomy, we need to become energy independent. We need to control our \nenergy sources so we can control the economic impact and not have to \nagain be hit with uncertain energy cost increases. Part of that is \ngoing to be a renewable portfolio, alternative fuels, conserving fuel. \nWe all know that. But we also need to take immediate action to help the \nconsumer.\n  As oil prices are rising, gasoline prices are rising, oil companies \nprofits have gone through the roof. The five largest oil companies in \n2007 had profits of $103 billion. That is $2 billion a week in profits. \nIn 2008, BP Oil has already shown a 63-percent increase over its 2007 \nprofits. So the consumers are paying more and the oil companies are \nmaking a lot more. We need to take action. We need to pass the Consumer \nFirst Energy Act. I thank Senator Reid for introducing this bill. I am \nproud to be a cosponsor. I hope we will shortly take this up and be \nable to pass it. It will help consumers today.\n  First, it deals with $17 billion that oil companies receive in tax \nbreaks. Remember, the profits of five companies were over $100 billion \nin 2007. We are talking about tax breaks we are giving which should be \nused for energy independence. Instead it is making us more dependent \nupon imported oil. What this legislation would do would be to modify \nthese tax breaks and put the money into an energy independence security \ntrust fund so we can become independent in energy needs.\n  We have heard a lot of conversation about the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. What is happening today is that the Federal Government is \nbuying 70,000 gallons of gasoline every day. Economics 101, supply and \ndemand, we are increasing the demand for gasoline by 70,000 gallons a \nday. That has a direct impact on the price of gasoline. We have 97 \npercent of our needs already in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. There \nis bipartisan effort to stop the filling of the petroleum reserve as we \nare hitting these huge increases in cost to the consumer. This \nlegislation deals with that. We should be having better tools to pursue \nthose who are price gouging. This legislation deals with that.\n\n[[Page S4010]]\n\n  I heard the Senator from North Dakota talk about the speculators. \nThis legislation deals with that. Let me explain that. As Senator \nDorgan pointed out, we have speculators, investors who are buying paper \non future oil who are causing the price of oil to go up, which means we \npay more at the pump. We should be regulating what we call the margins \nat a much higher level. Margins mean they have to put up not much \nmoney. They buy it on credit. Well, this legislation would have the FTC \nregulate the margin sales and purchases of futures on oil. That makes a \nlot of sense. It would calm the speculators and save us at the pump. It \nis another way we can reduce the cost immediately to the consumer. And \nit deals with offshore speculating, something else we should do.\n  The legislation also gives the Attorney General the ability to go \nafter collusion on price fixing in gasoline.\n  So all these provisions in the Consumer First Energy Act are aimed at \ntrying to bring down the cost to the consumer now and keep it lower \nthan it is today. It would provide immediate help and would bring us \ncloser to meeting our goal of energy independence for the sake of our \nnational security, for the sake of our environment, and for the sake of \nour economy.\n  So let's remember the struggles of American families with rising \nenergy costs as we work together. Let's put aside partisan differences, \nand let's pass the Consumer First Energy Act to provide real relief to \nthe consumers in America. It is in the best interests of the consumers. \nIt is in the best interests of our country. I urge my colleagues to act \nin a bipartisan way to pass this most important legislation.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/12/senate-section/article/S4010-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4010-S4014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             PUBLIC OPINION\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, so far, the 110th Congress has failed to \naddress some of the biggest problems confronting our Nation today. \nWhile some may be content to simply point the finger of blame, I think \nit is time for the Senate to take a long, hard look in the mirror.\n  I was struck by a poll I read which I would like to share with my \ncolleagues dated April 9, 2008. This is a Rasmussen poll which said \nthat just 13 percent of likely voters believe Congress is doing a good \nor excellent job--13 percent. The respondents to the poll were also \nasked whether they thought Congress had passed in the last year any \nlegislation that was designed to make their life a little bit easier. \nIncredibly, only 12 percent of these likely voters said Congress had \npassed any legislation to improve life in America during the last year. \nFifty-nine percent said we had not. Fifty-nine percent of the \nrespondents said Congress had not passed any legislation in the last \nyear that had made their life better.\n  This is quite an indictment. Frankly, I think we are going to have a \nchance tomorrow morning to demonstrate that either these respondents to \nthis poll had gotten it all wrong or we are going to prove them exactly \nright, depending on the vote we have tomorrow morning on this important \nenergy legislation I want to talk about in a moment. But first I wish \nto offer some suggestions on why it is that Congress is so poorly \nthought of by the American voter. Frankly, I think there are a number \nof examples. I have four examples of inexplicable delays in how \nCongress has failed to take care of the Nation's business.\n  First of all, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Certainly, \none of the most important jobs of the Federal Government is to make \nsure the American people are safe and secure. Our national security is \njob No. 1 for the Federal Government.\n  Over a year ago, our intelligence community alerted us to the fact \nthat an outdated foreign intelligence surveillance system was causing \nour intelligence gatherers to operate essentially blind to new threats. \nDespite this urgent plea from the intelligence community, the Speaker \nof the House has denied an opportunity for the House of Representatives \nto vote on a bipartisan piece of legislation that came out of the \nSenate. In fact, this authority has expired for new threats some 87 \ndays ago. Without the critical reform to our foreign intelligence \nsurveillance system, we will not have access to time-critical \ninformation that will help protect not only our troops who are deployed \naround the world but also the American people at home as well. It is \njust a crying shame that the House leadership would have delayed \npassage of this important legislation. Again, legislation that was \nbipartisan and voted out of the Senate is now bogged down and blocked \nbecause the Speaker of the House has denied an opportunity for this \nimportant legislation to come up.\n  There is another example, unfortunately, justifying the American \npublic's low opinion of the Congress, and this has to do with the \nColombia Free Trade Agreement. We have been waiting 538 days--that is \nthe second number on the chart, 538 days--for Congress to consider the \nColombia Free Trade Agreement. After more than a year of trying to \nnegotiate with Congress, President Bush finally submitted this \nimportant legislation for fast-track approval. But in a stunning \ndisplay of just how far Speaker Pelosi is willing to go to delay this \nimportant agreement, she opted to rewrite the rules of the House of \nRepresentatives in order to avoid having to vote on the bill within the \nexpedited timeline of our trade promotion authority.\n  This act would have ensured that farmers in my State, the State of \nTexas, as well as manufacturers and small businesses--it would have \nprovided them a duty-free entry into the markets of the nation of \nColombia in South America. Right now, those goods and services bear a \ntariff of up to 80 percent on their products, notwithstanding that my \nState of Texas, last year, sold $2.3 billion worth of goods and produce \nto the nation of Colombia and the people in Colombia. It is one of our \nbest trading partners in South America. So why should our American \ngoods and produce be discriminated against because of these high \ntariffs? Well, we had a way to solve that 538 days ago, but the Speaker \nof the House of Representatives has simply refused to allow the House \nto vote on it.\n  Recently, American businesses crossed the $1 billion mark in money \nlost to tariffs in Colombia as a result of the refusal to consider this \nimportant legislation. That is $1 billion that could have been saved \nand invested in our economy, and it is opportunities lost to small \nbusinesses and large businesses in America--such as farmers--to sell \ntheir goods and produce in Colombia without a tariff.\n  Well, it is also important because Colombia is one of our very best \nallies in South America in the fight against the drug cartels and \nterrorist organizations. Just last week, Colombia extradited a reputed \ndrug kingpin, Luis Hernando Gomez Bustamante, to America. This man is \nbelieved to head an organization responsible for 60 percent of the \ncocaine in America. He is finally now in custody pending trial in \nAmerica, thanks to the Colombian Government. We need to support \nColombia and President Uribe in their fight against men such as Luis \nGomez Bustamante who are bringing deadly drugs to our streets. But, \ninstead of the kind of cooperation and reinforcement and appreciation \nyou would expect one friend to show another friend, our friends in \nColombia have gotten nothing but a stiff arm from the Congress in a \nrefusal to act on important legislation that would benefit them and \nwould benefit us and would tell the world what it means to be a friend \nof the United States: beneficial trading relationships that are to the \nmutual benefit of the trading partners. But that was 538 days ago, with \nno action, and the clock is still ticking.\n\n  Mr. President, 683 days is another important example of mismanagement \nof the opportunity we have been given to serve the interests of the \nAmerican people. It was 683 days ago that Peter Keisler was first \nnominated for a judicial appointment by the President of the United \nStates. Unfortunately, he is not the only nominee who continues to \nlanguish while the majority continues to drag its feet in providing an \nopportunity for an up-or-down vote for these judicial nominees.\n  Today, as our colleagues from North Carolina have already pointed \nout, is the 300th day since Judge Robert Conrad's nomination came to \nthe Senate, and he has not even been given the courtesy of a committee \nhearing--300 days after his nomination came to the Senate.\n\n[[Page S4011]]\n\n  So far this year, the Senate has approved a total of one circuit \ncourt judge--just one. That by any standard is abysmal. While we \ncontinue to delay the confirmation of judges, there are 46 judicial \nvacancies in the Federal judiciary, 13 of which are considered judicial \nemergencies. And what does Congress do? What does the Senate do? Well, \nnot much, almost nothing to deal with the judicial emergencies and \nthese vacancies and to provide an up-or-down vote on these nominees.\n  The American people depend on fully functioning courts to find \njustice. The Senate's failure to do its constitutional duty to confirm \nor at least to allow a vote on qualified nominees for these vacancies \nhas a very real impact on communities, on businesses, on the residents \nof the areas in which those courts have jurisdiction, and crime victims \nto have access to justice. But having no judge who can sit and hear the \ncase is essentially like locking and chaining the front door to the \ncourthouse.\n  Finally, how long will it be before the majority makes good on its \npromise that Speaker Pelosi made 749 days ago? It was 749 days ago when \nshe promised the American people that if the Democrats were given the \nmajority, they would have a commonsense solution to rising gas prices. \nWell, last week, after waiting more than 2 years, Democrats did unveil \na plan. The irony is that it has become all too commonplace to find \nthat these energy plans do not have one drop of additional energy but, \nrather, they recommend, really, more of the same--more taxation, more \nlitigation, more investigations--but not one single drop of additional \nenergy, not one single watt of new energy.\n  While oil and gas prices have hit record highs virtually every day--\ntoday hitting $3.72 a gallon--on January 4, 2007, when Speaker Pelosi \nand our friends on the Democratic side took charge of both the House \nand the Senate, that price of a gallon of gas was $2.33. Now it is \n$3.72. That is about a $1,400-per-family increase in the cost of \nliving. And Congress continues to do next to nothing to deal with it, \nnotwithstanding the promise Speaker Pelosi made some 749 days ago.\n  Well, the irony is that we have heard, in the plan that has been made \nby some on the other side of the aisle, that all we need to do is to \nraise taxes on the domestic oil producers and that will somehow find a \nway to solve our lack of oil and gasoline. Unfortunately, some of these \nideas have been tried before and found to be total and abject failures. \nFor example, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research \nService, this same tax idea was tried back during the Jimmy Carter \nadministration. If you are too young to remember what happened during \nthe Carter administration, there were shortfalls in the supply of \ngasoline, resulting in interminable lines waiting at gas stations. As a \nresult, the Congressional Research Service said that domestic \nproduction--that is America's energy production--fell by roughly 5 \npercent, resulting in an overall increase in the dependence on imported \noil from foreign sources. Is that what our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle want, an increase in our dependence on imported oil? Well, I \nwould think not. So why would they come up with these tested and failed \nschemes to increase our reliance on imported oil? I noticed the \ndistinguished Democratic chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, \nSenator Bingaman from New Mexico, has expressed it in words that \nperhaps I think are prophetic when he says this windfall profits tax is \nvery arbitrary and bad policy.\n\n  Now, while this plan would help further line the pockets of OPEC, the \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and anti-American \nforeign leaders such as Hugo Chavez, this bill would also authorize the \nAmerican Government to sue OPEC to demand that they increase oil \nproduction.\n  Now, we ought to think about that one a minute. OPEC, after all, is \ncomposed of Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Algeria, \nAngola, Ecuador, Indonesia, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, and the United Arab \nEmirates. What our friends on the other side of the aisle have proposed \nis we file a lawsuit against Iran and Venezuela and tell them to turn \nthe spigot all the way open. What that would do, of course, assuming it \nwere possible, is it would mean that we were even more dependent on \nimported oil from our enemies such as Iran and Venezuela--not less. \nThis would only make us more dependent on OPEC--not less.\n  Now, I believe there is a better solution, and that better solution \nis to take advantage of the natural resources God has given this great \ncountry of ours, one with which we have been supremely blessed. If, in \nfact, our friends on the other side of the aisle would allow us to pass \nthe Domenici energy amendment--the American Energy Production Act--it \nwould have the potential of producing as much as 3 million additional \nbarrels of oil a day from American natural resources. This bill would \nopen domestic resources such as shale oil in the Arctic and offshore \ndeposits to domestic energy producers. It would immediately send a \nmessage to the speculators and commodity investors that there is going \nto be an additional amount of oil available in the future, up to 3 \nmillion barrels a day, and I believe have an immediate downward effect \non the price of oil--a barrel of oil which, of course, is 70 percent of \nthe cost of gasoline.\n  One thing is for sure: By taxing and penalizing our own domestic \nproducers, that is not a solution, and we need to do everything we can \nin our power to lower prices and not to play additional games by \ntrotting out tired and failed efforts of the past to try to bring down \nprices. We know the law of supply and demand is one Congress cannot \nrepeal, so that is why we ought to pass the Domenici amendment \ntomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, we are debating two very different \namendments on gas prices that are up for a vote tomorrow. We have the \nproposal of the minority leader that is full of old ideas that will not \nwork and will do absolutely nothing to affect gas prices now or in the \nfuture. In fact, the only provision in the minority leader's amendment \nthat would do anything to lower gas prices is lifted directly from the \nDemocratic plan to lower gas prices. This is the provision to \ntemporarily suspend filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. In \nresponse, the majority leader has offered a clean amendment to \ntemporarily suspend filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This is \none of the few options we have to address the pain at the pump our \nconstituents are facing right now.\n  Every time my friends on the other side of the aisle decide to pay \nattention to our energy crisis, their solution is always the same: help \nbig oil. In 2005, they authored energy provisions that gave ExxonMobil \nand other oil giants lavish subsidies that totaled over $14 billion, \nand these companies are reaping the rewards with record profits \nannounced every quarter. ExxonMobil recently announced $11 billion in \nprofits over a 3-month period. To put that in context, this means \nExxonMobil's yearly profit this year might well be almost twice the \nannual budget of the Department of Energy.\n  The authors of these proposals argue that if we simply shovel more \ntaxpayer money in the direction of oil companies, this money will \neventually trickle down to the people. But, as we have all too often \nseen, it does not. Gasoline prices are now over $3.70 per gallon, and \nthe specter of $4-per-gallon gasoline is looming around the corner. \nWhile oil companies hoard their windfall profits, the American people \nare suffering.\n  Yet my friends on the other side of the aisle do not want real relief \nfor the country; they only want to protect big oil's huge profits at \nany cost by opening every environmentally sensitive area in the country \nto drilling. Now, President Bush was right when he said we are addicted \nto oil, but what amazes me is the President's party is unaware they \ncontinue to act like addicts. Instead of supporting real plans to \nconserve oil or even transition to sustainable fuels, they go out in \nsearch of their next oil fix.\n  Some claim the way to lower gas prices is to end a bipartisan, 26-\nyear moratorium to open the Outer Continental Shelf to oil exploration \nand drill, drill, and drill. But the Energy Information Administration \nprojects that even if we opened the entire Outer Continental Shelf to \ndrilling off the east coast, off the west coast, and opened the entire \neastern Gulf of Mexico, nothing would happen to gas\n\n[[Page S4012]]\n\nprices. Why? First, because production would not begin before the year \n2017. The infrastructure to drill for oil is not just a large oil \nplatform but a network of hundreds of miles of pipeline to transport \noil from the platform onto land and then to refineries. This kind of \ninfrastructure simply does not exist on the east coast and in only \nlimited exceptions on the west coast.\n  The second reason why opening all our shores to oil drilling will not \nlower gas prices is because by the time full production actually ramped \nup, in 2030, drilling off all our coasts full tilt would only result in \na whopping 3-percent increase in domestic production. And even in 2030, \nas our continent is rung all the way around by oil platforms, all of \nthis new supply will be eaten up by a 7-percent increase in domestic \ndemand. The Energy Information Administration predicts that: ``Any \nimpact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant.''\n\n  So even opening all of our coasts to drilling, as the minority leader \nproposes, will have no impact on gas prices at all. As my colleagues \ncan see by this chart, the Federal Government has been issuing more and \nmore leasing permits for drilling, but at the same time the price of \ngasoline has continued to rise. In fact, over 80 percent of the \nresources in the Outer Continental Shelf are already open for \nexploration. Since 2001, the Bush administration has issued over 100 \nnew leases. Many of these leases are in the eastern Gulf where the oil \nindustry already has much of the infrastructure necessary to go into \nproduction but only 12 of these new wells have been drilled. The \nindustry is only developing a small fraction of the area already open \nfor drilling. Why isn't ExxonMobil pumping some of its profits into \ndeveloping these areas? If companies are not interested in developing \nthe large fields already open in the Gulf of Mexico, why is it so \ncritical to open environmentally sensitive areas to more drilling?\n  One might say it is to be expected that those on the side of big oil \nwould use this sort of rhetoric in an election year, but it is much \nworse than that. The McConnell amendment could be both economically and \necologically devastating. If you look at a picture here taken after a \nrecent oil spill in San Francisco, this is what we can routinely be \nfacing if we allow widespread drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf. \nWe could see our beaches closed for business because of oil spills.\n  In my home State of New Jersey, our shore is a priceless treasure \nthat my State would protect at any cost, but the shore also generates \ntens of billions of dollars in revenues each year and supports almost \nhalf a million jobs. It simply makes no sense to jeopardize a tourism \nand fishing economy worth tens of billions of dollars in exchange for a \ncumulative total of only a half year's supply of oil. The people of New \nJersey cannot afford the risk of millions of gallons of oil washing up \non our beaches.\n  This is not just a New Jersey problem. Florida's beaches generate \nbillions of dollars each year. In South Carolina, Myrtle Beach alone \nbrought in $3 billion in revenues. Do we want oil washing up onto the \npristine Cape Hatteras National Seashore? What about Virginia Beach? \nCan Maryland's famous blue crab survive yet another environmental \nassault?\n  The bottom line is the minority leader's proposal will do nothing to \nlower gas prices, but it will jeopardize coastal economies all along \nboth coasts. Is there anything we can responsibly do to ease the pain \nof such high gas prices? The answer is a resounding yes.\n  One important way to address oil prices that I hope we will be \ndebating more fully in the next week or so is to better regulate oil \nmarkets. Many analysts who have testified before the relevant House and \nSenate committees agree that based on pure supply and demand, the price \nof oil should be somewhere between $50 and $70 a barrel. So why are we \nhitting $125 a barrel? In part, it is because of excessive speculation \non futures markets, and unlike other markets such as the commodities \ninvolving corn or soybean futures, oil is being traded around the globe \nwith little or no oversight by the U.S. Government. If the Enron \ndisaster teaches us anything, it should be that markets cannot be \nallowed to operate without real oversight. In the upcoming weeks when \nthe Senate debates the comprehensive Democratic plan to address runaway \ngas prices, one of the most important aspects of that package will be \nincreased regulation of oil markets so we can effectively combat excess \nspeculation and any possible market manipulation.\n  Another important measure to bring short-term relief to the pain at \nthe pump is the majority leader's amendment to be voted on tomorrow. \nThis amendment would suspend filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at \nleast through December 2008. When the people of this country are \nsuffering with almost $4-a-gallon gas, when the price of oil has broken \n$125 a barrel, why would we be burying this precious commodity when we \nneed it the most? We should stop pouring all that oil into a hole in \nthe ground until the price of crude oil recedes to $75 or less. This \nwill truly help drive gas prices back down by increasing supply and \noffering some immediate relief to Americans.\n  It is very important that we look at these proposals. Even Jim \nWoolsey is fond of saying, by buying oil in such huge quantities and at \nsuch high prices, we are funding both sides of the war on terror. So it \nseems to me that if we want to do something about kicking our \naddiction, we don't go after more of it; we move in a different \ndirection. We suspend the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that is already \n97 percent full. We will have that opportunity tomorrow. Then we look \nat market speculation and these other elements of a truly broad-based \neffort that preserves our natural resources, preserves the economy that \nthose natural resources generate, as the New Jersey shore does, and \nthen ultimately achieves the goal of not only driving down the cost of \ngas but at the same time move us in a different direction to break our \ndependency.\n  So what are the real long-term solutions to ending our dependence on \noil and greening our transportation fleet?\n  The first thing we need to do is drastically improve fuel economy. In \n1976, our cars and trucks got 13 miles per gallon. Because of the Arab \noil crisis, we passed laws to improve the fuel economy of our passenger \nvehicles. From 1976 to 1981, we saw a rapid increase in fuel economy. \nIn 1981, our fleet had improved to 21 miles per gallon. But since 1981, \nwithout the political will to improve fuel economy standards and the \nrising popularity of SUVs, the average fuel economy of our passenger \nvehicle fleet actually declined to 20 miles per gallon in 2006.\n  What would have happened if we had kept slowly improving the fuel \neconomy of our vehicles from 1981 to the present? If we had increased \nfuel economy a modest 2 percent per year during that time, our new \nfleet of vehicles would now average 34 miles per gallon. While this is \ncertainly a huge improvement over where we sit today, it was definitely \nachievable since this figure is still well below standards set in Japan \nwhich are over 40 miles per gallon.\n  Astonishingly, if we had followed this course, our current demand for \noil would be over one-third less than it is today, down over 2 billion \nbarrels of oil per year. Cumulatively, we would have saved over 30 \nbillion barrels of oil. Thirty billion barrels of oil is more oil than \nthe entire proven oil reserves remaining in the United States. This \nmeans that this sensible and achievable policy could have saved us more \noil than we could ever hope to gain from domestic drilling. It is \ncommendable that we have finally raised fuel economy standards, but we \nmust make even further reductions if we want to make up for lost time.\n  Of course, fuel efficiency is just part of the answer to solving our \naddiction to oil. We also need tax incentives to increase the producion \nand use of superefficient vehicles already out there--such as hybrids. \nWe need a massive investment in cars that can run on sustainable \nalternative fuels like electricity or cellulosic ethanol. Once we truly \nhave a choice of fuels, the grip of our oil addiction will finally \nloosen.\n  This country also needs to invest in our mass transit infrastructure. \nThis weekend the New York Times reported that mass transit is up all \nover the country. We need a huge investment in mass transit to make \nsure that we all have multiple transportation options so we are not so \nreliant on driving.\n\n[[Page S4013]]\n\n  But while most of the Democratic Party supports these sensible policy \nreforms, my friends on the other side of the aisle are stuck in the \npast advocating old positions from previous Congresses. Mr. President, \nI hope that this will be the last time I need to rise in this Chamber \nto point out that more oil drilling in environmentally sensitive areas \nis not the answer to our oil addiction. It is time for an intervention.\n  It is time for a real cure based on a tough examination and \nreordering of our energy priorities--and not the tired old policies of \nthe past.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is time for us to get real about energy. \nIt is time for us to get real about gas prices. Withholding from the \nAmerican people new oil supplies needed to get gas prices down will \nonly hurt our families and our workers more.\n  American families are suffering from record pain at the pump. \nTruckers and shippers face layoffs and losses. Farmers, processors, and \npackagers are sending their food to market with higher prices and \nhigher costs, and airlines are once again threatened with bankruptcy.\n  Whether you drive a car, a big rig or a tractor, you know personally \nwhat I am talking about. With average gas prices now topping $3.70 a \ngallon, you have a right to demand some answers about our energy \nfuture. Your pain and suffering demands we supply you with relief. \nRelief comes in the form of economics 101. Folks, every time prices are \ntoo high, there is too much demand and too little supply. Now, maybe \nsome of our colleagues did not take the economics course, but I believe \nin common sense, and I believe the American people have common sense. \nThey realize that when you don't have enough of something, and the \ndemand keeps going up, the price goes up.\n  That is how our system works. Answers that focus only on demand and \nnot on supply are not enough to fix the problem. So we are where we are \ntoday with record high gas prices inflicting record pain at the pump.\n  Don't get me wrong. I support good, strong measures to reduce the \ndemand for oil. Last year, I supported Congress's measure to increase \naggressively but achievably high standards for corporate average fuel \neconomy, or CAFE. That would force better gas mileage from cars and \ntrucks. But those new fuel efficiency requirements will take years \nbefore they have an effect. In the meantime, families and workers will \nsuffer through years of higher gas prices. Auto makers cannot go out \ntomorrow and build a new fleet of high gas mileage cars and trucks. New \ncars take years to design and build.\n  Even if highly efficient cars were available tomorrow, families in \nthe middle of 4-year car loans probably cannot go out and buy a new \ncar. They have to wait until they can purchase a more fuel-efficient \ncar. In the meantime, these families will suffer through more years of \nhigher prices.\n  We can cut demand with more people riding mass transit, and I have \nsupported mass transit. I will continue to do so. But if you don't have \nmass transit in your area, such as where I live and where a whole lot \nof people in rural America live, you cannot move to the city or get a \ndifferent job. In the meantime, you will suffer through years more of \nhigher gas prices.\n  We can cut demand by subsidizing hybrid vehicles. Congress supported \nthose tax credits, as I do. But hybrid cars are too expensive now and \nwill take too many years to become affordable to most families. We are \nworking in Missouri to get much more efficient, much lighter batteries \nthat can help meet the needs for hybrid and plug-in cars. In the \nmeantime, while we are working on those technologies, families will \nsuffer through years more of higher gas prices.\n  I, for one, am unwilling to allow families to suffer years more of \nhigher gas prices, while we wait for demand strategies to work.\n  To address supply, some say we should take our hat in hand and beg \nour Middle Eastern suppliers to produce more oil. Since when has \nincreasing our dependence on the Middle East ever been a good idea?\n  Some propose raising taxes on suppliers searching and developing new \ndomestic oil supplies. Since when has taxing something more ever \nincreased its supply or lowered its price? Never. When we put taxes on \nthose who are searching and developing for new domestic oil supplies, \nwe ensure that there won't be as much and the price will be higher.\n  Some say we should investigate suppliers to probe what is making \nprices so high. I too support investigating wrongdoing, but since when \nhas investigating something ever increased its supply or lowered its \nprice?\n  The American people deserve more than begging, taxing, and \ninvestigating. American families and workers deserve real actions \ntoward real solutions. America doesn't need to look that far. Indeed, \nthe solutions to America's supply problems are right here in our own \nbackyard. America's lands, ocean floors, and mountains hold billions of \ngallons of oil waiting for us to come and get it.\n  We have millions of gallons of oil beneath the frozen tundra of \nnorthern Alaska. Had there not been a veto in 1995 of the development \nof the sources above the Arctic circle in Alaska, we would be getting a \nmillion gallons of oil a day from Alaska. You cannot tell me that would \nnot lower the price. It would have a huge impact. We also have millions \nof gallons of oil beneath the seabeds miles off our coasts. We have \nbillions of gallons of oil trapped in the shale beneath our Rocky \nMountains.\n  Tapping these new U.S. supplies will help relieve prices immediately. \nWhile it is true it will take years before new supplies will come on, \nwe will send an immediate signal to the speculators in the oil trading \nmarkets that new suppliers are on their way. They cannot continue to \npush prices higher.\n  Today's prices built on limited supply and a world dependent on \ntrouble spots will see America deciding to open vast and safe new oil \nsupplies. Oil prices, built on predicting the future, will have no \nchoice but to fall in the face of a future safe, new supply source for \nAmerica.\n  We can also face the future using new technologies. America owns, and \nuses every day, environmentally friendly oil technologies that are \ncleaner than ever before for exploring, developing, and producing. We \ncan drill sideways deep underground to avoid sensitive areas above. We \ncan drill many locations from a single site to avoid sensitive areas \naround.\n  Environmentally friendly operations in northern Alaska can drill in \nthe winter and be gone long before any animals are active in the \nspring.\n  Environmentally friendly operations could drill in the ocean and \nsurvive hurricanes such as Katrina with no spilled oil or gas. Does \nanybody recall the spills resulting when Hurricane Katrina tore through \nthe Gulf of Mexico drilling rigs? No, because they didn't happen.\n  To say we would repeat the mistakes of the 1960s and 1970s with the \nsame 40-year-old technology is like saying we will all continue to call \nourselves on rotary telephones or write each other on typewriters.\n  Another source of transportation fuel from new technology is coal to \nliquids. The technology to turn coal into liquid jet fuel or diesel has \nbeen around for a hundred years. We now have the technology to capture \ncarbon emissions and make it cleaner than refining conventional oil \nand, in addition, providing a greater supply.\n  We are also developing even cleaner and more affordable forms of \nbiofuels. Technology giving us clean-burning corn ethanol today will \ngive us cellulosic ethanol tomorrow with grasses and wood chips.\n  In my State of Missouri, gas is 10 cents cheaper than it otherwise \nwould be because we require 10 percent ethanol in all pumps. This will \nsave Missouri drivers $285 million this year. Some people say ethanol \nis driving up prices. Ethanol is a lot cheaper to produce, and it uses \nfermentation, not the cat cracking that goes into regular gasoline. It \nbrings down prices; it doesn't drive up the price of the fuel. The \noverall shortage of fuel has driven up the price for food. But most \nimportantly, the Government hoarding food is driving up the price. \nDon't make farmers the scapegoats. They are responding to the demand \nCongress made of them to go out and build ethanol-producing plants and \nproduce the ethanol to get cleaner, cheaper, domestically-produced \nenergy. That is what they are doing.\n\n[[Page S4014]]\n\n  Now the future is brighter in many areas because of new, cleaner \ntechnologies. We can have a brighter future of energy supplies if we \nlet all these new technologies work for us.\n\n  We can also have a brighter future of energy supplies if we stop \nbeing selfish and start thinking about the collective good. Too many \nindividuals are willing to say ``not in my backyard,'' even if it means \nthe group suffers. Too many groups pursue NIMBY strategies even if it \nmeans the Nation suffers.\n  Nobody here is trying to force Alaska to do something Alaska doesn't \nwant to do. Alaskans want to open more of their oil reserves. But it is \npeople in places such as Massachusetts saying no to Alaska.\n  No one here is trying to force Virginia to do something it doesn't \nwant to do. Virginians want to explore for oil and gas off their \ncoastline. It is people in places such as California and New Jersey \nsaying no to Virginians.\n  Nobody here is trying to force Colorado to do something it doesn't \nwant to do. Colorado wants to tap the shale beneath its mountains. It \nis people in places such as Washington, DC, saying no to Colorado.\n  This type of NIMBY sentiment must end. This type of selfishness must \nend. This type of inflicting multiyear pain waiting for demand \nstrategies must end. We must no longer deny Americans the new supply \nsolutions they need. We must no longer refuse American families and \nworkers the lower gas prices they demand.\n  We must not only suspend shipments to the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve, we must also open new oil supplies in northern Alaska, open \nnew oil and gas supplies under our oceans, and open new oil shale \nsupplies under our mountains, and open our ability to refine more oil. \nWe must open the ability of U.S. workers to manufacture more hybrid \nbatteries.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Republican amendment and \nprovision that will be coming tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know many of my colleagues have spoken \nabout the energy challenge and the crisis we face. I look forward to \nsupporting Senator Reid's amendment tomorrow. That amendment has been \noutlined in great detail during the course of the afternoon. I am in \nstrong support of that amendment.\n  We are facing a national challenge, and if you look back, \nhistorically, when we have been facing a national challenge--and this \ntime is a wartime--not to say all of this crisis is from the war, but \nwhether it is adding to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or bidding up \nprices in other parts of the world, it is unconscionable that we have \nthese extraordinary windfall profits that are out of the pockets of \nworking families. And the indifference of this administration to the \nplight of these working families is appalling.\n  I applaud our leader for the legislation we will have a chance to \nvote on tomorrow and, hopefully, we will have a strong vote in support \nof it. It is inevitable that we are going to be successful because the \nAmerican people are not going to tolerate the indifference and the \nextraordinary profiteering that is being experienced in this country at \nthis time. I thank our leader for his efforts and his recommendations \nto the Senate, and I look forward to voting in support of that \ntomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/12/senate-section/article/S4014-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DETAINEE BASIC MEDICAL CARE ACT OF 2008\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

He \ncalled on all Americans to recognize the essential role public safety \nofficers play in safeguarding our rights and freedoms. That role is \neven more important in today's complex and often dangerous world.\n  We all continue to enjoy the fundamental rights of a free people \nbecause of the sacrifices of these dedicated public servants. The least \nthat we owe them in return is to protect their basic rights and to \ntreat them with the dignity and respect they deserve.\n  Unfortunately, too many of our public safety officers do not have the \nsame rights in the workplace that most Americans enjoy. Police officers \nand firefighters perform some of the most difficult and dangerous jobs \nin our society, but they often don't have a voice at work to talk about \nsafety issues. They are the ones on the front lines fighting fires, \npreventing crimes, apprehending offenders and doing their best to keep \npeople safe from harm. But they don't have a way to share the lessons \nthey have learned about how to do these difficult jobs safely and \neffectively.\n  We are asking these workers to do so much for their communities, and \nthe least we can do in return is give them a voice at the table in the \nlife-and-death discussions that affect their families and their \nfutures.\n  Across America, unions give millions of workers that kind of voice on \nthe job. Throughout history, unions have always led the fight for a \nsafer, fairer workplace. Unions mean decent wages and benefits. Unions \nmean economic security and dignity for workers, and a strong middle \nclass for our Nation.\n  Public safety officers deserve the opportunity to choose for \nthemselves whether they want the advantages that unions bring.\n  Providing these basic rights of first responders is essential not \nonly for their own interests but also for the safety of our \ncommunities, and the safety of our entire Nation. In this post-9/11 \nera, we have asked first responders to take on a new and indispensable \nrole in homeland security. We face new threats that require efficient \nand effective coordination between State and local public safety \nworkers and federal security agencies. With these new partnerships, it \nbecomes vital to our national interest that State and local public \nsafety services are carried out as effectively as possible. Studies \nshow that giving workers a voice at the table, and facilitating \ncooperation between public safety workers and their employers is the \nbest way to improve the quality of public safety services and protect \nour homeland security.\n  That is why it is an honor to join Senator Gregg in sponsoring the \nPublic Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act.\n  This important bill will ensure that all firefighters, police \nofficers, and emergency medical personnel have the opportunity to have \na voice in the policies that affect their safety and their\n\n[[Page S4015]]\n\nlivelihoods. Under this bill, public safety officers will have the \nright to form and join a union and to bargain over wages, hours, and \nworking conditions. The bill also provides a way to resolve disputes, \npromote cooperation between labor and management, and reduce the \nconflicts that can undermine public safety.\n  The legislation accomplishes these important goals in fair and \nreasonable ways. States that already have collective bargaining in \nplace for public safety workers are not affected by the bill at all. \nStates that do not currently provide this basic workplace right may \nestablish their own collective bargaining systems, or ask the \nassistance of the Federal Labor Relations Authority in doing so.\n  This approach respects the autonomy of the States. The bill sets \nbasic standards, but allows States to find their own separate ways to \nimplement these standards.\n  The bill does not dictate particular contract terms--all it requires \nis that there be a process for public safety officers and their \nemployers to come to the table and talk. Each State legislature can \nhave the last word on any agreement that is reached through these \nnegotiations. This careful approach preserves the balance between \nworkers' rights and State interests, enabling each State to have a \ncollective-bargaining system that meets its particular needs and \nrequirements.\n  Providing these basic workplace rights for all first responders will \nbenefit workers, governments, and the public safety. Collective \nbargaining is the best way to achieve these strong, cooperative \npartnerships.\n  As Dennis Compton, fire chief in the city of Phoenix, has said:\n\n       When labor and management leaders work together to build \n     mutual trust, mutual respect, and a strong commitment to \n     service, it helps focus [a] fire department on what is truly \n     most important . . . providing excellent service to the \n     customers.\n\n  Across the country, we have seen how collective bargaining and public \nsafety go hand in hand. In Omaha, the local firefighters' union and the \ncity came together to find innovative ways to meet national safety \nstandards and combat persistent hazards, such as asbestos and unsafe \ntrucks, and their cooperation is paying off. The department previously \nhad one death in the line of duty every 5 years, but since workers \nreceived a voice in decisions on safety and health, there have been no \nfatalities in 12 years.\n  In Hennepin County, MN, the union representing firefighters and \nparamedical personnel worked with management to improve services for \nthe public. Through the union, the workers in the county were able to \noffer their expertise about how to redesign the county's ambulances and \nstretchers.\n  These new designs were adopted and saved many firefighters and \nparamedics from painful back and neck injuries. In turn, the county--\nand the taxpayers--saved money in workers' compensation and disability \nbenefits.\n  Taxpayers are obtaining better service at lower cost in Miami as \nwell, because of cooperation between the firefighters' union and the \ncity. The two sides worked together to establish one of the Nation's \nforemost fire department-based emergency medical services. Response \ntime has been reduced and lives have been saved as a result.\n  Families and communities deserve the best public safety services we \ncan provide, and they start with the strong foundation that collective \nbargaining provides. Every New York City firefighter, emergency medical \ntechnician, and police officer who responded to the disaster at the \nWorld Trade Center on 9/11 was a union member under a collective \nbargaining agreement, and those agreements strengthened their ability \nto respond so effectively in that massive crisis.\n  It is long past time to stop treating our heroic first responders as \nsecond class citizens. Giving them the rights they deserve is a matter \nof fundamental fairness, and an urgent matter of public safety. I \ncommend Senator Gregg for his leadership on this very important issue, \nand I urge my colleagues to give our heroes the respect and support \nthey deserve by passing this needed legislation.\n  Mr. President, this chart indicates what I mentioned, that the union \nin Miami, together with the city, established one of the Nation's \nforemost fire department-based EMS services, and they had very \nsubstantial savings.\n  This chart is interesting. States without collective bargaining have \n39 percent more firefighter fatalities than States that do. Many fire \nchiefs acknowledge that this is a result of better communication, \nbetter cooperation, and a better exchange of information on how to do \nthe job and do it safely. That is what this legislation does. Look at \nthe difference when we are talking about fatalities. This is what is \nimportant.\n  This next chart shows that some 300,000 police officers in 24 States \nwould gain basic workplace rights under the Cooperation Act. On this \nchart, we have more than 134,000 firefighters in 24 States who would \ngain basic workplace rights. That is why these firefighters, police \nofficers, and first responders feel so strongly about this legislation.\n  It is reasonable, it is responsible, it is sound, and it is \nnecessary. We spend a good deal of time around here talking about how \nwe need greater cooperation in dealing with the central challenges on \nnational security and homeland security. Who is at the backbone of \nhomeland security in the United States? Our firefighters, police \nofficers, emergency medical services, and first responders. These are \nthe groups, as indicated on this chart, that are in strong support of \nthis legislation, for the reasons I outlined this evening.\n  I intend, in the next 2 to 3 days, as we debate this legislation, to \ngo into greater detail in all of these areas. On this issue, there is a \nstrong case to be made. The time to act is now. This is an essential \npart of our whole national domestic homeland security. It is an \nessential part of making our fellow citizens safer in their community.\n  This legislation has been reviewed and studied and has strong support \nin the Senate. It passed the House of Representatives overwhelmingly. I \nlook forward to strong support in this body.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask for 5 additional minutes to my \ntime being allocated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Tennessee will have a total of 25 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I may not use all of that time, but I \nwish to respond to the comments of the Senator from Massachusetts. And \nI will have more to say about this issue, as well, over the next 2 or 3 \ndays as we debate this proposed legislation--involving unfunded \nmandates and overturning the labor laws of 21 States--about which the \nSenator from Massachusetts was talking.\n  When I was Governor of Tennessee a few years ago, I remember the \ndebate we had about whether public safety employees--firefighters, \npolice, and others--should be allowed to collectively bargain in our \nState. The arguments we considered were many of the ones the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts talked about: Did we need to authorize collectively \nbargaining so there could be better communication, better cooperation, \na more effective fire department, a more effective police department?\n  The answer during the 8 years I was Governor was in every case, no; \nthat it was not in the public interest for the public safety employees \nto collectively bargain, organize with the inevitable strike that might \ncome because if they collectively bargained and organized, a strike was \nthe weapon they would use to assert their rights.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. No, I would rather complete my remarks.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just on that point, if the Senator is going to represent \nthe legislation, I hope he does it correctly.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I believe I have the floor, and I did \nnot say the Senator's legislation prohibits strikes, if that is his \npoint. Out of courtesy to the Senator, I will be glad to take a \nquestion from him.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We will have a chance to debate. I thought the Senator \nwas representing that this legislation permitted the option of \nstriking. It does no such thing.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. No, it does no such thing, but as we well remember, in \nNew York City, where striking by public employees is prohibited, \ntransit\n\n[[Page S4016]]\n\nworkers struck anyway because they collectively bargained and they \ndidn't like the result.\n  The point I make to the Senator from Massachusetts is that I have a \nvery different view of this issue, and so do the people of Tennessee. \nWe considered this almost every year I was Governor and decided that we \ndid not think it was in the public interest to authorize collective \nbargaining for public employees, with the exception of teachers.\n  This proposal has been considered in Tennessee repeatedly since I \nleft the Governor's office--in 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005 and \neach time the State has come to the same conclusion. Elected officials \nhave come to the same conclusion in nearly half of our States. Twenty-\none States have decided that in the case of public safety employees, \nthose we admire so much and whom we count on in times of distress, \ncollective bargaining should not be required. That is the decision of \n21 States.\n  What this legislation would do is overturn that judgment. It would \nsay the judgment of the Senator from Massachusetts is better than that \nof the State legislature of Tennessee. The judgment of the Senator of \nMassachusetts may be better for the State of Massachusetts, but I \nrespectfully suggest it is not better for the State of Tennessee. I \nimagine the Senators from 20 other States would have the same opinion.\n  When I was Governor, I didn't think my wisdom as Governor was \nsuperior to that of the mayor of Dyersburg or the mayor of Maryville or \nthe mayor of Nashville about what kinds of labor laws they ought to \nhave there--or the elected city council--or what they should decide \nabout their labor laws. I didn't try to override them in that way.\n  What I am objecting to--and we will have a chance to talk about \nthis--is the inappropriateness of the Congress of the United States \noverturning laws in 21 States that, in one form or another, do not \nallow for collective bargaining of public service employees. This \nproposed legislation would say to the mayors of small towns in \nTennessee, and there are 347 total incorporated cities and towns in \nTennessee, and 90 of them have a population greater than 5,000: You \nwill collectively bargain. Instead of dealing directly with your \nfiremen and your policemen and your other public safety employees, you \nwill appoint somebody or let them pick somebody and you will deal with \nthat person. The Senator from Massachusetts may think that creates \nbetter cooperation and a better police force, but the people of \nTennessee do not think that, and they have considered it time and time \nagain. Why should we decide we know more than they?\n  There is an amendment to the Constitution. It is called the 10th \namendment:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are \n     reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.\n\n  That is an important provision. That is the way our country was \nformed.\n  We all take an oath to this Constitution, and I believe this \nlegislation has a substantial chance of violating the 10th amendment to \nour Constitution.\n  There is one other thing it does. It inevitably imposes new costs on \nsmaller towns. Nashville has a memorandum of understanding between the \ncity government and public safety officers. It has decided to do that. \nBut most of our 90 cities with 5,000 or more people do not think that \nbetter communication is improved with public safety employees by \ncollective bargaining or even a memorandum of understanding--the latter \nof which they are permitted to do. So here we come along and say to a \nsmall town in Tennessee: You must collectively bargain; you must \nappoint this person to deal with.\n  This legislation would inevitably add to their costs. It would be an \nunfunded Federal mandate. I will have an amendment later which will say \nthat this law, if it should pass--which I hope it does not--will be \namended to provide that if the Governor or the chief executive officer \nof the city or the town in Tennessee or any other State believes this \nis an unfunded Federal mandate, the law has no effect.\n  I think we have a 10th amendment problem, and we have an unfunded \nFederal mandate problem.\n  I can remember when all the Republicans--Newt Gingrich, et cetera--in \n1994, stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and said: We have had it \nup to here with unfunded mandates. We have had it up to here with \nMembers of Congress who come up with these great ideas and then pass a \nlaw and then take credit for it and then send the bill to the Governor \nor to the mayor. That is what we would be doing here. Those same \nMembers of Congress usually go right back to Massachusetts or Tennessee \nor wherever they are from, to the Jackson Day Dinner or Lincoln Day \nDinner, and make a great speech about local control and how wise all \nthe towns are. They have town meetings up in New England. We have \ncounty commissions down in Tennessee. Members of Congress say: We \nbelieve in you towns. You are the wise people, you come in and spend \nhours debating little issues, but we, when we fly into Washington, \nsuddenly have this burst of wisdom that overrides all that you may do.\n  I think the people of this country should admire and respect and \nhonor our firefighters. But we should honor and respect and admire our \nConstitution and our Federal system and say that we may have different \nopinions in different States and different cities about what we do, and \nthen to impose a big unfunded mandate, at least violating the spirit of \nthe 10th amendment to the Constitution by telling every town in \nTennessee and 20 other States that suddenly the law is changed, you \ncannot decide your labor relations anymore, we in Washington will do \nthat for you--I think we need to rethink that.\n  You know, what the Republicans said in 1994 was: No more unfunded \nFederal mandates. If we break our promise, throw us out. Well, the \nvoters put in the Republicans--my party--in 1994 and we broke our \npromise and last year they threw us out. I think they will throw some \nmore people out if we keep ignoring the will of the people and acting \nas if, when we fly to Washington, DC, we suddenly have a right to run \namok on the 10th amendment and to overturn decisions, in my State, for \nexample, that were debated annually during the 8 years I was Governor--\nand that also were rejected in 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005.\n  This is not a bill about cooperation, this is a bill against the 10th \namendment. It is a bill, in addition, that imposes inevitably unfunded \nFederal mandates on cities and towns that are already struggling. I \nhope the Senate will reject it.\n  Mr. President, on a more optimistic note about a bigger problem, \nthere has been a lot of discussion about gas prices. I would like to \ntalk about gas prices and energy prices in a little different way.\n  Some have blamed this person, some have blamed that person, some have \noffered a short-term remedy. I would like to challenge our Senate to do \nsomething that I believe the American people would be grateful if we \ndid. Let me begin it with a short story.\n  In 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked Senator Kenneth \nMcKellar, a Tennessean who was chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, to come down to the White House for a little discussion. The \nPresident asked Senator McKellar if he could hide $2 billion in the \nappropriations bill for a secret project to win World War II, and \nSenator McKellar replied to the President: Mr. President, that will be \nno problem. I just have one question: Where in Tennessee do you want me \nto hide it?\n  That $2 billion and that place in Tennessee became Oak Ridge, TN, one \nof three secret cities that became the principal sites of what was then \ncalled the Manhattan Project. The purpose of the Manhattan Project was \nto find a way to split the atom and build a bomb before Germany did so \nthe United States could win World War II. Nearly 200,000 people worked \nin 30 sites in 3 countries at breakneck speed until they succeeded. The \n$2 billion appropriation President Roosevelt asked for would be $24 \nbillion today.\n  According to New York Times science reporter William Laurence:\n\n       Into [the project] went millions of man-hours of what is \n     without doubt the most concentrated intellectual effort in \n     history.\n\n  On last Friday, I went back to Oak Ridge, one of those secret \ncities--now out in the open--and proposed that the United States launch \na new Manhattan Project, this one a 5-year project to put\n\n[[Page S4017]]\n\nAmerica firmly on the path to clean energy independence. Instead of \nending a war, the goal will be clean energy independence so we can deal \nwith rising gas prices, electricity prices, clean air, climate change, \nand national security--for our country first and then, because the \nworld has the same urgent needs, for the rest of the world.\n\n  By ``independence,'' I do not mean the United States would never buy \noil from Mexico or Canada or Saudi Arabia. By ``independence,'' I do \nmean the United States could never be held hostage by any country for \nour oil supplies.\n  In 1942, many were afraid that Germany would get the bomb and \nblackmail the world. Today, countries that supply oil and natural gas \ncan blackmail the world.\n  Some have questioned whether the word ``independence'' is the right \nword. I believe it is exactly the right word. Go to the dictionary. The \ndictionary says that independence means you don't want to be controlled \nby someone. Our war of independence against Great Britain didn't mean \nwe would never talk to them--we just didn't want to be in their pocket.\n  I think the American people understand what we mean by clean energy \nindependence. It is the right goal, and I would say the scientists in \nOak Ridge whom I talked with on Friday seemed to agree.\n  A new Manhattan Project is not a new idea. But it is a good idea and \nfits the goal of clean energy independence. The Apollo program was a \nsort of Manhattan Project. It sent men to the Moon.\n  Senator McCain and Senator Obama have each suggested a new Manhattan \nProject for energy. I think it is time for us to begin to put some \nflesh on the suggestion. What would they mean? Have something ready for \nthem and for us that we could move ahead with. Many Senators have made \na similar suggestion. It is time to do more than talk.\n  During the passage of the America COMPETES Act, we worked together \nacross party lines--the Senator from Massachusetts, who was just here, \nwas key to that. I worked hard on it. Senators McCain and Obama and \nothers worked on it as well. Senators Domenici and Bingaman were the \nleaders on that legislation here in the Senate. Several suggested as \npart of that discussion on how to preserve America's competitive edge \nthat we should focus on energy because focusing on energy independence \nwould force the kinds of investments we need to keep our competitive \nposition in the world.\n  In 1942, the prospect was that Germany would get the bomb before we \ndid. That was the overwhelming challenge. The overwhelming challenge \ntoday, according to National Academy of Sciences president Ralph \nCicerone, in his address to the academy 2 weeks ago, is to discover \nways to satisfy the human demand for and the use of energy in an \nenvironmentally satisfactory and affordable way so that we are not \noverly dependent on overseas sources.\n  Cicerone estimates that this year Americans will pay $500 billion \noverseas for oil; that is $1,600 for each one of us, some of it to \nnations that are funding terrorists who are trying to kill us. It \nweakens our dollar. It is half our trade deficit. It is forcing \ngasoline prices toward $4 a gallon and is crushing family budgets.\n  Then there are the environmental consequences. If worldwide energy \nusage continues to grow as it has, humans will inject as much \nCO2 to the air from fossil fuel burning between 2000 to 2030 \nas they did from 1850 to 2000.\n  There is plenty of coal to help achieve our energy independence, but \nthere is no commercial way yet to capture and store the carbon from so \nmuch coal burning--and we have not finished the job of controlling \nsulfur and nitrogen and mercury emissions.\n  I suggest the Manhattan Project of World War II fits today's proposal \nfor a new Manhattan Project for energy in the following ways. The \noriginal project proceeded as fast as possible along several tracks to \nreach one goal. The entire project, one engineer said, was a shotgun \napproach, using all possible approaches simultaneously. It had \nPresidential focus and bipartisan support in Congress. It had the kind \nof centralized, gruff leadership that only an Army Corps of Engineers \ngeneral could give it. It broke the mold.\n  Dr. Oppenheimer told his scientists in 1945 that the bomb was ``too \nrevolutionary to consider in the framework of old ideas.'' So is clean \nenergy independence. It began with a small, diverse group of great \nminds, as this one needs to as well.\n  There are also some lessons from the America COMPETES Act that we \nenacted just last year. Remember how that started. A bipartisan group \nof us asked the National Academies: Please give us 10 things that we, \nthe Congress and the Government, should do to keep our brainpower \nadvantage so our jobs don't go overseas. The National Academies took us \nseriously, and within 3 months assembled a small group of wise men and \nwomen headed by Norm Augustine, and they gave us 20 recommendations, \nand we considered them. The President had his ideas. We considered \nproposals by other competitiveness commissions. The Speaker of the \nHouse weighed in. Within a couple of years--it got a little messy a few \ntimes--we passed a blueprint which will put us on a path to double our \ninvestments in the physical sciences and significantly upgrade our \ncompetitiveness efforts from Washington.\n  Some people have suggested that this year is not a very good year to \ntry such a bipartisan approach. I think it is a perfect year to try a \nbipartisan approach. Senator Obama and Senator McCain and Senator \nClinton seem ready for it. Congressman Bart Gordon, the Democratic \nchairman of the House Science Committee is supportive--we were together \nin Oak Ridge on Friday. He and I are equally interested in this, just \nas we were equal participants in the America COMPETES legislation.\n  I have talked to Senator Bingaman and Senator Domenici and Senator \nMurkowski. Many other Senators--I will not begin to mention them all--\nhave suggested this idea. I would say a Presidential election is a \nperfect time for this. Voters expect us to have answers to $4 gasoline, \nfor climate change, for clean air, and to the national security \nimplications of our overdependence on foreign oil.\n  The people did not elect us to take a vacation this year just because \nit is a Presidential election year. So how to proceed? When I spoke \nwith Senator Bingaman, the chairman of the Energy Committee, he said: \nWell, instead of a single Manhattan Project, maybe we need several mini \nManhattan projects. And he offered to me the example that Chuck Vest, \nthe former MIT President who is the head of the National Institute of \nEngineering, has made.\n  Dr. Vest made an address in which he suggested 14 grand challenges \nfor the 21st century for engineering; three of them had to do with \nenergy.\n  I think Dr. Vest and Senator Bingaman are right. We do not do \ncomprehensive very well. I think we proved that with the collapse of \nthe comprehensive immigration bill. Step-by-step solutions along \ndifferent tracks toward a single goal are easier to digest and have \nfewer surprises. And, of course, the Manhattan Project itself in World \nWar II proceeded that way.\n  So here would be my criteria for choosing several grand challenges \ntoward the goal of clean energy independence:\n  Grand consequences: This is not a project for small thinking.\n  Real scientific breakthroughs: We know how to build nuclear \npowerplants. I think we should be doing it. We know how to drill 50 \nmiles offshore for oil and gas in an environmentally safe way, giving a \nlarge part of the revenues to the States so that they can then put them \nin trust funds for education. I think we should be doing it.\n  We know how to do a great many things that we are not doing. But this \nshould not be about doing things that we already know how to do. This \nshould be about the scientific breakthroughs to help us within 5 years \nget firmly on a path to clean energy independence.\n  Family budget: Our solutions need to fit the family budget so gas \nprices and electricity prices are something that we can afford.\n  And finally consensus: We need to come to some consensus. We found \nwith the America COMPETES Act that when we went for consensus, we could \npass an important bill. And the members of the Augustine panel wisely \nput aside some subjects relevant to competitiveness, like excessive \nlitigation,\n\n[[Page S4018]]\n\nwhich we could argue about for days. They left that to the side and \nfocused on 20 things they thought we could agree on, and we did.\n  So here are seven grand challenges that I would respectfully suggest \nto begin the suggestion, seven scientific breakthroughs that I believe \nwe should focus on for the next 5 years to put us firmly on a path to \nclean energy independence which fit the criteria that I outlined.\n  No. 1, make plug-in electric cars and trucks commonplace. And let me \noffer another story. Most people remember H. Ross Perot. Many people \nmay have forgotten how he made his money. He noticed that the banks in \nDallas in the 1960s were closing their doors at 5 o'clock and turning \noff their new computers. So Mr. Perot asked the banks: May I buy your \nidle nighttime computer capacity?\n  And they said, yes.\n  He then went to States such as Tennessee, before I was Governor, and \nsaid: May I manage your Medicaid data? I have some computer time.\n  They said yes.\n  So the banks made a lot of money, the States saved a little money, \nand Mr. Perot made a billion dollars.\n  Now, what does that have to do with clean energy? I would mention \nthis: I believe the idle nighttime computer capacity of the 1960s is a \nlot like the idle nighttime power plant capacity in the United States \ntoday.\n  An example: The Tennessee Valley Authority in my neck of the woods, \nwhich produces about 3 percent of all of the electricity in the United \nStates, has the equivalent of 7,000 or 8,000 megawatts of electricity \nidle most nights. That would be our largest untapped resource in the \nregion: I would think every night, or most nights, seven or eight \nnuclear powerplants' worth of unused electricity.\n  Add to that how, beginning in 2010, Nissan, Toyota, General Motors, \nand Ford--and possibly others--will sell electric cars that can be \nplugged into wall sockets. FedEx is already using hybrid electricity \ndelivery trucks. TVA could offer smart meters. Many utilities are doing \nthat. That would allow its 9 million customers at night to plug their \ncar or truck in and for a few dollars fill up with electricity and then \ndrive to work and back without using a drop of gasoline.\n  It might take a while, but it has been estimated that because 60 \npercent of Americans drive less than 30 miles a day, we could gradually \nreplace most of our light cars and trucks with plug-in electric \nvehicles that do not use gasoline and cut our overseas oil bill by \nperhaps as much as half.\n  In other words, we have got the plugs, the cars are coming, we need \nthe cord. To good to be true? Well, have not Presidents back to Nixon \npromised a revolutionary car? It has never happened. But times have \nchanged. Batteries are better, gas is $4.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  The second grand challenge would be to make carbon capture and \nstorage a reality for coal-burning power plants. This also was one of \nthe National Institute of Engineering's grand challenges. And there may \nbe solutions other than underground storage, such as using algae to \ncapture carbon. Interesting, the National Resource Defense Council \nargues that, after conservation, coal with carbon capture is the best \noption for clean energy independence because it provides for the \ngrowing power needs of the U.S. and will be easily adopted by other \ncountries.\n  No. 3, make solar power cost competitive with power from fossil \nfuels. This is a second of the National Institute of Engineering's \ngrand challenges. Solar power, despite 50 years of trying, produces on \none-hundredth of one percent of America's electricity. The cost of \nputting solar panels on homes averages $25,000-$30,000 and the \nelectricity produced, for the most part, can't be stored. Now, there is \nnew photovoltaic research as well as promising solar thermal power \nplants, which capture the sunlight using mirrors, turn heat into steam, \nand store it underground until the customer needs it.\n  No. 4, safely reprocess and store nuclear waste. Nuclear plants \nproduce 20 percent of America's electricity, but 70 percent of \nAmerica's clean electricity--that is, electricity that does not pollute \nthe air with mercury, nitrogen, sulfur, or carbon. The most important \nbreakthrough needed during the next five years to build more nuclear \npower plants is solving the problem of what to do with nuclear waste. A \npolitical stalemate has stopped nuclear waste from going to Yucca \nMountain in Nevada, and $15 billion collected from ratepayers for that \npurpose is sitting in a bank. Recycling waste could reduce its mass by \n90 percent, creating less stuff to store temporarily while long-term \nstorage is resolved.\n  No. 5, make advanced biofuels cost-competitive with gasoline. The \nbacklash toward ethanol made from corn because of its effect on food \nprices is a reminder to beware of the great law of unintended \nconsequences when issuing grand challenges. Ethanol from cellulosic \nmaterials shows great promise, but there are a limited number of cars \ncapable of using alternative fuels and of places for drivers to buy it. \nTurning coal into liquid fuel is an established technology, but \nexpensive and a producer of much carbon.\n  No. 6, make new buildings green buildings. Japan believes it may miss \nits 2012 Kyoto goals for greenhouse gas reductions primarily because of \nenergy wasted by inefficient buildings. Many of the technologies needed \nto do this are known. Figuring out how to accelerate their use in a \ndecentralized society is most of this grand challenge.\n  No. 7, provide energy from fusion. The idea of recreating on Earth \nthe way the sun creates energy and using it for commercial power is the \nthird grand challenge suggested by the National Institute of \nEngineering. The promise of sustaining a controlled fusion reaction for \ncommercial power generation is so fantastic that the five-year goal \nshould be to do everything possible to reach the long-term goal. The \nfailure of Congress to approve the President's budget request for U.S. \nparticipation in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor--\nthe ITER Project--is embarrassing.\n  To sum up the seven grand challenges: No. 1, make plug-in electric \ncars and trucks commonplace; No. 2, make carbon capture and storage a \nreality for coal-burning power plants; No. 3, make solar power cost \ncompetitive with power from fossil fuels; No. 4, safely process and \nstore nuclear waste; No. 5, make advanced biofuels cost competitive \nwith gasoline. That would be fuel made from crops that we cannot eat, \nnot crops that we can.\n  No. 6, make new buildings green buildings; and, No. 7, provide energy \nfrom fusion.\n  This is a longer range goal, but one we should work on. Our country \nis remarkable. We have all of the talent that we had during the time of \nthe original Manhattan Project in terms of university brain power, \nlaboratories, private sector companies. We still believe anything is \npossible.\n  These are precisely the ingredients we need during the next 5 years \nto place ourselves firmly on a path toward clean energy independence \nwithin a generation, and in doing so to make our jobs more secure, to \nhelp balance the family budget, to make our air cleaner, and our planet \nsafer and healthier, and to lead the world to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington State.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise tonight to continue the \ndiscussion on the votes we are going to have tomorrow on this important \nlegislation and, really, what will be the start of the legislative \nalternative to deal with the high price of gasoline.\n  I know tomorrow there is going to be a vote, and many of my \ncolleagues have come to the floor talking about the high price of \ngasoline and what we need to do about it.\n  I know going home this weekend and filling up my own car I spent over \n$3.80, and almost $3.90 a gallon. It is not lost on the consumers of \nWashington State that this problem has to be fixed.\n  Many of my colleagues are talking about supply. And while I wish this \nwas an issue of simple supply and demand, I think the market is showing \nus that it is not about supply and demand; that it is about the \nmanipulation of oil markets and the fact that we have deregulated the \nenergy futures market and created loopholes so that the speculators can \nhave their say in how the market functions without the proper oversight \nthat I think we need to restore.\n\n[[Page S4019]]\n\n  So we are going to have a chance to talk about that later when the \nDemocratic proposal is put forward before the Senate. But tonight I \nwant to make sure my colleagues understand this is not an issue about \ngetting more supply out of the United States. I have been on the Senate \nfloor several times talking about energy executives saying that it is \nnot the companies that have been holding up the supply in the United \nStates or that is going to solve this problem.\n  But I think it is important to look at the world's oil market and to \nunderstand that the United States only has 3 percent of the world's oil \nreserves. We are not in the top 10 leading countries in producing oil. \nAnd this exaggerated chart on size shows the top countries with the \nmost oil: Saudi Arabia and Iran and Iraq and Kuwait and UAE. And this \nshows by proportion, for national size, how small the United States is. \nThe United States is over here because we do not have that much supply \nof oil. In fact, if you look on the chart, the top 10 countries, we are \nnot in the top 10 countries in supply of oil. So the bottom line is, do \nwe want to continue to be reliant on these countries for an oil supply \nor do we want to diversify? I think many of my colleagues realize we \nhave to take aggressive steps to diversify a little differently.\n  Here is a pie chart that shows exactly where the world oil reserves \nare: 20 percent in Saudi Arabia, Iraq is another big number, Iran is \nanother big number. This little red piece of the pie here, 2 percent; 2 \npercent is what the United States has. So this notion that we are going \nto dramatically change this equation for the U.S. consumer or the price \nof gas by taking that 2 percent of the world's oil reserves and somehow \nmaximizing it, I do not care how much you maximize it, I do not care \nhow or where you drill, you are not going to change the impact on the \nprice of oil today on the market when these are the other players. \nThese are the people who are dominating the marketplace.\n  So I think it is very important that we get a handle on this \nsituation. We have seen now that oil has been over $125 a barrel. At \none point in time last Friday, oil closed at $126, and went back down.\n  But we keep seeing this inch up every day. You turn on the \ntelevision, the situation does not seem as though there is any relief \nin sight. This keeps going up. This is the national average, $3.71. In \nmy State I clearly saw $3.80. I will not be surprised if it is even \nhigher than that. And we have to do something to give consumers relief. \nThey cannot continue to afford to pay this price.\n  Well, we have listened now to oil company executives. I like to \nlisten to what they have to say about this matter because they are the \npeople who are involved in the supply and demand on a daily basis. They \nare the ones who are going out and getting this product and putting it \nin the marketplace.\n  Here is the CEO of Marathon Oil, who said:\n\n       $100 oil is not justified by the physical demands in the \n     market.\n\n  It is not justified. So here we are, a lot of these executives having \ntestified before various House and Senate committees saying that oil \nshould be at $60 a barrel. They are saying it is not even justified at \n$100 a barrel. What is causing this problem?\n  I would have to say that the $100 a barrel in the market is \ndefinitely causing problems with various industries. Last week we heard \nfrom some in the airline industry who were testifying before the \nCommerce Committee. These are their first quarter losses: Delta, $274 \nmillion; American Airlines, $328 million; United, $537 million.\n  When you talk to them about these losses, because these are things \nthat help take care of the employees, take care of pensions, take care \nof bills, they will tell you that fuel costs used to be the second \nexpense in the business. Now it is No. 1 because of the extraordinary \ncosts of fuel. And these are the losses they are racking up because of \nthat.\n  This is what one market analyst basically was saying about out-of-\ncontrol jet fuel prices:\n\n       Should the current fuel prices persist, the impact on \n     airline industry profitability is expected to rival if not \n     exceed that of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\n  This is a quote from a JP Morgan analyst. What they are saying is, I \nthink people here remember how dramatic the impact was on the airline \nindustry after 9/11, how people did not want to fly. Here is an analyst \nsaying, if this keeps going, it is going to be worse than 9/11.\n  I had a flight attendant tell me the same thing this weekend. She \nsaid: You know, we survived 9/11 and the terrorist attacks. We survived \nbankruptcy and reorganization. Now we have to survive this. I do not \nknow that we can do it if oil just keeps going up and up and up.\n  That is what these people are saying; that it is going to get as \ndramatic as the impact that we saw from 9/11 if we do not deal with \nthis issue. Well, one way I can tell you that we are not going to deal \nwith it, and not because of the legislative approach, simply because if \nit even was a solution, drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge would \nonly reduce it by a few pennies per gallon when it is at its full peak \nproduction, say, 10 to 20 years from now. And the fact that it would \nonly be two pennies per gallon, if you average that out over what a \nconsumer buys in a year, we are only talking about a few dollars to the \nAmerican consumer because I go back to that chart where it shows the \nUnited States with only 2 percent. How can we affect the price? These \nare new updated numbers.\n  Basically, the fact is, you cannot affect the price by drilling in \nthe Arctic Wildlife Refuge. That should tell us something. This is a \nfalse argument on the other side about the supply.\n  Our own administration, the Energy Information Administration, came \nto the conclusion that if we would drill in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge \nthinking that we were going to put world supply on the market, this was \ntheir conclusion, not mine.\n  They said: OPEC could countermand any potential price impact of ANWR \ncoastal plain production by reducing its exports by an equal amount and \nbasically continuing to keep the price high.\n  So this notion we are debating tonight, that somehow we are going to \ndrill our way to energy security and lower the $120-plus barrel of oil, \neven by the account or our own Energy Information Administration, is \nnot correct.\n  So what do we want to do? Democrats want to police the oil and gas \nmarkets. Democrats want to police these markets because we are tired of \nthe oil company executives saying that prices are not justified. We are \ntired of analysts saying that this price is not justified. We are tired \nof looking at the results when we deregulate the energy futures market \nand allow excessive speculation without proper controls. Like we have \non the stock exchange, like we have on other exchanges such as NYMEX \nand the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, we want rules in place. We want \nrules in place so consumers can be protected.\n  We know hedge funds are playing a big role here. This is not my \nquote. This is from Ann Davis of the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Hedge funds are taking ever-larger bets in a futures market \n     that is smaller than the stock or bond markets, and the funds \n     are using borrowed money to maximize their bets, magnifying \n     the impact on [energy market] prices. That is why people on \n     this side of the aisle have talked about a few things such as \n     closing loopholes and making sure there is transparency in \n     the energy markets. The Amaranth case showed the harm of this \n     excessive speculation and large trader positions without \n     proper market controls. Amaranth was a natural gas company \n     that basically took huge positions in the natural gas market, \n     and because we had deregulated the oversight of that energy \n     trading, they were able to manipulate the market. And after \n     they got out of the marketplace because they crashed after \n     some of their manipulative activities, we were able to see a \n     huge decrease in the price of natural gas. So we know these \n     hedge funds are able to impact the price of energy, and we \n     are very concerned about that.\n\n  We know that after the electricity market crisis, we were able to put \nnew rules into place for electricity and natural gas. It ended up \nhaving a very positive impact. In fact, this is what the chairman of \nthe FERC said about that:\n\n       The manipulative schemes in question were designed to lower \n     the prices in [a futures] market in order to benefit \n     positions held in a [physical] market.\n\n  I want my colleagues to understand how this works, but here is what \nthe\n\n[[Page S4020]]\n\nchairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that has oversight \nover electricity and natural gas markets said. What he was pointing to \nis the fact that people were driving up the physical price of oil by \nmanipulating the futures market. When the futures market isn't \nregulated, the price is easier to manipulate. Right now some oil \nfutures for 2015 delivery are well over $100 a barrel, and that is \ngoing to continue to dictate the price of oil markets in the future.\n  One analyst basically said the Government must act:\n\n       Unless the U.S. government steps in to rein in speculators' \n     power in the market, prices will just keep going up.\n\n  If we have analysts on Wall Street telling us we should act and do \nsomething, they are telling us what is happening on Wall Street. Here \nis an energy analyst saying:\n\n       Unless the U.S. government steps in to rein in speculators' \n     power in the market, prices will just keep going up.\n\n  The reason why they are saying that is there are exemptions for oil \nthat aren't there for other commodities. Cattle futures is an example. \nIf you want to trade in cattle futures, you are not exempt from CFTC \noversight. You have to register at an exchange. You have daily \nreporting requirements. That is so somebody who comes in and takes a \nbig position in oil to impact the price and trades around to impact the \nprice can be evaluated, and the CFTC and others can understand exactly \nwhat is going on and there is speculative limits. But look over here at \noil trading, not on the NYMEX but on this other international \ncontinental exchange, and you see none of the same requirements. So we \nhave deregulated this on this side, and now we wonder why oil has gone \nfrom $60 a barrel to $125 a barrel. It is not supply and demand. People \nin the industry will tell you it is not supply and demand. You have oil \ncompany executives telling you it is not supply and demand. You have \nanalysts telling you it is time for us to do something to restore the \noversight and transparency so the markets function properly.\n  I hope we get to this debate on the Senate floor in the next week or \nso.\n  As I said, we will be out here to talk more about that because there \nare several factors in the proposals we are talking about that I think \nwill be important. Obviously, closing the Enron loophole is critical, \nwhich we are trying to push out of this body in a final farm bill \nconference report; this will require oversight of all oil futures in \nthe futures markets, which my colleagues, Senator Levin and Senator \nFeinstein, and others have been working on; getting the FTC to \nimplement market rules, and they are in the process of doing that. Our \nbody has to have a huge oversight in making sure the proper rules are \nput in place. We want to make sure the price-gouging legislation that \nis being proposed in the Democratic package gets passed. But having the \nDepartment of Justice continue to help in this effort to look at the \nfact that there has been this lack of transparency and funny business \ngoing on in the marketplace is going to be very important for us to \ncontinue to police these markets.\n  I urge my colleagues to think about the fact that this is a real \ncrisis, that our economy can't continue to pay these prices, and that \nthere is nothing wrong with bona fide speculation, but there is \ncertainly something wrong with excessive speculation and with markets \nthat don't have sufficient transparency and oversight or rules in place \nto make sure it is functioning correctly. That is why Democrats want to \nmake sure we police the oil and gas markets to protect consumers. We \nare going to propose that through votes on the Senate floor. We are \ngoing to continue to push Federal agencies such as the FTC and the \nDepartment of Justice and the CFTC to do their jobs.\n\n  If I may, Mr. President, on a separate note, I saw last week one of \nthe solar companies made an announcement on their earnings. I will not \ndetail the company today, but the company was very specific in its \nannouncement. It had increased record sales. They were very excited \nabout what was happening in the solar market. But they announced they \nwere going to lay off people, and they were going to cancel jobs. They \nsaid in their earnings statement, because this is what companies have \nto do, you have to give guidance to your investors. You have to tell \nthem what are you are going to do for the rest of the year. This \ncompany made this announcement, and it said, because Congress is not \ngiving predictability about the investment tax credit, we can't plan \nfor the future for these projects. So we will be canceling projects, \nand we will be laying off people.\n  I say that tonight because I am frustrated we have not been able to \nget the production tax credits and investment tax credits passed. I \nthought we would get to this point where companies would start \ncanceling projects and thought that we had until about the first \nquarter of this year and their earnings statements where, again, they \nhave to give guidance and tell the public what is going on. But that is \nwhere we are. We need to do our job. If we believe in this situation \nwhere we are right now with this energy crisis out of control and the \nfuture being uncertain, it is time to invest in different types of \nenergy solutions. I know many of my colleagues, 88 of us here, support \ngetting a bill out and passed over to the House of Representatives. I \nknow there has been a debate between the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives on that measure and exactly how to pay for it.\n  What I can say to my colleagues is that when we start losing jobs and \ncanceling projects that are needed for energy production, we haven't \ndone our job. It is time for us to put differences aside and to get \nthis investment tax credit and production tax credit passed and get it \nimplemented so we can save this investment cycle and save the \nproduction for what is going to be much needed in future generations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the McConnell \namendment which is based on legislation introduced by the senior \nSenator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, who was joined by several of us \nas cosponsors and which seeks a responsible comprehensive national \nenergy policy.\n  First, I would like to thank Senator Domenici for his continued \nleadership on this issue. For years, many of us have followed his lead \nin trying to guide us toward policies that would expand our domestic \nproduction and supply of energy. Quite frankly, if more of my \ncolleagues had listened to him, we would likely not be here on the \nfloor today decrying the high cost of energy, especially gasoline.\n  There are three necessary components that we must address to move us \ntoward an energy independent future: Supply, conservation, and \nalternative sources. I and many of my colleagues understand that \nconservation and alternative sources are critical pieces of this \npuzzle. We took some steps to address those issues in the 2000 energy \nbill with higher CAFE standards and incentives for technological \ninnovation such as hybrids and fuel cells. This amendment before us \ndeals with the third of the three necessary components--domestic \nsupply--because none of the three are by themselves sufficient to \nachieve real energy security.\n  The United States is in the midst of an energy crisis. The folks in \nmy State know that all too well. Every day they are working harder and \nsmarter to make ends meet as the prices of the most basic essentials, \nfood and energy, continue to rise at record rates. Between 2000 and \n2005, 208,000 manufacturing jobs in Ohio have been lost, and 3 million \nnationwide, in part because of high energy costs that have forced \nemployers to find savings elsewhere such as payrolls.\n  There is no question that because of the high cost of natural gas, we \nhave gone from a country where we exported some $19 billion of chemical \nproducts to now importing chemical products. The reason for that is we \ndidn't realize natural gas was part of the food stock we needed for the \nchemical industry.\n  Energy costs have been skyrocketing in Ohio. Since 2000, gasoline \ncosts have risen 175 percent. Natural gas is up 107 percent. Heating \noil prices are up 130 percent. The nearly 350,000 Ohio families with \nannual incomes of less than $10,000 are now spending more than 47 \npercent of their aftertax income on energy costs. You wonder how people \nare able to handle these additional costs they are paying.\n  I believe it is the result of a tail-wagging-the-dog environmental \npolicy that\n\n[[Page S4021]]\n\nhas ignored our energy and economic needs. This policy prevents us from \ntaking advantage of our domestic sources of energy and has helped put \nus in the current crisis. The chickens have come home to roost. Many of \nus predicted it 8 or 9 years ago. No one seemed to listen.\n  We need to enact an energy policy that broadens our base of energy \nresources to create stability, maintain reasonable prices, and protect \nour Nation's security. It must be a policy that will keep energy \naffordable, and it must be a policy that would not cripple the engines \nof commerce that fund the research that will yield environmental \nprotection technologies for the future.\n  We need a ``second declaration of independence'' to move us away from \nforeign sources of energy in the near term and away from oil in the \nlong term. While we may not become truly independent of foreign energy, \nwe must make investments today that will help us achieve our goal \ntomorrow, including renewable fuels and alternative methods of powering \nour vehicles, such as hybrids, plug-ins, and fuel cells.\n  I believe the country that becomes least dependent on oil is the \ncountry that is going to be prevailing in this century. Other countries \nare becoming addicted to oil, and we all have heard about why some of \nthis is happening today. The Chinese are building automobiles every day \nand sucking up as much oil as they possibly can from whatever source \nthey can get it.\n  I believe this crisis was foreseeable. Since I entered the Senate in \n1999, Congress has chosen not to design a comprehensive, long-term \nnational energy policy. We have failed to harmonize our energy, \nenvironmental, and economic needs. Unless we do, we will experience a \ndiminished standard of living in the future.\n  I have been calling for increased domestic production for years. \nBefore I came to the Senate, Congress and President Clinton had a \nchance to open ANWR to responsible oil exploration. In 1995, when oil \nwas only $19 a barrel--did you hear that, $19 a barrel--President \nClinton vetoed increased domestic production. In addition, many of us \nhave been trying to open the Outer Continental Shelf to expanded \nexploration for years. Again, we have been blocked. Had we opened these \ndomestic sources of oil and gas years ago, prices of gasoline, natural \ngas, and home heating oil would not be where they are today. As I said, \nthe chickens have come home to roost.\n  A few years ago, we finally made some limited progress when we passed \nthe 2005 Energy bill. That bill should have been passed early on in \nthis century. We debated it back in 2003 for 6 weeks, and then it got \nstopped because we could not get the Senate to agree to it. We finally, \nas I say, got it done in 2005. That bill took some good steps forward. \nIt provides incentives for more oil and gas production. It increases \nthe use of clean coal technologies, nuclear power, and renewable \nsources of electricity and fuel, and it encourages conservation.\n  We need to do more, however, if we are to continue to remain \ncompetitive in the global economy. We need a plan for a future of tight \nenergy supplies in the near term and plan accordingly so we have a \nstable bridge to the future that does not set us at a disadvantage \nagainst other countries. In the short term, we need to wake up to the \nfact that our Nation will continue to rely on more traditional forms of \nenergy, such as oil, coal, and natural gas, to fuel our vibrant \neconomy, as no viable alternatives are yet available to take their \nplace.\n  This is important not just for the economy but for our national \nsecurity and our environment. In this era when the United States is \nengaged in the war on terror, energy independence is even more \ncritical. So many of the world's energy exporters are also breeding \ngrounds for the terrorists and anti-American regimes, such as \nVenezuela, that want to destroy America. Being dependent on these \nregimes for our energy supply increases the danger to our way of life.\n  American people should also understand that more and more countries \nare nationalizing their oil. As a result, they are driving out \ncompanies that could invest in exploration, as has been the case in \nVenezuela, and the same way in Russia. So we are seeing a situation--\nand I have heard the arguments that we have to get the Commerce \nDepartment and other Federal agencies involved, but some of the problem \nwe have is as they nationalize the oil, what they do not do is the \nexploration that is needed to produce the oil that should be coming on \nthe marketplace.\n  Increasing domestic energy production, renewable sources, and \nalternatives to oil would help smooth this country's transition to a \ncarbon-constrained world.\n  But we are on the cusp of another gathering storm--a storm that could \ndeal a destructive blow to my State of Ohio's already struggling \neconomy and our quality of life. In its wake, we could see the loss of \nhundreds of good-paying jobs, shocking increases in natural gas, \nelectricity, and gasoline prices, and pocket-numbing decreases in \nhousehold incomes. I know Americans right now are up against it. But I \ncan tell you, we ain't seen nothing yet if this legislation that is now \npending in Congress is passed.\n  This storm comes in the form of current legislative efforts in \nWashington to mandate massive reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide \nand other greenhouse gases. The debate is not about whether these \nreductions are necessary. I think I make that very clear; these \nreductions are necessary. Most of us agree to that. And we must act \nquickly to address climate change. The debate is about whether to \ninvest the time and effort necessary to do it in a responsible, \ncomprehensive, and progrowth fashion as opposed to rushing through an \nirresponsible, piecemeal plan that will raise energy costs on already \nhurting families, send jobs overseas, and fail to help the environment \nas intended.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works \nSubcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety, I am at the center of the \ndebate, and I believe Ohioans should pay close attention. The decisions \nmade could result in the most massive bureaucratic intrusion into the \nlives of Americans since the creation of the Internal Revenue Service.\n  As I mentioned, I have long championed harmonizing our economic, \nenergy, and environmental needs. I did so as mayor of Cleveland, as \nGovernor of Ohio, and we had great success in bringing both sides to \nthe table for the betterment of our State and Nation. That is why I am \nso committed to educating my colleagues and Ohioans about the \nunprecedented opportunity we have before us when it comes to crafting a \ncomprehensive solution to climate change. We must be smart and measured \nin our steps forward, always keeping in mind what is best for working \nfamilies, seniors, and those trying to make ends meet on fixed incomes.\n  The smart way to go about addressing this problem is not through \nunilateral actions that would hurt our economy and drive jobs overseas. \nThe policy proposal now under consideration in the Senate--the \nLieberman-Warner Climate Security Act--would do exactly that.\n  A recent analysis of the bill by the Environmental Protection Agency \nprovided a devastating critique of their policy proposal, estimating \nthat passage could result in annual losses in gross domestic product as \nhigh as $2.5 trillion by 2030. By 2050, annual losses in the GDP could \nbe as high as $5 trillion, with electricity rates doubling over the \nsame period of time.\n  The impact of this legislation will be disproportionately felt in \nStates such as Ohio that depend on coal for much of their energy needs. \nDuke Energy, a major electricity provider in Ohio, has released data \nindicating that if the policy becomes effective in 2012, customers in \ntheir service area could suffer a 53-percent increase in their \nelectricity bills.\n  According to a recent study by the American Council for Capital \nFormation, Ohio would lose 139,000 jobs by 2020. By 2050, net job \nlosses could grow as high as 487,000. And with Ohio consumers paying as \nmuch as 29 percent more for gasoline, 50 percent more for natural gas, \nand 80 percent more for electricity, disposable household income would \nbe reduced by about $2,000 per year by 2020 and $3,500 per year by \n2050.\n  Additionally, the Lieberman-Warner bill completely disregards the \ninternational dimension of the problem. Countries such as China and \nIndia refuse to slow their economic development in order to address \nclimate\n\n[[Page S4022]]\n\nchange. China--and listen to this one--puts two new coal-fired \npowerplants in service every week and now uses more coal than the \nUnited States, the European Union, and Japan combined. India is in the \nprocess of building the largest coal mine in the world. With facts like \nthese, America could totally shut down all of our emissions-producing \nactivities and we would not make a dent in CO2 emissions.\n\n  Americans should not suffer for symbolism while countries such as \nChina and India emit increasingly large quantities of greenhouse gases \nwithout consequences. Ohioans are already struggling with the cost of \nliving due to higher prices for gasoline, home heating fuel, \nelectricity, food, and health care. Lieberman-Warner will only make \nthings worse.\n  We cannot tolerate policies that harm our economy and drive \nbusinesses overseas to countries that do not recognize their \nenvironmental responsibilities or just do not have the political will \nto act. If we do, we will be worse off on two counts: fewer jobs and an \nenvironment that is not any cleaner than when we started.\n  That is why I am spearheading the development of an alternative \nsolution to climate change which is less intrusive, less costly, and \nwill more quickly achieve greater environmental benefits than the one \noption now before us. The smart way to address this problem is through \ncollaborative, multinational efforts to develop and deploy the clean \nenergy technologies that everyone recognizes as necessary to solve this \nglobal environmental problem.\n  I am pleased, with the support of our President, that consideration \nis being given to a clean energy technology fund--of some $2 billion we \nwould participate in--an international clean energy technology fund. I \nknow from reading a paper by Dr. Lin Jiang that China is giving serious \nthought to working with us. In a paper called ``The Nexus of Energy, \nGlobal Warming, and Environmental Concerns: Opportunities for U.S.-\nChina Cooperation,'' Dr. Lin wrote:\n\n       It is clear that greater investment is urgently needed to \n     help China develop cost-effective methods to use coal more \n     cleanly, through, for example, gasification and carbon \n     capture and storage (CCS)2. Collaboration between the U.S. \n     and China in accelerating the adoption of such technologies \n     could be mutually beneficial, since the U.S. is equally \n     abundant in coal reserve as well.\n\n  The Asian Pacific Partnership, which resulted from the passage of the \nHagel-Pryor-Voinovich, et al. bill, is in its infancy in sharing \ntechnological breakthroughs on controlling carbon emissions. It is \nalready happening through the Asian Pacific Partnership. For those who \nare really interested, you can go to www.asianpacificpartnership.org \nfor more information on what is happening.\n  Recently, Richard Armitage and Dr. Joe testified before the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee and submitted for the record a paper called \n``Implementing Smart Power: Setting an Agenda for National Security \nReform.''\n  In this paper, Dr. Nye suggested that:\n\n       The next administration and Congress should establish and \n     fund a joint technology development center. International \n     collaboration helps reduce costs and accelerate the pace of \n     innovation. The U.S. Department of Energy in partnership with \n     major global energy companies should establish a 10-year \n     endowment for funding energy and technology related research. \n     This could be administered by an international consortium of \n     the National Science Foundation and equivalents and disburse \n     grants through a peer review process to researchers to \n     provide venture capital to develop and deploy next generation \n     energy technologies, such as biofuels.\n\n  Also, the paper suggests that the next President should ``seek to \nidentify areas of mutual interest between the United States and China \non which the two powers can work together on a smart power agenda.\n  ``Work together.''\n\n       Energy security and environmental stewardship top that \n     list, along with other transnational issues such as public \n     health and non-proliferation. Global leadership does not have \n     to be a zero-sum game.\n\n  The point I am making is, we are on the edge. We are seeing the \nresult now in terms of the high cost of gasoline, the high cost of \nnatural gas, the high cost of heating oil because of the fact that we \ndid not put together a comprehensive plan some years ago, realizing we \nare in a global economy, the world is expanding, demand for these \nresources is growing every day, and in order for us to survive in this \ncentury, we have to become a whole lot more independent in terms of \nenergy--as I said, the ``second declaration of independence.'' The only \nway that is going to happen is to develop a comprehensive plan.\n  My colleague, Senator Alexander from Tennessee, did a very good job \nearlier this evening in laying out a comprehensive plan we should put \nin place. It is not going to happen overnight. It is going to take time \nfor it to take place.\n  The reason I am bringing up the issue of the legislation dealing with \nclimate change is, again, how do we handle that issue? Do we just go \nahead and say: ``Well, we are going to go forward with it. Cap in \ntrade. This is going to solve the problem,'' when most of us know the \ntechnology is not there in order to cap carbon and sequester carbon, \nwhen most of us know the Chinese and the Indians and other growing \neconomies are sending these greenhouse gases into the air.\n  Instead of just saying: Well, we will do it on our own, I think it is \ntime for us to get together and realize we are part of this global \neconomy. By working together, not only could the United States be a \nleader in dealing with climate change and greenhouse gases, but it \nwould also be one of the most fantastic things our country could do in \nterms of public diplomacy.\n  We have been banged over the head over the years because we have not \ngot on into Kyoto. That was voted on here on the floor of the Senate \nand it went down overwhelmingly ``no.'' Then, 2 years ago, we passed \nthe Pryor-Hagel bill. The reason it passed is because it had an \ninternational dimension to it.\n\n  I think where we are today is we have to say: Here we are and here is \nwhere we want to be, and how do we get there. Wouldn't it be wonderful, \nas I have said, if the United States could be a leader in doing this \nand bringing other countries together in saying we are going to do this \ntogether. I have a motto: Together we can do it. I think that is the \napproach we should take. If we don't do that, if we go ahead with this \ncap-and-trade legislation and say: Well, it is going to take care of \nthe problem, we are going to be having the same problem we are having \ntoday, only it will be compounded: a 55-percent increase in electric \ncosts by 2012, an 80-percent increase in natural gas costs, and a 30-\npercent increase in gas costs. We can't handle that. We have to worry \nabout the standard of living of our people. So we have to balance this.\n  I think if we work on a bipartisan basis, we can come up with \nsomething that is spectacular. It is overdue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are debating a number of measures in the \nnext couple of days, and one of them that is before the Senate right \nnow is the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act. I wish to \nspeak for a couple of moments about that legislation.\n  This legislation would allow States that do not currently provide \nfirst responders with collective bargaining rights 2 years to revise \ntheir State law to do that. After 2 years, the Federal Labor Relations \nAuthority would become responsible for protecting the rights of first \nresponders in those States that still don't provide these rights. The \nFederal Labor Relations Authority would issue regulations to establish \nprocedures for employees to choose whether to form a union for \ncollective bargaining but would not have any say in the terms of the \nagreement.\n  This legislation is critically important for us to respond to \nemergencies across the country. There are some States that can do it \nbetter than others because of limitations. We think at times such as \nthis of the tragedy of 9/11, and it is important at this time to \nremember that every New York City firefighter, emergency medical \nperson, every police officer who responded to the disaster at the World \nTrade Center on that horrific day in American history was, in fact, a \nunion member under a collective bargaining agreement. So their unions \nstrengthened their ability to respond to this crisis.\n\n[[Page S4023]]\n\n  The bill before us, the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation \nAct, would give public safety officers the right to bargain over wages, \nhours, and working conditions, and would ensure that these rights are \nenforceable in State court. It also provides an efficient and effective \ndispute resolution mechanism for labor-management conflicts.\n  It is important to note that this bill does not force any specific \nregulatory scheme on the States. It gives States plenty of leeway to \nadopt new collective bargaining laws that make sense for their States. \nStates that choose not to craft their own system can get the help of \nthe Federal Labor Relations Authority.\n  I guess in summary form, we think of the importance of this \nlegislation in the context of the threats we face: the threat of \nterrorism, the threat of disasters, all kinds of threats our \ncommunities are faced with. I and a lot of other Americans, I believe, \nwant to make sure those who are putting their lives on the line every \nday, whether they are firefighters or police officers or other \nemergency personnel, have the peace of mind to know they are protected \nunder law and that they also have the ability to negotiate and watch \nout for their own wages, benefits, and working conditions.\n  That is what this legislation seeks to do: To bring States that don't \ncurrently have this in place--this labor relations authority in place--\nto make sure we are doing that in every State of the Union so no matter \nwhere you live, those who are protecting us--the police officers, \nfirefighters, and others--have the ability to benefit from the \nprotections they should have under law.\n  I urge my colleagues, as so many others who have already done so, to \nsupport the Public Safety Employer-Employees Cooperation Act. It is \nvery important legislation, and it is important that we pass it here in \nthe Senate.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, despite a little snow the last few \nweeks, spring is finally arriving in Minnesota. In fact, we had our \nfishing opener this weekend. It is the time of year when people start \ngoing up north. They have their cabins up there. It is not exactly \nextravagant, but that is their vacation place and that is where they \nspend a lot of their summer.\n  A lot of my constituents have been calling our office saying they \ndon't know if they can afford to go up north this summer. Worse than \nthat, we have had many people who drive trucks for a living, who have \nlong commutes to work, who are concerned about even keeping up with \ntheir jobs. You can see why. The oil and gas prices have tripled since \n2002: Minnesota, $3.49 per gallon; in the United States, gas prices are \nat $3.66 per gallon. You can see why the truckers are upset with diesel \nat $4.15 per gallon and oil at $122 per barrel.\n  I have to pause for a moment to say I have been coming to the Senate \nfloor to address the price of oil for a number of weeks now and it \ncontinues to astound me that every time I speak, the prices have gone \nup even more, and there appears to be no relief in sight. We look at \nthe skyrocketing gas prices in Minnesota where they have gone from \nabout $2.90 up to $3.62 in only 3 months. This is astonishing, and it \nis even more astonishing that this administration continues to do \nnothing; that the attitude seems to be this is what is happening, this \nis what the market says.\n  I believe there are things we can actually do, of course, in the long \nterm but also in the short term. I don't believe we can continue to do \nbusiness as usual. I have heard from farmers who are having a hard time \nmaking ends meet, even with the high commodity prices, because the cost \nof their inputs such as diesel fuel for their farm equipment and \nfertilizer made from natural gas have spiraled out of control. I have \nheard from people who are having a hard time heating their homes and \ngoing on with their lives.\n  The high price of energy has inflated the price of everything from \ngroceries to transportation to home heating. We had a hearing in the \nJoint Economic Committee a few weeks ago about the price of food. There \nare a number of factors at play there, including the low value of the \ndollar and the export market; including the weather; including some of \nthe demand for biofuels, although that was put as a relatively small \nfactor. But one thing that was mentioned time and time again was the \ncost of transportation.\n  In cold northern States such as Minnesota, where people have to pay \noff large heating bills, this is the time of year they do it. Some of \nthem put it off until now. They are too afraid of thinking about paying \ntheir bills for next winter. Middle-class families are struggling with \nthe high cost of health care and college education, and they can't \nafford the price of gas, especially in our rural areas. You look at the \nfact that there really haven't been any wage increases or the wages \nhave been stagnant and, in fact, have been going down; you add that to \nthe increasing expenses with the price of gas up about $1,000 or $2,000 \na year, depending on how much you drive. For a middle-class family, \nhealth care is up something like $1,500 a year; appliances are up, \ntelephone service is up. It comes to about $5,000 extra a year that the \nmiddle-class families are expending in the last 8 years.\n  Not a day goes by that I don't hear about this kind of struggle from \nmy constituents, so it is hard for me to understand how our President \nseemed so taken aback recently when someone asked him about $4-a-gallon \ngas. This was on February 28, 2008, not too long ago, and the President \nsaid:\n\n       You're predicting $4 a gallon gasoline? That's interesting. \n     I hadn't heard that.\n\n  The fact is it is not just interesting to the people of my State; it \nis, in fact, a budget buster for too many people in my State. This \nadministration has failed to provide Americans with a meaningful energy \npolicy that would provide relief from high gas and energy prices.\n  This country needs a bold energy policy for the future--not little \ngimmicks, not little ideas that maybe give you an extra 20 bucks. This \ncountry needs something more than someone who is going to say it is \ninteresting. We need a policy that will stabilize prices and give \nconsumers more alternatives, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and \nprovide us with the next generation of home-grown biofuels.\n  Brazil has achieved energy independence. They have done it with \nsugarcane. It is easier to do, but they have done it. They basically \nleapfrogged our country because their government had the foresight to \nput a policy in place that pushed the development of biofuels. They \nhave their own oil, but mostly they have their own biofuels.\n  We can do this; we just need the will. We need to pursue a forward-\nlooking energy policy with the same sense of urgency we used to put a \nman on the Moon nearly 40 years ago.\n  In the long term, that is going to mean making strategic decisions in \nresearch on hybrid cars, new solar technology, cellulosic ethanol, and \nother forms of energy from biomass. It is just around the corner. We \nknow that. Chevy is coming out with the Chevy Volt which gives you 30 \nmiles, by plugging your car in every day and then it converts over to \nbiofuels. That is 2 years away. We have new solar technologies. We have \ncellulosic ethanol right at the University of Minnesota where \ngroundbreaking research is being done. We can do this.\n  We need better fuel efficiency for our cars and trucks. As the \nPresiding Officer knows, this Congress was the first Congress since I \nwas in junior high to increase the gas mileage standards for new cars \nand trucks by 10 miles per gallon. We can do more. We also need a \nrenewable energy standard such as we have in Minnesota where we simply \nbasically are going to provide 25 percent of our energy, our \nelectricity, from renewable sources by the year 2025. That was a \nbipartisan agreement in our State--the Republican Governor, Democratic \nlegislature, nearly unanimous, supported by our biggest electricity \ncompany itself, which took even a higher standard--30 percent--for \nitself.\n\n[[Page S4024]]\n\n  These are long-term solutions. I believe very strongly they are \nimportant and they are the future and we need to pass them. But there \nare also things we can do in the short term about high gas prices that \ncould bring immediate relief to the families in my State and across \nthis country. That is why I am proud to cosponsor the Consumer First \nEnergy Act, which Majority Leader Reid introduced last week. There are \n20 cosponsors, 20 Senators who are already on this bill. The bill \nattacks high gas prices from five different angles, all of which are \nachievable in the short term.\n  The first thing, and the thing I have heard most about when I talked \nto people in this business, is the role that market speculation is \nplaying in today's price of gas. The administration likes to tell us \nhigh gas prices are just a simple case of supply and demand, and more \npeople are driving, so the price of gas goes up. But that answer \ndoesn't hold true any longer. Look at what the oil executives have been \nsaying. On October 30, 2007, the CEO of Marathon Oil said:\n\n       $100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the \n     market.\n\n  That is the CEO of Marathon Oil on October 30, 2007. I think he might \nknow what he is talking about. Then a more recent quote, on April 11 of \nthis year, by the CEO of Royal Dutch Shell, who said:\n\n       The [oil] fundamentals are no problem. They are the same as \n     they were when oil was selling for $60 a barrel.\n\n  On April 1 of this year, senior Vice President of ExxonMobil said:\n\n       The price of oil should be about $50 to 55 per barrel.\n\n  If oil should be roughly at $50 or $60 a barrel, given market \nfundamentals, why is it trading at $118 per barrel? If supply and \ndemand doesn't explain the high price of gas, what does? According to \nthe experts, there is a frenzy of unregulated market speculation in the \noil futures market that is driving prices to record highs.\n  I wish to share a quote from an energy market analyst with \nOppenheimer, who recently was named by Bloomberg as a top-ranked energy \nanalyst in the country. He said:\n\n       I am absolutely convinced that oil prices should not be a \n     dime above $55 a barrel. Oil speculators include the largest \n     financial institutions in the world. I call it ``the world's \n     largest gambling hall.'' It is open 24/7. It is totally \n     unregulated. This is similar to a highway with no cop and no \n     speed limit and everybody is going 120 miles per hour.\n\n  That will be reassuring to the people calling our office because they \ncannot afford to go up to the lake this summer. ``The world's largest \ngambling hall.'' Why are these trades in a commodity as vital as oil--\nat a time when we are in a very fragile situation internationally and \nwe are doing business with countries we would rather not deal with, why \nis this commodity, oil, unregulated? In 2000, there was a provision \ninserted into the Commodity Futures Modernization Act that exempted \nelectronic energy trades from Federal regulation. In the absence of \noversight, what was once a small niche market became a booming \nindustry, attracting a rampant speculation from hedge funds and \ninvestment banks, the largest financial institutions in the world. Oil \nand natural gas prices became volatile.\n  That provision has come to be known as the ``Enron loophole'' because \nit made possible the many abuses that triggered the western energy \ncrisis and cost the economy $35 billion and nearly 600,000 jobs.\n  The Federal Government has a critical role to play in conducting \naggressive oversight of changing energy markets. Any prosecutor--and \nthe Presiding Officer knows from his past work as a prosecutor--can \ntell you that good laws are not enough; you need good enforcement. \nHistory has shown us that when enforcement is lax, consumers ultimately \npay the price. The Consumer First Energy Act addresses the problem of \nmarket speculation by stopping traders from routing transactions \nthrough offshore markets in order to get around limits on speculation \nput in place by U.S. regulators. Specifically, the Intercontinental \nExchange, or ICE, in London allows trading in American oil futures, \ngasoline and home heating oil, with far less stringent reporting \nrequirements than what is required here at home. This has driven a lot \nof speculation offshore and out of reach of our regulators.\n  This bill will make those foreign trades in American oil and gasoline \nfutures subject to reporting requirements so we can have a proper paper \ntrail and keep track of what is occurring.\n  This bill would also require the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \nto increase the margin requirement for oil trades. A margin \nrequirement, as you know, is the amount of money you have to put down \nif you want to buy and sell oil futures. The margin requirement is \ncurrently set by the exchanges themselves, which is like the fox \nguarding the henhouse. They have set the requirements so low it has led \nto this rampant speculation.\n  Some people believe this occurred because many speculators have taken \nmoney out of subprime mortgages, or the mortgage market, and put it \ninto oil. The people in Minnesota want to know the people in Washington \nare looking out for them. I think the way we do that is by reining in \nsome of this rampant speculation with this bill.\n  The bill also has requirements that will allow us to push on OPEC so \nthey provide the oil they should provide. They are keeping it at an \nartificially low level. They are colluding to do that.\n  Yet, at the same time, our country is doing business with many of \nthese countries. This has to stop, and we have to use the leverage we \nhave to push OPEC to produce more oil.\n  Another part of the bill would ask that we temporarily halt putting \noil into our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This is estimated by energy \nanalysts to bring in about 3 to 5 cents per gallon. They are 97 percent \nfull. Yet our Government is purchasing oil at this incredibly high \nrate. This bill puts a temporary halt on that so we can put more oil on \nthe market and, at the same time, not burden our country by buying it \nat this incredibly high rate.\n  Finally, this bill does something we have been trying to do for \nyears: It takes the oil giveaways and puts them in the hands of those \nwho can actually produce renewable energy. As you know, we came so \nclose to doing this in the past. We were one vote short of blocking the \nfilibuster--a tool the other side has used 68 times now, a record \nnumber. We were one vote short of taking $17 billion, over a 10-year \nperiod, and putting it into the hands of basically the people of this \ncountry, to say there is a better way. Instead of investing in the \nsultans of Saudi Arabia, we can put our investments in the farmers and \nworkers of this country. If Brazil can do it with sugarcane, we can do \nit with residue from logging or hybrid cars or with hydrogen fuel \ncells. We can do it with cellulosic ethanol, the next generation of \nbiofuels--but not if we are unwilling to talk about how we do it, which \nis put our money where our mouth is, which is to take the giveaways the \noil companies have been enjoying for so many years, while seeing record \nprofits, and putting it in the hands of the future.\n  That is what we are asking this Senate to vote on tomorrow. I can \ntell you that if you ask the people in Minnesota--whether they are \nDemocrats, Republicans or Independents or whether they are from the \nTwin Cities or the Iron Range of Minnesota or southern Minnesota--they \nwant to go the next step. They are bold. They figure if we can put a \nman on the Moon, we can do this. This is why I support this bill. This \nis our future.\n  I am very proud to be a sponsor of the bill, and I hope this Chamber \nis willing to do something tomorrow different than what we have done in \nthis area of energy before. We have taken steps and increased the gas \nmileage standards, but this is our opportunity to be bold and to \nrespond to the people of this country who are not looking for gimmicks \nbut they are looking at us to do something. We know we can do a long-\nterm solution, research and development, and the transitioning to green \njobs. We can do the transition to cellulosic ethanol and put the money \nthere.\n  In the short term, we need to get rid of this idea that Government \nshould put up our hands and let this keep going, while the rampant \nspeculation goes on and on. We need to place stronger limits on market \nspeculation; temporarily suspend deliveries of oil into the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve; put a stop to the oil company giveaways; enact the \nwindfall profit tax, which I know is different than proposals in the \npast. It kicks in when oil\n\n[[Page S4025]]\n\ncompanies are not truly investing in renewables or adding to its \nrefineries and production. And then we have to put that pressure on \nOPEC.\n  These are the kinds of short-term, bold measures the people of this \ncountry are looking for. So tomorrow we have our chance. I implore my \ncolleagues to join us. Let's get this done and do something real for \nthe people of this country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I rise to recognize a very \nspecial individual from my home State of Kentucky, Mr. Robley Rex. \nEarlier this month, Mr. Rex celebrated his 107th birthday. To live 107 \nyears in and of itself is an achievement by anyone's standard. In the \ncase of Robley Rex, those 107 years have been especially full of \naccomplishment and patriotic service. He has filled his lifetime with \nloyal service to our Nation's Armed Forces, to the U.S. Postal \nDepartment, to local businesses, to the Methodist ministries and, \nperhaps most importantly, to his family and his fellow veterans.\n  Robley Rex was born in Hopkinsville, KY 1901. Upon turning 18, be \nenlisted in the U.S. Army and proudly served our Nation. He returned to \nKentucky after serving with 5th Infantry in Germany in 1922. Mr. Rex \nthen joined the Veterans of Foreign Wars, VFW, and married Ms. Grace \nBivens. He held jobs with local Kentucky businesses before beginning \nhis career as a U.S. Postal Department railroad mail clerk. At the \nspry, young age of 86, Robley Rex began volunteering through the VFW \nand was honored by the group for having performed more than 13,600 \nhours of service over a 20-year period. He also volunteered his time at \nthe VA Medical Center in Louisville, KY, helping the hospital staff and \ninspiring the patients and their families. He also found time to become \nan expert in proper flag etiquette. Mr. President, I don't know I \nanyone who knows more about how to properly care for an American flag \nthan Mr. Rex.\n  I am proud to represent such a remarkable model of honor and duty and \nI am pleased to have the opportunity to recognize Robley Rex in front \nof this distinguished body. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking \nhim for his continued service to our Nation and to Kentucky, and to \nwish him all the best on his 107th birthday and in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/12/senate-section/article/S4025-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Staff Sergeant Chad A.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 60th \nanniversary of the State of Israel, which is being celebrated today \naround the world. Since May 1948, the Jewish state has transformed \nitself from a fledgling band of pioneers and immigrants to a strong, \nrobust, and democratic state. Israel has been an indispensible friend \nover the years and remains our greatest ally in the Middle East. One of \nthe world's most innovative and exemplary countries, Israel has lived \nup to its founding ideal of being a ``light unto the nations.''\n  Beset on all sides by enemies, Israel declared its independence under \ncover of night on the fifth day of the Jewish month of Iyar. The new \ncountry was immediately recognized by U.S. President Harry Truman, a \ndecision which continues to make America proud. Still, the surrounding \narmies immediately invaded. Challenged in a war for its survival, \nIsrael prevailed to enjoy its independence. Israel would face \nexistential threats from larger foes several times again, prevailing \neach time and steadily growing stronger.\n  And yet, for 60 years now, the State of Israel has done far more than \njust survive and persevere. Mr. President, it has thrived.\n  Politically, Israel has built a sanctuary of democracy, the rule of \nlaw, and basic rights and freedoms. Religiously, Israel has built a \ntolerant society for the Jews, Christians, Muslims, and Bahai who share \nthe Holy Land. Economically, it is a modern marvel, home of some of the \nmost high-level technological advances in the world. In the field of \nagricultural production, which is so important to my home State of \nSouth Dakota, Israel has done the so-called impossible and it has made \nthe desert bloom. The invention of the surface drip irrigation system \nrevolutionized farmers' ability to bring water to their crops, creating \na lasting benefit for the entire world.\n  Congratulations to Israel on 60 years of statehood. Our friendship \nand alliance with Israel is an extension of our interests and our \nvalues, and I look forward to a strong U.S.-Israel relationship for \ngenerations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/12/senate-section/article/S4025-4", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4025-S4026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     GREAT LAKES LEGACY ACT OF 2008\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last week, my colleagues from the Great \nLakes and I introduced the Great Lakes Legacy Act of 2008. This bill \nwill reauthorize the Great Lakes Legacy Act of 2002, which \nsignificantly benefited efforts to clean up contaminated areas of the \nGreat Lakes.\n  The focus of the Legacy program is to clean up ``Areas of Concern'' \nin the Great Lakes. These are sites that do not meet the water quality \ngoals established by the United States and Canada in the Great Lakes \nWater Quality Agreement. The primary reason that these areas fail to \nmeet water quality goals is the result of contaminated sediments from \nindustrial activity. This contamination results in fish advisories, \ndegradation of fish and wildlife populations, taste and odor problems \nwith drinking water, beach closures, and bird and animal deformities or \nreproductive problems.\n  The existing Legacy program has funded several projects throughout \nthe region to remove contaminated sediments in Areas of Concern. In \nfact, almost 800,000 cubic yards of contaminated sediments have been \nremoved since the program was created in 2002. This is material that \nhas been safely removed from riverbeds so that it no longer poses a \nthreat to human health or the wildlife.\n  Still, there are 13 Areas of Concern in the State of Michigan alone. \nThe environmental problems are far too grave considering the fact that \nthe Great Lakes holds one-fifth of the world's freshwater, supplies \ndrinking water to tens of million people, and provides a $5 billion \nfishery. They threaten the Great Lakes as a source of potable water, as \na recreational resource, as a commercial asset, and as a natural \nhabitat.\n  The bill that we have introduced would build on the existing Legacy \nprogram in several ways. It would increase the authorization of \nappropriations from $54 million to $150 million annually in order to \nclean up the Areas of Concern within 10 years. The bill would give the \nEPA greater flexibility to manage funds by allowing the EPA to \ndistribute funds directly to contractors and would not require States \nto maintain previous year's funding levels at a\n\n[[Page S4026]]\n\nsite. Under this bill, eligible projects would be expanded to include \nhabitat restoration. Many Areas of Concern cannot be delisted until \nhabitat restoration work is done. Also, the bill would give the EPA the \ndiscretion to provide Legacy Act funds to demonstration and pilot \nprojects. Finally, the bill would clarify the role of polluters in \nparticipating in future projects.\n  We have been working for decades to try to clean up the Areas of \nConcern. This bill was drafted based on recommendations from a \ncoalition of environmental and industry groups that are working to \nprotect and restore the Great Lakes, and I want to thank them for their \ndedication. I hope that my colleagues will support this legislation to \ncontinue progress on cleaning up these sites and protecting our \nprecious Great LakA for the use and benefit of citizens throughout the \nMidwest and across Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/12/senate-section/article/S4026-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO PLACIDO DOMINGO\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to pay tribute to someone \nwho has touched the lives of millions not just in this country but \nacross the world. This week, tenor Placido Domingo sings the title role \nin the new Washington National Opera production of Handel's \n``Tamerlano.'' It is his 130th role, an unprecedented feat. He has made \neach of these parts into something alive and multidimensional. Tragic \nfigures like Otello or Cavaradossi have come to life and, through their \nactions, have laid out time-honored truths about human emotions and how \nwe live. Mr. Domingo's singing, marked by a clarion tone and natural \nsense of the shape of a musical phrase, can move us to great heights \nand the deepest depths. He is a positive force in the world and someone \nthat everyone can celebrate.\n  Next year marks the 40th anniversary of his debuts at the Lyric Opera \nof Chicago and the country's premiere opera house, the Metropolitan \nOpera. He frequently sings across the globe, gracing stages of esteemed \nEuropean opera houses like London's Royal Opera and Milan's La Scala. \nHe might be most widely known as one of the ``3 Tenors.'' His recording \nof grand productions and solo recitals fill store racks in my home \nState of Vermont, as well as the whole country. These are unheralded \nachievements for any tenor, undertakings that have led to numerous \nawards like several Grammy awards and his recent election by a \nrespected British magazine as the ``King of Singers.''\n  Thankfully, his ego is not nearly as long or wide as that list of \nlaurels. He is a deeply respectful individual, and he takes interest in \nothers. He came be extremely kind. He paid me one of the nicest favors \nlast year, when, at a special function, my wife Marcelle asked him to \nsing ``Happy Birthday'' to me. Rarely has the simple tune been heard \nwith such color and finesse. It was a moment that I will never forget.\n  Even in that straightforward, if always sweet, tune that amazing \nsense of the inner workings of music was there. There have been other \ngreat tenors but few who have shown such a strong musical sense. The \nword used most often to describe Mr. Domingo's approach to each score \nis ``scrupulous,'' a word that means meticulous, fastidious, \nconscientious. That quality extends into his work from the podium as a \nconductor and from the boardroom as a general manager, not only of the \nWashington National Opera but also the Los Angeles Opera. He gets \ninside whatever he is doing--singing, conducting, administration--and \nmakes it come out fresh, natural, and seemingly right.\n  He has literally lived and breathed opera throughout his life. As a \nchild, he sang the popular Spanish operas known as zarzuela. The two \ncompanies that he directs have commissioned new operas, and it is new \noperas that make all the difference between a ``has-been'' and a \nliving, breathing art form. Just 2 years ago, the Washington National \nOpera put on Scott Wheeler's ``Democracy.'' Its themes of politics, \nlove, and Washington still resonate today.\n  Mr. Domingo spends a great deal of time in the United States, which \nhas received him like the hero he often sings on stage. He knows New \nYork, Washington, and Los Angeles like a native. He undertakes tours to \nsing across the Nation, sometimes bringing music to communities that \nmay not have a major opera house. He is not an American citizen, but he \nembraces some of the best qualities of what it means to be an American, \nenergetic and open, alive to life's possibilities. He has forged a \nspecial bond with the country, and for that we are all grateful.\n  As Mr. Domingo takes on his role this week at the Washington National \nOpera, I know the entire Senate joins me in congratulating and thanking \nhim for his relentless work and his spectacular ability to move us to \ntears, laughter, and sheer joy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/12/senate-section/article/S4026-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4026-S4027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF NORAD\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of the signing of the North American Aerospace Defense \nCommand Agreement between the United States and Canada. For Colorado, \nthe home to the headquarters of the North American Aerospace Defense \nCommand, NORAD, this is a proud and joyous 50th anniversary.\n  Since the May 12, 1958, signing of the first NORAD agreement, NORAD \nhas been a model for international cooperation in defense planning, \nexecution, training, information management, and technological \ninnovation. For half a century, the command has helped detect, deter, \nand defend against threats to the North American Continent. Today, we \nhonor this legacy of success, but we also look ahead to the next half \ncentury of this partnership, so that NORAD can continue to provide for \nthe security of our continent and our homeland.\n  Over the last 3 years, I have visited frequently with the commanders \nof NORAD and U.S. Northern Command in Colorado Springs. I am humbled by \nthe work that the men and women of NORAD do day-in and day-out to carry \nout their mission. At all hours, NORAD executes its missions of \naerospace warning, aerospace control, and maritime warning. If any \naircraft, missiles, or space vehicles pose a threat to the North \nAmerican Continent, NORAD provides accurate, unambiguous, and timely \nwarning. The command works closely with its homeland defense, security, \nand law enforcement partners to prevent air attacks, to safeguard the \nsovereign airspaces of the United States and Canada, and to provide a \ncapability to respond to unknown, unwanted, and unauthorized air \nactivity approaching and operating within North American airspace. At \nsea, NORAD provides binational warning of any maritime threat that may \nbe approaching the continent.\n  Over the last half century, NORAD has been a mechanism for \ncollaboration between the United States and Canada in the interest of \nsecurity. NORAD exercises command and control of military forces of \nboth countries, so that we can respond to threats efficiently and \njointly. NORAD has also allowed a growing level of information and \nintelligence sharing between the Canadian and American militaries, \nintelligence services, and other agencies and organizations. This is \nabsolutely vital to our efforts to confront and defeat the threats of \nthe 21st century.\n  NORAD brings together not only the Active-Duty components of the U.S. \nand Canadian militaries but also the capabilities of our nations' \nReserve components and national, provincial, state, local, and tribal \norganizations. The product of NORAD's efforts is the broad, binational, \nmultiagency cooperation that has been, and will continue to be, \nfundamental to our national defense.\n  Mr. President, today's milestone is an opportunity to reflect on the \nrewards of the NORAD partnership. These rewards are measured by the \nsecurity of our citizens but also by the strength of the relationship \nbetween our two countries. NORAD's 50-year legacy of cooperation has \nhelped build respect, trust, and confidence between Canadians and \nAmericans. It is a relationship that is longstanding, stable, mutually \nbeneficial, and absolutely essential in today's security environment, \nwhere the threats and challenges we face are always evolving.\n  We must always remember, though, that the success of NORAD is a \nproduct of the men and women who make it work. To the Americans and \nCanadians\n\n[[Page S4027]]\n\nwho have stood shoulder to shoulder in the command over the past 50 \nyears, I say thank you. We are proud of your professionalism, your \ncommitment to your mission, and your tireless service to our countries. \nCongratulations on the 50th anniversary of NORAD, and congratulations \non a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/12/senate-section/article/S4027-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HONORING CHRISTINE BARON\n\n Mr. BIDEN.

Chris Baron, president of Verizon's Philadelphia Tri-\nstate Region, is receiving a prestigious and well-deserved honor from \nthe Philadelphia Police Athletic League for her tireless community \nservice. It is my honor to add my well-wishes to the festivities.\n  Chris has been involved in many charities in our region, but I got to \nknow her through her commitment to combating domestic violence. Chris \nled Verizon's HopeLine program in my home State of Delaware, which \nprovides domestic violence victims with free wireless phones and \nairtime.\n  Victims of domestic violence use the phones to contact family, \nfriends, and employers, and they can be crucial in time of emergency. \nDuring Chris' tenure heading the program, victims have received over \n6,500 wireless phones and Verizon has given more than $150,000 to local \norganizations, shelters, and law enforcement in the ongoing struggle to \ncurb domestic violence.\n  Every day, in every State, countless Americans step forward in the \nface of unimaginable fear. Chris Baron, and those like her, provide \nsafety options, critical support, and services that victims so \ndesperately need.\n  Receiving this award puts Chris in rare company. Past honorees \ninclude Walter Annenberg; Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell; \nPhiladelphia district attorney Lynne Abraham; and Julius ``Dr. J'' \nErving.\n  I have said many times on this floor that the Violence Against Women \nAct is my proudest legislative accomplishment. But I will be the first \nto acknowledge that VAWA means nothing without the hard-working men and \nwomen who implement its ideas. Chris Baron exemplifies the true heroes \nin our fight against domestic violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/12/senate-section/article/S4027-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING LOUIS CARNEY\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I recognize a longtime and \ndear friend of mine, Louis Carney, on the occasion of his recent Silver \nBeaver Award from the Boy Scouts of America. Louis has spent the better \npart of the last 50 years giving of himself not only to friends, \nneighbors and family members, but to the Boy Scouts as well. He served \nas a cubmaster in 1964; den leader in 1965; Webelos leader in 1969; Boy \nScout chairman in 1980; vanguard staff in 1987; District Cub Scout \nCommittee in 1981; and District Eagle chairman from 2004 to today. \nUntil very recently, Louis attended Scout Camp annually and is the \nrecipient of countless Scout leadership awards including two Extra Mile \nawards, the Arrowhead honor, the District Award of Merit, the Eagle \nFeather award, the Wood Badge Training award, numerous leadership \ntraining awards, and an On My Honor award.\n  In addition to Louis's service to the Scouts, he is a Korean war \nveteran, worked in the U.S. Postal Service for 25, years and spent time \nas a potato farmer. During his adult life, he has volunteered at the \nFamily Center, the food kitchen and the Museum of Idaho and served in \nmany leadership positions in the LDS church all in my home town of \nIdaho Falls, ID. He also has spent thousands of hours volunteering in \nlocal schools. He has a reputation for reliability, and his selfless \nservice has been demonstrated countless times and in countless ways \nwhen it comes to the youth and community in eastern Idaho. Many grown \nmen who were Boy Scouts in their youth remember Louis's devotion to \nthem and to Scouting, and his example of leadership through service has \ndoubtless lived on in these individuals. When it comes to Scouting, \nLouis has said ``I love Scouting; it's the one thing that can keep a \nfamily together.''\n  His service went well beyond the Boy Scouts or his community \nvolunteer activities--Louis and I served in our church together when we \nwere both younger. His service was close to home as well. Many snowy \nmornings, we would wake up to find that Louis had plowed not only our \ndriveway but those of our neighbors. He is the salt of the earth and \nmade his community his neighborhood and made his community members, \nincluding me, his neighbors in the truest sense. My wife Susan and I \noffer Louis our heartfelt congratulations on his Silver Beaver Award \nand our gratitude for his kindness, generosity, and friendship over the \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/12/senate-section/article/S4027-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING SOUTH DAKOTA COMMUNITIES\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \ncommunity of Woonsocket, SD, on reaching the 125th anniversary of its \nfounding. Woonsocket is a rural community located in Sanborn County, \nwhich is also celebrating the 100th anniversary of its courthouse.\n  The city of Woonsocket was founded in the summer of 1883 at the \njunction of the Chicago, Milwaukee, and Saint Paul Railroads, and it \nwas given its name by the Superintendent of the railroad, C.H. Prior \nafter his home town in Rhode Island. The city grew at a tremendous rate \nupon dedication as 50 lots were sold in the first day. The first church \nservice in the town was held just 3 days after the sale of the first \nlot. The population grew rapidly and the first business that opened was \na saloon.\n  Woonsocket was named county seat of Sanborn County by the Territorial \nLegislature in 1884. In October 1906 the city of Woonsocket proposed a \nSanborn courthouse. The proposal was accepted and a courthouse was \nbuilt for $50,000. It was dedicated May 22, 1908.\n  Today, Woonsocket is still a thriving community, with many \nrestaurants, local businesses and churches all nestled around scenic \nLake Prior. With excellent schools, Woonsocket school district boasts a \n100-percent graduation rate.\n  The people of Woonsocket celebrate this momentous occasion on the \nFourth of July and are marking the 100-year anniversary of the \ncourthouse on May 22. One hundred and twenty-five years after its \nfounding Woonsocket remains a vital community and a great asset to the \nwonderful State of South Dakota.

A bill to hold the surviving Nazi war criminals accountable \nfor the war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity they \ncommitted during World War II, by encouraging foreign governments to \nmore efficiently prosecute and extradite wanted criminals; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nSenator Nelson of Florida in support of the Simon Wiesenthal Center's \n``Operation: Last Chance,'' a final effort to bring the remaining Nazi \nwar criminals to justice.\n  The atrocities committed by Nazis and their allies were vast, \nredefining the modern conception of crimes against humanity. In the \nNuremburg trials and other courts, many Nazis faced accountability for \ntheir atrocities committed under the shroud of World War II. \nUnfortunately, some of the most guilty perpetrators of these acts \nescaped justice, when they fled to South America, Eastern Europe, or \nsimply faded into postwar anonymity.\n  The Simon Wiesenthal Center, which is committed to raising awareness \nof the Holocaust, is determined not to let the remaining perpetrators \nescape justice. In 2002, the center initiated ``Operation: Last \nChance,'' which sought to capitalize on the opening of the Soviet \narchives to identify the remaining Nazi war criminals. However, time is \nrunning short, and several of the most wanted Nazis remain at large.\n  We are thus introducing a bill to support the center's efforts. This \nlegislation would require that the President report on foreign \ncooperation in prosecuting, extraditing, and receiving extradition of \nwanted Nazis. It would also indicate that the United States should take \nsuch cooperation into account when considering target countries for \nadmission into or renewal of the Visa Waiver Program.\n  For too many victims of the Holocaust, the crimes committed by the \nNazis and their allies over 60 years ago have not been adequately \nredressed. Too many countries are ambiguous about helping in the search \nfor the remaining Nazi fugitives, and so little time remains. I thus \nhope that this bill can help the Simon Wiesenthal Center in its pursuit \nof justice, and in doing so, finally lay to rest some of the terrible \nghosts of the twentieth century.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3007\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``World War II War Crimes \n     Accountability Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Surviving Nazi war criminals are becoming increasingly \n     rare.\n       (2) The identities of many of the remaining criminals were \n     made known only after the end of the Cold War and the \n     collapse of Communist governments throughout eastern Europe.\n       (3) In most of these formerly communist countries, the \n     volume of available information is enormous, and the \n     available resources to study it and identify war crimes \n     suspects is comparatively small.\n       (4) In the United States, the Office of Special \n     Investigations (OSI) of the Department of Justice is \n     responsible for detecting, investigating and taking legal \n     action to denaturalize or deport persons who took part in \n     Nazi-sponsored acts of persecution committed abroad between \n     1933 and 1945.\n       (5) As of April 2008, OSI had successfully prosecuted more \n     than 100 people involved in Nazi war crimes who were residing \n     in the United States.\n       (6) As a government office with limited resources, OSI is \n     under enormous strain to\n\n[[Page S4031]]\n\n     identify and prosecute those criminals identified by newly-\n     released records before it is too late.\n       (7) Some foreign governments hinder the efforts of OSI, \n     Congress, and the United States government to extradite or \n     deport convicted Nazi war criminals from the United States to \n     their country of origin or other relevant jurisdiction.\n       (8) Certain nongovernmental organizations have been \n     instrumental in the search for wanted Nazi war crimes \n     suspects for over 60 years.\n       (9) In 2002, the Simon Wiesenthal Center launched \n     Operation: Last Chance to maximize the identification and \n     help facilitate the prosecution of the remaining unprosecuted \n     Nazi war criminals, helping to achieve justice for the \n     victims of the Holocaust.\n       (10) Simon Wiesenthal, a survivor of the Nazi death camps \n     whose work stands as a reminder and a warning for future \n     generations, dedicated his life to--\n       (A) documenting the crimes of the Holocaust; and\n       (B) hunting down the perpetrators still at large.\n       (11) As founder and head of the Jewish Documentation Center \n     in Vienna, Simon Wiesenthal successfully brought to justice \n     wanted Nazi war criminals, including--\n       (A) Franz Stangl, the commandant of the Treblinka death \n     camp;\n       (B) Franz Murer, ``The Butcher of Wilno''; and\n       (C) Erich Rajakowitsch, who was in charge of the ``death \n     transports'' in Holland.\n       (12) Mr. Wiesenthal's work, which contributed enormously to \n     the modern understanding of justice, war crimes, and crimes \n     against humanity, should be continued.\n       (13) Of the most guilty Nazis and Nazi collaborators still \n     at large, Operation: Last Chance has identified the following \n     suspects:\n       (A) Dr. Aribert Heim, who served as a medical doctor at the \n     Sachsenhausen, Buchenwald, and Mauthausen concentration \n     camps, is the most wanted ex-Nazi still at large. His most \n     terrible crimes were committed at Mauthausen, where he \n     murdered hundreds of inmates by administering lethal \n     injections of phenol to their hearts or by other torturous \n     killing methods during the fall of 1941. His whereabouts are \n     unknown.\n       (B) Dr. Sandor Kepiro, who served as an officer in the \n     Hungarian gendarmerie, was 1 of several Hungarian officers \n     convicted in 1944 for the mass murder of several thousand \n     civilians (mostly Jews) in the city of Novi Sad on January \n     23, 1942. In the wake of the occupation of Hungary in March \n     1944, he was pardoned, promoted, and returned to active \n     service. He escaped to Austria in 1945, fled to Argentina in \n     1948, and returned to Hungary in 1996.\n       (C) Milivoj Asner, who served as the police chief of the \n     city of Slavonska Pozega. During 1941 and 1942, Mr. Asner \n     orchestrated the robbery, persecution and destruction of the \n     local Serb, Jewish and Gypsy communities, which culminated in \n     the deportation of hundreds of civilians to Ustasha \n     concentration camps, where most of the deportees were \n     murdered. After his exposure in Operation: Last Chance, the \n     former police chief later escaped once again to Klagenfurt, \n     Austria where he currently resides.\n       (D) Charles Zentai is accused of murdering 18-year-old \n     Peter Balazs, a Jewish boy he caught riding a Budapest tram \n     without the requisite yellow star on November 8, 1944. After \n     Hungarian requests for his extradition went unanswered, \n     Zentai was able to immigrate to Australia in February 1950, \n     where he currently lives.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States should actively encourage extradition \n     and prosecution of the remaining Nazi war criminals (as \n     described by 8 U.S.C. 1182 (a)(3)(e));\n       (2) the Simon Wiesenthal Center should be commended for its \n     historic work in bringing to light the atrocities of the \n     Holocaust and in advancing justice for Nazi war criminals \n     through Operation: Last Chance; and\n       (3) the Office of Special Investigation of the Department \n     of Justice is advancing the declared foreign policy of the \n     United States by bringing wanted World War II criminals to \n     justice and should be commended for its actions.\n\n     SEC. 4. DESIGNATION OF VISA WAIVER PROGRAM COUNTRIES.\n\n       (a) Cooperation.--After a country is initially designated \n     as a visa waiver program country under section 217(c) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1187(c)), the \n     Attorney General, in evaluating the effect that such \n     designation would have on the law enforcement and security \n     interests of the United States under paragraph (2)(C) of such \n     section, shall consider the extent to which such country is \n     cooperating in--\n       (1) extraditing or prosecuting wanted or indicted Nazi war \n     criminals to the relevant jurisdiction; and\n       (2) admitting into their territory aliens described in \n     section 212(a)(3)(E)(i) and ordered removed from the United \n     States by a United States immigration judge, the Board of \n     Immigration Appeals, or a Federal court .\n       (b) Presidential Discretion.--\n       (1) In general.--If the President determines that it would \n     not be in the national interest of the United States to \n     terminate a country's designation as a visa waiver program \n     country based on the evaluation under subsection (a), the \n     President may decline to terminate such designation after \n     providing advance written notification to--\n       (A) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate;\n       (B) the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate;\n       (C) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (D) the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (2) Contents.--In providing notification under paragraph \n     (1), the President shall--\n       (A) identify each crime suspect described in subsection \n     (a)(2) whose admission has not been effected; and\n       (B) submit copies of all decisions rendered by United \n     States immigration judges, the Board of Immigration Appeals, \n     and Federal courts that relate to such crime suspects.\n\n     SEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT.\n\n       In each of the fiscal years 2009 through 2013, the \n     President shall submit an annual report to the committees \n     listed in section 4(b)(1), which describes, for each country \n     that has a pending application for entry into or renewal of \n     the visa waiver program, whether such country is--\n       (1) cooperating satisfactorily in extraditing or deporting \n     wanted Nazi war crimes suspects to the jurisdiction in which \n     they have been indicted or convicted;\n       (2) prosecuting wanted Nazi war crimes suspects effectively \n     within such country's jurisdiction; and\n       (3) cooperating satisfactorily in admitting to the \n     territory of such country aliens described in section \n     212(a)(3)(E)(i) and ordered removed from the United States \n     territory by a United States immigration judge, the Board of \n     Immigration Appeals, or a Federal court.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon and I are \nintroducing the World War II Accountability Act, which seeks to compel \nforeign governments harboring Nazi war criminals to prosecute and \nextradite those individuals. It is a sad truth that more than 60 years \nafter World War II some countries continue to provide safe haven for \nthese war criminals. Bringing these surviving Nazis to justice is a \ntime-sensitive affair, and one that can bring much needed peace to \nthose remaining holocaust survivors who have already suffered so much.\n  In the United States, the Office of Special Investigations, OSI, of \nthe Department of Justice is responsible for detecting, investigating \nand taking legal action to denaturalize or deport persons who took part \nin Nazi sponsored acts of persecution committed between 1933 and 1945. \nAs of August 2005, OSI had successfully prosecuted 100 persons involved \nin Nazi war crimes who were residing in the U.S.\n  Nongovernmental organizations are also integral to these detection \nand investigation efforts. In 2002, the Simon Wiesenthal Center \nlaunched Operation: Last Chance to maximize identification and to help \nfacilitate the prosecution of remaining Nazi war criminals.\n  Of the most egregious Nazi war criminals, Operation: Last Chance has \nidentified suspects like Mr. Milivoj Asner, who served as the police \nchief of the city of Slavonska Pozega. Mr. Asner orchestrated the \npersecution and destruction of the local Serb, Jewish, and Gypsy \ncommunities, which culminated in the deportation of hundreds of \ncivilians to Ustasha concentration camps. Mr. Asner currently resides \nin Klagenfurt, Austria. The center has also identified Dr. Aribert \nHeim, who served as a medical doctor at the Sachsenhausen, Buchenwald, \nand Mauthausen concentration camps. His most terrible crimes occurred \nat Mauthausen, where he murdered hundreds of prisoners by administering \nlethal injections into their hearts or by other tortuous killing \nmethods. Dr. Heim's whereabouts are unknown.\n  Unfortunately, even the best efforts of OSI and organizations like \nthe Simon Wiesenthal Center to identify and investigate Nazi war \ncriminals are not enough. Some foreign governments hinder the \nextradition of convicted Nazi war criminals between the U.S. and their \ncountry of origin.\n  The World War II Accountability Act seeks to remedy this situation by \nmaking cooperation in the extradition of Nazi war criminals a \nprerequisite to a country's inclusion in the U.S. visa waiver program. \nThis is a powerful incentive for countries that continue to harbor \nthese criminals. I believe it is a necessary tool to compel the \nrelevant countries to cooperate with our search for justice. For \nholocaust survivors, this justice is long overdue.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/12/senate-section/article/S4032-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4032]]\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 558--DESIGNATING JUNE 10, 2008, AS ``NATIONAL HUNGER \nAWARENESS DAY'' AND AUTHORIZING THE COLLECTION OF FOOD DONATIONS DURING \n   THE PERIOD BEGINNING MAY 12, 2008, AND ENDING JUNE 10, 2008, FROM \n CONCERNED MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND STAFF TO ASSIST FAMILIES SUFFERING \n  FROM HUNGER AND FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WASHINGTON, DC, METROPOLITAN \n                                  AREA\n\n  Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. Dole, Mr. \nCasey, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 558\n\n       Whereas food insecurity and hunger are a fact of life for \n     millions of low-income citizens of the United States and can \n     produce physical, mental, and social impairments;\n       Whereas recent data published by the Department of \n     Agriculture show that 35,500,000 people in the United States \n     live in households experiencing hunger or food insecurity, \n     and of that number, 22,800,000 are adults and 12,600,000 are \n     children;\n       Whereas households with children had nearly twice the rate \n     of food insecurity as those without children;\n       Whereas 3.3 percent of all United States households (3.8 \n     million households) have accessed emergency food from a food \n     pantry 1 or more times;\n       Whereas 55.5 percent of food-insecure households have \n     participated in at least 1 of the 3 major Federal food \n     assistance programs: the Federal food stamp program \n     established by the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2011 et \n     seq.), the school lunch program established by the Richard B. \n     Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.), \n     and the special supplemental nutrition program for women, \n     infants, and children established under section 17 of the \n     Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1786);\n       Whereas the problem of hunger and food insecurity can be \n     found in rural, suburban, and urban portions of the United \n     States, touching nearly every community of the Nation;\n       Whereas, although substantial progress has been made in \n     reducing the incidence of hunger and food insecurity in the \n     United States, certain groups remain vulnerable to hunger and \n     the negative effects of food deprivation, including the \n     working poor, the elderly, homeless people, children, migrant \n     workers, and Native Americans;\n       Whereas the people of the United States have a long \n     tradition of providing food assistance to hungry people \n     through acts of private generosity and public support \n     programs;\n       Whereas there is a growing awareness of the important \n     public and private partnership role that community-based \n     organizations, institutions of faith, and charities provide \n     in assisting hungry and food-insecure people;\n       Whereas more than 50,000 local community-based \n     organizations rely on the support and efforts of more than \n     1,000,000 volunteers to provide food assistance and services \n     to millions of vulnerable people;\n       Whereas all citizens of the United States can help \n     participate in hunger relief efforts in their communities \n     by--\n       (1) donating food and money to such efforts;\n       (2) volunteering for such efforts; and\n       (3) supporting public policies aimed at reducing hunger: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 10, 2008, as ``National Hunger \n     Awareness Day'';\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to observe \n     National Hunger Awareness Day--\n       (A) with appropriate ceremonies, volunteer activities, and \n     other support for local anti-hunger advocacy efforts and \n     hunger relief charities, including food banks, food rescue \n     organizations, food pantries, soup kitchens, and emergency \n     shelters; and\n       (B) by continuing to support programs and public policies \n     that reduce hunger and food insecurity in the United States; \n     and\n       (3) authorizes the collection of food donations during the \n     period beginning May 12, 2008, and ending June 10, 2008, from \n     concerned Members of Congress and staff to assist families \n     suffering from hunger and food insecurity in the Washington, \n     D.C., metropolitan area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/12/senate-section/article/S4032-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 559--DESIGNATING MAY 15, 2008, AS ``NATIONAL MPS \n                            AWARENESS DAY''\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Burr, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \nFeingold, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Specter, Ms. \nMikulski, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Brown, Mr. Stevens, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. \nCollins, and Mr. Crapo) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 559\n\n       Whereas mucopolysaccharidosis (referred to in this \n     resolution as ``MPS'') is a genetically determined lysosomal \n     storage disorder that renders the human body incapable of \n     producing certain enzymes needed to break down complex \n     carbohydrates;\n       Whereas complex carbohydrates are then stored in almost \n     every cell in the body and progressively cause damage to \n     those cells;\n       Whereas the cell damage adversely affects the human body by \n     damaging the heart, respiratory system, bones, internal \n     organs, and central nervous system;\n       Whereas the cellular damage caused by MPS often results in \n     mental retardation, short stature, corneal damage, joint \n     stiffness, loss of mobility, speech and hearing impairment, \n     heart disease, hyperactivity, chronic respiratory problems, \n     and, most importantly, a drastically shortened life span;\n       Whereas the nature of the disorder is usually not apparent \n     at birth;\n       Whereas, without treatment, the life expectancy of an \n     individual afflicted with MPS begins to decrease at a very \n     early stage in the life of the individual;\n       Whereas recent research developments have resulted in the \n     creation of limited treatments for some MPS disorders;\n       Whereas promising advancements in the pursuit of treatments \n     for additional MPS disorders are underway;\n       Whereas, despite the creation of newly developed remedies, \n     the blood brain barrier continues to be a significant \n     impediment to effectively treating the brain, thereby \n     preventing the treatment of many of the symptoms of MPS;\n       Whereas treatments for MPS will be greatly enhanced with \n     continued public funding;\n       Whereas the quality of life for individuals afflicted with \n     MPS, and the treatments available to them, will be enhanced \n     through the development of early detection techniques and \n     early intervention;\n       Whereas treatments and research advancements for MPS are \n     limited by a lack of awareness about MPS disorders;\n       Whereas the lack of awareness about MPS disorders extends \n     to those within the medical community;\n       Whereas the damage that is caused by MPS makes it a model \n     for study of many other degenerative genetic disorders;\n       Whereas the development of effective therapies and a \n     potential cure for MPS disorders can be accomplished by \n     increased awareness, research, data collection, and \n     information distribution;\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution than can raise public \n     awareness about MPS; and\n       Whereas the Senate is also an institution that can assist \n     in encouraging and facilitating increased public and private \n     sector research for early diagnosis and treatments of MPS \n     disorders: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 15, 2008, as ``National MPS Awareness \n     Day''; and\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of ``National MPS \n     Awareness Day''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/12/senate-section/article/S4032-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 560--PROCLAIMING THE WEEK OF MAY 18 THROUGH MAY 24, \n                2008, AS ``NATIONAL PUBLIC WORKS WEEK''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Inhofe) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Con. Res. 82\n\n       Whereas the United States enjoys broadcasting and sound \n     recording industries that are the envy of the world, due to \n     the symbiotic relationship that has existed among these \n     industries for many decades;\n       Whereas, for more than 80 years, Congress has rejected \n     repeated calls by the recording industry to impose a \n     performance fee on local radio stations for simply playing \n     music on the radio and upsetting the mutually beneficial \n     relationship between local radio and the recording industry;\n       Whereas local radio stations provide free publicity and \n     promotion to the recording industry and performers of music \n     in the form of radio air play, interviews with performers, \n     introduction of new performers, concert promotions, and \n     publicity that promotes the sale of music, concert tickets, \n     ring tones, music videos, and associated merchandise;\n       Whereas Congress found that ``the sale of many sound \n     recordings and the careers of many performers benefited \n     considerably from airplay and other promotional activities \n     provided by both noncommercial and advertiser-supported, free \n     over-the-air broadcasting'';\n       Whereas local radio broadcasters provide tens of thousands \n     of hours of essential local news and weather information \n     during times of national emergencies and natural disasters, \n     such as September 11th and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, as \n     well as public affairs programming, sports, and hundreds of \n     millions of dollars of time for public service announcements \n     and local fund raising efforts for worthy charitable causes, \n     all of which are jeopardized if local radio stations are \n     forced to divert revenues to pay for a new performance fee;\n       Whereas there are many thousands of local radio stations \n     that will suffer severe economic hardship if any new \n     performance fee is imposed, as will many other small \n     businesses that play music including bars, restaurants, \n     retail establishments, sports and other entertainment venues, \n     shopping centers, and transportation facilities; and\n       Whereas the hardship that would result from a new \n     performance fee would hurt American businesses, and \n     ultimately the American consumers who rely on local radio for \n     news, weather, and entertainment, and such a performance fee \n     is not justified when the current system has produced the \n     most prolific and innovative broadcasting, music, and sound \n     recording industries in the world: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress should not impose any new \n     performance fee, tax, royalty, or other charge relating to \n     the public performance of sound recordings on a local radio \n     station for broadcasting sound recordings over the air, or on \n     any business for such public performance of sound recordings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/12/senate-section/article/S4033-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Res. 558\n\n       Whereas food insecurity and hunger are a fact of life for \n     millions of low-income citizens of the United States and can \n     produce physical, mental, and social impairments;\n       Whereas recent data published by the Department of \n     Agriculture show that 35,500,000 people in the United States \n     live in households experiencing hunger or food insecurity, \n     and of that number, 22,800,000 are adults and 12,600,000 are \n     children;\n       Whereas households with children had nearly twice the rate \n     of food insecurity as those without children;\n       Whereas 3.3 percent of all United States households (3.8 \n     million households) have accessed emergency food from a food \n     pantry 1 or more times;\n       Whereas 55.5 percent of food-insecure households have \n     participated in at least 1 of the 3 major Federal food \n     assistance programs: the Federal food stamp program \n     established by the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2011 et \n     seq.), the school lunch program established by the Richard B. \n     Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.), \n     and the special supplemental nutrition program for women, \n     infants, and children established under section 17 of the \n     Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1786);\n       Whereas the problem of hunger and food insecurity can be \n     found in rural, suburban, and urban portions of the United \n     States, touching nearly every community of the Nation;\n       Whereas, although substantial progress has been made in \n     reducing the incidence of hunger and food insecurity in the \n     United States, certain groups remain vulnerable to hunger and \n     the negative effects of food deprivation, including the \n     working poor, the elderly, homeless people, children, migrant \n     workers, and Native Americans;\n       Whereas the people of the United States have a long \n     tradition of providing food assistance to hungry people \n     through acts of private generosity and public support \n     programs;\n       Whereas there is a growing awareness of the important \n     public and private partnership role that community-based \n     organizations, institutions of faith, and charities provide \n     in assisting hungry and food-insecure people;\n       Whereas more than 50,000 local community-based \n     organizations rely on the support and efforts of more than \n     1,000,000 volunteers to provide food assistance and services \n     to millions of vulnerable people;\n       Whereas all citizens of the United States can help \n     participate in hunger relief efforts in their communities \n     by--\n       (1) donating food and money to such efforts;\n       (2) volunteering for such efforts; and\n       (3) supporting public policies aimed at reducing hunger: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 10, 2008, as ``National Hunger \n     Awareness Day'';\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to observe \n     National Hunger Awareness Day--\n       (A) with appropriate ceremonies, volunteer activities, and \n     other support for local anti-hunger advocacy efforts and \n     hunger relief charities, including food banks, food rescue \n     organizations, food pantries, soup kitchens, and emergency \n     shelters; and\n\n[[Page S4046]]\n\n       (B) by continuing to support programs and public policies \n     that reduce hunger and food insecurity in the United States; \n     and\n       (3) authorizes the collection of food donations during the \n     period beginning May 12, 2008, and ending June 10, 2008, from \n     concerned Members of Congress and staff to assist families \n     suffering from hunger and food insecurity in the Washington, \n     D.C., metropolitan area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/12/senate-section/article/S4046-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL MPS AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

Res. 559\n\n       Whereas mucopolysaccharidosis (referred to in this \n     resolution as ``MPS'') is a genetically determined lysosomal \n     storage disorder that renders the human body incapable of \n     producing certain enzymes needed to break down complex \n     carbohydrates;\n       Whereas complex carbohydrates are then stored in almost \n     every cell in the body and progressively cause damage to \n     those cells;\n       Whereas the cell damage adversely affects the human body by \n     damaging the heart, respiratory system, bones, internal \n     organs, and central nervous system;\n       Whereas the cellular damage caused by MPS often results in \n     mental retardation, short stature, corneal damage, joint \n     stiffness, loss of mobility, speech and hearing impairment, \n     heart disease, hyperactivity, chronic respiratory problems, \n     and, most importantly, a drastically shortened life span;\n       Whereas the nature of the disorder is usually not apparent \n     at birth;\n       Whereas, without treatment, the life expectancy of an \n     individual afflicted with MPS begins to decrease at a very \n     early stage in the life of the individual;\n       Whereas recent research developments have resulted in the \n     creation of limited treatments for some MPS disorders;\n       Whereas promising advancements in the pursuit of treatments \n     for additional MPS disorders are underway;\n       Whereas, despite the creation of newly developed remedies, \n     the blood brain barrier continues to be a significant \n     impediment to effectively treating the brain, thereby \n     preventing the treatment of many of the symptoms of MPS;\n       Whereas treatments for MPS will be greatly enhanced with \n     continued public funding;\n       Whereas the quality of life for individuals afflicted with \n     MPS, and the treatments available to them, will be enhanced \n     through the development of early detection techniques and \n     early intervention;\n       Whereas treatments and research advancements for MPS are \n     limited by a lack of awareness about MPS disorders;\n       Whereas the lack of awareness about MPS disorders extends \n     to those within the medical community;\n       Whereas the damage that is caused by MPS makes it a model \n     for study of many other degenerative genetic disorders;\n       Whereas the development of effective therapies and a \n     potential cure for MPS disorders can be accomplished by \n     increased awareness, research, data collection, and \n     information distribution;\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution than can raise public \n     awareness about MPS; and\n       Whereas the Senate is also an institution that can assist \n     in encouraging and facilitating increased public and private \n     sector research for early diagnosis and treatments of MPS \n     disorders: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 15, 2008, as ``National MPS Awareness \n     Day''; and\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of ``National MPS \n     Awareness Day''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/12/senate-section/article/S4046-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL PUBLIC WORKS WEEK\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.
