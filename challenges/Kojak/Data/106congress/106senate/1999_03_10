Under the previous order, there will now be an \nhour for debate to be equally divided between the chairman and the \nranking minority member of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we will start off with 5 minutes for the \nSenator from Louisiana and try to get some additional time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts for his leadership on this issue. He is trying to \ncommunicate, and I think eloquently so, the issue before us. This week \nwe want to do something good, something that is meaningful, something \nthat will help in our education system in this country. We need to \nspend more than just a few days. It has been a little discouraging, I \nthink, for some of us, on both sides of the aisle, in our evident lack \nof ability to come to some reasonable agreements about some of these \namendments, so they are preventing this good bill from passing.\n  I am a cosponsor of the Ed-Flex bill, along with Members of the \nRepublican side and other Democrats who are supporting this bill. Why? \nBecause our Governors at home are supporting this bill; our \nsuperintendents at home are supporting this bill.\n  I had the great privilege of cohosting, with my Governor and \nsuperintendent of education, and our BESE, which is the Board of \nElementary and Secondary Education, just Monday in our State, over 250 \neducation leaders from all over the State, from all of our 64 parishes. \nThey came and expressed their support for the idea that the Federal \nGovernment should give the schools, the States and the districts more \nflexibility so they can combine programs to more efficiently spend the \nmoney, as long as the basic regulations of safety, health and civil \nrights are there. They really want the flexibility. I would like to \ngive it to them, and I know the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts and our leader from Vermont wants to, also.\n  So, I am hoping we can come to some agreement. If we could offer a \nfew amendments on our side and other amendments could be offered on the \nRepublican side, amendments that are meaningful, then we could get this \nbill passed with a couple of other things that will work and need to be \ndone.\n\n  One of those things is the reduction of class size. I don't believe \nthere is an educator who would disagree. Whether you are from \nCalifornia or Vermont or Louisiana or Illinois, who doesn't know that \nhaving smaller classes at those earlier grades--particularly \nkindergarten, first, second and third grades--is so important?\n\n[[Page S2466]]\n\n  I could give this speech pretty well before I was a mom. Now I can \ngive it very well. Frank and I have a 6-year-old who is learning to \nread this year. With 28 kids in his class, it is a struggle. He has a \ntutor. We help him at home. But the teacher does not have enough time \nindividually.\n  We want to be able to send some money down to the States, with very \nfew strings attached, to help our school districts that are really \nstruggling in this area, to give them some additional money to help \nthem hire additional teachers. In doing that, as I was told this \nMonday--and I want to communicate this to my colleagues--it would be no \nuse to send that money down to help reduce class size if we also do not \nsend a companion amendment down for school construction and \nmodernization. You cannot have a new teacher if you don't have a \nclassroom or you don't have the space for that teacher to teach and to \ndivide those classes into smaller units.\n  We have a crisis in our country at this moment. That crisis is that \n40 percent of our youngsters at the second grade level are not reading \nat second grade level. Let me repeat that: not 2 percent, not 10 \npercent, not 25 percent--but 40 percent. Unfortunately, in some places \nin Louisiana, in some demographic groups, that number is tragically as \nhigh as 70 percent.\n  If this is not something the Federal Government should be concerned \nabout, I don't know what is. I don't know of anything that is more \nsignificant than having second graders in this country--the strongest \ncountry, militarily, in the world, economically strong, leading the \nworld in many areas--but lagging behind in this simple basic.\n  Local governments can do some things. The State government most \ncertainly is the big partner. But we need to be a junior partner, and \nwe need to be a reliable junior partner by putting up some money where \nour mouth is, sending that money down to the States with as few strings \nattached as possible, and then insisting, in partnership with our \nlocals, on accountability every step of the way.\n  So, yes, this Ed-Flex bill is important, giving more flexibility to \nlocal governments. But if we would do that and not do our class size, \nour school construction, we would be--I know my time is running short, \nso let me just conclude--we would be shortchanging students who are \nalready shortchanged by the numbers I have just suggested.\n  I thank my colleague. Could I have 1 more minute?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I yield 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. So I think we would be shortchanging these students, \nour students, our teachers, our parents, if we cannot get this bill \nstraight by giving the flexibility, adding some additional money for \nclass size reduction, adding some additional bonding capacity for \nschool construction and modernization, so we can begin this next \ncentury with a real investment in the things that count, that is in our \neducation system, K through 12 particularly.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's additional time has expired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank those who have brought this bill to the floor. \nThank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are about to take our third and fourth \ncloture votes this week, the first on whether we will meet our 7-year \ncommitment to help communities reduce class size and the second on \nwhether we will prematurely end this education debate.\n  While our Republican friends continue to block action on critical \neducation issues for the sixth day in a row, communities are struggling \nto make decisions about their school budgets--they need and expect our \nhelp.\n  We have an excellent opportunity to deal with key education issues \nthat have been clear for many months--reducing class size, recruiting \nmore teachers, expanding afterschool programs, bringing technology into \nthe classroom, reducing dropout rates, modernizing school buildings. No \nbill on the Senate Calendar right now is more important than education.\n  Nothing is more important on the calendar of local schools than their \nbudgets. Over the next three weeks, schools across the country will be \nmaking major decisions on their budgets for the next school year. In \nmany of these communities, the budgets are due by early April. In \nMemphis, school budgets are due on March 22. In Fayette County, KY, \nschool budgets are due on March 31. In Boston, Savannah, Las Vegas, and \nHouston, school budgets are due the first week of April. In San \nFrancisco, they are due April 1; Council Bluffs, IA, school budgets are \ndue April 15. In Altoona, PA, school budgets are due in April.\n  This is why the Murray amendment is so important to consider, so that \nschools will be able to say, yes, we want to use this money for new \nschoolteachers, for smaller class size, because we know for the next 6 \nor 7 years, there will be a continuing commitment and enough resources \nto be able to do it.\n  The Senate should keep its promise that schools will be able to hire \n100,000 new teachers over the next 7 years to help them reduce class \nsize. Communities can't do it alone. They want the Federal Government \nto be a strong partner in improving their schools. We can't sit on the \nsidelines or allow this debate on education to stay in gridlock.\n  A teacher from Kansas wants action by Uncle Sam. He writes:\n\n       Even here in Kansas, many teachers struggle to provide \n     their students with a quality education because they have so \n     many students to reach. We have waited for years for the \n     State legislature to do something, but they haven't. Now is \n     the time for the Federal Government to step in and help. Your \n     support for this bill will speak loudly to myself and other \n     teachers that you truly believe in public education. Please \n     help reduce class size in our country.\n\n  A teacher from Maine writes:\n\n       It is becoming more and more necessary to reduce class \n     sizes to address the individual needs of a wider variety of \n     students. . . . Please support the initiative to hire more \n     teachers to reduce class sizes in U.S. public schools.\n\n  A parent from North Carolina writes:\n\n       I am a parent with 2 children in a public school and one \n     that will enter school soon. . . . I am very well aware of \n     the critical need for additional classroom teachers. Our \n     children, our future, and our Nation depend upon a strong \n     public school system.\n\n  Mr. President, last year when we signed onto the first year on \nreducing class size it was done in a bipartisan way. Listen to what \nHouse Majority Leader Dick Armey said:\n\n       We were very pleased to receive the President's request for \n     more teachers, especially since he offered to provide a way \n     to pay for them. And when the President's people were willing \n     to work with us so that we could let the State and local \n     communities use this money, make these decisions, manage \n     the money, spend the money on teachers where they saw the \n     need, whether it be for special education or for regular \n     teaching, with freedom of choice and management and \n     control at the local level, we thought this good for \n     America and good for the school children. We were very \n     excited to move forward on that.\n\n  That was what the majority leader, Dick Armey, said about that \nagreement--just 5 months ago, Mr. President. That is why we find it so \ndifficult to understand why we can't at least get to the point of \nconsideration on this measure.\n  Senator Slade Gorton said about the Class Size Reduction Act:\n\n       On education, there's been a genuine meeting of the minds \n     involving the President and the Democrats and Republicans \n     here in Congress. . . . It will go directly through to each \n     of the 14,000 school districts in the United States, and each \n     of those school districts will make its own determination as \n     to what kind of new teachers that district needs most, which \n     kind should be hired. . . . We've made a step in the \n     direction that we like. We never were arguing over the amount \n     of money that ought to go into education. And so this is a \n     case in which both sides genuinely can claim a triumph.\n\n  The Murray amendment is a continuation of what was agreed to last \nyear, in which both sides claimed triumph, and there was a movement \nmade towards smaller classrooms. That is what the issue is that we will \nbe voting on at 1.\n  The Senate should not turn its back on our promise to help \ncommunities reduce class size in the early grades. We should meet our \ncommitment to parents, students and communities, and we should meet it \nnow.\n  We need to act now, so communities can act effectively for the next 7 \nyears.\n\n[[Page S2467]]\n\nSenator Daschle has made a reasonable proposal for an up-or-down vote \non a limited number of amendments with limited time agreements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 6 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I hope his proposal will be accepted and we can move \ntowards a vote on the issue of class size as well as the Republican s \nproposal on the IDEA.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Nevada, Mr. \nReid.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have more than 1 million people in our \nprisons around the country. Let us just round it off and say we have 1 \nmillion people in prison. Eight hundred twenty thousand of those \nprisoners have no high school education; 82 percent of the people in \nour prisons today are without a high school education. That is why \nSenator Bingaman and I have offered an amendment to create within the \nDepartment of Education someone to specialize, to work on, to keep \nthese kids in school.\n  Every day 3,000 children drop out of school in America. Since we \nstarted the debate on this legislation, 15,000 children have dropped \nout of high school. Every one of those children dropping out of high \nschool are less than they could be. I have heard statements here the \nlast several days saying, well, why do we need to talk about kids \ndropping out of school? Why don't we talk about the children who are \nhandicapped who need money?\n  I acknowledge that. The fact of the matter is, we have tried on this \nside of the aisle to get more funding for special education and have \nbeen unable to do so because of not having enough votes on that side of \nthe aisle. It is not an either/or situation. We need to help local \nschool districts with more funding for handicapped children, and I \nrecognize that. I will do that. If we had a vote on that today, I would \nvote for it.\n  That does not take away from the fact that we need to do something \nabout high school dropouts. I do not believe, personally, there is a \nmore important problem in education today than kids dropping out of \nhigh school, half a million children each year dropping out of high \nschool. I think we should go back and find out where we are.\n  As the manager on the Democratic side of this legislation, Senator \nKennedy, has said, we are not trying to eat up lots of time. We will \nagree to half hour amendments on five amendments. That takes 2\\1/2\\ \nhours, 15 minutes on each side, and vote on them, vote them up or down. \nThe legislation, we feel, is important. If the other side doesn't want \nto vote for them, have them vote against them. I think it would be a \nvery difficult vote, for example, on the Bingaman-Reid legislation to \nvote against keeping kids in high school, but that is a privilege.\n  The majority leader of the U.S. Senate, on February 23, gave a speech \nto the National Governors' Conference at their annual meeting:\n\n       Now when we bring up the education issues to the floor next \n     week, [there will] be some amendments and disagreements. . . \n     . That's great. Let's go to the Senate floor, let's take \n     days, let's take a week, let's take 2 weeks if it's \n     necessary. Let's talk about education.\n\n  I respectfully submit to the majority leader that he must have left \nhis remarks with the Governors and didn't bring them to the floor of \nthe Senate, because after a little more than a day of debating Ed-Flex, \nwe in effect have been gagged. It seems around here that we can only \nvote on amendments the majority wants to vote on; that we have no \nability to bring up amendments we feel are important.\n  The Ed-Flex bill is important legislation. We support that \nlegislation. But we do not support the legislation without having the \nlegislation made better. I am not going to talk about the afterschool \nprograms and the new teachers we need and school construction; others \ncan do that and do that well. I am here to talk about the Bingaman-Reid \nlegislation which talks about children dropping out of school.\n  The Ed-Flex bill would be made a better bill if we said within the \nDepartment of Education there would be $30 million a year--that's all--\n$30 million a year out of this multibillion-dollar budget that we would \nuse to work on keeping kids in high school. Think if the bill succeeded \nto the effect that we could keep in school every day 500 of those 3,000 \nchildren--500 kids that would be what they could be. They would have a \nhigh school education. They could more easily support their families. \nThey could go on to college and trade school. You cannot do that if you \nhave not graduated from high school. We would only--and I underline \n``only''--only have 2,500 high school dropouts a day.\n  Mr. President, I think we need to move forward and have a debate on \neducation. A debate on education allows us to talk about what we want \nto talk about, and we would improve the Ed-Flex bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that we have the ability to vote on keeping kids in \nschool.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts for his leadership on this bill as well.\n  Mr. President, I would like to congratulate our colleagues, Senators \nFrist and Wyden, for their efforts to provide States and localities \nwith greater opportunities to be innovative in their use of Federal \nfunds.\n  This bill provides States and localities with the flexibility and \nfreedom from Federal regulations that is often necessary for States to \nbest serve their children and parents in providing top-notch \neducational services.\n  As a former Governor, I am particularly sensitive to the argument \nthat too many Federal strings and regulations make Federal assistance \nseem more like a Federal burden. This legislation, while not a panacea \nfor all of our educational needs, returns flexibility to the States in \na way that is effective and helpful, but that still requires States to \nbe accountable for positive results as they provide public education to \nour Nation's children.\n  I thank the Senators for their insight and their sensitivity to the \nconcerns of our Nation's Governors, legislatures, and school officials, \nand I urge my colleagues to support this bill--on final passage--if and \nwhen we get there. And I hope we will get to that point as soon as \npossible if we can reach some agreement on relevant amendments.\n\n  Mr. President, I also thank Senators Harkin, Lautenberg, Kennedy, and \nmany others for the opportunity to talk about an amendment that we \nstill hope we will be able to offer in due course which recognizes a \nsad reality faced every schoolday by too many children and teachers \nacross the country.\n  We all say--here in Washington, in every State capital, and in every \ncounty, city, and town--that education is important. Indeed, it is \ncritically important. But those words must ring hollow to the millions \nof children who walk through the doors of their schools to find leaky \nroofs, crowded classrooms, and woefully inadequate heating and air-\nconditioning systems. The state of too many of our schools is \ndeplorable.\n  Mr. President, in spite of the relatively good economic times, many \nStates are experiencing, many local governments are experiencing just \nthe opposite, and they have not been able to meet the school \nconstruction and renovation challenges that are facing our Nation.\n  This is an area where the Federal Government can and we believe \nshould play a pivotal role without interfering with the longstanding \npreference for local control of education. The Federal Government can \nbe a meaningful partner in contributing to the vital national interest \nthat our students receive a good education in an environment that is \nconducive to learning.\n  Mr. President, the General Accounting Office estimates our national \nschool infrastructure repair needs total some $112 billion. That same \nGAO study also estimates that we, as a Nation, need $73 billion to \nbuild the new schools that are required to accommodate the rapid growth \nin our public school enrollments.\n  In addition to all of the findings in the amendment that we still \nhope to have an opportunity to be able to vote on, I have similar data \nfrom my own State of Virginia which indicates not only tremendous \ninfrastructure needs exist, but our State and local governments simply \ncannot afford to foot the bill by themselves.\n\n[[Page S2468]]\n\n  A 1998 report on school infrastructure, requested by the general \nassembly, found that while localities estimate that school construction \ninvestments of $4.1 billion will be made in the next 5 years, school \nconstruction needs in Virginia could exceed $8.2 billion. Virginia \nGovernor Gilmore and the members of the general assembly approved a \nschool construction repair plan this year which I applaud, but which \nonly meets 3 percent of that unmet burden.\n  While there is no question that every dollar counts, and helps, I \nhave heard from students, parents, teachers, administrators, school \nboard officials and legislators about the need to complement Virginia \nschool modernization construction efforts.\n  Earlier this year, the Thomas Jefferson Center for Educational Design \nat the University of Virginia issued a report which not only echoed the \nneed for more school construction funds, but also detailed the \nalarmingly unsafe or inadequate condition of many schools in our \nCommonwealth.\n  Classes are being held in over 3,000 trailers; 2 out of 3 school \ndistricts have held class in auditoriums, cafeterias, storage areas, \nand book closets; and 3 percent of Virginia school districts had to \nincrease the size of their classes in order to accommodate their \ngrowing student population.\n  While I don't let public opinion polls determine how I vote on issues \nI believe it is appropriate to note that there is overwhelming public \nsupport for Federal help in the area of school construction funding.\n  In a recent poll conducted by Republican pollster Frank Luntz, 83 \npercent of Americans surveyed supported significant Federal school \nconstruction spending and indicated that it should be a top priority of \nCongress.\n  Still, some believe that our nation's infrastructure needs in other \nareas are just as compelling as our school construction and repair \nneeds.\n  In a statement made to the Finance Committee last week a Public \nFinance Specialist with the Congressional Research Service concluded \nthat the ``condition of America's school facilities may or may not be \nworse than the condition of other capital facilities of other State and \nlocal public services.'' This statement would seem to imply, Mr. \nPresident, that the Federal Government should not attempt to prioritize \ninfrastructure needs.\n  Last year, however, Congress approved $216 billion in road and \ntransit funds.\n  We were obviously willing to concentrate on transportation needs \nduring our last session.\n  Why shouldn't we concentrate on school infrastructure needs this \nsession, particularly in light of the 1998 Report Card for America's \nInfrastructure issued by the American Society of Civil Engineers, which \nrates our public schools as being in the worst condition among all \npublic infrastructure.\n  The simple fact Mr. President, is that prioritization is our \nresponsibility.\n  Many years ago, when faced with enormous transportation needs as well \nas a large growth in our nation's student population, President \nEisenhower proposed a massive national infrastructure project in his \n1955 State of the Union Address.\n  This project resulted in the building of many of the nation's schools \nin existence today.\n  Mr. President, Loudoun County in Northern Virginia has determined \nthat, because of the enormous growth of their student population, they \nneed to build 22 new schools.\n  That figure doesn't even address their repair needs. And just down \nthe road, at Chantilly High School, which I visited last spring with \nEducation Secretary, Dick Riley, students are sharing lockers, \nattending classes in over a dozen trailers that have poor ventilation, \nand are so crammed in the hallways when they change classes that school \nofficials were actually considering banning bookbags and backpacks.\n\n  Mr. President, I received a compelling letter from the Superintendent \nof Schools in Caroll County, VA, about that county's school \nconstruction needs.\n  Superintendent Oliver McBride outlined that the average age of the \nschool buildings in Carroll County is 45 years. Carroll County school \nofficials estimate that their school construction needs total $61 \nmillion.\n  Mr. McBride wrote,\n\n       We have been particularly pleased with the interest and \n     response of the members of the Virginia General Assembly and \n     Governor Gilmore who have and are seeking to make additional \n     funds for school construction available to localities in the \n     State. We certainly would encourage the U.S. Congress to \n     become a participant in this effort as well . . . Simply \n     stated, we need your help.\n\n  Mr. President, our efforts to help States and localities build and \nrenovate schools in no way jeopardizes their autonomy with respect to \neducation. It merely acknowledges the need for the Federal Government \nto complement the efforts of many States and localities that are now \nwrestling with the question of how to repair and equip old schools, and \nhow to build new schools.\n  Mr. President, it is our children who pay the price if we fail to \nacknowledge that Federal school construction funding is both imminently \nappropriate and critically important.\n  And if my colleagues want to debate how we allocate school \nconstruction money, whether we target any funds to specific districts, \nhow we avoid creating too many Federal strings, or how we can make it \neasy for States to take advantage of this type of funding mechanism, I \nam more than willing to do that.\n  But the point is we need to engage in that discussion. And we need to \nbegin now.\n  Our children, their parents, and our States need our help.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this sense-of-the-Senate amendment if \nwe are permitted to offer it.\n  Let's at least send the right message to this Nation: that we see the \nleaking roofs, that we see the cracked walls, that we see all the \ntrailers--and that we are willing to help.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank again my colleague from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to Senator Kennedy, thank you very much not only \nfor yielding to me, but also for your great leadership on this \nimportant issue of education.\n  I want to just bring us up to date on where we are, at least where I \nthink we are. At 1 o'clock we are going to have a vote to basically \nallow us to take up the issue of the 100,000 new teachers in the \nclassroom that Senator Murray has worked so hard on, and Senator \nKennedy and others. Certainly, the President puts this as a priority in \nhis budget. Where we are now is, if we do not vote to do that, this \nbill is effectively shut down. Ed-Flex alone--and it is a good bill--\nturns its back on all the other education needs my colleagues have \ndiscussed.\n  The Senator from Vermont keeps offering an amendment on IDEA to fund \nit; and he is right, and I am ready to vote for that. Why does he block \nmy chance to vote on afterschool? Why does he block my chance to vote \non 100,000 teachers? Why does he block my chance to vote on dropouts? I \nwill support him in his desire to fund IDEA. He is right on that point, \nbut he is wrong to go along with the strategy which blocks us from \nvoting on issues of such importance to America's families.\n  I want to share a couple of charts in my remaining few minutes with \neveryone. Here you see children involved in afterschool activities. We \nwant a chance to offer our afterschool amendment which would open up \nafterschool to a million children. Look at the look on the faces of \nthese children. They are engaged, they are learning, they are occupied, \nand they are happy.\n  Another picture. Look at these children. They are not getting into \ntrouble. They are engaging with a mentor and obviously, from the look \non their faces, are very involved in this learning game.\n  What happens if we do not have these afterschool programs? You do not \nhave to be a genius to know that kids get in trouble after school. Look \nat this chart. At 3 o'clock, juvenile crime spikes and it does not go \ndown until late in the evening and it starts to go down at 6 when \nparents come home from work. We know that children need to be kept \nbusy. That is why we have the support of law enforcement for our \nafterschool programs.\n  Let me show you the law enforcement who has supported afterschool\n\n[[Page S2469]]\n\nprograms since we began this effort. Senator Dodd has worked hard on \nthis; Senator Kennedy. Again, I do not want to sound like I am the only \none that is pushing this. We have many, many Senators on our side of \nthe aisle--and we hope some on the other, although it has not been \ntested yet--who support this.\n  Here are the law enforcement that have written to us: National \nAssociation of Police Athletic Leagues, Fight Crime, Invest in Kids, \nNational Sheriffs Association, Major Cities Police Chiefs, Police \nExecutive Research Forum, National District Attorneys Association, \nCalifornia District Attorneys Association, Illinois Association of \nChiefs of Police, Texas Police Chiefs Association, Arizona Sheriffs and \nProsecutors Association, Maine Chiefs and Sheriffs Association, Rhode \nIsland Police Chiefs Association.\n\n  That is an example of law enforcement that supports afterschool \nprograms.\n  We just got a letter from the Police Athletic League in which they \ntalk about the importance of adding an amendment such as the Boxer \namendment which, in essence, says that law enforcement participation in \nafterschool programs is important. We mention law enforcement in our \nbill over and over again.\n  A quote from the PAL letter:\n\n       After-school youth development programs like those proposed \n     in your amendment have been shown to cut juvenile crime \n     immediately, sometimes by 40-75 percent.\n\n  That is a quote from a letter to me.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who often talk \nabout law and order and the importance of going after criminals--and I \nshare their concern--this is one thing we can do to stop crime after \nschool.\n  I close with this statistic: 92 percent of the American people favor \nafterschool programs. Let's do it.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  First, I want to discuss very briefly the Boxer amendment. Back in \n1993, I offered--and it was endorsed in 1994, when we were \nreauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--the basic \namendment that Senator Boxer is talking about. We called it the 21st \nCentury Schools at the time, though it was only minutely funded.\n  This past year, the President decided that was a good program. He put \n$200 million into the program and I deeply appreciate this \nacknowledgment that it was a good program. Thus, we are talking about \nsomething which I agree with and that Congress did back in 1994. The \ntime to review it, however, is when we're reviewing the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, which has already begun with hearings and will \ncontinue.\n  So the concept is one that is acknowledged by everyone as being \nimportant. The need for remedial education has increased dramatically, \nand the way that can be addressed is through afterschool programs. When \nwe get to this issue later in the year, at the proper time, I will be \nendorsing the concept and welcoming amendments from either side to make \nthe initiative more consistent with the current needs.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe it appropriate to step back one \nor two steps from the debate over educational flexibility legislation \nand the 100,000 teachers proposal which is in front of us and look at \nthe general philosophy of Federal education and the profound \ndifferences between the two sides.\n  Perhaps the best place in which to determine the attitude of the \nClinton administration and its supporters here in Congress with respect \nto the Federal role in education is the budget of the United States \nsubmitted by the President approximately 1 month ago.\n  For a number of years, there has been one relatively modest program \nof unrestricted aid to school districts across the United States of \nAmerica. It is called title VI, for innovative program strategies, the \nleast rule-infested, the least bureaucracy-influenced of all of the \nforms of Federal aid to education. For the present year, 1999, it \namounts to $375 million, a very modest amount of Federal aid to \neducation.\n  In the budget of the President of the United States for the year \n2000, it has zero dollars. It is simply wiped out. In its place are \nnine new specific Federal programs, many of which have been discussed \nby Democratic Members of this Senate, totaling almost $250 million, \nevery one of which is aimed at a precise goal, every one of which says \nwe in Washington, DC, know which school districts across the United \nStates know better than do the parents, teachers, and school board \nmembers in those individual communities, and we are going to give you \nmoney with strings and rules attached.\n  Now, there is another Federal program which gives money to certain \nschool districts that they can use for any educational purpose. It is \ncalled impact aid, and it goes to school districts which encompass \nFederal military reservations or other large Federal presences or in \nwhich there are many students who come from such grounds where property \ntaxes are not collected as the basic support for public schools. The \nmoney that comes to those school districts can be spent in the way \nthose school districts deem most effective for the education of their \nkids.\n  Impact aid in this budget from the President is cut by $128 million--\njust slightly less than the $200 million earmarked almost solely for \nnew teachers that is the subject of the debate right here right now. In \nother words, let's stop allowing these school districts to determine \ntheir own educational priorities and we will tell them what their \npriorities are here.\n  Interestingly enough, the total of each of these disfavored programs \nis almost identical to the amount of money in the new, more categorical \naid programs that the President has come up with.\n  Dwarfing that, Mr. President, is the lack of support for special \neducation for IDEA. The President disguises that lack of support by \nroughly the same number of dollars nominally for the year 2000 as he \nhas for the year 1999. But almost $2 billion of that is the funding \nthat will not go to the schools until October 1 of the year 2000. In \nother words, it won't be charged against any deficit in the general \nfund in the year 2000 itself, it will be forwarded to the year 2001. It \nwill be a bill for the people of the United States to pay, a hidden \nbill.\n  Now, that is balanced off by several billion worth of school \nconstruction bonds, the full cost of which to the Federal Government is \nonly $150 million in the year 2000 but will be billions by the time we \nare all finished.\n  Finally, there are a number of present programs--all categorical \nprograms--in the budget which are increased about $750 million, but the \npattern is overwhelming. This administration will cut or eliminate \nthose programs in which the school districts have plenary authority to \nmake choices in which teachers, parents, principals, and school board \nmembers set educational priorities. In every case--including the \nteachers amendments we are talking about here--the judgment by this \nadministration and by those who support it is a very simple one: Local \nschool boards, even State authorities, don't know how to spend their \neducation money and we have to tell them how to do it.\n  So this particular debate over one or two of these particular new \nprograms--always aimed at valid goals, of course --really is a disguise \nfor the statement that more and more control should be transferred from \nlocal school boards, from local entities, and even from the States, to \nthe Department of Education and Washington, DC, and to all of the great \neducational experts here in the U.S. Senate who know how to run all \n17,000 school districts in the United States as a whole.\n  The Senator from Vermont has a perfect alternative, it seems to me, \nto this proposition. That is, at the very least, let school districts \ndetermine whether they want to spend the money on this narrow teachers \nprogram or whether they want to cover the obligations we have already \nundertaken in the Disability Education Program, the special needs \nstudents, where just 2 years ago we passed, and the President signed, a \nbill stating that we would support 40 percent of the cost of that \nspecial education. We are at about 9 percent right\n\n[[Page S2470]]\n\nnow. And when you take out the phony $1.9 billion, which won't even be \ncharged against the 2000 budget, it will drop to about 6 percent. Why? \nIn order to come up with all of these fine-sounding new programs in \nwhich the Federal Government tells each school district exactly how it \nshould operate.\n\n  The choice, Mr. President, is a dramatic choice. The choice is \nwhether or not we will follow the course of this administration and \nreduce substantially the amount of money we allow school districts to \ndetermine the goals for themselves, or tell them more and more what \nthey should do for themselves.\n  Mr. President, that simply is not the right direction in which to go, \nand the increasing categorization of schools should be reversed. We \nshould at least give the flexibility the Senator from Vermont has asked \nfor in the spending of new money--money above and beyond the amount of \nmoney that we are devoting to education at the present time. I commend \nhis arguments to my colleagues and hope we will act accordingly.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first, let me review for a little bit \nwhere we are. As the Senator from Washington pointed out, we have on \nthe floor, an alternative to what would be provided in the Murray \namendment. Schools would be able to have some flexibility on the \nexpenditure of money that intended for schools, if they want, to add \nmore teachers--the new teachers are in the President's new 100,000 \nteachers program.\n  First, I will point out some of the problems with the President's \nprogram as it is presently drafted. The guidelines have just come out \non it, and they still don't seem to cure this problem. I was on a \nnational press hookup this morning, and at least two States who were on \nthat hookup--Wyoming and North Dakota--have already reached the goal of \n18 children per classroom. They would not, under the current \nguidelines, be able to use the money for what they want to use it, \nprofessional development. Vermont is in that same category. The 100,000 \nnew teachers program would affect states differently, and some states \nwould not benefit at all from. Those are just two problems with it.\n  That is why we have the option I suggested, which is in amendment \nform. We will have a chance to vote on it. It would say that you would \nhave the option of using these funds--which will be substantial; in \nmany cases, $1.2 billion is involved--toward reaching the commitment we \nmade back in 1975 and 1976, to provide 40 percent of the funding for \nspecial education. We are down to less than 10 percent at this point.\n  The chart behind me shows that very well. The orange in that chart is \nwhat we should be paying to the schools across the Nation for special \neducation assistance, and we are not. In addition to that, a recent \nSupreme Court decision has said that schools must not only take care of \nthe educational aspects, but they must also take care of the medical \naspects of a child who needs medical assistance in the schoolhouse. \nThat is going to add hundreds of millions of dollars more in special \neducation costs, I would guess, in the years ahead, and probably even \nthis year.\n  To refresh people's memory, the agreement on the $1.2 billion, \n100,000 teacher proposal happened in the wee hours of final passage of \nthe bill, and I was not present. If I had been present, I certainly \nwould have fought at that time what they did in the language of it. \nWhat we are trying to do is make sure the communities would have the \noption of using that money to defer some of their cost of special \neducation, and then have other funds freed up to provide the kinds of \nchanges or money expenditures they need.\n  The amendment proposed by Senator Lott yesterday offers what I have \nbeen talking about. I believe it would be a good middle ground between \nthose of us who are urging that we live up to our promises with respect \nto IDEA funding, and those who think we should undertake a massive new \neffort to hire teachers for local schools. The Lott amendment \nessentially permits local school officials to decide whether they need \nmore money to educate children with disabilities, or whether they need \nto hire additional teachers. From what I am hearing from Vermont \nteachers, IDEA funding is the first, second, and third issue raised \nwith me about education when I visit the State.\n\n  We are fortunate in Vermont to have already achieved the small class \nsizes the President is trying to promote with his teacher hiring \nprogram. Reducing class size further is not a priority at this time. \nMeeting the needs of children with disabilities is. This is what is \nhampering our local schools from doing the things they need to do. We \nwould like very much to see the flexibility include such things--which \nare a priority--as the ability of our teachers to be given additional \ntraining so they can perform better in the classroom.\n  I realize that some localities in other areas may hold a different \nview. They could use their portion of $1.2 billion to hire teachers. \nThe point is that it should be their choice, not ours. In listening to \nthe debate over the past several days, one might get the impression \nthat hiring more teachers is the silver bullet. Clearly, that is not \nthe case. What is missing in the discussion is the quality of the \nteacher in the classroom. I think it is common sense that the most \nimportant aspect of teaching is to have a teacher that is a good \nteacher. The classroom size can go down to 10, but if the teacher is a \nlousy teacher, you are not going to have much quality education. On the \nother hand, if you have a qualified teacher, whether the class size is \n18 or 20 or 23, you will have quality education. The size is not going \nto make much difference. When I was growing up, our average class size \nwas about 30, and I had good teachers. The biggest problem is making \nsure that we have professionally qualified teachers.\n  In the last Congress, during the process of the reauthorization of \nthe Higher Education Act, there was a great deal of concern about the \nquality of our teachers and the effectiveness of the various programs \nthat existed to address these concerns. We thought that the programs \nthat had never been utilized, or were not effective, could be changed \nto take care of what is the primary need of the Nation. This need is \nthe need for fully qualified teachers--not only qualified in teaching, \nbut in knowing what the standards are that have to be met. They must \nknow how we can move kids into a situation where they have the math \nstandards essential to perform in the international markets, and where \nthe young people graduate from high school ready for jobs that pay $10, \n$15 an hour. We don't have that kind of thing in most areas of the \ncountry.\n  In hearings on that subject, I believe every member of our committee \nexpressed grave concerns that the quality of teaching was not at the \nlevels to ensure that our students meet educational goals. As part of \nthe higher education bill, we included an entire title devoted to \nteacher quality. And because we were dealing with higher education, we \nfocused largely on the training of future teachers. I believe we \ndeveloped a very positive and comprehensive approach for dealing with \nthat issue.\n  Another issue along those lines that we have to look at, is what we \ncan do in the higher education areas to make sure the colleges and the \nuniversities that have teacher colleges understand the changes that are \nnecessary to ensure that when they graduate people from the education \ndepartments, they are qualified teachers.\n  I have examined many, many of the programs for teacher scholarships \nthat are in existence and have found that they are missing a lot of \nimportant information for young people who are graduating. These \ngraduates will be our teachers for the next century, and they really \ndon't have the kind of education they should have to graduate and be a \ngood teacher, a professional teacher, one who is qualified to go into \nthe classroom. We have a lot to do in that regard. The money would be \nmuch better spent there, than it would be spent on classroom size. The \nplace to do that, however, is in the context of the elementary and \nsecondary education authorization, not piecemeal as we are doing now on \nthe Senate floor.\n  Until we get a better handle on the teacher quality issue, we are \nmaking a big mistake by sending local officials out to look for more \nteachers. Where are they going to come from? Are they\n\n[[Page S2471]]\n\ngoing to be good teachers? And, are they going to have a classroom? If \nyou have 100,000 new teachers, where are they going to teach? That is a \nquestion that has not been answered. If you suddenly reduce the class \nsizes, you have to have someplace to put the students who are pushed \nout of the existing classrooms. You have to have classrooms to put them \nin.\n  On Monday, it was suggested that the first question a parent asks of \nhis or her child is, Who was in your class? I would suggest that the \nfirst question is, Who is teaching your class? If a locality has a \nplentiful supply of unemployed quality teachers and lacks only the \nfunds to hire them, that locality will find the Class Size Reduction \nProgram to be beneficial. If that is not the case, those funds will be \nput to much better use by supporting existing efforts to educate \nspecial education students.\n  If, in the context of the ESEA reauthorization, we determine that \nhelping to hire teachers is an important component of the overall \napproach to supporting teaching, then we can do that. I hope, if we do \nthat, that we proceed in a thoughtful way to work through the real \nneeds of schools and students. The 100,000 teacher program does not now \nadequately address the differences in needs of local schools around the \ncountry. Some schools may need more professionals while others need \nmore professional development. I would say it is much more of the \nlatter than the former.\n  In the meantime, let's take Senator Lott's suggestion to allow \nschools to choose how they spend these funds made available for fiscal \nyear 1999, the $1.2 billion. It is not too late to make this option \navailable. Guidance on teacher hiring programs has been available for \nless than a week, and funds will not be provided until July.\n  Mr. President, let me again go over the basic problem we have here.\n  First, we had a wonderful bipartisan relationship last year. It \nreally makes me sad to think that has broken down on the first \neducation bill we have taken up this year. Last year we passed 10 good, \nsound, education bills out of my committee. They are now in operation, \nand we are looking toward improvement, even though we still have the \nappropriations fight to go through this year. But, we worked in a way, \nlast year, that benefited all of us. We shared our ideas and worked \nthem out in the committee.\n  This year, this Ed-Flex bill was voted out of committee 10-to-1. The \nDemocrats chose not to be present when it was voted out, and that is \nfine, because there didn't seem to be any conflict in it. It was \nbasically the same bill we had voted out of committee 17 to 1 last \nyear. So I thought, fine, that is all right; they have other things to \ndo.\n  But now this has turned into what is basically, I think, a political \ndemonstration project to get political advantage by proposing various \namendments to this bill. These amendments should be taken care of not \non the Senate floor right now, but through the normal committee \nprocess, during the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, which we are already in the process of holding hearings \non. We must examine each one of the programs that have been addressed. \nThey should not be placed on this Ed-Flex bill and bypass the committee \nprocess.\n\n  Certainly we have to worry about the issue after school programs. \nThat is an incredibly important issue. The proposal in the amendment of \nthe Senator from California, is a program that I put into the 1994 \nreauthorization of ESEA. Perhaps the program needs to be modified--\nalthough it is a pretty good program right now--to take care of the \nchanging demands upon our educational system. However, that should be \ndone during the reauthorization of ESEA, and there shouldn't be much \ncontroversy over it. The President has already endorsed it and has \nadded funds to it, making it a substantially better program as far as \nfunding goes. And through the reauthorization of ESEA, we will just \nimprove it to make sure it is better as far as handling our young \npeople. The others are also all worth taking a look at.\n  I certainly agree that we have to end ``social promotion.'' That is a \nterm that has just recently come into use. Let me explain a little bit \nabout where that term came from.\n  Literacy studies have shown that 51 percent of the young people we \ngraduate from our high schools are functionally illiterate. That is a \ndisaster. You ask any businessman. A potential employee says, ``Why \ndon't you want to look at my diploma?'' The businessman says, ``It \ndoesn't mean anything. I don't even know if you can do ordinary math or \nreading.'' So that is the social promotion that we have to end. We have \nto make sure that every child who graduates from high school meets \ncertain standards or they don't get a diploma. That makes common sense.\n  There are other amendments being offered which also ought to be \nconsidered, but they ought to be considered in the normal committee \nprocess, not just for purposes of politics, or whatever else.\n  I am, though, encouraged to learn from the leadership that we have, \napparently come to an agreement, which will be expressed in the not-\ntoo-distant future. This will give us the opportunity to get on with \nthe educational situation by passing the basic bill, the Ed-Flex bill. \nAnd we may agree on some amendments to be offered, and we will vote on \nthose.\n  So I am hopeful that before the afternoon is finished we will have \nthe opportunity to move forward on this bill, and then get back to \ndiscussing education in the committee room, within the context of the \nESEA reauthorization, where we should be, instead of on the Senate \nfloor.\n  Mr. President, I am now going to read a message from the leader, if \nthat is all right.\n  For the information of all Senators, negotiations are ongoing, and we \nare very close to an agreement with respect to the overall Education-\nFlexibility bill. Having said that, the agreement would be vitiated on \nthe scheduled cloture vote. But that agreement has not been fully \ncleared by all interested parties. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent, \non behalf of the leader, that the pending vote scheduled to occur at 1 \np.m. be postponed until 1:30 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I then will continue to go forward and \nhope that maybe we are coming to an end. It s not that I don't like \nbeing on the Senate floor continuously day after day, starting in the \nmorning and ending at night, but there are other things on my own \nschedule that sometimes suffer. Hopefully, we can reach agreement. \nAgain, the status of our educational system is what we are talking \nabout here generally. Hopefully, with this agreement, we will get back \nto an orderly process to examine the needs of this Nation.\n  Let me reflect again, as I have before, upon the status of education \nin this country and why we are concerned about it.\n  Back in 1983, under the Reagan administration, Secretary Bell at that \ntime did an examination of our educational system and compared it with \nour international competitors. He took a look at where we stood with \nrespect to our young people graduating from high school, and also those \ngraduating from skilled training schools, and determined that we were \nway, way behind our international competitors--the Asian and European \ncommunities. In fact, the commission that was set up to do the \nexamination was so disturbed that they issued this proclamation. To \nparaphrase, they said, if a foreign nation had imposed upon us the \neducational system that we had at that time we would have declared it \nan act of war. Well, we still have that education system. You would \nthink that a tremendous change would have occurred, but it hasn't.\n  I am on the goals panel, and we meet once a year to determine whether \nor not our schools have improved.\n  Most recently, we took a look at the situation last year to see what \nhad happened to improve our educational prowess and standards relative \nto the rest of the world. What we determined was there has been no \nmeasurable improvement since 1983. That was 15 years ago. We have not \nimproved. That cannot continue, and that is why we are here today and \nwill be working on this as we move forward.\n  As shocking as that revelation was, we found that the only data we \nhad to measure whether there had been improvement was 1994 data. We do \nnot\n\n[[Page S2472]]\n\neven have a system which will provide us with current data to show us \nwhether we have any improvement or not. That is a terrible situation. \nWe cannot even measure our performance to determine whether or not we \nhave had any improvement.\n  Hopefully, as we move forward, that situation will be taken care of \nin the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. A primary focus of what \nI will be doing this year, in order to address the situation, is to \nthoroughly review the Department of Education. Mr. President, $15 \nbillion is spent on elementary and secondary education, and it seems to \nme that one of the primary focuses of the Department of Education \nshould be to find out whether we are improving. Does this program or \nthat program work or not? Are the young people are influenced by this \nor not? Yet, with $15 billion, we have not been able to determine \nwhether or not anything is happening.\n  We have important changes to make in the Department of Education. We \nhave to take a look at where our priorities are and take a look at \nwhere the $260 million is spent on research. I am frustrated as \nchairman of the committee to think at this point in time that we are \nspending all this money and we do not know whether the programs we have \nbeen using work or not. If we can't find out with $260 million whether \nour educational system is improving, we better take a good look at our \nresearch programs. That is one thing we will be looking at on the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  It is certainly going to be an interesting year, and I am hopeful \nthat in the next 25 minutes we will find that there has been an \nagreement that will allow us to go forward in an orderly process.\n  Now, back to our educational system and the problems we have with it. \nTo refresh the memories of Members as to what this means to our future, \nwe have had terrible problems with finding young people with the skills \nnecessary for this Nation to compete in the world.\n  In fact, we are so short that we have somewhere around 500,000 jobs \nout there available that are not being filled. Actually, that is down \nsomewhat, I should say. We made a significantly downward push. But why? \nHow? By changing the immigration laws to bring in more people from \nforeign nations who have the skills to come in and help our businesses \ncompete.\n  That is not the way it should be happening. We should not be looking \ntoward amending immigration laws to supply our businesses with the \nskilled workers they need to meet the demands of the present-day jobs. \nThis is another area that is of deep concern to me.\n  Several years ago, we set up a skills panel to establish standards to \nmeasure whether we were meeting the goals of our industry. I do not \nknow how long ago that was, but it has been many years. We have yet to \nestablish even one standard. Obviously, we have a long way to go if we \nare going to meet the needs of our businesses.\n  The first thing we have to do--and I know the President endorses this \nalso--is make sure that every student who graduates from high school is \nfunctionally literate and not functionally illiterate, as the studies \nshow, and that is a big charge.\n  We do have some things that are good news, though. Although, \nunfortunately, there is usually bad news connected with that good news. \nThe good news is, we have all sorts of technology which has been \ndeveloped over the years with various programs. The bad news is that \nthese programs started to become available in the midseventies, and we \nare not yet in a position to determine how they could be better \nutilized in our school systems.\n\n  You can also utilize software in your home computer where you can \nlearn simple elementary math, algebra, and calculus by yourself if you \nwant to. All of these things have been available for over 20 years, but \nthey are not readily available, nor are they in any way coordinated in \ntheir use in our school systems.\n  My own kids have caught up on matters by having it available to them \nindividually. However, there is no coordination nor evaluation \nconnected to the utilization of that technology in assisting young \npeople who are having a difficult time or want to go ahead of their \nclass in understanding calculus or other high standards of math, there \nis no coordination nor evaluation.\n  I was at a conference recently in Florida where the technology people \ncame in, and I was able to talk with them. There are wonderful programs \nout there, but there is no evaluation system, not even in the industry \nitself, to determine what works and what does not work. We have all of \nthese wonderful programs--AT has a good one and many companies do--\nand they are available, but there is no assessment of them. There is no \nevaluation of whether, one, an individual benefits from it; or, two, \nwhether it can be used on a broad basis or how to fit it into the \nclassroom to make sure the young people will be able to take advantage \nof this technology.\n  That is another thing we have to look at with the ESEA \nreauthorization: First, how can we set up a situation where we can \nevaluate these programs? And second, how can we make sure that, in the \nafterschool area, we have programs available that will allow our young \npeople to catch up and move ahead?\n  I see the sponsor of the bill is present on the Senate floor. I \ncongratulate him for the introduction of this bill and the hard work he \nhas put into it. He has helped move it forward. I am sure he shares \nwith me the glimmer of hope which will burst forth with a resolution to \nthis problem.\n  I yield to the Senator from Tennessee such time as he may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, first, I commend the manager of the bill \nfor an outstanding job. It has been now several days that we have been \non a bill that to me is a very exciting bill, because we know, based on \nhow it has been used in 12 States, that it is an effective bill, a bill \nthat works, a bill that helps our children learn, a bill that unties \nthe hands of our teachers and our school boards and our local schools.\n  It is a bill that costs not one single cent. How many bills go \nthrough here that really don't cost the taxpayer anything? Yet, the \nmoney we spend today is spent more efficiently, more effectively, with \nmore local input, with the education of our children being the goal and \ndemonstrated results which, if I have time, I will review some of those \nresults that we know today.\n  Let me, as background, refer to a chart that is so confusing. I do \nnot want my colleagues in the room to even try to look at the details \nof this chart, but let me tell you what the chart is. Basically, I \nasked the General Accounting Office, which is an objective body that \ncomes in and helps us evaluate existing programs, how well are we doing \nin terms of spending education dollars and resources today and how is \nit organized.\n  I have a 15-year-old, a 13-year-old and an 11-year-old. If you take a \nchild, a 13-year-old, we know the objective is to educate them, prepare \nthem for a job, to have a fulfilling life, to prepare them for the next \nmillennium. What are the programs we are putting forth since we are \nfailing them--and let me make that point clear, we are failing our \nchildren today, when we compare ourselves to countries all over the \nworld. We are failing them. What are we doing? We have to do better.\n  If we take what we are doing today for, say, young children, look \naround the outside, the outside. The target here says ``young \nchildren.'' This says ``at-risk and delinquent youth.'' This says \n``teachers.''\n\n  For young children, how many programs do we have focusing on young \nchildren today? And the answer is: Department of Justice has two \nprograms, the Department of Labor has seven programs; ACTION has one \nprogram; the State Justice Institute, a program; the Corporation for \nNational Community Service, six; the General Services Administration \nhas a program; the Department of Agriculture, coming all the way down, \nhas six programs. Again, the point of this--whether you are looking at \nat-risk and delinquent youth or teachers or young children--is that we \nhave numerous programs, overlapping programs that are really all well \nintentioned, many of which start in this body as another good program \njust like many of the nongermane amendments to my underlying Ed-Flex \nbill. What is happening is we have another few blocks, another few \nprograms\n\n[[Page S2473]]\n\nto add to this chart, and that is really not what we need today. What \nwe need today is to have better organization, at least initially, and \nthen have the debate about where resources should come in, how these \nresources should be spent; how we can coordinate, not duplicate, not \nhave overlap.\n  I say that because my simple bill is a bill that basically says let's \ngive our local schools and schoolteachers and school districts a little \nmore flexibility to innovate, to be creative, to take into account what \nthey know are the needs of their school. It might be one-on-one \nteaching. It might be smaller class size, though let me just say I was \non the phone this morning with three Governors: ``Class size is good, \nbut the ratio in my State already is 18 to 1,'' said one of the \nGovernors. Another said, ``The class size in my State is 19 to 1 right \nnow. We have already solved the class size problem. Our real challenge \nis to have one-on-one tutoring for grades 1, 2 and 3 so they can at \nleast learn how to read early on. Give us that flexibility to meet the \nsame stated goals; that is, educating maybe a group of economically \ndisadvantaged children--educating them but taking into consideration \nwhat my teachers say, what my parents say, what my principals say, what \nmy school district says, and don't you, up in Washington, tell me how \nto use those resources because that is not what I need.''\n  The point is, you can use them for what you want as long as you meet \nthe stated goal in statute, what we have set out to use that money for.\n  Real quickly, what do we have today? I am from Tennessee. Tennessee \nis not in yellow on this map. The States that are in yellow are those \nStates that have Ed-Flex today, a demonstration program started in 1994 \nwith 6 States, 2 years later another 6 States added so we have 12 \nStates. We have data from these States. I will cite some of the data \nfrom Texas because they have had longstanding experience with it with \nvery good data. I will show you some of that data. But the Senator from \nMassachusetts, who is on the floor, feels very passionately about \nadding more programs--and that debate has to take place and should take \nplace, but just not on this bill. It is currently taking place in the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee as we speak. There are \nhearings ongoing, looking into all elementary and secondary education \nwhere we are looking at all of the resources. We are looking at that \noverlap that is there. We are looking at objectives and goals. All that \nis ongoing.\n  What we are saying is, yes, all of these amendments are important to \nlook at, but let's concentrate on this single Ed-Flex bill, get it to \nthe American people, to their benefit, today. My Ed-Flex bill simply \ntakes what is existing in these 12 States and expands it to all 50 \nStates, paying that respect to that local school, that local school \ndistrict, those parents and those teachers.\n  The Democratic Governors' Association--it has to be confusing to the \nAmerican people because we have a bill that is supported by every \nGovernor in the United States of America. It is supported by the \npopulation at large, hugely supported by the population. There are \nDemocratic cosponsors in this very body. It is a bipartisan bill. Ron \nWyden of Oregon is my cosponsor and we are out front fighting for this \nbill in a clean state, yet we have this filibuster that is going on, \nwhere we have cloture votes, procedural votes that say we are going to \nstop this bill. I am offended for that in part because of my children, \nand in part because I feel I am responsible to the American people to \nmake sure the younger generation is educated well compared to school \ndistricts in a State or compared to around the country or compared \nglobally, where we are failing today. That is our obligation.\n  It has to be confusing because we have this body filibustering a bill \nthat has broad support, that the President of the United States just a \nyear ago recommended. A week ago he said pass that bill. Secretary \nRiley of the Department of Education says it is right on target, it is \na superb bill--he has endorsed that bill. That is what is difficult and \nmust be confusing.\n  Let me show you what the Democratic Governors' Association said in a \nletter to us on February 22:\n\n       Democratic Governors strongly support this effort to vest \n     state officials with more control over the coordination of \n     Federal and state regulatory and statutory authority in \n     exchange for requiring more local school accountability.\n\n  I think that is an important point because you have the issue of \nflexibility, of innovation, of creativity. But we have to have tough \naccountability built in. Why? Because when you give anybody flexibility \nand give them a little more leeway to meet those stated goals, you want \nto make sure that they are held accountable for meeting those goals and \nif they are not, taking that flexibility away. That accountability is \nbuilt in very strongly.\n  The Democratic Governors--and remember that is where the filibuster \nis coming from, it is on the Democratic side--but the Democratic \nGovernors tell us ``Most important, S. 280''--and that is this bill, \nthe Ed-Flex bill, the bill we are debating today--``maintains careful \nbalance needed between flexibility and accountability.''\n  That balance was carefully crafted. I think that is why the bill has \nso much support; 17 to 1 out of the committee. It is rare for a bill to \ncome out of a committee discussion, again, bipartisan, 17 to 1 this \npast year.\n\n       S. 280 is common-sense legislation that we believe deserves \n     immediate consideration. We hope, therefore, that you will \n     join in supporting its prompt enactment.\n\n  I guess this prompt enactment is what we are trying to achieve, what \nwe are working to achieve. Right now we have not been successful in \nworking toward that prompt enactment. As I said earlier, I believe the \nHouse will pass this bill today. And, again, if we can pass this bill \nsometime this week we can have it on the desk of the President to the \nbenefit of all Americans and not just people in those 12 States.\n  The National Governors' Association--again, I spent a lot of time \nwith the Governors. People say, Why, as a Federal official, are you \nworking with the Governors? The answer is straightforward: Because the \nGovernors traditionally have been the people responsible for looking at \neducation and education programs. Right now, in terms of overall money, \nabout 7 or 8 percent of the education dollars spent across the State of \nTennessee come from the Federal Government, and it is the Governors \nthat typically oversee education and have a long experience with it.\n  Just very quickly, on what the Governors have said--I won't go \nthrough this. This is a letter of endorsement: ``Expansion of the Ed-\nFlex demonstration program to all qualified states and territories.'' \nJust one sentence:\n\n       Ed-Flex has helped states focus on improving student \n     performance by more closely aligning state and Federal \n     education improvement programs and by supporting state \n     efforts to design and implement standards-based reform.\n\n  I think that is the overall point. We are all working together, both \nsides are working together in a bipartisan way to improve education. It \nis bicameral--the House and the Senate have bills that are moving \nforward. It is State and it is Federal and local all working together \nfor this particular bill.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate the Senator yielding. It has been a great \npleasure for me to have a chance to work with him, on a bipartisan \nbasis, for this legislation, and I feel it will be very helpful if he \ncan just take a minute and outline the breadth of support for this \nlegislation. Because, certainly, when we began this discussion, I don't \nthink most Americans could have told you anything about Ed-Flex. We \njoked most people would think this was the instructor at the Y, the new \naerobics instructor.\n  But the fact is that just a few miles from this Senate Chamber, a \nschool is using Ed-Flex and the existing dollars to cut class size in \nhalf. That is going on today using existing dollars. Not spending one \npenny more of Federal funds, we are seeing a school close to the United \nStates Capitol cut class size in half.\n  If you listened to this debate--and I happen to be for the hiring of \nthe additional teachers--you would get the impression that the only way \nyou could cut class size in America was to spend more Federal money.\n  I happen to think we do need to spend some additional dollars, which \nis why I support the Kennedy and the Murray amendments. I also share \nthe\n\n[[Page S2474]]\n\nview of the Senator from Tennessee that we can cut class size now, \nusing existing dollars.\n  I think it would be very helpful, given the fact that we are so close \nnow to the agreement--I really commend the minority leader, Senator \nDaschle, and the majority leader, Senator Lott, because they have \ngotten us right to the brink of having an agreement so we can go \nforward with this legislation--if my friend and colleague could just \noutline for the Senate the breadth of support for this legislation. I \nappreciate him yielding to me for this time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield, we have a \nhalf-hour debate on this from 1 to 1:30. We have now used up 20 \nminutes. I want to make some brief comments. Obviously, I want the \nSenator to conclude. We did not divide that time officially, but I hope \nat least we will have some part of that half hour to make our points, \ntoo.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, if I could just finish in 1 minute, 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is very generous, if we get 5 or 6 minutes \nat the end, that would be fine.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me make it clear, when I came to the \nfloor there was nobody from the other side here, so that is one of the \nreasons I wanted to go ahead and use this opportunity to lay out where \nwe are today.\n  Let me take one more minute or so, because this accountability/\nflexibility is very important. The broad support that my colleague and, \nreally, cosponsor of the bill, Senator Wyden, has referred to is this \nbroad support that we feel when we go back to our town meetings and we \ntalk to people. The broad support starts at the level of those parents, \npeople in the schools, the teachers, the educational establishment, who \nhave said--and I have shown this on the board--this is a step in the \nright direction, up through the Governors and their strong bipartisan \nsupport. The difference in how we get there is, I think, where the \ndebate is. That is what I am hopeful we can reach, working together \nwith some sort of agreement.\n  I again want to thank my colleague, Senator Wyden, because this bill \ncame out of us working together in a task force, listening to the \nAmerican people as we go forward.\n  Let me just close and basically show again, without going into the \ndetails, that we have some demonstrated results from Ed-Flex and how \nbeneficial it can be. That is why we feel so passionately about getting \nthis bill through.\n  This is from Texas statewide results. The categories: African \nAmerican students did twice as well when they were in an Ed-Flex \nprogram. Hispanic students in Texas did twice as well in an Ed-Flex \nprogram. The economically disadvantaged students improved 7 percent \nversus 16 percent, again, in an Ed-Flex program.\n  This essence of accountability and flexibility is part of this bill. \nI plead with my colleagues to pull back this inordinate number, \nexcessive number, of nongermane amendments so we can pass this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Senator KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are in the process of trying to work \nthrough some kind of arrangement where we can address a reasonable \nnumber of amendments, on both sides. I do not want to characterize how \nclose we are to it, but we are moving towards a vote at 1:30. It is \nreally a question of whether the leadership and the other Members are \ninclined to do so.\n  On the one hand, I find it quite objectionable to have to get into a \nsituation where those in the minority are going to have to go hat in \nhand to the majority and say: Look, we are going to be limited to these \nnumber of amendments in order to get our amendments considered. The \nrules of the Senate permit us to offer amendments until there is a \ndetermination by 60 Members of this body to terminate or close off \ndebate. Then there is also an opportunity for follow-on amendments, if \nthey are germane.\n  We are in a situation, nonetheless, where there are some negotiations \nbeing worked out and being addressed. We are inviting Members on both \nsides to give their reactions on it. It is a process which is done here \nin this body, and we will see what the outcome is.\n  Barring that, we will be moving towards the vote on cloture on the \nMurray amendment, which we have talked about during these past days. It \nis a very simple amendment. It is a continued authorization for the \nnext 6 years on class size for the earliest grades, K through 3. We \nhad, as I mentioned earlier in the day, made an agreement which had \nbroad bipartisan support. I read into the Record the very strong \nsupport for that measure when we worked it out just a few months ago, \nwhen the Republican majority leader, Dick Armey, said:\n\n       We were very pleased to receive the President's request for \n     more teachers, especially since he offered to provide a way \n     to pay for them. . . . We were very excited to move forward \n     on that.\n\n  This is the Republican majority leader in the House of \nRepresentatives. We also have included statements where the Republican \nchairman of the House committee, Mr. Goodling, stated similar kinds of \nexpressions of favorable consideration.\n  Now we are faced without the opportunity to consider this amendment. \nThat is basically unacceptable, Mr. President--particularly when \ncommunities across this country have to submit their budgets, which \nincludes the hiring of teachers for this coming September, in only a \nfew weeks. If schools want to take advantage of this year's teachers \nand the follow-on teachers, they have to be able to make a judgment. \nSchools, communities and school boards are all inquiring about this \nfunding--the school boards in particular. They are in such strong \nsupport of this funding--the school board associations, the parents \nassociations, the principals associations, the teachers associations. \nThey want a degree of certainty--what rules do they have to play by. \nThat is why this legislation is so important.\n  The GAO report states that when they asked local directors and \nprincipals and superintendents of schools what were the three things \nthat they wanted most, they said: First, additional funding--no \nsurprise. Secondly, they said, tell us about additional programs that \ncan benefit the children. Thirdly, we want information on how to run \nthe school. That is in the GAO report, not, ``No. 1, we just want the \nEd-Flex.''\n  We are for Ed-Flex. I want to see accountability, and we have made \nsome progress. The House is dealing with that issue this afternoon--\nthey took some language and, I think, made some important progress in \nterms of accountability. The fact is, Mr. President, that the No. 1 \nissue on school boards all across this country is plain and simple: Are \nwe going to move ahead and give the kind of continued authorization for \nthis legislation so we can get smaller class size for the next 3 years, \nor aren't we?\n  At 1:30, we have the chance to vote on that issue here in the U.S. \nSenate. We can vote in favor of cloture, which effectively ties that \nparticular provision into the legislation--it can still be modified, if \nthe amendments are germane. Then we take the next step to go to the \nconference. That is what is really before us and why this vote is of \nparticular importance and significance.\n  I see 1:30 has arrived--my friend and colleague from Tennessee is on \nhis feet. We will either vote, which I am glad to do, or accede to the \nmajority leader, if he has a request.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. We are close. Mr. President, we are very, very close. That \nmakes me feel good, if we can come to an agreement. But in light of \nthose negotiations, with respect to the Ed-Flex bill, and the fact that \nwe are as close as we are, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nvote scheduled to occur at 1:30 be postponed until 2 p.m. today.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to, \ncould we have the time divided to both sides?\n  Mr. FRIST. And the time divided as part of the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see other Senators. We had several who wanted to \nspeak.\n  Mr. FRIST. I will defer.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If you want to proceed first, I will check with my \ncolleagues.\n\n[[Page S2475]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield such time as is necessary to my colleague from \nKansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senator Frist and Senator Jeffords, and \nothers, for the important work they have done on this piece of \nlegislation. I think this is a marvelous piece of legislation.\n  In my time in the Senate, which has not been long, I cannot recall \nseeing a piece of legislation that has been supported by all 50 \nGovernors. All 50 of them are supporting Ed-Flex. It seems like, to me, \nit is one of those provisions in bills that comes forward where people \nsay, ``This is the right time, right place, right idea. Let's do it.''\n  It is time we should move forward with this bill. It passed in \ncommittee 10-0. It passed last year out of committee 17-1. This ought \nto be something on which we could agree.\n  I would just like to make a couple of points. My State is an Ed-Flex \nState. Kansas is an Ed-Flex State. We have had a number of school \ndistricts that have asked for and received the authority and the \nflexibility. This started down the same path that welfare reform did \nearly on, when you finally had some States saying, ``Look, the \nsituation has gotten bad enough. You have so many Federal strings and \nredtape on it that we can do a better job here if you'll just give us a \nlittle breathing room. Just let us have a little bit of help here, not \ntelling us what to do and letting us decide.''\n  That is what started welfare reform; you had some States starting to \ndo that and asking for little provisions: ``Let us take this into our \nown hands and we'll do a better job.'' And you know what? They did do a \nbetter job. They did do a better job, and they were the laboratory of \nthe experimentation of democracy in saying, ``Well, let's try it \ndifferent here; different there.''\n  And what has ended up taking place? We have in my State welfare \nreform today where you have had a reduction in welfare recipients of 50 \npercent over the past 4 years--a 50-percent decline. And the people off \nwelfare are saying, ``Thank goodness I'm working,'' and ``I feel better \nabout myself.'' And I feel better about this program. This has worked. \nWe are seeking to replicate that in education by saying, ``Let the \nflowers bloom in the States across the Nation.''\n  The principle behind Ed-Flex is simple. You have heard about it. It \nallows local schools to implement creative programs that are custom \ntailored to the needs of their kids, enables State education agencies \nto waive State requirements, along with Federal mandates, so that local \nschools can innovate effectively.\n  Listen to what we are doing in Kansas about these Ed-Flex programs \nthat we have in our State. We have had several States where we have had \na number of waiver requests. I think we have 43 waivers in my State \nthat have been requested.\n  One school district received a waiver in order to more better \ndistribute title I funds to the neediest students. Leavenworth schools \nrequested a waiver to provide an all-day kindergarten class and \npreschool programs to better serve the special needs of the children of \nour soldiers who are serving at Fort Leavenworth. Emporia used an Ed-\nFlex waiver to implement new literacy programs and an intensive summer \nschool program.\n  Do those sound like good innovative ideas that are particular for a \nlocal school district meeting its needs? It certainly does. And that is \nwhat Ed-Flex is about; and that is what it is providing in my State.\n  Take that and replicate that across the Nation to the 46 million \nschoolchildren in 87,000 public schools across this country. And does \nanyone really think--does anyone really think--that a one-size-fits-all \napproach would work with such incredible diverse needs, circumstances, \nsituations across the country? Communities need the flexibility to \naddress their unique needs, and given that opportunity they will \neducate the children better. They will do a better job than the one-\nsize-fits-all mandates out of Washington.\n\n  I am surprised and dismayed that some people are filibustering this \nbill and saying: Well, we're not going to let it move forward on such a \ntried and true concept that is being tried and worked in so many \nStates, that is supported by all 50 Governors, that provides for \nlocalized decision making on such an important decision as to how do we \neducate our children?\n  We have examples in this thing that should be working, and we should \nallow this to take place. Unfortunately, some people are trying to kill \nthis bill with amendments that, of all things, actually add--actually \nadd--Federal mandates--which the whole point of the bill is to reduce \nFederal mandates, and a number of people are trying to add Federal \nmandates.\n  Think about that. When the purpose of this is to allow schools \nflexibility in how they run their programs and spend their money, most \nof these amendments do exactly the opposite. They mandate that the \nschools spend a certain amount of money in a certain way no matter what \ntheir situation or their need. It just does not make sense.\n  What is even stranger is that these amendments would require \nadditional Federal spending on new mandates while ignoring the \ncommitments we already made to children with special needs through \nprograms like the IDEA. The way I see it, we should fulfill the \npromises we have made to disabled children before we create new \nentitlement.\n  There are many reasons why we need Ed-Flex. I think it can create \nthat innovative environment that can let our schools be as good as our \nchildren. Currently, our system is failing our children. What we need \nto do is get these obstructions of Federal regulations out of the way. \nWe need to stop holding up the passage of these worthy initiatives and \nstart doing the right thing by the American people and by our children.\n  Let this bill move. Let it move forward so that we can give that \ninnovative atmosphere, and we can have a system worthy of the children \nof America.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just to review 7% of the Federal budget \ngoes to educational programs--the role of the Federal Government is \nexceedingly limited.\n  So let's think for a moment what this is all about. This is a rifle \nshot program, Title I primarily. You have the Eisenhower Program, which \nis the teaching of math and science and the technology. Those together \nare maybe, $700 million nationwide, but that is a targeted program to \nthe neediest children.\n  Now, 90 percent of the waivers today go out of the formula providing \nthe targeted help and assistance to the neediest children. That is why \nthere is some caution about what is being included in the Ed-Flex. \nThere have been attempts by my colleagues--Senator Wellstone and \nSenator Reid--and myself to make sure that we are going to get \nflexibility at the local community level to serve the neediest \nchildren, but not to do what we did 25 years ago and build swimming \npools and buy football equipment--because the local people know best \nabout how to spend the money. That is what happened 25 years ago, Mr. \nPresident. Many of us are not prepared to say we are going to recognize \nthat as a matter of national policy.\n  The most underserved children in this country need to be a part of \nour whole process in the education system. And they need additional \nkinds of help and assistance in terms of math, reading and other \nprograms. We are going to have a limited amount of resources spread \nnationwide--2 to 3 cents out of every dollar locally--but it is going \nto go to the neediest children.\n  It is important to understand what the debate is about. We want some \nflexibility in that local community if they are going to use these \nresources and use it more creatively to help and assist those children. \nThat is where Ed-Flex makes some difference. But if you look where the \nwaivers have been, they have not been, with all respect to my colleague \nfrom Oregon, creating smaller class size. That is not where the GAO \nreport has been.\n  It is moving past the formula from 50 percent to 43 percent. Under \ncertain circumstances they have received the funds before and want to \ntry and still carry forth the substance of the legislation because it \nis getting the most of\n\n[[Page S2476]]\n\nit, in terms of the neediest children for schoolwide programs.\n  With all respect, that is what this debate is about. It is not a big \nsack of dough we are sending out there. The local community needs the \nadditional resources and they can raise it or the States can. This is \nwhere the Targeted Resources Program developed some 35 years ago.\n  I might say that the most important analysis of the effectiveness of \nthis program has been in the last 2 weeks where we have the report on \nTitle I which shows that there is measurable student improvement and \nadvancement, with a series of recommendations. Part of the \nrecommendations are what? The smaller class size, afterschool programs.\n  We come back to a situation where we are being denied that \nopportunity to vote. We welcome the chance to see this move ahead. As I \nhave mentioned and pointed out in a lead editorial today--we want a \nsituation like we have in Texas where they have a described measurable \ngoal; they measured the results of their investment against those \ngoals, and they made progress on it. That is a very substantial and \nsignificant kind of improvement over what we are talking about here \ntoday. I kind of wonder why we are not going that way--I would like to \nsee us go that way. However, that issue has been defeated in an earlier \nWellstone amendment. We think there is still enough justification to \nprovide support for this proposal.\n  Let's not confuse this legislation, Ed-Flex, with doing something \nabout smaller class size. We are talking about $11.4 billion--$11.4 \nbillion additional dollars--in local communities for smaller class \nsize. There is not a nickel in this bill for smaller class size, not a \nnickel. So if we are concerned about smaller class size, the effort \nthat we ought to be making here today should be in support of the \nMurray amendment. That is the one Senator Murray has advanced to the \nSenate, spoken to the Senate, pleaded with the Senate. She has been our \nleader on this issue. Hopefully, we can make some progress on this \nissue.\n  I know time is moving along. I want to certainly cooperate with the \nleaders, but at some time we will have to have some evaluation.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Massachusetts, I heard our friend \nfrom Kansas saying we were trying to kill the Ed-Flex bill. Would you \nhave a comment on the statement that we are trying to kill the Ed-Flex \nbill?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Senator, I support this legislation, as the author of \nthe initial Ed-Flex legislation with Senator Hatfield, who deserves the \nmajor credit on this concept, when he came and spoke to the members of \nthe Education Committee and we took that on Title I and also on the \nGoals 2000.\n  But we also want to deal with smaller class size, and the Republican \nleader, Dick Armey, said only five months ago, ``We are very pleased to \nreceive the President's request for more teachers, especially since he \noffered to provide a way for them. We are very excited to go forward \nwith that.'' And Chairman Goodling made similar statements.\n  We are now put in this situation where we are told that we cannot \nconsider that, we have to just go ahead with Ed-Flex--we can't consider \nwhat the Republicans agreed to in a bipartisan way. I have listened to \nthose who say let's put partisanship aside. We would like to put \npartisanship aside--we would like to follow on with what Dick Armey and \nChairman Goodling said. They supported this proposal.\n\n  It was bipartisan in October. Why was it bipartisan in October and it \nis now partisan in March?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Is it also true that one of the movers of the underlying \nbill has been the Senator from Oregon, Senator Wyden? Hasn't he been \none that has been speaking out all across the country in the State of \nOregon on the importance of Ed-Flex?\n  I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, does it appear, based on \nthat alone, when one of the prime movers of the Ed-Flex bill is a \nDemocratic Senator from the State of Oregon, that we are trying to kill \nthe bill?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Certainly not. One of our colleagues that we respect and \nadmire most and has had a distinguished career not only in the Senate, \nbut in the House of Representatives, and been long committed to \neducation--- we certainly commend him for his constancy in terms of \neducation reform.\n  Mr. REID. I also say to the Senator from Massachusetts in the form of \na question, isn't it true that each one of these amendments we have \nasked to have a hearing on, that we are being gagged on, isn't it true \nwe would agree to a very, very short time limit of one-half hour on \neach amendment; isn't that true?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. Senator Daschle indicated that \nhe would be willing to propose, and has proposed to the majority \nleader, a one-half-hour time limit on the various amendments. Now we \nare in our fifth day without having the opportunity to act on an \namendment.\n  This bill could have been history with votes on these various \nmeasures, but we are effectively denied that because the majority does \nnot want to have their Members vote on a particular educational issue--\nthat is a new concept.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator has 4 minutes 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Is it not true that the Senator has been to the State of \nNevada on many occasions?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Isn't it true that the State of Nevada is the fastest \ngrowing State in the Union and Las Vegas is the fastest growing city in \nthe Union?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator knows that well.\n  Mr. REID. This year, in a relatively small community of Las Vegas, we \nhad to hire in one school district alone 2,000 new teachers.\n  Now, we are talking about nationwide, as I understand this very \nimportant legislation that the Senator from Washington has pushed that \nwe would hire over the years 100,000 new teachers to help places like \nLas Vegas, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield. The Las Vegas school board \nhas to have their budget finalized by the first week in April. They are \neligible for close to $4 million. That school board is meeting, I am \nsure, and looking at this debate in the Senate wondering whether they \nought to move ahead and accept that $4 million in additional funds for \nthe next year and the following year in order to provide those teachers \nin those new schools.\n  The Senator from Nevada is being denied the opportunity to at least \ngive assurances to his constituency as to whether the Senate will go on \nrecord on this.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator think it rings hollow in the ears of the \ngoverning body of the Clark County school trustees that we will be able \nto debate these issues ``some later time'' with the budget facing them \nwithin a few days? That doesn't ring very clear in their ears--that we \nwill debate this issue some other time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. I hope we will do everything to \ncertainly ensure that we will have a continuing opportunity during the \nsession to consider education amendments. The fact is after this \nparticular proposal we will move towards the Appropriations Committee \nor the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--and there is no \nguarantee we will see that.\n  So to those parents, those teachers, those school boards, this debate \nis the essential time for what will happen to that school board in Las \nVegas, and that is in terms of class size. That is what we are \nbattling. That is what this vote will be about.\n\n  Mr. President, I withhold whatever time remains.\n  Mr. FRIST. How much time does this side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes 49 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. Has their time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have 1 minute 17 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. Hopefully, in a few minutes we will have word on some sort \nof final agreement as we move forward. I know we are making progress in \nterms of the negotiations. I hope we can advance this bill through the \nSenate. It is\n\n[[Page S2477]]\n\nvery disappointing that we have all of the politics above and before an \nexcellent, superb policy that has good evidence behind it.\n  I want to respond to my colleague who talked about the waivers and \nthe potential for abuse and money channeled to other populations. We \nhave to make it clear that this is not a block grant. This isn't money \nthat can be used for any purpose whatsoever. The great thing about this \nbill is the money that is being directed--that 7 percent of Federal \ndollars--still goes to the stated purpose, with the stated \naccountability guaranteed by the bill.\n  This whole hypothetical that these States with waivers can take this \nmoney and rechannel it away from targeted goals is really absurd. If we \nlook at the history, this isn't hypothetical policy. We can look back \nand see what the 12 States have done, including the great Commonwealth \nof Massachusetts. These waivers have not been abused. Regarding these \nStates who have put the waivers forward, the GAO came back and told us \nin November 1998:\n\n       The Department of Education officials told us they believe \n     the 12 current Ed-Flex States have used their waiver \n     authority carefully and judiciously.\n\n  That is one of the rare pieces of legislation where we have a track \nrecord, and we can go back and even strengthen it, which is what we did \nin accountability. In the field of accountability, across the board, \nwith great care, we built in accountability at the local level, the \nState level, and the Federal level. This tier approach on this chart--\nat the bottom is the local level--outlines what we put into this bill \nto guarantee that the waivers are not abused in any way, and those \ngoals are achieved at the State level and at the Federal level. I know \nwe just have a few minutes.\n  I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the sponsor of this bill. I am \npleased to be an original cosponsor.\n  Mr. President, let's get on with the task before us. The Educational \nFlexibility Partnership Act is a straightforward bill. It is a \nbipartisan proposal. It has been endorsed by the Governors of all 50 \nStates. It will make a positive difference in the lives of students \nthroughout this Nation. It will give to every State the flexibility \nthat 12 States have had for the past 5 years--flexibility that will \nallow our States and our local schools to pursue innovative efforts to \nimprove K-through-12 education. We should invoke cloture and take this \nimportant step toward improving our schools.\n  In support of the need for this legislation, let me cite one example \nfrom my home State of Maine. Maine is one of the 38 States that are \ncurrently not eligible for Ed-Flex waivers. When Maine examined its \neducational system several years ago, the State found out that its \nschools had made significant progress in improving the achievement of \nMaine's students in K through 8. But in Maine, as in most of America, \nstudent achievement in secondary schools lagged far behind. Maine's \nschools simply were not sustaining the progress of the early years all \nthe way until graduation. To the Maine commissioner of education, to \nlocal school boards, and to teachers and parents throughout the State, \nthe need for change was clear. Maine needed to focus its efforts on \nimproving secondary education; therefore, the commissioner of education \napplied to the Federal Secretary of Education for waivers from Federal \nrequirements in order to use Federal education funding to address the \ntrue needs facing our State.\n\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the Federal Department of Education did \nnot share the conclusions of Maine's local educators; it resisted \nMaine's request for a waiver.\n  Eventually, the waivers were indeed granted, but only after a lengthy \nbattle between Maine and the Washington education bureaucracy. Time, \neffort, resources, and money were needlessly wasted. This should not \nhave occurred. Passing the Education Flexibility Partnership Act will \nprevent other States from enduring the same frustration and delay that \nMaine experienced. It will allow us to use education dollars to address \nreal needs and not the priorities set in Washington, DC.\n  I thank the Chair and the sponsor of the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I see one of the cosponsors of the \nlegislation here. Since we will have a vote momentarily, I wanted to \nmake a statement and then propound a unanimous consent request that \nwill help facilitate passage of this bill.\n  My colleagues, can't we even do education flexibility--this \nbipartisan bill that everybody is for? I don't direct this at the \nDemocratic leader; he is working with me and we are trying to find a \nreasonable solution. But it seems to escape us. I just think it is a \nlegitimate question. Why can't we find a way to agree to education \nflexibility, to give this opportunity to States other than the 12 that \nalready have it and do what is best for education at the local level? \nThat is why I brought it up, because I thought it was broadly supported \nand we could do it quickly.\n  If we can't get an agreement, we will keep working on it, debating \nit. But it is going to affect the rest of our schedule. It is our \nintent when we complete the education bill to go to missile defense, \nand then, if there is time, to do the supplemental, keeping in mind \nthat the week after next, the whole week would be spent on the budget \nresolution. So I am concerned about our ability to come to an \nagreement. I thought we had a legitimate one worked out, and I want to \npropound that request, hoping that maybe it can still be agreed to.\n\n\n                       UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nvote scheduled to occur at 2 o'clock today be vitiated and that the \ncloture vote scheduled for Thursday be vitiated.\n  I further ask that all amendments pending to S. 280 other than the \nJeffords substitute be withdrawn and Senator Lott be recognized to \noffer an amendment relative to the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act/choice and the amendments immediately be laid aside.\n  I further ask that Senator Kennedy be recognized to offer an \namendment relative to class size and that amendment be laid aside.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Lott, or his designee, have a \nchance to offer an amendment relative to the special education \namendment, and it be immediately laid aside.\n  I ask consent that Senator Bingaman be recognized to offer his \namendment relative to dropout programs and it be laid aside.\n  I further ask that I or my designee be allowed to offer another \namendment relative to special education, IDEA, and that it be laid \naside, and that Senator Boxer be recognized to offer an amendment \nrelative to afterschool programs and that it be laid aside.\n  I further ask that I or my designee be allowed to offer another \namendment dealing with special education and that it be laid aside for \na Feinstein amendment relative to social promotion, and that there be 5 \nhours equally divided in the usual form for debate on the eight first-\ndegree amendments, and no additional amendments or motions be in order \nto S. 280, other than the motions to table.\n  I emphasize that we are saying, basically, we have amendments by \nSenators Kennedy, Bingaman, Boxer, Feinstein, with amendments on this \nside of the aisle to match each one of those, and that we would have \ndebate only, limited to 5 hours of debate, and so we would have an \nopportunity to debate and vote on those issues.\n  Then I ask that at the conclusion of yielding back of that time, the \nSenate proceed to vote on or in relation to the eight pending first-\ndegree amendments in the order in which they were offered, with the \nfirst vote limited to 15 minutes and all others after that be limited \nto 10 minutes, and there be 5 minutes between each vote for \nexplanation.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following those votes, the bill \nbe advanced to third reading and passage occur, all without any \nintervening action or debate.\n  So, we could have these issues all debated, eight amendments, then go \nto final passage, and we could complete it at a reasonable time \ntomorrow and move on to the next issue.\n  I think this is a very fair approach. So I ask unanimous consent it \nbe agreed to.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S2478]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for making \nthe offer that he has. He and I have been in discussions throughout the \nmorning trying to find a way with which to resolve this impasse. I \nappreciate very much his willingness to have the up-or-down votes that \nwe now have wanted for some time.\n  We have 20 amendments that Senators want to offer. For the life of \nme, I don't understand. We had over 20 amendments offered, voted on, \nconsidered, and disposed of on the military bill a couple of weeks ago, \nand we resolved that bill within 3 or 4 days. We could have easily done \nthat by now.\n  I have offered to the majority leader the agreement that he has just \narticulated, with one minor change. We keep the time. We go to the time \ncertain that the majority leader suggested in his unanimous consent \nrequest. But we would also accommodate four other amendments: Two \noffered by Senator Wellstone, an amendment offered by the Senator from \nRhode Island, and the amendment offered by the Senator from North \nDakota--all related to Ed-Flex, directly related to Ed-Flex, with the \nexception of Senator Dorgan's report card amendment. Those four \namendments would not require any additional time beyond the 5 hours; \nthat is, we divide up the time allotted to us in whatever amount is \nrequired for each amendment. But we would accommodate at least those \nthree Senators who have waited patiently now for over a week to offer \ntheir amendments.\n  So I hope the majority leader can modify his request with that simple \noutstanding caveat, that one additional change: No additional time, one \nadditional change to accommodate three Senators who have waited \npatiently and who want to resolve this matter. I hope the majority \nleader will modify his request in that regard, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to that effect.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would object to that modification.\n  I would say that then we would have 14 additional amendments, but \ncrammed into 5 hours on this noncontroversial bill that is broadly \nsupported on both sides. I don't think that is an adequate solution.\n  We can go forward with a cloture vote, and we can continue to have \ndebate, and we can continue to work to come to conclusion on this in a \nway that everybody is comfortable with.\n  I understand Senators want to offer amendments. There are Senators \nwho want to offer amendments on this side. I understand there are \nMembers who want to offer amendments who want a direct vote. There are \nother Members who would like to second-degree them. So we have made a \nvery complicated process out of a broadly supported, simple bill that \nwould help education.\n  I would object to that modification at this time.\n  But we will continue to work to see if we can come up with something \nlater.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. In light of the objection, the Senate will conduct two \nback-to-back votes on cloture motions relative to this bill.\n  I regret that there are objections. The agreement is exactly what the \nranking member and the whip had indicated they would support a few days \nago. But we can continue to work on this, and hopefully we can get an \nagreement where we can complete it tomorrow so we can go to the other \nissue. Until we complete this bill, everybody else will have to wait.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/10/senate-section/article/S2478-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2478-S2500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 55, the nays are \n44. Three-fifths of the Senators not having voted in the affirmative, \nthe motion is rejected.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senators Jeffords and Frist and \nthose who have worked so hard on the Ed-Flex bill. This is an \noutstanding piece of legislation. It has the support of our Nation's \nGovernors, the National Governors' Association. They strongly support \nthis legislation. Most of the educational leadership in the States and \nlocal communities support this type of legislation. My Governor of \nAlabama, a Democrat, Don Siegelman, supports this legislation. Mr. Ed \nRichardson, the State superintendent of education in Alabama, supports \nthis legislation.\n  The Ed-Flex bill came out of Labor Committee last year with a 17-1 \nvote. Democrats and Republicans supported it. Now this year, the \nPresident indicates that he will support it and sign this legislation. \nThe strength of it is that it is a clean bill. Basically, what it says \nis that we learned a lot from the historic welfare reform debate during \nthe 104th Congress. We learned if you give State and local officials \nsome flexibility and the ability to do things differently than the \nFederal regulations have mandated, they will find ways to be better. \nThey will find ways to do a better job. It is an affirmation of them.\n  I'd also indicate that a GAO report in 1998 said that the Department \nof Education officials have told the GAO that they believe that 12 Ed-\nFlex States, the 12 States that now have this legislation as a pilot \nproject, have used their waiver authority carefully and judiciously.\n  Mr. President, It simply goes against reason that people duly elected \nto run the school systems in our counties and States would abuse \nflexibility and should be denied creativity because those of us in this \nbody believe we know how to run their school systems better. The \nFederal Government provides only 7 percent of the money for State and \nlocal education, but it mandates over 50 percent of the regulations.\n  Let me read you a letter I received from the Montgomery public \nschools in Montgomery, AL. This is what I was told with regard to \npaperwork that has to be done for the Federal Government.\n\n       Personnel in the schools of the Montgomery Public School \n     System and three Central Office assistants are estimated to \n     spend this year 16,425 hours in Title I program \n     documentation, bookkeeping, etc. What this boils down to \n     moneywise, is that the system spends $860,833.48 for the \n     personnel to take care of the paperwork. This is a \n     conservative estimate and does not include such programs as \n     HIPPY and other programs funded by Title I not housed in \n     schools.\n\n  This is the kind of thing that is happening. This is the kind of \nmoney we need to get down to the classroom. I taught in public schools \none year. My wife has taught in public schools a number of years. Our \ntwo daughters graduated from a large public high school in Mobile, AL. \nWe have been involved in PTA. To suggest the principals and teachers \nand school superintendents do not care about their kids and are not \ntrying to do better to get more bang for their buck every day is to \ndemean them and put them down, while we have this idea that we have to \nprotect the system by mandating what they do.\n  I think the Ed-Flex bill is a wonderful bill. It is a clean bill. It \nis not a radical bill. It allows applications for waivers and that sort \nof thing.\n  Mr. President as a teacher, as a spouse of a teacher, and as a parent \nof children in the Alabama public schools, I know that the most \nimportant event is that magic moment in a classroom when learning \nactually occurs. That magic moment is not enhanced by micromanaging \nregulations from Washington, DC. It simply does not help education.\n  Mr. President, I care about education. I want to see our education \nsystem improved. I will support--as Congress has done for the last 10 \nyears--increased Federal funding for education. But I want to be sure \nit is used wisely and efficiently so that learning is enhanced, and not \ncreating a bureaucracy that takes 35 cents out of every dollar before \nit ever gets down to the States. That is what we have learned. In fact, \nafter this modest bill, I will be supporting a bill that will have even \ngreater impact which will require that 95 percent of every Federal \neducation dollar that is expended actually goes to the local classroom.\n  Let me share with this body a response to a question I proposed to a \nprincipal of a Title I elementary school in Alabama, Mr. Thomas \nToleston. He was asked what would he do if he had less Federal mandates \nwhich would help free up some extra money for his school; if the \nFederal Government would eliminate the regulations, how would he spend \nthe freed up funds. This is what he said he would like:\n\n       I would ensure that Southlawn would implement a \n     comprehensive summer school program in reading and math for \n     all students who score below average on the Stanford \n     Achievement Test 9.\n\n  No one here even knows what the Stanford Achievement Test 9 is. He \ndoes; this is his career. That is what he would like to spend more \nmoney on--not building a new classroom or 100,000 new teachers.\n  He said:\n\n       This would include sufficient faculty, hardware and \n     software in an effort to bring those poor performing students \n     up to average performance.\n\n  So you could take your year-long teachers and pay them extra to work \nin the summer school program.\n\n       If additional funds were available, I would also attempt to \n     bring more faculty to our extended day program [afterschool \n     programs] to offer more exposure to our students. These \n     exposures would be in the areas of music, i.e. violin and \n     other musical instruments that are available in the \n     Montgomery\n\n[[Page S2480]]\n\n     Public School System, but are not being utilized.\n\n  They would take extra funds to have teachers come down after school \nto do this, not new teachers.\n\n       Another area of interest to me would be the ability to \n     provide students with scholarships of additional exposure. \n     This would include paid trips to the Huntsville Space Center \n     to increase students' interest in science and math.\n\n  Now, we have been talking about building classrooms and adding \n100,000 teachers and all these ideas that people in this body, who have \nbeen doing some polling, and they think the polls are good so they \noffer to mandate it all over the country. Mr. Toleston never mentioned \nany of those ideas, yet we here in Washington want to force them on him \nand his school?\n\n       The earlier we expose students to these hard core areas the \n     greater the chances for them to develop an interest.\n       I would also like to expand our present extended day \n     program to begin classes in computer program at the 4th and \n     5th grade level. This is a career that will allow one to have \n     a fairly good paying job without a college degree. This \n     program would provide a net for some of the students who we \n     know will never make it to college. But, again, I think that \n     the interest must be presented at the elementary level to \n     make a significant difference.\n       Since we all know that the greater the parent involvement \n     the better students do in school, I would like to have more \n     money set aside for parent programs. Presently, I have one \n     teacher who volunteers one night a week to teach parents how \n     to use computers. I would like to compensate her but the \n     funds are not available.\n\n  Under this bill, if we have Federal mandates, they still won't be \navailable.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Most of the planning for the school year takes place during \n     the summer months. The stipend paid to teachers is $50.00 per \n     day. I would like to have the flexibility to offer my teacher \n     an additional $50.00 per day. This still seems like a small \n     price to pay but it would be a worth while incentive for them \n     to give up one of their summer vacation days. I feel that \n     this would encourage more teachers to be apart of the \n     planning process during the summer. Once school starts it is \n     time to execute our plans--no time for planning.\n\n  Mr. President, those are just some of the points that I would make.\n  I would just say this: People are asking, Why won't this bill pass? I \nthink they have to look at those on the other side of the aisle who say \noften that they are for returning control to the local people, to \npeople we have elected in our communities to run our school systems. \nBut when the chips are down, there is always some reason not to.\n  I hope that we can work through some of these amendments, all of \nwhich ought to be debated during the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct that we will be taking up later this year, not on this bill. This \nis a clean bill, and should be kept clean. If we will do that, we can \npass this important bill, and then we can deal with many of these \nissues later.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time. I d also like to again thank \nSenators Frist and Jeffords for all of their hard work on this bill. I \nagree wholeheartedly with the premise of this legislation which is \nthat, if given more flexibility, our local school systems can improve \ntheir ability to educate our children.\n  I notice that the majority leader has arrived on the floor. I am \npleased to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator from Alabama for yielding so we can get \nthis consent agreement before Members change their minds.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nvote scheduled to occur on Thursday be vitiated. I further ask that all \namendments pending to S. 280 other than the Jeffords substitute be \nwithdrawn and I be recognized to offer an amendment relative to IDEA/\nchoice and the amendment then be immediately laid aside. I further ask \nthat Senator Kennedy be recognized to offer an amendment relative to \nclass size and that amendment be laid aside.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I or my designee be recognized to offer \nan amendment relative to the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct amendment and it be immediately laid aside.\n  I ask consent that Senator Bingaman be recognized to offer his \namendment relative to dropout programs and it be laid aside. I ask that \nmyself or my designee be recognized to offer an amendment relative to \nthe Individuals with Disability Education Act and it be laid aside and \nSenator Boxer be recognized to offer an amendment relative to \nafterschool programs, and it then be laid aside.\n  I further ask that I or my designee be recognized to offer an \namendment relative to IDEA and it be laid aside for Senator Feinstein \nand Dorgan to offer their amendment relative to social promotion and it \nbe laid aside. I further ask that I or my designee be recognized to \noffer an another amendment relative to the Individuals with \nDisabilities Act and it be laid aside for Senator Wellstone to offer an \namendment relative to accountability, and there then be 5 hours equally \ndivided in the usual form for debate on these 10 first-degree \namendments and no additional amendments or motions be in order to S. \n280, other than motions to table. I further ask that at the conclusion \nor yielding back of time the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation \nto the 10 pending first-degree amendments in the order in which they \nwere offered, with the first vote limited to 15 minutes, with all \nsucceeding votes limited to 10 minutes, and there be 5 minutes between \neach vote for explanation.\n\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following these votes the bill \nbe advanced to third reading and passage occur, all without any \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nshall not, did the majority leader say between the votes tomorrow there \nwill be 5 minutes equally divided?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. There was \ndiscussion previously with respect to my amendment. I wonder if the \nmajority leader has anything to say with respect to my amendment?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have discussed the Reed amendment, and I \nbelieve there has been a good deal of work done on that amendment. An \nagreement has been worked out, and it will go into one of our \namendments that will be put into the bill. So it will be included. It \nwould not be necessary to consider it separately.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the majority leader for that information. It would \nhave been cleaner to have done it up or down, but the substance is \nimportant, and I am pleased that it will be included in the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. LOTT. I appreciate the Senator's attitude on this. Obviously, he \nhas worked on it, he cares about it, and he would have liked to have it \nhighlighted and considered individually. We were trying to craft an \nagreement, and the attitude he had was that he wanted to get it done; \nthat was more important. I wish we had more Senators who were willing \nto make such a concession. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for \nthat approach.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the majority leader and the Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nshall not. Is the order which listed the amendments the order of the \nvotes or the order in which the amendments would be laid down? Is there \nflexibility--to use that word--about how we might proceed this \nafternoon, for those of us who are here and ready to do our amendments?\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe they would come up in the order identified and \nvotes would occur in that order, too. However, I presume that if there \nis a scheduling problem, the managers would be flexible and we could \nget an agreement to change that order. But that was the agreement that \nwas asked for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Daschle for his cooperation \nin this effort, too. We found, a few moments ago, that we were very \nclose to an agreement, even though it might not have appeared so. I am \nsure Members on both sides would have liked to have done it \ndifferently, but I believe this will allow us to get to a conclusion on \nthis bill. It has broad support. We\n\n[[Page S2481]]\n\ncan then move on to other very important national issues. So I thank \nSenator Daschle for his help in working out this modification.\n  One last thing, and I will yield the floor. In light of the \nagreement, then, there would be no further votes today. The Senate will \ndebate the amendments to S. 280 for the remainder of the session today, \nand up to 11 back-to-back votes will occur tomorrow morning. I hope \nmaybe it won't be necessary to have all 11, but it could be 11, with \nthe 10 amendments and final passage. All Senators will be notified of \nthe exact time of the votes. I thank my colleagues for their \ncooperation. We did get the unanimous-consent agreement, correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We did.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to briefly thank those Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle. This is a very important procedural agreement \nwe have reached, after some deliberation and a great deal of \nwillingness to cooperate on the part of many Senators. There were many, \nmany Senators who had expressed the hope that they could offer their \namendments; they were precluded from doing that. Frankly, I am \ndisappointed that they were precluded. But I will say this: I am also \ngrateful to the majority leader for agreeing to have up-or-down votes \non the class size amendment, on the dropout amendment, on the social \npromotion amendment, on the amendment with regard to report cards, and \non the amendments Senator Wellstone will be proposing on the \naccountability.\n  This represents, I think, a compromise that we hoped we could reach. \nIt represents an extraordinary amount of good-faith effort on both \nsides. I think the Senators from Oregon and Tennessee ought to be \ncommended as well for their patience and tolerance in working with all \nof our colleagues in bringing us to this point.\n  It goes without saying, the managers of the bill, the Senator from \nVermont and the illustrious and extraordinary ranking member, Senator \nKennedy, deserve a great deal of credit. We have come a long way. We \nhave reached a point now where we are going to be able to finish this \nbill--a very good bill that deserves support. This also allows us to \ndeal with the amendments that a number of Senators have been fighting \nto have votes on now for several days.\n  I thank all Senators for their cooperation.\n  Mr. President, there have been a number of questions about how we are \ngoing to be proceeding under the unanimous consent request. We \nconsulted with the majority leader and with the manager of the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all but 1 hour of time allotted under \nthe unanimous consent agreement be consumed today, allowing 1 hour \nunder the arrangement anticipated by the unanimous consent agreement to \nbe used tomorrow. I then ask unanimous consent that those who might \nwish to express themselves on the bill or on amendments be allowed as \nif in morning business to speak later on this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we want \nto check with our leadership on this side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, it is our \nintention that we use up the 4 hours for those members who have \namendments to introduce and speak to them this evening. And that we \nhave 1 hour evenly divided tomorrow for Members on either side to \naddress the Senate, as if in morning business. That is what we had \nhoped to be able to do.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is my \nunderstanding that under the previous unanimous consent order that the \namendments should be offered at this time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I anticipate that the amendments would \nall be offered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That would be fine.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I modify my request to clarify that it \nwould be my expectation that all amendments would be offered, and that \nthere would be a period of 1 hour simply to discuss and further \nconsider these amendments tomorrow. I withdraw the request at this \npoint, and I certainly defer to the managers to renew their request at \nsuch time as the majority leader clears the request. But I don't \nanticipate an objection. I appreciate the indulgence of both managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  Who seeks time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  I want to indicate to our colleagues on this side that have \namendments, that we expect those to be offered in the very near future. \nIt is 3:15 now--we have 2 hours on each side. We are going to try to be \nin touch with those Senators that have amendments and work out a shared \ntime to accommodate Senators' schedules.\n  Senator Feinstein will take the first half hour, followed either by \nSenator Dorgan or Senator Wellstone for 15 minutes. Then we thought 45 \nminutes on the other side, one-half hour on this side, one-half hour on \nthe other side, and then those that either wanted to talk on the \namendments or that wanted to be able to talk on the bill would be able \nto do so using up the time that has been allocated by the leader--that \nwas our intention. We want to make sure all of our Members understand \nthat we expect that those amendments are going to be offered this \nevening. We want them included in the Record so that those tomorrow \nmorning are able to look at the exact wording. That was our intention.\n  So we will proceed in that way, and we will be in touch with the \nsponsors of these amendments to work out with them appropriate time \nallocations.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 60 To Amendment No. 31\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding flexibility to \n    use certain Federal education funds to carry out part B of the \n Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and to provide all local \n educational agencies with the option to use the funds received under \n section 307 of the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 1999, \n   for activities under part B of the Individuals with Disabilities \n                             Education Act)\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I offer an amendment on behalf of \nSenator Lott on the IDEA/choice amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont (Mr. Jeffords), for Mr. Lott, for \n     himself and Mr. Abraham, proposes an amendment numbered 60 to \n     amendment No. 31.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that the amount appropriated \n     to carry out part B of the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411 et seq.) has not been \n     sufficient to fully fund such part at the originally promised \n     level, which promised level would provide to each State 40 \n     percent of the average per-pupil expenditure for providing \n     special education and related services for each child with a \n     disability in the State.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that any Act authorizing the appropriation of Federal \n     education funds that is enacted after the date of enactment \n     of this Act should provide States and local school districts \n     with the flexibility to use the funds to carry out part B of \n     the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n\n     SEC.   . IDEA.\n\n       Section 307 of the Department of Education Appropriations \n     Act, 1999, is amended by adding after subsection (g) the \n     following:\n       ``h) Notwithstanding subsection (b)(2), and (c) through \n     (g), a local educational agency may use funds received under \n     this section to carry out activities under part B of the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411 \n     et seq.) in accordance with the requirements of such part.''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield one-half hour to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  I believe, Mr. President, that I have one-half hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The Senator is recognized for \n30 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 61 To Amendment No. 31\n\n  (Purpose: To assist local educational agencies to help all students \n  achieve State achievement standards, to end the practice of social \n                   promotion, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n\n[[Page S2482]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), for herself, \n     Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered \n     61 to amendment No. 31.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments submitted.'')\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this is an amendment which does two \nthings. One of them is it deals with the practice, either formal or \ninformal, of social promotion, and authorizes a remedial program of \n$500 million a year for a program of competitive grants.\n  The second part has to do with school report cards.\n  Senator Dorgan will be speaking on the second half, and I will \naddress my comments to the first part.\n  This amendment would authorize $500 million a year from the year 2000 \nto 2004 for competitive grants to school districts to help provide \nremedial education for afterschool and summer school courses, for low-\nperforming students who are not making passing grades.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of the amendment is to provide Federal \nincentives and Federal help to those school districts that abolish and/\nor do not allow social promotion. As a condition of receiving these \nfunds, school districts would have to adopt a policy prohibiting social \npromotion for students; require that all K through 12 students meet \nminimum achievement levels in the core curriculum defined as subjects \nsuch as reading and writing, language arts, mathematics, social \nsciences, including history, and science; test student achievement in \nmeeting standards at certain benchmark grades to be determined by the \nStates for advancement to the next grade; and, finally, provide \nremedial education for students who fail to meet achievement standards \nincluding tutoring, mentoring, summer, before-school and after-school \nprograms.\n  School districts would be authorized to use funds to provide academic \ninstruction to enable students to meet academic achievement standards \nby implementing early intervention strategies or alternative \ninstructional strategies; strengthening learning by hiring certified \nteachers to reduce class sizes, providing professional development, and \nusing proven instructional practices and curricula aligned to State \nachievement standards; providing extended learning time such as \nafterschool and summer school; and developing intensive instructional \nintervention strategies for students who fail to meet State achievement \nstandards. The amendment also addresses the special needs of children \nwith disabilities by allowing school districts to follow the child's \nindividualized education plan.\n  Why do we need this amendment? Perhaps nothing better describes why \nwe need this amendment than an article which appeared in the Los \nAngeles Times five days ago about the largest school system in the \nUnited States--California's--and I want to read the headline: \n``California Ranks Second to Last in U.S. Reading Test.''\n\n       California ranks second to last among 39 States in a new \n     Federal assessment of fourth grade reading skills. The study \n     revealed Thursday that only 20 percent of the students are \n     considered proficient readers.\n\n  Mr. President, California has 5.6 million students, more than the \npopulation of 36 other States, and only 20 percent of them are reading \nproficiently at the fourth grade level.\n  That is an incredible statement of what the practice of social \npromotion has done.\n  I truly believe that the linchpin to educational reform is the \nelimination of the path of least resistance whereby students who are \nfailing are simply promoted to the next grade in the hopes that \nsomeday, somewhere they will learn.\n  This practice alone, I believe, after visiting literally dozens of \nschools, is the main reason for the failure in the quality of public \neducation today. It is largely responsible, in my view, for its \ndecline.\n  Achievement standards must be established--and enforced. To promote \nyoungsters when they are failing to learn has produced a generation \nthat is below standard and high school graduates who can't read or \nwrite, count change in their pockets, or fill out an employment \napplication. It is that bad. And California is just about the worst.\n  It is such a shame to hand a high school diploma to a youngster whom \nyou know cannot fill out an employment application for a job. In my \nState, a state that is restructuring its economy and seen the emergence \nof a new high-skilled, high-tech work base, this means doom for the \nability of these youngsters to sustain themselves with gainful and \nfulfilling employment in the future.\n  This same article, discussing this assessment of reading skills, also \nshows that 52 percent of our fourth graders scored below the basic \nlevel, meaning they failed to even partially master basic skills.\n  The news wasn't much better for California's eighth graders, who \nranked 33rd out of 36 States, and only 22 percent were proficient \nreaders. In December 1998, a study by the Education Trust ranked \nCalifornia last in the percent of young adults with a high school \ndiploma--in other words, students are not even finishing and getting \ntheir diploma--37th in SAT scores, and 31st of 41 States in eighth \ngrade math. Nearly half of all students entering the California State \nUniversity system require remedial classes in math or English or both.\n\n  The news is also grim nationally. I start out with California to say \nthat this all begins right at home. But the news is also grim \nthroughout the rest of the United States where our students are falling \nfar behind their international counterparts. The lowest 25 percent of \nJapanese and South Korean eighth graders outperform the average \nAmerican student. In math and science, United States 12th grade \nstudents fell far behind students in other industrialized countries, \nwhich is especially troubling when we consider the skills that will be \nrequired to stay ahead in the 21st century. United States 12th graders \nwere significantly outperformed by 14 countries and only performed \nbetter than students in Cyprus and South Africa. We scored last in \nphysics and next to last in mathematics.\n  What is social promotion? Simply stated, social promotion is the \npractice, either formal or informal, of a school's advancing a student \nfrom one grade to the next regardless of that student's academic \nachievement. In some cases, it is even regardless of whether they \nattend school or not. It is a practice which misleads our students, \ntheir parents and the public.\n  The American Federation of Teachers agrees. Let me quote from their \nSeptember 19, 1997, study:\n\n       Social promotion is an insidious practice that hides school \n     failure and creates problems for everybody--for kids, who are \n     deluded into thinking they have learned the skills to be \n     successful or get the message that achievement doesn't count; \n     for teachers who must face students who know that teachers \n     wield no credible authority to demand hard work; for the \n     business community and colleges that must spend millions of \n     dollars on remediation, and for society that must deal with a \n     growing proportion of uneducated citizens, unprepared to \n     contribute productively to the economic and civic life of the \n     Nation.\n\n  That is well said. But merely ending social promotion and retaining \nstudents in the same grade will not solve the problem. We cannot just \nlet them languish without direction in a failing system. Instead, we \nmust provide ongoing remedial work, specialized tutoring, afterschool \nprograms, and summer school. All must be used intensively and \nconsistently, and that is what this amendment is designed to create. It \nis designed to create both the incentive and also the help to \naccomplish this.\n  I know it can work. Last June, I led a delegation of California \nleaders to Chicago. We saw a dominantly poor, dominantly minority \nschool district turned around, social promotion abolished, and the \nremediation, summer school, and tutoring put in place. And now test \nscores and grades are improving.\n  How widespread is this practice, ubiquitous as it is? It is \nwidespread. Although there are no hard data on the extent of the \npractice, authorities in schools and out of schools know it is \nhappening, and in some districts it is standard operating procedure. In \nfact, 4\n\n[[Page S2483]]\n\nin 10 teachers reported that their schools automatically promote \nstudents when they reach the maximum age for their grade level. And the \nSeptember 19, 1998, AFT teacher study says social promotion is \n``rampant.''\n  It found most school districts use vague criteria for passing and \nretaining students. They lack explicit policies of social promotion, \nbut they have an implicit practice of social promotion, including a \nloose and vague criteria for advancing students to the next grade. And \nthey view holding students back as a policy of last resort and often \nput explicit limits on retaining students.\n  Also the study found that only 17 States have standards--only 17 \nStates have standards in the four core learning disciplines: English, \nmath, social studies, and science. Only these four have standards which \nare well grounded in content and are clear enough to be used, says the \nAFT study.\n  In July of last year, I wrote to 500 California school districts and \nasked about their policies on social promotion. I must tell you, their \nresponses are vague and often misleading, and they include the \nfollowing: Some school districts say they don't have a specific policy. \nSome say they simply figure what is in the best interests of the \nstudent. Some say teachers provide recommendations, but final decisions \non retention can be overridden by parents. And some simply just promote \nyoungsters, regardless of failing grades, nonattendance, or virtually \nanything else. In short, the policies are all over the place.\n  Last year, in California the legislature passed and the Governor \nsigned into law a bill to end social promotion in public education, a \ngiant step forward. In California now, this could affect fully half of \nCalifornia's students because 3 million children in California perform \nbelow levels considered proficient for their grade level. The grant \nfunds authorized in this amendment can be very helpful in providing \nongoing remedial and specialized learning and provide necessary help \nfor these 3 million children in my State, and the millions of children \nin other States as well.\n  President Clinton called for ending social promotion in his last two \nState of the Union speeches. Last year, he said: ``We must also demand \ngreater accountability. When we promote a child from grade to grade who \nhasn't mastered the work, we don't do that child any favors. It is time \nto end social promotion in America's schools.''\n  I will never forget, in 1990, when I was running for Governor of \nCalifornia and I appeared before the California teachers association, I \nsaid we must end social promotion, and I was roundly booed. How things \nchange. We now have the President of the United States, and a Democrat \nto boot, saying we must end social promotion.\n  I believe just as firmly in 1999 as I did in 1990 that the practice \nof social promotion is the Achilles heel of public education in the \nUnited States of America.\n  The seven States that have a policy in place which ties promotion to \nState-level standards today are California, Delaware, Florida, \nLouisiana, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia. I really want to give \nthem my kudos and say congratulations and right on.\n  I mentioned that the Chicago public schools have ditched social \npromotion. After their new policy was put in place in the spring of \n1997, over 40,000 students in Chicago failed tests in the third, sixth, \neighth, and ninth grades, and then went to mandatory summer school. \nChicago's School Superintendent Paul Vallas has called social promotion \n``educational malpractice.'' He said from now on his schools' only \nproduct will be student achievement. What welcome words those are.\n  In my own State, the San Diego School Board in February adopted \nrequirements that all students in certain grades must demonstrate \ngrade-level performance, and they will require all students to earn a C \noverall grade average and a C grade in core subjects for high school \ngraduation, effectively ending social promotion for certain grades and \nfor high school graduation.\n  For example, San Diego schools are requiring that their eighth \ngraders who do not pass core courses be retained or pass core courses \nin summer school.\n  Let me conclude. A January 1998 poll by Public Agenda asked employers \nand college professors whether they believe a high school diploma \nguarantees that a student has mastered basic skills. In this poll, 63 \npercent of employers and 76 percent of professors said the diploma is \nnot a guarantee that a graduate can read, write, or do basic math. What \na failure.\n  I first got into this because I also serve on the Immigration \nSubcommittee of the Judiciary Committee. Every year I had California \nchief executive officers, particularly in high tech companies, come in \nand say: ``We can't find high school graduates we can hire. Please \nincrease the quota of people from foreign countries who can come to us \nas temporary workers and work for us, because we can't find qualified \nAmericans.'' What a condemnation.\n  California employers tell me consistently that applicants are \nunprepared for work and the companies have to provide basic training to \nmake them employable. High-tech companies say they have to recruit \nabroad. For example, last year MCI spent $7.5 million to provide basic \nskills to their employees. On December 17, a group called California \nBusiness for Education Excellence announced they were organizing a \nmajor effort to reform public education. These major constituencies--\nthe California Business Roundtable, the California Manufacturers \nAssociation, the American Electronics Association, companies like \nHewlett-Packard, IBM, Pacific Bell--had to organize because they see \nfirsthand the results of a lagging school system.\n  So I offer this amendment today. It can provide the money to help \nteachers teach and students learn. It is estimated that this year the \nbudget will have $4 billion more in it for public education. I say \nlet's authorize the expenditure of $500 million for the kind of \nremedial and summer school programs that in fact can help us abolish \nsocial promotion and really have excellence and accountability in both \nour teachers and our students.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes 53 seconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will reserve the remainder of my time, if I might. \nI see Senator Dorgan on the floor. I know he wishes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first let me ask consent to yield myself \n15 minutes of the time allocated to our side, that I might be able to \npresent my amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Does the Senator intend to offer an amendment this \nafternoon?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would say to the Senator from Vermont, the amendment \nSenator Feinstein has offered is an amendment that combines her \namendment and my amendment. We have done that at the request of the \nmajority leader. So rather than having two amendments, we will have \nonly one and we will have only one vote on it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I appreciate that information.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am pleased today to join my colleague from California. \nI was listening to her explain the first portion of the amendment which \ndeals with social promotion and remedial education. It reminded me that \nthe last time we joined forces here on the floor of the Senate was also \non an education amendment. We worked on a very simple amendment called \nthe Gun-Free Schools Act. This is now the law in this country and has \nbeen for a number of years because we decided there ought to be a zero \ntolerance in this country for a student who brings a gun to school. You \nought not have to worry, no matter where you are in the country, about \nguns in schools. Everywhere in this country, we ought to understand \nthat guns and schools do not mix, and every student and every parent \nought to understand there is a penalty of expulsion for one year for \nbringing a gun to school.\n\n  I am pleased to have joined with my colleague from California to make \nthat Federal law, and I wonder how many tragedies may have been avoided \nwhere guns were not brought to school because a student now understands \nthere is zero tolerance with respect to guns in schools.\n\n[[Page S2484]]\n\n  Today we are here for a different purpose on the same subject: \neducation. The first part of the amendment we have offered deals with \nsocial promotion. The second part is a piece that I have written with \nSenator Bingaman from New Mexico regarding the issue of a school report \ncard. Let me explain that amendment.\n  Every 6 to 9 weeks in this country, a parent with a child in school \ngets a report card that tells the parent how that child has done. \nParents are able to see grades that describe how their child is doing \nin school, an A, a B, a C, or God forbid, maybe a D or even worse. \nStudents are graded and parents know what grades those students are \nachieving in their school.\n  But I raise a question: What does it mean when your child brings home \nthe best grades from the worst school? Does that tell you much as a \nparent? You see, we grade students, but there aren't any grades for \nschools. There are no report cards for schools. Even though we spend \nover $300 billion on a system of elementary and secondary education in \nour country, parents and taxpayers have no way of knowing how that \nschool is performing. We grade the children who are in that system, but \nwe do not require a report card on how well our schools are doing so \nthat parents also know how well their school is doing compared to other \nschools, how well their State is doing compared to other States.\n  A number of States already have school report cards, but very few of \nthem have report cards that provide a range of information on school \nquality indicators important to the public. And more notably, very few \nstates get that information to the parents themselves. So the parents, \nas the taxpayers who own that school, who provide the resources to run \nthat school, have very little information about how well that school \ndoes. Again, I return to the question: What does it mean for your child \nto be the best student in the worst school?\n  With this amendment, we propose to offer a Standardized School Report \nCard Act, which would say to all the schools around the country that, \nmost of you are already preparing some kind of report card, but let's \nall do it all in the same general way so that we can make some \nreasonable comparisons, school to school and State to State.\n  We want the report card to grade a school on six areas: 1, student \nperformance; 2, professional qualifications of the teachers; 3, average \nclass size; 4, school safety; 5, parental involvement; and 6, student \ndropout rates.\n  As I mentioned, more than 35 States now have some form of a school \nreport card. My State does, although my State's report card doesn't do \nanything more than simply to ask the school to look ahead to prepare \nfor changes in enrollment in the years ahead. It is not a very \nsubstantive report card, and most parents in my State have never seen \nthis report card. I would like, at the end of this process, to provide \nvirtually every parent in this country who has a child in school with a \nreport that says, here is how your child is doing, and another report \nthat says, here is how your school is doing related to other schools, \nother communities, other States. That would be good information for the \ntaxpayers and the parents of our country to have.\n  I was thinking, as I was listening to my colleague from California, \nabout a young girl named Rosie Two Bears. She is likely in class this \nafternoon in Cannon Ball, ND. I toured that school some while ago. I \ndon't know what a report card will say to the parents of Rosie. That \nschool is unsafe and in desperate need of repair.\n\n  I have described on the floor on previous occasions the condition of \nthat school. They have 150 students, one water fountain, and two \nbathrooms, kids cramped together in classes without an inch between \ntheir desks and no place to plug in a computer to get to the Internet, \nbecause the school won't accommodate wiring of that sort. In the \ndownstairs area where they have band and chorus, the room frequently is \nevacuated because sewer gas backs up and the students can't learn in a \nroom full of sewer gas backing up into the school. It is an awful \nsituation.\n  What would a report card say about the school of Rosie Two Bears? \nPerhaps if there were a report card that drove home to parents and \ntaxpayers the unsafe conditions of their children s school, there would \nbe a public outcry to improve that school.\n  The Ojibwa school, up on the Turtle Hill Mountain Indian Reservation, \nis another example of a tragedy waiting to happen, with all of these \nkids learning in detached trailers, going back and forth between \nclasses in the winter. I have been there and seen exposed wiring. I can \nshow you the reports that show that school is unsafe. Everybody knows \nit, and there is no money to build a new school for those children. \nAddressing this problem will be part of an another debate that we want \nto happen, but right now, this amendment is about four or five good \nideas on education that won't break the bank, that represent good \ninvestments in our kids, represent good approaches to improve and \nstrengthen education in this country. If we can do these things \ntogether, we will have done something very important for our children.\n  When we consider a report card that all parents could receive, I go \nback to the point that wouldn't it be nice for the parents of \nstudents--whether they go to your school or my school or to the Cannon \nBall School or the Ojibwa school--to be able to see what their child is \ngetting from that school? What are we getting for our tax investment in \nthat school? Are we proud, as parents, as the teachers who teach in \nthat school, of the building we have housed our children in, of the \ntextbooks we have provided? Are we doing the right things?\n  That is what Senator Bingaman and I and others would like to achieve \nwith this standardized report card for schools.\n  The Senator from California knows, because I have heard her speak of \nit, that the American people view education as one of their top \npriorities. Often people talk about how far ahead of politicians the \npeople are. Well, that certainly is true with respect to education. \nPeople know what is important. When people sit around the dinner table \nat night and talk about their lives, what are the first things they \ntalk about? They talk about what their children are learning in school, \nare we proud of that school? Are our folks getting good health care? Do \nwe have a good job? The central things in life. Children and school \nrepresent a priority for many of us. It is why I am pleased that one of \nthe first bills on the floor of the Senate following impeachment is \nabout education. It is why we have pushed so hard to be able to offer \namendments to it. Our purpose is not to be destructive, but to focus on \na number of steps we can take to improve education. I think Ed-Flex is \nfine. With this bill we are saying give the States some flexibility, \nbut that is not all there is with respect to education policy. There \nare other ideas, good ideas.\n  The attempt around here all too often is to get the worst of what \nboth sides have to offer rather than the best of what each has to \noffer. We have some good ideas. Ed-Flex is a fine idea. Let us add some \nother good ideas to it: dealing with class size, a school report card, \nending social promotion, addressing the problems of students dropping \nout. Those are good ideas and are central to what the American people \nbelieve could strengthen education in this country.\n  I hope that, when we have offered these amendments--some good ideas, \nI think, from both sides--there will be some positive votes on these \nideas, so that this Ed-Flex legislation will leave the Senate in a much \nstronger position to positively influence the lives of young Americans \nand families. I will have been proud to play one small part of that \nwith my colleague from California.\n  Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from North \nDakota, because I think, between us, we really have struck at the \nlinchpin of reform.\n  One is in the report card situation, to provide an ability for every \nparent to know some of the basics about the school that his or her \nchildren attend, and to be able to make some judgments on their own \nwhether that child is in the best learning environment. And what the \nreport card could do is spur competition, I think, I say to the \nSenator, among students, among schools,\n\n[[Page S2485]]\n\namong school districts, if they have a way to compare one to the other.\n  When you were talking about Cannon Ball, North Dakota, I was thinking \nabout Los Angeles, and going into a school that had 5,000 students K \nthrough sixth grade. Everything was in shifts. You can imagine the \ncacophony of sounds with 5,000 small children in this school. I had \nnever seen a school this size before.\n  As we debate social promotion, I am troubled by the size of some \nschools. I have read the views of educational experts and what they \nsaid about the size of the school. I read they advised that elementary \nschools be no bigger than 350 students to have that teacher-student \nquality relationship; middle schools, 750 students; and high schools \nmaybe a maximum of 1,200 students.\n  Because of the lack of money and the inability to do some of these \nthings, schools just diminish their quality. Like you, I am very \nhopeful that there will be an additional amount of $4 billion for \npublic education in this year s budget. I think the American people \nwant it, I think our students need it.\n  I just want you to know that I am very pleased to join with you on \nthis amendment. I hope it can stay in. I hope it will survive \nconference. I hope people will realize that we have to make major \nstructural changes in public education. Certainly a report card for \nschools to benefit parents, the elimination of social promotion, and \nthe provision of remedial programs and summer school can help. Ongoing \nand consistent programs, in which children can be brought up to their \ngrade level, are critical to helping these students learn and become \nproductive citizens and are critical to ending this ``educational \nmalpractice.''\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Feinstein-Dorgan amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time remains on the 15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 4 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will not use all of that, but I did want to say to \nSenator Feinstein that the ending of social promotion is an opportunity \nto invest in young lives in a way that will solve problems now, rather \nthan deferring them until much, much later. By ending social promotion \nwe can prevent much bigger problems later in a young person s life.\n  I happen to have, as most parents do, a profound conflict of interest \nhere. I have two children in public elementary school: one in fourth \ngrade and one in sixth grade. I do homework most evenings with them, \nand the homework is getting tougher these days. My children are in \npublic schools, and I don't know what people are talking about when \nthey talk about failing scores and how the public school system does \nnot work.\n  I am enormously proud of our public school system and what we have \naccomplished through public schools in this country. But I also know \nthat the only way a public school system works is with parental \ninvolvement. If the parent is not involved in the child's education, it \nis not going to work very well. There are three things you need for \neducation to work: a teacher who knows how to teach, a student willing \nto learn, and a parent involved in the education of that student. When \nthose three things are present, education works.\n  The Senator from California, in the first part of this amendment, \noffers a proposal that I think has great merit and is long overdue. I \ndid not speak about it when I spoke about my half of the amendment, but \nI just want to tell her that I think what she is offering has great, \ngreat merit and will be profoundly important to children in this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the remainder of my time, and yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Inquiry. I don't know whether we are finished with \nthis amendment. If so, I am ready to send an amendment to the desk. I \ndo not know whether my colleague from Vermont--\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I would like to proceed to explain very briefly the \nposition that we will have on the amendments that have been offered \nhere.\n  This is an agreement, unanimous consent agreement, that was made to \nenable us to get through this bill. And I appreciate all those that \nhave entered into this agreement.\n  I would like to explain to my colleagues, however, that because these \nare all--these two that are being talked about right now, the school \nreport card and the ending of social promotion, are both amendments \nwithin the purview of the committee dealing with elementary and \nsecondary education. It is my intention to listen very carefully and \ncarry forward the information that is provided on these until such time \nas we are marking up the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  However, it will be my procedure, in order to have an orderly hearing \nprocess in going ahead on these matters, to probably table the \namendment of the Senator from California. But I do understand and \nbelieve that a great deal of what she says, if not all, is very \nrelevant to our educational system but should be done in the orderly \ncommittee process. I want to make that clear so everybody understands \nwhen we vote on these things it is because they should be done in the \nproper order under an orderly committee process.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 62 to Amendment No. 31\n\n            (Purpose: To provide accountability in Ed-Flex)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nreading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 62 to amendment No. 31.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 15, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       ``(F) local and state plans, use of funds, and \n     accountability, under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and \n     Technical Education Act of 1998, except to permit the \n     formation of secondary and post-secondary consortia;\n       ``(G) sections 1114b and 1115c of Title I of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Act of 1965;''.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Do we have a copy of the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Vermont wish to object? \nThe Senator seeks a copy of the amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have an extra copy. Might I ask \nwhether I could also get one Xeroxed while I am speaking?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, which I have talked to my colleagues \nabout, speaks to the central issue with this legislation that a lot of \ncolleagues, I think, are trying to step around, dance around; that is, \naccountability. In other words, this amendment says we are for \nflexibility, but we are also for flexibility with accountability.\n  It is absolutely acceptable for school districts and States to make \nall kinds of decisions on the ground about whether or not you want more \nteaching assistants or more computers or more community outreach. All \nof that makes sense and is within the framework of flexibility.\n  I say to my colleague from Vermont, this amendment combines two \namendments, so let me start and devote maybe about 5 minutes or less to \nthe Perkins program--a very important vocational education program. \nWhat this amendment essentially says is, look, there are certain kinds \nof core requirements, core accountability requirements, of the Perkins \nprogram--vocational ed, high school, college--that must be protected--\nthat must be protected.\n  The requirement that school districts and vocational schools meet \ntheir States' performance standards, who can object to that? The \nrequirement\n\n[[Page S2486]]\n\nthat schools and districts provide professional development to \nteachers, counselors and administrators, who can object to that? The \nrequirement that schools must provide programs of sufficient size, \nscope and quality to bring about improvement, what is objectionable \nabout that? The requirement that schools and districts must evaluate \nthe programs, including the assessment of how the needs of special \npopulations are being met, what is objectionable about that? And \nfinally, the requirement that schools and districts must tell the State \nabout their process for local evaluation and improvement of the \nprogram.\n  That is the Perkins Vocational Education Program. And the only thing \nI am saying, on the basis, I say to my colleague from Vermont, of the \ngood work that we have done together on vocational education, why in \nthe world, understanding the importance of flexibility, would we want \nto not at least protect this program and make sure that in every State \nall across the country that at least these core requirements are met? \nLet everybody be flexible as long as they meet these core requirements. \nLet's not sacrifice the quality of this program.\n  Mr. President, the other part of this amendment is what troubles me \nthe most. This is what troubles me the most about Ed-Flex. And let me \njust say to my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike, I am quite \nsure that this amendment is going to pass overwhelmingly. For all I \nknow, it may get 99 votes. But let me tell you one unpleasant truth \nthat you have been unwilling to face up to. It is this: When the \noriginal title I program first passed in 1965, a lot of sweat and tears \nwent into this program. We had some basic protections for poor children \nin America and we said there were going to be certain core requirements \nand in no way, shape, or form would those requirements ever be violated \nbecause this went to the very essence of what we are about as a Federal \nGovernment, which is making sure there is protection and quality of \neducation for all our children.\n\n  Here is what the core requirements are all about. This amendment is a \ndifferent version from the amendment I had on the floor, because this \nis trimmed down and it refers specifically to sections 114(b) and \n115(c) of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  I am just saying we wrote this into this legislation in 1965, \ncolleagues. This was over 30 years ago. What did we say? We said let's \nmake sure that no State will ever be in a position of being able to \ngive a school district a waiver from the following requirements: That \nfor all of the title I children, low-income children, there will be \nopportunities for all children to meet challenging achievement levels; \nthat they will use effective instructional strategies which will give \nprimary consideration to extending learning time, like an extended \nschool year; that we will serve underserved populations, including \nwomen and men, or girls and boys; that we will address the needs of \nchildren, particularly those who are members of the target population, \nwho need additional help; that we will provide instruction by highly \nqualified professional staff; that we will minimize removing children \nfrom the regular classroom during regular school hours; and that we \nwill provide the professional development for teachers and aides to \nenable the children in school to meet the State student performance \nstandards.\n  What is going on here? I came out here and spoke for almost 4 hours \nthe other day and I never heard anybody give me a substantive argument \nabout why they are opposed to this amendment. What is going on here? I \nam not going to use Senators' names, but one Senator with considerable \nstature here in the U.S. Senate said, ``Senator Wellstone, if your \namendment passes, it will gut this bill.'' If that is what my colleague \nis saying, that is exactly what makes me worry about this legislation. \nHow could this amendment gut Ed-Flex when this amendment just says we \nare going to do with Ed-Flex what the proponents of Ed-Flex say Ed-Flex \ndoes?\n  Then my colleagues say, ``Don't you trust the Governors? Don't you \ntrust the school districts across America?'' My answer is yes, I trust \nmost of them, and therefore you should trust most of them, and \ntherefore surely no one who is involved in education with children in \nour country would be opposed to the idea that for title I children, for \npoor children, there will be certain core requirements which will be \nthe essence of accountability.\n  How can you be opposed to it? I don't know of any Governor or any \nschool board member who would say, ``Senator Wellstone, we don't want \nto live by the standard of making sure that our teachers are highly \ntrained for title I children. Senator Wellstone, we don't want to live \nby the standard that there should be high standards for these children. \nSenator Wellstone, we don't want to have to give special help to kids \nwho are falling behind.''\n  What are you afraid of? Why is there not support for this amendment? \nThis amendment, in a slightly fuller version, received about 45 votes \nlast time. I am hoping, now that I have sort of refined this amendment \nand narrowed the scope, that it will receive a majority vote. Because \nif this amendment does not pass, this piece of legislation, I want to \nsay to people in the country, this will not be a step forward. This \npiece of legislation is not a step forward for several reasons.\n  Let me just make one point that I made earlier as well, that right \nnow, with title I, we are spending about $8 billion a year, and \ndepending on who you listen to--whether it is the Congressional \nResearch Service or whether it is Rand Corporation--this program is \nseverely underfunded. In my State of Minnesota, when I meet with school \ndistrict officials, especially in our urban communities, they tell me, \n``Paul, what happens is we get money for schools with 65 or 75 percent \npoverty''--my amendment says schools with 75 percent poverty population \nshould have first priority; that passed; I am glad it did--``but then \nwe run out of money.''\n  If we are serious about helping these kids, we ought to be providing \nthe funding to our school districts so they can provide the support to \nthe children who are behind. Many of our schools all across the country \nscream at us and tell us: ``Because you haven't provided us with the \nresources, we can only help half the students,'' or a third of the \nstudents. So if we want to do something significant, we ought to \nprovide the funding.\n  What we certainly should not do is turn our backs to what was so \nimportant about title I as a part of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. What was so important about title I--this is a big \nFederal program; this is a Federal program that matters to K-12. What \nwas so important was, we knew way back in 1965 and we know today that \nwe as a National Government, we have a responsibility to make sure \nthere are certain standards which apply to the education that poor \nchildren receive, and so we made sure there were certain standards, \ncertain core requirements, which would be part of accountability. We \nwould say that every school district in the land and every school in \nthe land which was serving title I children would never be able to \nviolate these core requirements. That is what we as a Congress were \ndoing for poor children. We were for school districts having \nflexibility. We are for school districts having flexibility.\n\n  However, this piece of legislation strips away the most important \naccountability feature to title I. This piece of legislation does not \nany longer give these children the protection. This piece of \nlegislation, therefore, in its present form, is not a step forward, it \nis a great leap backward. I am surprised there is not more opposition.\n  I know it is called Ed-Flex. Great title. I know everybody can say \nthis is what the Governors want and we just sort of give all the \ndecisionmaking power to the States. Politically, it seems to be a \nwinning argument. Maybe I am the only one in the U.S. Senate who feels \nthis way. I am for flexibility and I am for some of these other \namendments that deal with smaller class size and rebuilding crumbling \nschools, and I am for spending a lot more money on education for \nchildren that comes out of the President's budget, that is for sure. \nBut as a U.S. Senator, I will not be on the floor of the U.S. Senate \nand not speak against a piece of legislation which strips away some \ncore protection for poor children that makes sure these children also \nget a decent education, and that the title I program which deals with \nthese children meets these core requirements.\n\n[[Page S2487]]\n\n  For any other Senator to say this amendment guts Ed-Flex troubles me, \nbecause I think if everybody thought Ed-Flex was such a good bill, they \nwould want to at least make sure we had this elementary, basic \nprotection for these children. How can we pass this piece of \nlegislation without this accountability?\n  This amendment improves this legislation, Senator Jeffords. This \namendment makes it a better bill. Without this amendment, we don't have \nthis protection for some of the children in this country. I will oppose \nit even if I am the only vote in opposition.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I reserve the remainder of my time, assuming that my \ncolleague on the other side who disagreed may want to make some \narguments.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I believe I was asked a question. I \nwould be happy to answer. I prefer that the Senator finish his \npresentation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will, although I say, in the spirit \nof debate, it would probably be better if I had a chance to get some \nsense of why there is opposition to this amendment. Then I could maybe \nrespond to that and we could have a little more of a give-and-take \ndiscussion.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I will wait until the Senator finishes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. SESSIONS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Well, Mr. President, I have an amendment that is \nsimilar to the amendment colleagues voted on last time. I have tried to \nmeet some of the objections that were made to that amendment. It now is \nbased literally on sections 114(b) and 115(c) of title I of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. It is the same language \nwhich deals with the core requirements of title I and makes it clear \nthat we want to make sure no State is allowed to give any school \ndistrict an exemption from these core requirements.\n  Again, let me just list these requirements:\n  To provide opportunities for all children to meet challenging \nachievement levels--the Senator from New Mexico is on the floor, and I \nwill bet he would not object to that.\n  To use effective instructional strategies that give primary \nconsideration to providing extended learning time like an extended \nschool year, before- and after-school, and summer programs;\n  To use learning approaches that meet the needs of historically \nunderserved populations, including girls and women;\n  To address the needs of all children, but particularly the needs of \nchildren who are members of the target population through a number of \nmeans, including counseling, mentoring, college guidance, and school-\nto-work services;\n  To provide instruction by highly qualified professional staff;\n  To minimize removing children from the regular classroom during \nregular school hours;\n  To provide professional development for teachers and teaching \nassistants to enable all children in the school to meet State student \nperformance standards.\n  I listed the basic requirements on the program as well.\n  I am thinking out loud while I am speaking. Let me try to figure this \nout. The Chair is a lawyer, and maybe I should be a lawyer at this \nmoment. But it seems to me that this doesn't do any damage to the idea \nof flexibility. It seems to me that anybody who would argue that this \nsomehow damages Ed-Flexibility, or any State or school district that \nmakes that argument, must have in mind that they want to waive these \ncore requirements. If they want to waive these core requirements--and \nwe are now about to pass a piece of legislation that will enable them \nto do so--that is what is flawed in this legislation. That is the flaw \nin this piece of legislation. That is the problem.\n  There is a reason we made these core requirements part of title I, \nwhich has been such an important program to low-income children. The \nreason, I say to the Chair, is that while many school districts in many \nStates have done a great job--and I have seen great work done in \nMinnesota--the fact of the matter is that sometimes these children fall \nbetween the cracks. Sometimes these children's parents, or parent, are \nthe ones without the prestige and clout in the community. Therefore, we \nwant to make sure there is some protection for these children. We want \nto make sure they receive instruction from highly qualified teachers. \nWe want to make sure that if they fall behind, they get some help. We \nwant to make sure they are asked to meet high standards.\n\n  I hope somebody is watching this debate. Why in the world is this \namendment unacceptable? Why is this amendment unacceptable? Because, I \nam telling you, if what Ed-Flex is all about is to sort of say, on the \npart of the Federal Government, we are giving up on this core \naccountability and, State school districts, you do whatever you want, \nyou don't have to worry about meeting these core requirements that deal \nwith low-income children, I am against it. Do you know something? A lot \nof Senators should be against it.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope we can go over 50 votes today, and I hope \nthis amendment will pass. If it does, I think it will make this Ed-Flex \nbill a much better piece of legislation.\n  There is one other thing we should do: Fund it. Fund it. I would say \nthat in all the discussions I have had with people--I hope all of my \ncolleagues have visited schools with title I communities in urban and \nrural communities. I will tell you, I have heard little discussion \nabout how ``we don't have enough flexibility.'' I have heard a lot of \ndiscussion about not having adequate funds. Fund it.\n  Fully fund title I. Then we would be doing something to help these \nchildren. Fully fund Head Start, and then we would be doing something \nto help the children. Fully fund pre-K, preschool, early childhood \ndevelopment, and make child care affordable for families. Then we would \nbe really doing something to help these children. Lower class sizes. \nNow we are helping these children. Make sure we do something to help \nchildren who drop out so that they don't drop out. I say to Senator \nBingaman, I was told by a judge in Minnesota that there is a higher \ncorrelation between high school dropouts and incarceration than between \ncigarette smoking and lung cancer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will soon yield the floor.\n  I hope there are 100 votes for my amendment, because then I will \nbelieve the Ed-Flex bill is a good piece of legislation. Without this \namendment, you don't have the accountability. You have given up on the \nFederal role of protecting poor children. That is a huge mistake.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, what is the state of the business in the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 63 To Amendment No. 31\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for school dropout prevention, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Reid, Mr. Levin, Mr. Bryan, and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 63 to Amendment No. 31.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, before I start, let me just indicate my \nsupport for the amendment that the Senator from Minnesota is offering. \nI agree with him. I favor the Ed-Flex bill, and I intend to vote for \nthe Ed-Flex bill. I also, though, believe we need to be sure the funds \nwe provide at the Federal level get to the students who most need those \nfunds, and to the programs that will benefit disadvantaged students. So \nI favor that amendment.\n  The amendment I have sent to the desk here and that I will speak on \nright now relates to what I consider perhaps the most severe problem \nfacing the\n\n[[Page S2488]]\n\neducational system in this country today--at least in my State, and I \nbelieve throughout the country--and that is the problem that too many \nof our students are leaving school before they graduate from high \nschool.\n  For an awful long time, this was a problem that people sort of \nignored, and education policy wonks here in Washington and around the \ncountry essentially looked the other way and talked about other aspects \nof the educational issue. But more and more I have come to believe that \nthis amendment I am offering on behalf of myself and Senators Reid, \nLevin, Bryan, and Boxer deals with a crucial issue for our young people \nand for our educational system. We can deal with the dropout problem. \nWe can provide assistance to States and local school districts that \nwant to reduce the dropout rate, and we can do that at the same time we \nare adequately funding special education. We can do it at the same time \nwe are providing this additional flexibility in the Ed-Flex, which is \nwhat the Ed-Flex bill calls for.\n  Last week, when I offered the amendment, it was plain that there was \nsome sort of contest between the proposal to adequately fund dropout \nprevention and the needs of special education. I do not see that as the \ncase. That is a false choice. There is no rule and there is no \nlimitation or requirement on those of us in the Senate to deal with one \nand not the other. We can deal with both of these issues. I favor \ndealing with both of these issues. Special education is extremely \nimportant. In order to address this, I put a couple of provisions in \nthe amendment that I just sent to the desk. Two key provisions relate \nto special education.\n\n  The first says that there is a sense of the Senate that there is a \ngreat need to increase funding for special education. I support doing \nthat. And the amendment makes it very clear that that is what we intend \nto it.\n  A second provision I have added says that any funds that are \nappropriated for dropout prevention above the $150 million annual \namount that is called for in this bill shall go to special education \nrather than to this dropout prevention need.\n  So it is not an either/or decision. And I don't think we should see \nit that way.\n  This legislation on dropout prevention was offered last year. It was \nadopted here in the Senate by a vote of 74 to 26. Its main provisions \nare very well known to the Members of the Senate. Let me just go \nthrough them.\n  There are five main provisions. First, it provides better \ncoordination and streamlining of existing Federal programs which serve \nat-risk students. We have several programs intended to serve at-risk \nstudents. This bill would try to bring those together and coordinate \nthem.\n  Second, it sets out a national plan to address the dropout crisis \nthat exists at the State, local and national levels.\n  Third, there is $150 million authorized in grants to schools with \nhigh dropout rates in each State.\n  Fourth, there is a requirement for uniform dropout data to be \nprovided so that parents will know where the problem exists most \nseverely, and for policymakers to have that information so that we can \nmake good decisions.\n  Finally, it calls for what we designated here as a ``dropout czar,'' \nor a person who will have a full-time job working in the Department of \nEducation to try to work with local school districts and States to deal \nwith this issue. We ought to have at least one person in the Department \nof Education who comes to work every day with the responsibility of \ntrying to help solve this problem. That is not too much to ask in a \ncountry of our size.\n  So that is what the bill tries to do.\n  The problem is serious. It warrants our attention.\n  Since we have been debating this bill, there have been over 20,000 \nyoung people drop out of our schools. There are over 3,000 young people \nwho drop out of our high schools and our middle schools before \ngraduation each schoolday. So the problem is severe. There have been \nover 400,000 students who have dropped out since last April when we \nlast approved this amendment here in the Senate. These new dropouts \njoin a large pool of unemployed, most of them unemployed adults who \nlack high school degrees.\n  We have a serious problem here. I think many Senators and many people \nin this country would be shocked to know the extent of this problem. \nLet me give you some figures that came out of ``Education Week'' \nrecently. According to ``Education Week,'' which is a very respected \npublication that does good research on education-related issues, \naccording to their study, there are 30- to 50-percent dropout rates \nreported over the 4-year high school period in communities around this \ncountry.\n  Let me give you some specific statistics which they reported.\n  In Cincinnati, ``Education Week'' claims that 57 percent of students \nin Cincinnati's high schools do not complete high school, who drop out \nbefore the completion of high school; in Philadelphia, 54 percent; Salt \nLake City, 39 percent.\n  Everybody, at least in my part of the country, in the Southwest, \nlooks to Utah, and says: ``Oh, they have a better educational system \nthan we do in New Mexico, and they always do everything right in \nUtah.'' The truth is that 39 percent of their students don't complete \nhigh school--in Salt Lake City, not in Utah, but in Salt Lake City--47 \npercent in Oklahoma City; in Dallas, according to ``Education Week,'' \n61 percent of students do not complete high school.\n  I hope that Senators will come to the Senate floor and contradict \nthese statistics and tell me that this is crazy, that they do not agree \nwith these statistics. I hope they can do that, because, in fact, I \nfind these statistics to be very startling.\n  But I know for a fact that in my State the percentage of people not \ncompleting high school is very high. It is particularly high among \nHispanic students in my State. We have a great many Hispanic students \nin my State, and way too many of them leave school before they complete \nhigh school and middle school. There currently is no Federal program \nthat is intended to help solve this problem.\n  We have a TRIO Program. People point to the TRIO Program. It is an \nUpward Bound Program. But less than 5 percent of the eligible students \nparticipate in those programs.\n  There is a program just now getting started called GEAR UP. This is \nfor middle school mentoring. The unfortunate thing about this is that \nit doesn't reach ninth or tenth graders. That is where the problem \nreally occurs most severely.\n  Then title I--title I, unfortunately, does not usually get any funds \nto the high school level. Most of the title I funding goes to \nelementary schools where the need is great. But what I am talking about \nis middle school and high school. And those schools see very little \ntitle I funding.\n  One of the main reasons this bill is needed is to restore some \nbalance to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which, at \npresent, is heavily weighted toward the younger grades. I favor the \nassistance to the early grades, but I believe we need to do something \nat the middle school and high school levels as well.\n  A lot of what needs to be done is reforming our high schools. Our \nhigh schools are too big. That is where the dropout problem is most \nsevere. You get a 2,500-student high school, and, frankly, it is too \nanonymous. Too many of the young people come to that school; nobody \nknows whether they come in the morning or not. I have talked to high \nschools in my State, the large high schools, and I ask, ``What do you \ndo if a student doesn't come to school?'' They say, ``After 3 days of \nthem not coming to school, we send them a letter. We send a letter to \ntheir home address and ask them why they are not coming to school and \ncomplain to the parents.'' Well, the reality is you need a more \npersonalized response and a more immediate and effective response when \nstudents start dropping out of school. This legislation can help us \naccomplish that.\n  United States graduation rates are falling behind other \nindustrialized countries. When the Governors met and President Bush met \nin Charlottesville in 1989 and set the National Education Goals, the \nsecond goal was that we want to have at least 90 percent of our \nstudents complete high school and graduate from high school. The \nreality is we have made virtually no progress towards achieving that \ngoal since 1989. We are now in 1999, and we have made\n\n[[Page S2489]]\n\nvirtually no progress. Clearly, we need to deal with this issue.\n\n  Some have said: ``Well, let's put it off. Let's deal with it later on \nin this Congress. This is a 2-year Congress. We are going to eventually \nget around to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nreauthorization. We can deal with it then, maybe not this year. But \nsurely next year we will get around to it. So just relax. We will get \naround to it.'' I believe we have a crisis with our high school dropout \nrates, and I believe we need to deal with it now.\n  There is no logical reason why we can't do the Ed-Flex bill, which I \nsupport, and do whatever this Senate wants to do with regard to special \neducation, and do something to assist local schools in dealing with the \ndropout problem. We can do all three of these things.\n  As our former President, Lyndon Johnson, was famous for saying, ``We \ncan walk and chew gum at the same time'' here in the U.S. Senate. This \nis not too much for us to take on.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I hope we get the \nsame kind of strong vote this time that we got in the last Congress--at \nleast have the 74 votes that we got in the last Congress. I hope we can \nget even a stronger vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 hour 57 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nprevious agreement with respect to the Ed-Flex bill be modified to \nallow 1 hour of the 5-hour debate limitation to be used on Thursday \nprior to the vote with respect to the pending amendment, and, further, \nthat hour of reserved time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at this time I would just like to make \nsome brief comments on the amendments which have been presented by the \nminority. I would like to again reiterate for my colleagues that the \nprocess we are going into was an agreement reached in order to move \nthis bill along. This bill, which is known as the Ed-Flex bill, is \nrelatively noncontroversial. I think the only vote in opposition in \ncommittee, and may well be in the Chamber, was by Senator Wellstone. \nBut we are in the process to move this bill along, to move it along \nwith the House bill, which I believe was passed, or will be passed \ntoday in order to get it into law in time so that States may have a \nmaximum benefit from its passage. It is a bill with which all 50 \nGovernors agree, a bill with which the President agrees, and the \nDepartment of Education has been sending the guidelines out for its \nutilization. All of this is ongoing.\n  However--and it is understandable--the minority has a desire to be \nable to put amendments on the bill because they feel strongly that \nthese initiatives ought to be put into law. However, as chairman of the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I must say that we \nare in the process now of reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. That act is where most of these amendments should be. \nSome of them are perhaps relevant. For example, part of the Wellstone \namendment is relevant to the Ed-Flex bill.\n  If we are going to assure that the committee system works--where \nevidence is presented at hearings, where we have people from the local \nschools all the way up to the States' Department of Education testify, \nwhere we can be absolutely sure of what we are doing in this incredibly \nimportant bill, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which has \nsome $50 billion in Federal dollars, I believe it should not be done in \nthis kind of ad hoc process of attaching amendments. Well-intentioned \nas the amendments may be, some of which I would agree to, some of which \nI have even offered in the past, we can not offer them in a way that \ndoes not make sense when you are trying to be more effective with the \nexpenditure of Federal funds.\n  There is $50 billion included, and yet, as I mentioned earlier, over \nthe last 15 years, ever since we understood we had some serious \nproblems in education in this country, we have seen absolutely no \nmeasurable improvement in the test results of our young people.\n  That is an intolerable situation. It does not make any sense to \nreauthorize a bill, which has obviously not had much impact on \nimproving education in this country, without holding hearings or before \nfully examining it.\n  I am put in the very difficult position of having to allow these \namendments to be presented in order to move the bill along, and then I \nwill be the one to have to move to table. A motion to table means you \ndo not allow the amendment to be voted on, and I will do this because \nthe amendment should be offered when the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act is before us. But, my move to table will give the \npolitical argument that I killed all these amendments. I am just trying \nto help this country's education system improve and not to do it in \nthis ad hoc, messy way.\n  Therefore, I must oppose the amendment offered by my colleague from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein. I have long advocated that we, as a Nation, \nneed to address, head on, the issue of social promotion. In fact, we \nmade some progress in this area last Congress. Funds made available for \ntitle II of the Higher Education Act, teacher quality enhancement \ngrants, may be used by States to develop and implement efforts to \naddress the problem of social promotion and prepare teachers to \neffectively address the issues raised by ending the practice of social \npromotion.\n  ``Social promotion'' is a term which educators know, but I am not \nsure everyone does. It simply means that we sort of gave up on young \npeople saying, well, it is not really that important that they know how \nto read because there are jobs that you can get without having to read.\n  That situation has changed. We are going into the next century, and \nwe know that unless a child has an excellent education when they \ngraduate, they are not going to be able to get a good job. The literacy \nstudies show that 51 percent--this is an incredible statistic--of the \nyoung people who graduated from high school, when measured for their \nperformance, were functionally illiterate. We have to stop that. Ending \nsocial promotion is what that is all about.\n  However, the amendment by Senators Feinstein and Dorgan is one I will \nreluctantly have to move to table, in order to make sure that we can \nmove on in an orderly process on the ESEA reauthorization.\n  The other amendment, by Senators Bingaman and Reid on school \ndropouts, is in a similar situation. We all know that we have to do \nsomething about school dropouts. We know that the so-called forgotten \nhalf in our educational system for years has been ignored, and when \nthey get to sixth, seventh, and eighth grades they do not see any \nrelevance to education in their lives. Everybody is pushing: You have \nto go to college; You have to go to college. And now we know there are \nmany high-paying, skilled jobs that young people can get, and that \nyoung people would have the ability for if they had the proper \nschooling efforts in order to learn those skills that are necessary.\n  And so we have to accommodate that. We have to make sure that the \nyoung people in the sixth and seventh grades understand that if they do \nthings to get the education, they will be able to get a good job.\n  There has been a tremendous move in that direction in some States. In \nMississippi, with one of the worst records in the sense of educational \nperformance, they are spending millions of dollars making sure that \nyoung people start looking at careers in the sixth grade so that they \nknow there is a relevancy to the education and they won't drop out. It \nis very important. But it should be considered on the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, which is now before the committee,\n\n[[Page S2491]]\n\nand on which we are holding hearings. I certainly agree with Senator \nBingaman in what he is doing.\n  There is another amendment that has to do with report cards that we \nhave listened to, and that is fine, as well. But that is an issue for \nthe States to address, not for the Federal Government to mandate.\n  In many cases, the States are ahead of us in addressing the quality \nof their schools. Mr. President, 36 States already require report \ncards. We need to also remember that funding for education is primarily \na State and local responsibility. So, again, that is another good \napproach, but it is something we should do in the orderly committee \nfunction.\n  Senator Wellstone has amendments. I have to say at least one of them \nis relevant to the underlying act. He is on the committee. He had an \nopportunity to offer it, but did not. Under the present situation, Ed-\nFlex demands accountability of States that are participating. It is \nimportant to keep in mind that accountability has been part of Ed-Flex \nsince its inception, and the managers' package builds on those strong \naccountability provisions. So, again, this one could have been offered \nin committee. He chose not to offer it in committee, so I must oppose \nthat one as well.\n  Mr. President, I again want to put everyone on notice that I have the \nresponsibility to protect the ability of this committee to work in an \norderly fashion. Because of that, I will have the unpleasant duty of \nprobably moving to table these amendments when they come up, or to \noppose them.\n  I would like to also refer to the Boxer amendment. This is another \none that is very familiar to me. The 21st Century Community Learning \nCenters is a program that I created back in 1994 as part of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. I fought hard to include this \nprogram in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and was \nsuccessful, in spite of opposition from the very same administration. \nGetting the program funded was not easy in the face of the \nadministration's opposition to this program. In fact, the \nadministration proposed rescinding the fiscal year 1995 funding for the \n21st Century Community Learning Centers. All of a sudden, the \nadministration woke up and said: Hey, Republicans sometimes have a good \nidea. It is an amazing thing for this administration to recognize. But \nanyway, all of a sudden they put $750,000 into the program--I am sorry \nthey asked to rescind it at another time.\n  More recently, the administration decided that they now like this \nprogram, and in fiscal year 1997 they recommended $15 million for this \nprogram. Now they are increasing it even more. So, obviously, I am a \ngreat friend of that one. It was a bill I got passed back in 1994 in \nthe last reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  I have enormous interest in changes to any of this legislation, \ncertainly changes as dramatic as proposed by this amendment. This \namendment almost completely rewrites the 21st Century Community \nLearning Centers. It changes its purpose, use of funds, and other \naspects of the legislation. Last year, the administration, through the \ncompetitive grants process, substantially changed the focus and, \nindeed, the very nature of it by rewriting regulations. That was an \nunfortunate matter. Overnight, an act to expand the use of existing \nschool facilities became an afterschool program--retracted it.\n  All these other things are just as valuable. Certainly I understand \nthe desires of Senator Boxer to work on that bill. We will have plenty \nof opportunity. She will have all the opportunity she wants when the \nbill comes out of the committee later this year.\n  So, I could go on and on. But right now I again want to reiterate, in \norder to get this bill through we have been forced to go into this kind \nof amendment process, which some will say gives them the opportunity to \ndo something constructive, knowing full well at the end of the day they \non the other side of the aisle will not prevail because they do not \nhave the votes. Fortunately, I believe my colleagues in the Senate, at \nleast the majority of them, will say: Yes, let's use the orderly \nprocess, the one this institution was designed to utilize, in passing \nout legislation, passing out bills. And the process of offering \namendments should be done first in the committee where they can have a \ngood review after hearings and then secondly done on the floor.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to \ndiscuss my support for the Education Flexibility Partnership Act or Ed-\nFlex as it has become known. Ed-Flex provides much needed relief to the \nschools of 12 states currently included in a demonstration project \nbegun in 1994. Like many of my colleagues, I believe it is time to give \nthis relief to the other 38 states who suffer from government over-\nregulation.\n  In preparation for each new school year, teachers and school \nadministrators throughout the country face the challenge of providing \nthe highest level of education with a limited amount of resources. This \nhas always been the case and will remain the true for generations to \ncome. I know this from personal experience. My wife was an educator in \nthe Tulsa Public School District for many years and both of my \ndaughters are current teachers. In my conversations with them, I have \nseen first hand the problems associated with bureaucratic mandates \nhanded down from Washington.\n  Let me give you an example of what I am talking about. Over the last \nthree decades, the Federal Government has piled on mountains of \nbureaucratic redtape on local school districts. Between 1960 and 1990, \nthe average percentage of school budgets devoted to classroom \ninstruction declined from 61% in 1960 to 46% in 1990. The most \nsignificant reason for this decline is traced to the explosion of \nadministrators and non-teaching support staff while the overall number \nof teachers has reduced. One primary reason for the growth in \nadministrative personnel is the growth in regulations, both state and \nFederal.\n  Let me show you just one example of how this is evidenced in \nOklahoma. In my hometown of Tulsa, the Tulsa Public Schools have \napproximately 42,600 students. In order to provide quality education to \nthose 42,600 students, there are approximately 225 administrative staff \nemployed by the Tulsa Public Schools system. Now, I realize that some \nof these are essential managerial and administrative staff, however, \nhow many are doing nothing more than trying to keep Tulsa schools' in \ncompliance with Federal regulations? How many of those staff could be \nbetter utilized in classrooms across the district instead of spending \ntheir time dedicated to paperwork? And, this is just one example of one \npublic school system in my state. The problem is the same in every \nsingle school system.\n  Mr. President, it is clear, the more people and resources it requires \nto comply with government regulations, the fewer people and resources \ndedicated to teaching our children.\n  Each time we create a new Federal program, with it comes numerous \nforms and reports. The schools must understand, complete these forms \nand reports and submit to the appropriate departments within the \nappropriate agencies, by the appropriate deadlines. Whether schools use \nteachers and administrators, or support staff and volunteering parents, \nto fulfill this obligation, valuable time and resources are used for \nWashington's paperwork, not student education.\n  Let me illustrate this point further. Currently, the Federal \nGovernment provides approximately 7% of overall school funding. \nHowever, Federal paperwork accounts for upwards of 50% of all school \npaperwork. It is estimated that completing this paperwork requires \nabout 49 million hours each year. Mr. President, that is the equivalent \nof 25,000 employees working full time for an entire year. According to \none expert, it is estimated that it takes six times as many employees \nto administer a Federal education dollar as it does to administer one \nstate education dollar. Again, these people are not teaching or \neducating our children, but completing bureaucratic red tape.\n\n  Earlier, I discussed the number of administrative positions in the \nTulsa Public Schools; but the problem is more pronounced in the state \nas a whole. There are approximately 5,950 administrative and other \ncertified staff performing non-teaching duties in Oklahoma. Those 5,590 \npeople represent\n\n[[Page S2492]]\n\nabout 10% of the total public school personnel. That is 10% doing \nsomething other than teaching children. That concerns me greatly. I \nhave to wonder whether we are using our resources in the best way \npossible to meet the educational needs of our children.\n  Now, some of my colleagues, and the President, believe that we need \nthe Federal Government to hire an additional 100,000 teachers in order \nto reduce class size around the country. However, I have to wonder if \nthat is really the answer to the problem. As I have just demonstrated, \nwe have too many professional and certified staff in my state that are \nnot educating children. Instead, they busy themselves attempting to \ncomply with government regulations. If we can unburden school districts \nof cumbersome regulation, the local districts can shift some of their \nresources back to educating our children. If the Federal Government \ndoes require the states to hire additional teachers, it will simply be \none more mandate handed down from Washington for the states to comply \nwith once the dedicated Federal funds expire. You can be sure that if \nthere are additional Federal mandates there will be additional non-\nteaching certified staff required to administer the program and that \nmeans another professional staff member not in the classroom teaching \nour children.\n  As the bureaucratic mandates from Washington have increased, states \nneeded a way to gain some flexibility to address their individual \nconcerns. Our answer to the states was the Education Flexibility \nPartnership Demonstration Act of 1994, an effort I was proud to support \nwhile I was in the House of Representatives. First authorized in 1994 \nfor six states, and expanded in 1996 for six additional states, Ed-Flex \nhas given 12 state legislatures the freedom to identify the most \nefficient and effective means possible to meet the needs of students \nand schools in their states. Under Ed-Flex, the Department of Education \ngives to states and local districts the authority to waive certain \nFederal requirements that interfere with state and local efforts to \nimprove education. In exchange for this flexibility, the state and \nlocal districts must agree to comply with certain federal core \nprinciples and agree to waive its own state regulations. The states \nmust also agree to use the affected federal funds for their original \npurpose.\n  Mr. President, I think it says something about the nature of our \ncurrent bureaucracy that we have to give states the power to waive \nFederal regulations. If there were fewer onerous regulations in the \nfirst place, we would not have to pass legislation to give states the \npower to ignore federal regulations. Wouldn't it make more sense to let \nthe states be responsible for the education of our children, not \nbureaucrats in Washington?\n  In my State of Oklahoma, we have great diversity in our education \nneeds. We have schools of all kinds; urban schools, rural schools, \ninner city schools, and suburban schools. In my conversations with \neducators and administrators, I hear them tell unique stories about the \nchallenges they face in trying to educate their students. All of these \neducators tell different stories. However, not surprisingly, almost to \na person, they tell me of the problems they have in complying with \ngovernment regulations. It does not come as a surprise to me that the \neducation challenges presented at urban schools like Tulsa McClain High \nSchool differ widely from the needs of smaller rural schools like \nWeatherford High School. Yet, they all have to comply with the same \nFederal regulations. Given the failings of the public schools today, it \nis little surprise that the cookie-cutter approach of the Federal \nGovernment has been a disaster.\n  The time has come to move beyond a one-size-fits-all Federal approach \nin educating our children. As I look around our country, I see the \ngreat successes that our Governors are having in making progress in \neducation reform. I am continually amazed at the policy innovations \ngoing on in State legislatures all over the country with regard to \neducation. However, now, it is the Federal Government's responsibility \nto join with those Governors and give them more flexibility to continue \nto innovate and improve our public schools. I understand the need for \naccountability. However, I believe accountability is best when it \nclosest to home and vested in Governors, State legislators, and local \nschool board officials than with faceless Federal bureaucrats in \nWashington. State leaders understand this. That is why groups like the \nNational Governor's Association and the National Conference of State \nLegislators have endorsed this legislation.\n  As I have watched and listened to the debate on Ed-Flex, I have been \nsurprised by many amendments offered by some of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle. Many of the proposed amendments seem \ncounterproductive to the central purpose of Ed-Flex. Ed-Flex is about \neasing government mandates and regulations. However, many of the \namendments we have debated would add to the mountain of Federal \nmandates applied to State and local school districts. As much as I hate \nto say this, it appears that many of my colleagues would rather have a \npolitical issue than have meaningful education reform.\n  Mr. President, the results Ed-Flex prove the effectiveness of the \ndemonstration program. Whether it is giving local districts the \nresources to provide one-on-one reading tutoring or lower the teacher \nto student ratios in classrooms, Ed-Flex has been a tremendous success. \nThese are all things we can agree upon. Based on its proven track \nrecord, the time has come to expand Ed-Flex to the rest of the country. \nWe need to continue to identify programs that work and expand them, \nwhile eliminating the programs that are ineffective.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to thank Senators Frist and Wyden \nfor their leadership on this issue. Their efforts prove that we can \nwork together to the benefit of our children when it comes to educating \nour children. As the Senate proceeds with the reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act later this year, I look forward \nto working with them to continue to progress we have begun here today.\n  Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to discuss my views on \nEd-Flex and I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, for the convenience of all Members, I \nwould like to let them know that, as far as I know, at least on the \nmajority side of the aisle, there are no speakers desiring to come to \nthe floor. I put them on notice that if I do not hear from them within \n10 minutes, we may end up drawing the session to a close. As far as the \nother side of the aisle, I also inform them. I believe we have notified \nthe minority that if they have no further speakers, we would appreciate \nknowing that. If we hear from no one within 10 minutes, we will presume \nthey have no further people to be heard and then yield the remainder of \nthe time back so that tomorrow we can start on schedule.\n  I also notify Senators that the order of the amendments tomorrow will \nbe the order that was originally delineated and not as they may have \nbeen presented, so that Senators will know exactly when their \namendments will be coming before us.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be charged equally to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to share a few remarks. I \nhave had the pleasure to be able to preside over this body for the last \nhour and hear some excellent remarks from Senators who are concerned \nabout education. I thought, as we heard some\n\n[[Page S2493]]\n\ngood remarks from one of our brother Senators about an amendment to \ndeal with the dropout rate, that this is how we have gotten where we \nare today in large part.\n  The remarks were good. I personally am concerned about the dropout \nrate. I have been involved in youth programs in my hometown of Mobile, \nAL. We had a meeting with the police and the school boards on how to \ndeal with truancy, dropout problems, and what we could do to confront \nthat. That is happening, I suspect, all over America right now. Some \nschools have good dropout programs, others do not.\n  The question was, are these numbers--showing 50 percent in many \nschools dropping out before graduating--are they accurate? I am not \nsure that they are, frankly. We questioned that in our community, \nbecause sometimes when people transfer from one school to another, they \nare counted as a dropout. But we do have higher dropouts than we need. \nAnd good school systems are identifying them at the earliest possible \ntime in dealing with them.\n  But I thought to myself as it was suggested--this amendment would \nsuggest and mandate that we have a dropout czar in America--so this \nU.S. Senate now is going to take it upon itself to have a czar to deal \nwith dropout problems. And that will be the 789th--if I am correct in \nmy numbers--Federal program Congress would have adopted and that is now \nin effect, all to be added to a bill called Ed-Flex that is suppose to \ngive more flexibility to the school systems, to allow them to use the \nresources we are sending to them now effectively to deal with the \nproblems as they know they exist and they would like to deal with them.\n  Yes, I wish I could wave a wand and create a program that would \ninstantly eliminate the dropout problem in America. I would be tempted, \nas all of us are, to think we could appoint a czar in Washington who \nwould stop the dropout problem. But I really do not think it is going \nto happen.\n  What we have to do is strengthen our school systems in the classroom, \nwhere teaching occurs, making those schools more friendly, more \nmotivating, more interesting, more challenging, educating the young \npeople who are there, because really the only thing that counts is that \nmagic moment in a classroom when the learning occurs between teachers \nand pupils.\n  One of the Senators said our problem is schools are too big. Well, I \nguess next we will have a czar to set the sizes of schools in America. \nMy daughters both graduated from a large high school in Mobile, AL. \nBill Bennett came down and gave them an award as one of the best high \nschools in America--racially balanced--a big high school, Murphy High \nSchool, an outstanding high school. It is a large school. All large \nschools are not bad. In fact, our dog was named Murphy, named after the \nhigh school. We loved that school. My wife and I participated in the \nPTA and were most interested in what went on there.\n  When I graduated, my senior class had 30 members. It was a public \nhigh school. The one who finished third in my class of 30 is now dean \nat the University of Alabama. And I finished below her. And the one who \nfinished two below me--seventh--graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy.\n\n  I do not think we need in this body to be saying what the sizes of \nschools ought to be and how school systems ought to run their programs. \nWe need to help them in every way we can and to eliminate this problem, \nas I noted earlier today, where a system like Montgomery, AL, spends, \naccording to the letter I got, $860,000 to comply with Federal \nregulations. The Federal Government gives 8 percent of the funding and \nover 50 percent of the regulations.\n  So our chairman, Senator Jeffords, has presented a commonsense, \nreasonable, modest step toward allowing local school systems to \npetition for the right to have flexibility in how many of these \ngovernmental programs are ordered. That is so rational, it makes so \nmuch sense, and it in fact was proven effective in the welfare reform \nbill. That is all we are talking about.\n  There is no doubt Senator Jeffords will conduct hearings on any of \nthese matters. He will take testimony and receive it and consider \nmatters to deal with truancy, matters to deal with drug problems, \nmatters to deal with special education. We want to deal with that. But \nthat will come up in the education bill that will come along later.\n  This bill needs to remain a clean bill designed to create flexibility \nfor our school systems in America. That is what it ought to be. We \nought not to allow it to be clogged up with every Senator's view of \nwhat would be wonderful if they just ran schools in America, because \nthat is how we have gotten in this fix. That is what we are trying to \nmake some progress toward completing.\n  I care about education. I care about public education. I taught. My \nwife has taught. Our children have participated in public education. We \nwant to make it better. But I am not at all persuaded that the Members \nof this body have studied the problems of the Mobile, AL, or Vermont \nschool systems. They have not studied those problems. They do not know \nhow to fix them. They read a study somewhere that says something, and \nthey feel obligated to come down here and present the next program, the \n789th program, Federal Government mandate, to fix it. Then they can go \nback home and say, ``I fixed truancy, I fixed dropout problems,'' or \nwhatever.\n  I just say to my colleagues that this is not the way to do it. We \nhave elected school board presidents, school board members. We have \nsuperintendents of education. We have principals. We have teachers. \nThey know our children's names. We need to put as much power and as \nmuch money into the hands of the people who know our children's names \nas we possibly can. If they do not care about our children, we need to \nmake sure we have someone there who does. But I submit to you they do \ncare about them. They are better trained than we are in education. They \nare seeing kids every day in their classrooms. They know what \nfacilities are in existence. Do they need more teachers? Do they need \nmore classrooms? Do they need more computers? Let them decide \nthat. That is what we should do; give them the flexibility to make the \ndecisions needed.\n\n  I think we will find, if we pass this bill, that instead of just the \n12 States indicated in the chart from the GAO report this past \nNovember--the GAO studied this Ed-Flex bill that gave 12 States the \nright to have more flexibility in their educational programs. They \nconcluded that they have used their authority well, the flexibility \ngiven to them, and that the waiver authority has been used carefully \nand judiciously.\n  Why would we expect otherwise? Why would we expect that the people we \nhave elected and hired to take care of our children, who know our \nchildren's names, are not going to use freedom and financial support \nfrom Washington carefully and expeditiously? I feel very strongly about \nthis.\n  I see the Senator from Arkansas has come to the floor. I will be \nanxious to hear his remarks, because he has served on this committee, \nthat I have just joined this January, for the past 2 years. He is \npassionately concerned about improving education. He has a bill that I \nam proud to support--Dollars to the Classroom. That bill goes much \nfurther than this Ed-Flex bill. I believe it would be a historic step \ntoward empowering our local education system to get out from under \nFederal regulations and be able to focus entirely on educating our \nchildren, get that money and authority to the classroom where it can be \nused wisely.\n  I thank the Chair for the time and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the \nremarks of the Senator from Alabama and thank him for his kind remarks \nconcerning the Dollars to the Classroom proposal. I look forward to \nworking with him on the committee.\n  I am dismayed that a bill that has the kind of bipartisan support--\nsupport in this Chamber, support across the country among educators, \nsupport among our Nation's Governors--would have been held up as long \nas this has been held up and would have had the kind of amendments, \nmany of them worthy of debate but that would have been far more germane \nto the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which, as the chairman \nhas said, will be debated and will be marked up in committee later this \nyear. I think it is\n\n[[Page S2494]]\n\nunfortunate that we have had all of these amendments filed.\n  As Senator Sessions said, I have a bill, that I feel very strongly \nabout, that would go further than Ed-Flex. I have resisted offering \nthat as an amendment. We could have brought that to the floor. We could \nhave offered that to the Ed-Flex bill. However, it is important that \nthis piece of legislation move forward uncluttered, clean, with the \nsupport of both parties, and be presented to the President for his \nsignature.\n  I want to especially address in the next few minutes one of those \namendments which has been offered, an amendment that sounds so good: \nThe 100,000 teachers funded at the Federal level over the next 7 years. \nI think it is kind of a cotton candy amendment: It looks good, it is \nsweet, it tastes good, but it is not very filling, it is not very \nsatisfying, and it is not very good for you. The 100,000 teachers--when \nyou say that at first blush to the average American, that sounds very, \nvery appealing, but I think when you look in greater depth and you look \nmore closely at what that amendment would do, then, I think in fact it \nis not worthy of our support.\n  We have already decreased class size across this country. At the same \ntime we have seen a dramatic reduction in class size across the United \nStates, we have not seen a comparable improvement in achievement. \nBetween 1955 and 1997, over 42 years, school class size has dropped in \nthe United States from 27.4 students per classroom to about 17 students \nper classroom, according to the National Center for Education \nStatistics--a very dramatic drop, from 27 to 17. At the same time, the \nnumber of teachers has grown at a faster rate than the number of \nstudents. This chart illustrates that very clearly. We see a very \ndramatic increase in the number of teachers and the student ratio \ndecreasing appreciably.\n\n  While public school enrollment has decreased in Arkansas, in my home \nState, going from the broad international statistic to what it looks \nlike in Arkansas, we have seen our public school enrollment drop \nslightly, by 1.3 percent, during the last quarter century. The number \nof teachers during that same period of time has dramatically increased \nin Arkansas, from 17,407 in 1965 to 29,574 in 1997. Now, that \nrepresents a 70-percent increase in teachers in the State of Arkansas. \nAt the same time, we saw a slight decrease in the number of students in \nour public schools. What that represents is a very dramatic improvement \nin classroom size. We have smaller classes, we have more teachers \nteaching those classes, but studies have shown that unless the class is \nvery, very large to begin with, modest reductions in the size of the \nclass do not correlate with gains in student performance.\n  Here is the point: Effective teachers can generally handle, studies \nindicate, an ordinary class of 19 students as easily as they can handle \na class of 14 students.\n  I want teachers to have smaller classes. I think that is a desirable \ngoal. It is a goal that is being achieved in States all across this \ncountry. But I do not believe it is something we should mandate from \nWashington, DC, nor fund from Washington, DC. Senator Sessions said it \nbetter than I can: I don't believe we need the 100 Members of the U.S. \nSenate to become some kind of super school board making those kinds of \ndecisions as to what schools need most.\n  At the same time teacher-student ratio has dropped in Arkansas from \n21.9, almost 22, in every class in 1970, to 17 per class in 1995, \nstudent achievement has failed to show a measurable increase during \nthat same time period. I want to say that again: We have seen classes \ndrop from about 22 per class to 17 per class over the last 25 years in \nArkansas. It has dropped more dramatically nationally, but in Arkansas \nwe have seen it drop from 22 to 17. We have not seen student \nachievement show comparable improvement during the time that classes \ngot smaller.\n  Now, the initiative that has been presented by Senator Kennedy, the \namendment offered by Senator Kennedy and Senator Murray, is expensive \nindeed, and there is no demonstrable evidence that for what we will be \npaying for this new program, we will see a corresponding improvement in \nacademic performance. If enacted, the President's teacher initiative \nwill provide enough money to hire only 361 additional teachers in the \nentire State of Arkansas in the first 2 years. All of the hoopla, all \nof the excitement about the 100,000 new teachers--which sounds like \nsuch a dramatic number--over the next 2 years in the entire State of \nArkansas, it means 361 additional teachers.\n  Now, we have in Arkansas 314 school districts. Many have argued we \nneed fewer. Perhaps that is true; perhaps we need to consolidate some. \nBut we have 314 school districts. We are going to receive 361 new \nteachers. That is 1.15 new teachers per school district. If we want to \nbreak that down a little more, it amounts to about half a teacher per \nelementary school. Since the focus of the amendment and the initiative \nis supposed to be grades 1 through 3, when you calculate that, it means \n.18 new teachers.\n  Here we have that clearly outlined: In the State of Arkansas, 1.15 \nnew teachers per school district; a half a teacher per elementary \nschool; or .18 new teachers for each grade 1 through 3.\n  It is simply not enough of a commitment if that is what we are trying \nto do, it is not enough of a commitment on reducing class size, to make \nan appreciable difference in Arkansas or the Nation. If this initiative \nwere carried out for the full 7 years, Arkansas would be able to hire \nonly 939 new teachers for the whole State over the whole 7-year period. \nThat equals 3 new teachers per school district, or 1.4 teachers per \nelementary school, or half a teacher in grades 1 through 3, to do the \nwhole program for the whole 7 years. For such an expensive proposal, I \nbelieve Americans expect more results than that.\n  This will do little to actually reduce the student-teacher ratio when \nthere is only one new teacher in an entire school district, which is \nthe result we would have under this initiative.\n  Lisa Graham Keegan, one of the most innovative directors of public \ninstruction in the country, superintendent of public instruction for \nthe State of Arizona states:\n\n       In the first year of the President's new program, Arizona \n     will receive more than $17 million. $17 million is a lot of \n     money; what do we get for that kind of investment? At $30,000 \n     per year--a good, but not great wage--we can pay for a little \n     over 500 new teachers, as the program asks. In Arizona, that \n     comes to a bit under 2 teachers per school district. Not per \n     school, but per school district.\n\n  They would average two new teachers per school district in the State \nof Arizona. Not every school district--and I think this is so \nimportant--finds that their greatest need is having more teachers or \nsmaller classes. Many school districts do not need more teachers. They \nmay need more books or more computers. Maybe they just need better-\ntrained teachers. A one-size-fits-all approach is not what States and \nschool districts need or want.\n  Again quoting Lisa Graham Keegan, she states:\n\n       President Clinton made it abundantly clear that he had \n     decided that smaller class sizes are a good thing, even \n     though research has provided no clear indicators of the \n     impact that class size has on a child's ability to learn. \n     Nevertheless, because class size had been a good thing in \n     some of the classrooms the President had visited, then \n     smaller class sizes had to be a good thing for every \n     classroom in America.\n\n  Well, that is a pretty strong allegation. But I think it is accurate \non the basis of effectively anecdotal evidence. The President concluded \nthis sounds good, looks good, this is appealing, and this was going to \nbe his education initiative: 100,000 new teachers, paid for by the \nFederal Government, without having the research to demonstrate that, in \nfact, it correlates to better academic performance.\n  This program requires that the money be used for new teachers. Yet, \nmany States have already implemented class size reduction programs on \ntheir own. At least 25 States, including California, Florida, Nevada, \nTennessee, Wisconsin, Virginia, and Maryland, have either tried a class \nsize reduction program or are currently considering a class size \nreduction program.\n  What about the 25 States that, on their own, many times at the \nexpense of their constituents and their school patrons, have \nimplemented their own class size reduction programs? What about those \nwho are ahead of the curve\n\n[[Page S2495]]\n\nand have sought to address this at the local level? Are we now going to \nsay we are imposing this upon you, that you have to hire these new \nteachers if you want the benefit of this Federal program?\n  In his testimony before the Senate Health and Education Committee, on \nFebruary 23, Michigan Governor John Engler said this. I know our \nPresiding Officer, the Senator from Michigan, will concur with this. \nGovernor Engler has been one of the most creative and innovative \nGovernors both in the area of welfare--pushing welfare reform a number \nof years ago and seeing a tremendous revolution in the welfare system \nin Michigan--and he has now been pushing hard for greater flexibility \nfor the schools in Michigan and the schools across this country. He \nsaid in his testimony before our committee:\n\n       Many Governors feel so strongly that the bureaucracy is the \n     problem that we cannot imagine being unable to improve \n     education with greater funding flexibility.\n\n  He didn't say send us more money. He might not turn that down, I \ndon't know; but he didn't say that was the greater need. He said the \nproblem is the bureaucracy. Give us greater flexibility and we will \nimprove education.\n\n  Governor Ridge of Pennsylvania said in his testimony before our \ncommittee:\n\n       We all care about teacher competency, social promotion and \n     class size and many other things, yet, we must recognize that \n     the States themselves are designing programs that meet their \n     unique needs.\n\n  The States themselves are designing programs. Once again, it is a \nmatter of trust. Who are we to conclude in the U.S. Senate that we can \nbe trusted to know what is best for local schools in Michigan, \nArkansas, Vermont, and Washington State, but the Governors don't, the \nschool superintendents don't, or that the local elected school boards \ncan't be trusted? I think that is a misconception and an insult to \nthose local leaders who care as much about the welfare and the \neducation of children as we do here in the Senate.\n  Reducing class size simply does not necessarily mean we are going to \nhave improved performance. It does not deliver the results. States \nperforming exceptionally well on achievement tests do not have an \nextraordinarily high number of teachers per student. For example, the \nState of Minnesota ranked third in the 1996 NAEP test scores for eighth \ngrade mathematics. They ranked third on the NAEP test in eighth grade \nmath. They rank 42nd in students per teacher.\n  If lowering class size were the panacea, then Minnesota, I think, \nwould have a hard time explaining why they rank third in the Nation in \neighth grade math and 42nd in class size. There simply is no clear \ncorrelation. Without the research, without the hearings, without the \nevidence, why would we want to pass it? Is it because, like cotton \ncandy, it looks good and sweet?\n  On the other hand, schools that have a low student/teacher ratio do \nnot necessarily have a high achievement score. Example: The District of \nColumbia has the lowest number of students per teacher--13.7--of any \nState or Federal jurisdiction. It is 13.7. Yet, it ranked 41st in its \n1996 NAEP test scores for eighth grade math. In contrast, we have \nMinnesota. I know there are a lot of factors that can be involved, but \nthat tells me there is not a clear correlation between class size and \nacademic performance.\n  Eric Hanushek, an economics and public policy professor at the \nUniversity of Rochester, maintains that teacher quality ``has 20 times \nthe impact of class size. Teacher quality just swamps all the evidence \nwe have on class size. If I had a choice between a large class with a \ngood teacher and a small class with a lousy one, I'd take the large \nclass any day.''\n  The teacher quality is far more critical in ensuring the quality of \nthe education of our children than the student/teacher ratio, the class \nsize.\n  I remember, vaguely, when I was in the second grade we had too many \nsecond graders; we had 37. And so the superintendent decided we were \ngoing to take 7 of the second graders--me being one of them--and put \nthem in a joint class with second and third grade. Mrs. Hare was the \nteacher. Some of the parents expressed concern that we were going to \nhave a combined class because the class was too big. But we had an \nextraordinary teacher, a quality teacher, in a combined class of 7 from \none grade and 20 from another grade. But it worked. It worked not \nbecause the class size was perfect, or because the student/teacher \nratio was perfect, but because, as Senator Sessions referred to it, the \nmagic of learning in a classroom was taking place. We had a quality \nteacher who cared about the kids and instilled in us students a desire \nto learn. That is what we can do about education--improve the quality \nof teachers in the classroom, not some feel-good measure of hiring \n100,000 teachers, whether that be the need or not.\n  Mr. President, about 1,100 studies have been made of class size. Out \nof those 1,100, only a very small few made any link at all between \nsmall classes and improved achievement. The research and the evidence \nis simply not there.\n  The proponents of this measure keep mentioning that we need to \nfulfill the promise made last fall in the omnibus appropriations bill, \nwhich funded the Class Size Reduction Program, at a price tag of $1.2 \nbillion.\n  What I would ask is this: What happens at the end of the 7 years when \nthis authorization expires? We then have a new mandate that must be \nfunded, or the States and localities will bear the burden of continuing \nthe program which we started. Hiring 100,000 new teachers with the \nspending schedule to expire at the end of 7 years will result in one of \ntwo things: Either a new heavier tax burden upon our States in trying \nto pay for these teacher salaries, or a permanent entitlement \nestablished at the Federal level, and another step in nationalizing \neducation control in this country.\n  What happens with new Federal education programs? Once in place, they \ngrow. They grow. Year after year, they grow. And this will become a new \nprescriptive program that places more regulations on the localities and \nfurther contributes to a Federal oversight of what should be and has \nalways been a local issue.\n  Some Members have been talking about the urgency with which we must \nenact class size legislation. But, before we create a new Federal \nprogram, shouldn't we, I ask my colleagues, fully fund the mandates \nthat Congress has already placed on school districts?\n  Every time I meet with parents, teachers, principals and local school \nboard members from across Arkansas, they have one common theme and one \ncommon complaint. And it is this: Senator Hutchinson, please fully fund \nspecial education.\n  When we placed that mandate upon the schools, we made a commitment \nand a pledge that we were going to provide 40 percent of the funding of \nthat mandate at the Federal level. Now, before we have even gotten \nclose to meeting that commitment, we start a host of new programs, \nincluding the initiative to hire 100,000 new teachers.\n  During the 1995-1996 school year, 53,880 students in Arkansas were \nserved under IDEA. That is about 12 percent of all students in the \nState served under IDEA special education.\n  Funding for special education affects all schools and all school \ndistricts. It is not a problem limited to Little Rock, or Rogers, AR, \nor to the State of Arkansas. Every State has to deal with this critical \nfunding problem.\n  We are failing to miss a critical point: If we provide more funding \nfor special education, then schools will have more money available to \nhire more teachers, create afterschool programs, or build new schools, \nwhatever the need is at the local level.\n  If we would, rather than funding 100,000 new teachers ``one size fits \nall'', whether that is the need at the local level or not, if we would \ninstead take that funding, place it in IDEA special education funding, \nit then would allow the local school districts to determine with the \nresources that are now free where the greatest need is--computers, \nbooks, tutors, or even school construction. But the decisions would be \nmade locally.\n  In 1975, Congress first mandated a free appropriate public education \nfor school-age children with disabilities. We have, Mr. President, not \nfulfilled the responsibility to which we committed.\n  The formula for providing grants to States is authorized at 40 \npercent, the national average per-pupil expenditure. Congress has never \nprovided more than 12\\1/2\\ percent of IDEA funding, and that\n\n[[Page S2496]]\n\nwas back in 1979, 20 years ago. For fiscal year 1999, allocations to \nStates represented only 11.7 percent of average per-pupil expenditures. \nSchools get only 11 percent of the funding, but 100 percent of the \nFederal mandates, and what an expensive mandate it is.\n  This shortfall in funding does not just affect special education \nstudents. Because schools are mandated by Federal law to provide a free \nand an appropriate public education, they must provide these services.\n  As Fort Smith public schools superintendent, Dr. Benny Gooden, wrote \nin a letter last week--one of our outstanding superintendents in Fort \nSmith, AR, who writes regularly about the burden that IDEA places upon \nlocal resources:\n\n       For almost 25 years, local elementary and secondary schools \n     and their governing boards of education have attempted to \n     deliver essential educational services to children with \n     disabilities under these Federal guidelines. During this time \n     period, the costs associated with providing these services \n     have escalated dramatically, while the level of Federal \n     support has never approached the promised 40 percent of \n     applicable costs which accompanied the initial passage of the \n     legislation.\n\n  While providing an education to disabled students is necessary and \ndesirable, we must recognize the effect of imposing unfunded mandates \non our school districts.\n  The more that we fail to pay our fair share of the cost of educating \ndisabled students, the more we force local school districts to take \nmoney away from other programs to fulfill their duty to special \neducation students.\n  With all of the talk about the importance of enacting class size \nreduction programs now when school districts are working on their \nbudgets, it is important to fully fund IDEA and allow school districts \nto free up more money for other uses.\n  The costs for educating a special education student can be 5 to 10 \ntimes the district average.\n  In addition, as we all are aware, the U.S. Supreme Court recently \nruled that the related services provision in IDEA includes medical \nservices. This is going to dramatically increase this figure even more.\n  Whether this was the intent of Congress or not, we made a commitment \nto fund 40 percent of IDEA costs. And we simply have not kept our \npromise.\n  How can we in good conscience make more promises? We are going to \ngive you 100,000 new teachers across this Nation. In Arkansas, it is \nabout one per school district. How can we think of making more promises \nwhen we have not fulfilled the ones we already made to them in regard \nto special education? We are imposing an undue burden on school \ndistricts. And, if school districts had to spend less money on special \neducation, they could use the available funds in the way they see fit. \nIf that is entirely for teachers, so be it. If it means professional \ndevelopment, so be it. If it means buying new computers, we ought to \nlet those local districts make those decisions.\n\n  I see Senator Coverdell, who has been one of the great leaders on \neducational reform in meeting our Republican vision for education, and \nI have spoken quite a while on this at this point.\n  I hope my colleagues know how strongly I feel about this. This is an \nimportant bill. It is an important step that we are taking.\n  Senator Jeffords did an outstanding job. I can't say enough about the \nleadership of Senator Frist on this. We need not clutter this bill with \namendments. We certainly don't need to start a new mandate on our \nschools. I hope that we will pass the bill quickly, pass a clean bill \nand send it to the President.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I think we are down to two speakers. We \nhave agreed that Senator Coverdell will speak for 5 minutes, and then I \nbelieve Senator Baucus will speak for about 6 or 7 minutes.\n  I want to commend the Senator from Arkansas for his very eloquent \ndiscussion of the differences on how money ought to be spent. I \nappreciate him coming and sharing those with us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the \nremarks of the Senator from Arkansas. His eloquent statement delineates \nwhat is at stake here. I will expand upon it just briefly. As Senator \nJeffords said, I will limit this to 5 minutes.\n  I would like to make three points with regard to what we will begin \nvoting on tomorrow.\n  First, I want to make it very clear that from my perspective the \namendment suggests that we should have a Federal program that envisions \n100,000 Federal teachers, which is a bad idea. It is just not a good \nidea.\n  Mr. President, it envisions, or it suggests, that some Washington \nwizard wonk has some better idea about what ought to happen in \nArkansas, Georgia and your State of Michigan. I just have to suggest \nthat most of those wonks have never been to any of these locations. \nThey have no idea--none--as to what that school board requires or \nneeds. Some will require teachers. Some will require transportation. \nSome require construction. Some require a playground. And every \nAmerican in the country knows that the needs of all of these school \ndistricts all across the Nation are all different. The Senator from \nMassachusetts would have us believe there is only one requirement, that \nonly Washington knows what it is, and you are going to do it our way, \nthe old Frank Sinatra song.\n  You are going to fill out this zillion-page application, and you are \ngoing to do it our way.\n  I suggest that if most Americans had a chance to evaluate whether the \nwonk from Washington should do it or the local school board should do \nit, they are going to go with the local school board.\n  That takes me to my second point. This idea that Washington is going \nto do it after you fill out the 15-20 page application is going to lead \nto systems that have not met their responsibilities being weighted to \nthe advantage of this program. It will tend to reward those who have \nnot yet done the job they were supposed to do. If you talk to the \nGovernors of the States, many, including mine, have already expanded \ntheir numbers of teachers to reduce class size--all across the country, \nTexas, California, to Georgia. So a system that has one solution is \nonly going to be weighted to those school districts that didn't do \nanything about it. True, maybe they need some assistance because they \nhad a harder time meeting that standard, but mark my word, you will \ntend to reward systems that have not stepped up to the bar with this \nkind of program.\n  My third point. The fact that Washington bureaucrats, guided by the \nadministration, are going to decide who is a winner and who is a loser \nsuggests that it is going to be politically correct, that political \ncorrectness will suddenly weigh in on this. If you look at the record \nof decisionmaking about who the winners and losers are during the \ncourse of these last 6 years, it will substantiate the assertion I \nmake. In department after department, agency after agency, the town is \naswirl with politics getting in the way of policy. A program that picks \nwinners and losers in Washington is already susceptible to it but \nparticularly so now.\n  So the point that the Senator from Arkansas made that we should fully \nfund our previous commitments, which will have the effect of freeing up \nfunds in local school districts all across the country to make their \nown decisions about what their priorities are, is a better idea; it is \na better idea than having a bureaucrat who has never been on the scene, \ncould not name one school superintendent, one school board member, or \neven the name of the communities to be affected, deciding what the \npriorities are all across the country. It makes no sense. It is a bad \nidea. It should be defeated so that we can proceed with this \nlegislation that has been endorsed by 50 Governors. And I might point \nout those 50 Governors have not endorsed the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, I thank the manager for granting me this time, and I \nyield back whatever of the 5 minutes might remain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will yield time as he may consume to \nthe Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair. I thank my good friend, the Senator \nfrom Vermont, for yielding time.\n\n[[Page S2497]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am very strongly in favor of the Education \nFlexibility Partnership Act. That is very simply because if there is \nany investment that makes sense in this country, it is investing in \neducation, pure and simple, full stop, end of subject.\n  At all levels--whether it is Head Start, whether it is the early \nyears zero to 3, whether it is after Head Start, whether it is \nkindergarten, whether it is elementary and secondary, whether it is \ncollege, whether it is postgraduate education, whether it is continuing \neducation, whether it is technical skills development--education is the \ninvestment which is going to make the difference in our country and \nassure our future as Americans, the time we spend continuing to educate \nour people in a very thoughtful, constructive way. Of course, we do not \nwant to just throw money at the problem but, rather, we want to invest \nwisely; and this legislation, S. 280, is very much, in my judgment, a \nstep in that direction.\n\n  Let me address Ed-Flex, that is, the basic underlying bill, and tell \nyou why I am so proud to be a cosponsor of the bill and why I think it \nis important legislation.\n  The name of the bill basically explains it--Ed-Flex. It is \nflexibility for educational programs, and particularly at home. It is \nvery simple. The Federal Government, I believe, ought to trust parents, \ntrust teachers, and trust local school boards. We should do everything \nin our power here in Washington to liberate our children from Federal \nGovernment rules that might make sense in Manhattan, NY, but perhaps do \nnot make sense in Manhattan, MT.\n  I was a little surprised at the previous speaker, my good friend from \nGeorgia, saying an amendment on this bill is Washington wizard wonk \nstuff telling local governments what to do. That is just not true. This \nis Ed-Flex. It is giving more flexibility to local communities to \ndecide more on their own what makes most sense. For example, let's talk \na little bit about computers. Right now, for example, a well meaning \nbut distant Federal bureaucracy does too often stand in the way of a \nschool district.\n  For example, let's talk about Federal funds allowed to a small \nMontana school, or even a large New York City school, to purchase \ncomputers for students with disabilities. We know those computers \nprobably will not be used all day long, that is, computers, mandated by \nWashington, for students with disabilities. It obviously makes sense \nthat these computers should be utilized to help other students when the \ndisabled students do not need them. But there is a rule, a Washington \nrule, that prevents this from happening, preventing other students from \nusing those computers.\n  That is the point of this bill, more flexibility. Under Ed-Flex, the \nunderlying bill, States can get a waiver to use these computers to \neducate our kids. In short, the bill makes eminent sense. It is the \nnext logical step to help our kids be better educated.\n  Let me address an amendment that has been under discussion, the \namendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, and \nthe Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, an amendment to lower class \nsize in our country.\n  This is pretty basic stuff. There aren't many things we can do to \nhelp students more than lowering class size. I hear some Senators in \nthe Chamber say the opposite; they at least are very strongly implying \nthat lower class size does not help kids, does not help the quality of \neducation.\n  If we just think about it intuitively, Mr. President, that just \ndoesn't make sense. But what is the evidence? One Senator recently \nmentioned Minnesota, a State that ranked third in recent national test \nscores but apparently, according to the Senator, has high average class \nsizes.\n  I cannot speak about Minnesota, but I can speak about my State of \nMontana. Our teacher-to-student ratio is much lower than the national \naverage, but we are very proud of the quality of education in our \nState. Montana's fourth graders and eighth graders placed among the top \nfour States in three of the four categories, again, with class sizes \nthat are lower than average. I can tell you from at least my experience \nyears ago going to Montana schools that we had smaller classes, and it \nmade a big difference. I have very vivid memories of very good teachers \nin classes that were not too large.\n  I also want to relate an experience that is not directly relevant to \nthis discussion, but I think it does have some bearing on the basic \nunderlying point.\n  Mr. President, like a good number of other Senators, I have what I \ncall a ``workday.'' About 1 day a month I work at some different job. I \nmight wait tables, work at a sawmill, work in a mine. I show up at 8 in \nthe morning with my sack lunch and I am there to work. I am not there \nto watch, I am there to work. My good friend, Senator Graham from \nFlorida, has been doing this for many, many years. Frankly, I got the \nidea from him about 6, 8, or 10 years ago. It is a great idea and it is \none of the best parts about this job, frankly--to be able to do things \nlike that.\n  One day on my workday in Helena, MT, I was assigned to a health care \ncenter. In the morning I helped an Alzheimer's patient. This patient \nwas obviously in great need of care and I learned a lot, I must say, \nabout the problem of Alzheimer's disease--both for the person who has \nit and with respect to the care giver.\n  But in the noon hour, for 2 hours the center assigned me to the Meals \non Wheels Program. They gave me a little van loaded up with hot lunches \nand a list of names and told me which part of town to go to, to drive \naround and deliver these meals. This is the basic hot lunch program. \nAbout the second or third name on the list was a name that seemed \nfamiliar. It rang a bell; I wasn't sure what. It was Mrs. Foote.\n  I asked myself: Why is that familiar, that name, Mrs. Foote? I didn't \nthink a lot about it. I knocked on the door and the lady said come in. \nShe opened up the door, and way back in this hot little kitchen, \nsitting at the kitchen table, was a lady. Then it dawned on me.\n  I said, ``Mrs. Foote, by any chance did you ever teach \nkindergarten?''\n  She said, ``Why, yes, I did.''\n  I said, ``Did you teach kindergarten in the basement of the First \nChristian Church, at the corner of Power Street and Benton Street?''\n  ``Why, yes, I did.''\n  That was my kindergarten teacher, whom I had not seen since \nkindergarten.\n  Why did I have such a strong memory of Mrs. Foote? One, I do vaguely \nrecall, I must say we didn't have a large class. I must be honest and \nsay I don't remember much about that. I do remember Mrs. Foote being a \nsuper teacher. She didn't remember me from Adam, as I must confess, but \nas I was talking to Mrs. Foote she then pulled out some newspaper \narticles about her.\n  I then realized why in many respects Mrs. Foote meant so much to me. \nMrs. Foote had a master's degree in art history, she had a master's \ndegree in English literature, yet she was teaching kindergarten. She \nwas one of these wonderful Americans who was sacrificing her time to be \na teacher, a high-quality teacher, and also a teacher, as I recall, who \ndid not have an awful lot of kids in her class.\n  Not too long ago, in fact about a half-hour ago, I heard a Senator \nhere on the floor saying, ``Gee, you give me a choice between a high-\nquality teacher and a large class size and I'll make the choice every \ntime for the quality teacher.'' Obviously, that is a false choice. That \nis not what we are talking about here. We want high-quality teachers. \nBut we also want small class sizes, because smaller classes--all things \nbeing equal--do help provide a better education.\n  This amendment, the Murray-Kennedy amendment, is an additional sum of \nmoney for teachers. We in Montana will get about $4 to $5 million. In \naddition, the amendment has a 15-percent provision, which is that 15 \npercent of the funds can be used to train teachers. It gives that \nadditional flexibility.\n\n  I must say, this is a no-brainer, to me. I just don't know why school \ndistricts and teachers and parents would not like to have a little \nextra help, some extra help to hire a few more teachers, a little extra \nhelp to train a few more teachers. That is all this is. This is not \nrearranging the categories, the boxes. This is not taking money from \none program to give to another. This is an add-on. This is additional.\n\n[[Page S2498]]\n\n  So I hope some of the viewers and listeners--who earlier heard other \nSenators speak--realize this is not Washington telling State and local \ndistrict school boards what to do. Rather, it is saying: Here is some \nadditional money for some teachers, for some training, because we want \nto help you. We want to form a partnership with you to make sure our \nkids get the best quality education they could possibly get. That is \nall it is. It is that simple.\n  I strongly urge when we do vote on this tomorrow that the amendment \npass. I know the bill is going to pass. It is a very important step we \nwill be taking to help invest in our Nation's future.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 60, As Modified, To Amendment No. 31\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have a modification at the desk for \namendment No. 60, which I offer on behalf of Senator Lott.\n  I ask unanimous consent the amendment be modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 60, as modified, to amendment No. 31), is as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  IDEA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that if part B of the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Act (20 USC 1411 et seq.) were \n     fully funded, local educational agencies and schools would \n     have the flexibility in their budgets to design class size \n     reduction programs, or any other programs deemed appropriate \n     by the local educational agencies and schools that best \n     address their unique community needs and improve student \n     performance.\n       (b) Amendment.--Section 307 of the Department of Education \n     Appropriations Act, 1999, is amended by adding after \n     subsection (g) the following:\n       ``(h) Notwithstanding subsections (b)(2), and (c) through \n     (g), a local educational agency may use funds received under \n     this section to carry out activities under part B of the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411 \n     et seq.) in accordance with the requirements of such part.''.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent to add as cosponsors to \namendment No. 60, as modified, Senators Gregg, Collins, Frist, and \nSessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present and ask the time be charged equally to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first I wish to compliment my colleague \nand friend, Senator Jeffords, for his leadership on this bill. I am \nconfident that tomorrow we will pass this bill.\n  Also, I wish to compliment Senator Frist and others on the Labor \nCommittee who have worked very, very hard to put together a good \npackage, a responsible package, to allow the States to have more \nflexibility in dealing with Federal education programs so they can \ndeliver a better product, and that is basically improving the education \nof our kids. That is a very noble goal.\n  By doing so, they are saying we want to set up a program, which we \nhave already done in a pilot program in a few States, and make it \navailable to all States. All State Governors, Democrats and \nRepublicans, say we want to have that flexibility, give us the ability \nto ask the Federal Government for a waiver from a lot of the rules and \nregulations in managing these programs so we can do a better job.\n  Frankly, they are telling us they can do a better job, without Uncle \nSam's rules and regulations, in trying to manage their schools. They \ndid not need so much Federal help. It is really what the States were \ntelling us.\n  Democrats as well as Republicans were saying that. I think they are \nexactly right in doing so. I compliment the sponsors of this \nlegislation, and I am going to be pleased tomorrow when we pass it.\n  Unfortunately, there are a few amendments that are circulating around \nthat I think would be very detrimental to this bill. As a matter of \nfact, I believe if they are adopted, we shouldn't pass this bill.\n  The main amendment I am going to address is the one that maybe has \nreceived more attention than others--the so-called 100,000 teachers \nthat Senator Kennedy, Senator Murray and others have been so laudatory \nabout, saying, ``This is exactly what we need to improve the quality of \neducation.''\n  A couple of comments: One, I think if schools need more teachers, the \nschools should be able to make that decision. That decision should not \nbe made in Washington, DC. When I say ``the schools,'' I am talking \nabout the school board administrators, the parents, the teachers, the \nlocal officials, the school board officials, the Governor. They should \nbe making that decision. I do not think that is Senator Kennedy's \ndecision to make. I do not think that is the U.S. Senate's decision to \nmake. Nor do I think it should be made by President Clinton. That is \nnot our responsibility. That is a State responsibility. That is a local \nresponsibility.\n  Frankly, the local government knows best what they can do to improve \neducation, not Washington, DC. It may be a school in the Northeast \nneeds more insulation because of the cold or maybe they need more \ncomputers, maybe they need a new building, maybe they need building \nrepair, maybe they need more teachers. I don't know. I wouldn't think \nthat we have the guts or the gall to say we know best, the government \nknows best, but when I look at Senator Kennedy's amendment, that is \nexactly what it says.\n  Here we have a national program. We are going to have 100,000 \nteachers. It is going to be paid for by the Federal Government. Keep in \nmind, almost all teachers, K through 12, are paid for by State and \nlocal governments, yet now we have an amendment on the floor of the \nSenate that says, We want 100,000 teachers at a cost of over $11 \nbillion, to be paid for by the Federal Government--100 percent paid for \nby the Federal Government. In some of the districts, the teachers will \nbe paid for 65 percent by the Federal Government and 35 percent by the \nState government.\n  It is interesting. I have asked, What is the impact? Somebody said \nthat we did part of this last year. We passed a bill last year that \ncost $1.2 billion, and we increased the number of teachers 30,000. Boy, \nthat has really done a wonderful job. I looked at my State. As part of \nthe bill that we passed last year, part of this 30,000 teachers, \nOklahoma is going to get 348. Big deal. For the life of me, I do not \nthink that is a Federal responsibility. Oklahoma is going to get $13 \nmillion to help pay for 348 teachers. Big deal. Is that really what the \nFederal Government is supposed to do? Is that our responsibility? I \ndon't think so. At least Republican amendments are saying, ``Instead of \nteachers, let's at least allow the States to have the option. If we are \ngoing to have Federal money, let's have the money go to give the \nschools the option for teachers or for meeting our responsibility with \nkids that have special needs, giving States the flexibility to use the \nmoney either for schools or students with special needs,'' which we \nalready have a Federal law stating the obligation for the States to do \nit, an unfunded mandate. So at least we give the States some \nflexibility. That is not in Senator Kennedy and Senator Murray's \namendment.\n  I am looking at this amendment. There are lots of things in here that \ndeal with regulations and how the money is going to be used, basically \ntelling the States here is how to do it; we know best. The Federal \nGovernment knows best. Senate Democrats know best. President Clinton \nknows best.\n  For the life of me, I just think that is a serious mistake--the \nFederal Government passing a bill last year that says Oklahoma gets 348 \nmore teachers paid for for 1 year. I might mention, if we don't pay for \nit next year, what happens to that Federal teacher? I hate to say it, \nbut we have 1,800 schools in the State of Oklahoma. We are going to get \n348 teachers. That is about one-fifth or one-sixth of a teacher for \neach school, not each class, each school. Does that really make sense? \nI don't think it makes any sense. Which school is going to get a \nteacher? Which school is not going to get a teacher?\n\n  I know my colleagues on the Democrat side have an amendment that says \nwe are going to have a Federal school building program, and the \nPresident proposed billions of dollars, I guess $11\n\n[[Page S2499]]\n\nbillion, for more teachers and several billion dollars for more school \nbuildings. Which school buildings are going to be replaced? Which \nschool building is going to be repaired? We are going to be making \nthose decisions in Washington, DC? Is that the proper use for \nincremental dollars? Do they get more bang in educational value out of \nbuildings or in teachers? We are saying we don't know. We are saying \nwhy don't we free up some of the resources that we are now spending \nfrom the Federal Government to the States and let the States make the \ndecision? Let the local school boards make the decision. Let the \nteachers make the decision. Let the parents make the decision.\n  Instead, my colleagues that are offering the amendment are saying, \nno, no, we will decide; the Federal Government is going to decide we \nneed 100,000 teachers. I disagree.\n  It is interesting. Somebody said, well, we really need lower class \nsize. For a little bit of history, most States have already been \nreducing the average sizes of their classes. That trend is expected to \ncontinue. My guess is that President Clinton feels, since he has \npromoted this, class size has really declined. In 1955, the average \npublic school class size in the United States was 27 students. In 1975, \nit dropped to 21. Today it is down to 17.3. If you are talking about \nonly elementary schools, the numbers are slightly higher, but they \nstill show a decline, from 30.2 in 1955 to 18.5 today, 18.5. ``Well, it \nought to go to 18.'' Well, it looks to me like demographically we are \ngoing to 18 anyway. That will happen whether the Federal Governments \ngets involved in hiring 100,000 teachers or not. We have spent $1.2 \nbillion last year to hire 30,000 teachers. That money is only good for \n1 year. Then under this bill, it says, well, let's spend more than \nthat. Let's just spend billions every year.\n  It has amounts allocated: $1.4 billion for the year 2000; $1.5 \nbillion for 2001; $1.7 billion for 2002, and on; I see $2.8 billion for \nthe year 2005. This says here is a recipe where we can have the Federal \nGovernment spending more money, and it stops at the year 2005. We are \ngoing to pay for these Federal teachers only up to the year 2005 and \nthen stop? Sorry, States, now it is your responsibility.\n  I just think that is a serious mistake. In my State of Oklahoma, I \ndon't know exactly the number of teachers that we have, but 348 \nteachers, when we have 1,800 schools and lots and lots of teachers in \neach school. I just fail to find the wisdom in doing it.\n  There is a difference in philosophy between the Democrats and \nRepublicans on this issue. We have basically said the States and local \nschool districts should make a better decision. Senator Kennedy and \nsome of my colleagues on the Democrat side seem to think that they have \nthe answer. They are going to dictate 100,000 teachers. They are going \nto dictate billions of dollars of the Federal Government building \nschool buildings. I think that is a mistake.\n  I had my staff--this is almost 2 years old, a year; it was done May \n15, 1997, so it is a little obsolete--I asked them, How many Federal \nprograms are involved in education right now? I know there are a lot, \nbut I don't know them all. I haven't served on the Labor and Education \nCommittee for a long time--I was on it for several years--but I know \nthere are a lot. As a matter of fact, there are a lot more than I \nimagined.\n  I will put this in the Record and maybe somebody can update it for \nme. According to this, in May of 1997, there were 788 Federal education \nprograms, 788 Federal education programs that were spending at that \npoint $968 billion. That is a lot of money. That is about one-\nseventeenth of all the Federal spending that we are spending today. \nSomeone can't say we do not have any emphasis in education. What we \nhave is a lot of Federal programs, probably 700-some, too many Federal \nprograms, and we are spending billions of dollars, almost $100 billion, \nprobably if this is updated it is over $100 billion, because I know we \nhad significant increases in the last couple of years in education. \nJust in the Department of Education alone, there were 307 education \nprograms, totaling $59 billion. Again, this is 1997.\n\n  So it shows you there is a lot of Federal input. I personally think \nwe need to consolidate most of those programs, get rid of them, and \ngive the money and the power back to the States and to the local school \nboards. What I think is, we do not need to have another program. ``Here \nare 100,000 teachers. Let's make this, instead of 788 programs, 789.'' \nI think President Clinton has proposed 8 or 9 new education programs \nalone.\n  We do not need more education programs. What we need to do is free \nthe States and local school boards to where they can do a better job \nwith the resources they now have without all the strings and redtape \nand bureaucracy they now have to comply with.\n  So I hope that will be what we will do. I hope that tomorrow when we \nare voting on this series of amendments, when we have amendments that \nare trying to micromanage how States spend money, run their schools, \nthat we will table those amendments, that we will defeat those \namendments, and we will pass the Ed-Flex bill which will give more \nflexibility to States and local school boards in actually administering \nFederal programs. They can do a better job in educating our kids, to \nimprove the quality of education for the children of America.\n  So I encourage my colleagues to vote against these amendments that \ntry to micromanage education from Washington, DC, and pass the Ed-Flex \nbill to give the flexibility to the States and to the local school \nboards to do a better job for our kids.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for an excellent \nstatement. He has certainly put in perspective what we are trying to do \nhere. We started out with a very simple bill, and now we have--well, we \nhave the monster pared down somewhat by getting agreements on both \nsides. But I just remind everyone that we will be voting tomorrow on \nthese amendments. There will be some debate time tomorrow morning for \nthat purpose.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield for just a second?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. One, I compliment Senator Jeffords for his management on \nthis bill. I am delighted we have an agreement and we will get it \ncompleted. I compliment him for his leadership in the Labor Committee \nin putting this bill together.

I thank my colleague.\n\n\n                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on Thursday evening, March 4 and Friday, \nMarch 5, I was necessarily absent because of several long-standing \ncommitments in Bismarck. It was important\n\n[[Page S2500]]\n\nthat I be in North Dakota for a conference I cosponsored, Women's \nHealth-Women's Lives, to join Secretary of Energy Richardson for \nmeetings on a range of energy issues, and for a meeting with the \nGovernor and other state leaders about the state's water resources.\n  Had I been present for rollcall vote No. 32, to table the Jeffords \namendment to S. 280, the Ed-Flex legislation, I would have voted \n``nay.'' On rollcall vote No. 33, to table the Gramm amendment to \nprohibit implementation of the ``Know Your Customer'' banking \nregulations, I would have voted ``nay'' had I been present.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, on Tuesday, March 9, 1999, I missed \nthe second cloture vote on S. 280, the Education Flexibility Act.\n  I fully intended to be in the chamber for the vote yesterday, and had \nI been there I would have voted against cloture. While I support the \nconcept of flexibility for education, I also believe that Democrats \ndeserve right to offer education amendments on key priorities such as \nreducing class-size, providing after-school care, addressing the \nconcern of crumbling schools, and a few other major priorities.\n  Senate Democrats have offered in good faith to accept time agreements \nand limited debates on our education priorities.\n  It is disappointing that instead of voting on education priorities \nfor American students, teachers, and parents, we are debating \nprocedural motions and closure petitions. Instead of using the time \nwisely to discuss the major education issues facing our schools, we are \nfacing gridlock on procedure. That is not what the American people sent \nus to the Senate to do. We are willing to have our debate and cast our \nvotes to reduce class sizes, to fix crumbling schools and to provide \nafter-school care for children that need it to learn and be safe while \nparents work. If our Democratic amendments prevail, we strengthen the \nEducation Flexibility Act and help schools. If our amendments do not \nget a majority, then we had the opportunity to debate and we can move \nforward on the underlying bipartisan legislation.\n  I wish I had been here on Tuesday to participate. Unfortunately, I \ngot trapped in Charleston, West Virginia when the Ronald Reagan \nNational Airport closed at 11 a.m. on March 9, 1999 due to the snow \nstorm in Washington, DC. I had been in Charleston, West Virginia to \nvote in the mayoral election and to participate in the United Airlines \nannouncement of two Mileage Plus Service Centers in my state which will \ncreate 600 new jobs. The new centers will be located in Charleston and \nHuntington. This is exciting news for my state, and I have been in \ntouch with officials for months about this economic opportunity. At the \ntime, I felt that I could personally vote in the local election, attend \nthis exciting announcement and return in plenty of time for the 2:45 \nvote on the Senate floor. Due to the snow storm, I missed the vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/10/senate-section/article/S2500-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I will use a little of the morning \nbusiness time myself to just bring everyone up to date as to where we \nare at this point. This concludes the debate time for today. Tomorrow \nthere will be, I believe, 1 hour evenly divided for Members to talk on \nthe amendment process.\n  The purpose of that time will be to try to make sure everybody \nunderstands the amendments, because we have a number of amendments. \nThey seem low in number--there are about eight or nine amendments--but \nsome of those are complicated by combinations of amendments. So I urge \nall of our Members to make sure that they understand the amendments.\n  Because this is an important piece of legislation, which I want to \nget through, and the leader does also, we will be using probably a \ntabling situation for many of the amendments. I want to explain why \nthat is. That is because most of these amendments should be on the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization which is being \nworked on at this time. That is a very important bill. It is a $15 \nbillion bill. It has most of the Federal programs. And we will be \nlooking at it very closely to determine whether there should be a \nparing down of programs, how effective the various agencies and \ndepartments have been, and we will be spending the time of deliberation \nto better utilize and to make sure we can maximize our improvement.\n  As I said earlier today, the evidence is very clear that we have made \nvery little improvement in our schools over the last 15 years, although \nwe have been trying. Thus, it is important we take a close look at the \nDepartment of Education to see that those funds are being well spent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/10/senate-section/article/S2500-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2500-S2502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PREVENTING HEARING LOSS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues an article that recently appeared in The Washington Post, \n``Hearing Loss Touches a Younger Generation.'' This article raises \nimportant issues related to hearing loss and gives us practical advice \nfor protecting our hearing.\n  Hearing loss affects approximately 28 million Americans and is \naffecting more of us at younger ages. Hearing difficulties among those \nages 45 to 64 increased 26 percent between 1971 and 1990, while those \nbetween ages 18 and 44 experienced a 17 percent increase.\n  About one third of the cases of hearing loss are caused, at least in \npart, by extreme or consistent exposure to high decibel noises. While \nthe Environmental Protection Agency has worked to decrease our exposure \nto loud noises at work, many Americans now face threats to optimal \nhearing during their leisure hours from loud music, lawn mowers and \noutdoor equipment, automobiles, airplanes and other sources. Too many \nAmericans simply are not aware of the devastating impact loud sounds \ncan have on their hearing.\n  At the encouragement of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the \nNational Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders \n(NIDCD) is leading a collaborative effort with the National Institute \non Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the National Institute on \nEnvironmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) to help improve awareness about \nnoise-induced hearing loss. It is my hope that this effort ultimately \nwill help reverse the trend toward increasing noise-induced hearing \nloss.\n  Health professionals, too, play an important role in the treatment \nand prevention of hearing loss. In particular, I'd like to highlight \nthe important work of audiologists in successfully combating and \ntreating hearing loss. Over the years I have been impressed by the \ncost-effective, quality care they provide, most notably demonstrated in \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs health care system, which has \nallowed veterans direct access to audiologists since 1992.\n  Through high standards of care by qualified health care professionals \nand through improved education about the dangers of hearing loss, I \nbelieve we can protect and improve the hearing of millions of \nAmericans. I ask unanimous consent that the attached article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n  Hearing Loss Touches a Younger Generation; With Rise in Noise, More \n                              Seeking Help\n\n                           (By Susan Levine)\n\n       Tomi Browne listens to people's ears. To how they hear and \n     what they don't. And for most of her 22 years as an \n     audiologist, her clients have been overwhelmingly older--\n     stereotypically so. Seniors pushing 70 or beyond. The \n     hearing-aid set.\n       But lately, surprisingly, Browne's contemporaries have been \n     showing up at her Northern Virginia office.\n       These are men and women in their forties to early fifties, \n     baby boomers. They confess that they strain to catch words in \n     crowded restaurants or meetings, or that the television \n     suddenly needs to be turned higher. Loud sounds really hurt \n     their ears, and maybe they've noticed an incessant buzzing.\n       Some walk out with the startling news that they've \n     permanently lost hearing. More\n\n[[Page S2501]]\n\n     than a few return to get fitted for hearing aids.\n       ``I'm seeing more of my classmates . . . as patients, \n     rather than them bringing in their parents,'' said Browne, \n     44. ``Sometimes they're even bringing in their teenage \n     kids.''\n       Other audiologists report the same sobering age shift, and \n     statistics are starting to corroborate the anecdotal \n     evidence. Data from the National Health Interview Survey \n     indicate that significantly more Americans are having \n     difficulties hearing. From 1971 to 1990, problems among those \n     ages 45 to 64 jumped 26 percent, while the 18 to 44 age group \n     reported a 17 percent increase.\n       California researchers found an even sharper rise in \n     hearing impairment among more than 5,000 men and women in \n     Alameda County, with rates of impairment for those in their \n     fifties increasing more than 150 percent from 1965 to 1994.\n       With people living longer than ever, ``This has to be \n     viewed as a very serious health and social problem,'' said \n     Sharon Fujikawa, president of the American Academy of \n     Audiology. ``It really behooves us to conserve our hearing as \n     much as possible or risk isolation.''\n       Marilyn Pena, a secretary from Germantown, was about 47 \n     years old when she first learned her hearing was deficient. \n     She ignored the diagnosis. Soon she also was ignoring her \n     alarm clock--because she couldn't hear its wake-up beep--and \n     resorting to lip reading at work. ``People at work would come \n     up and whisper in [my] ear because they didn't want others to \n     hear, and I couldn't hear, either,'' she said.\n       After seven years, pushed by frustrated friends, Pena \n     finally hooked a hearing aid behind her left ear. She no \n     longer guesses in vain at conversation or asks, ``What?'' \n     countless times a day. ``Since I started wearing it, I'm much \n     more observant. It's amazing how many people wear them.''\n       Worrisome changes also are taking place among children and \n     teenagers, who are growing up with rock concerts far more \n     deafening than those the Woodstock generation attended, along \n     with the mega-volumes of everything from video arcades to \n     boomboxes. A study published last year in the Journal of the \n     American Medical Association showed that nearly 15 percent of \n     children ages 6 to 19 tested suffered some hearing deficit in \n     either low or high frequencies. Other research has identified \n     pronounced differences among high-schoolers compared with \n     previous decades.\n       The main culprit, many suspect, is noise--not just the \n     noise blaring from the headsets that seem permanently \n     attached to teenagers but the noise from their parents' \n     surround-sound stereos, which can rival small recording \n     studios. Add the barrage to moviegoers' ears during flicks \n     such as ``Armageddon'' and ``Godzilla'' (prompting enough \n     complaints that the National Association of Theater Owners \n     convened a task force), and the blast from leaf blowers, \n     mowers, personal watercraft, power tools, even vacuum \n     cleaners.\n       Technological advances they may be--powerful conveniences \n     for daily life--but they produce decibel levels that can \n     prove downright dangerous to the ears over time.\n       ``We've grown up in a sort of turned-on, switched-on \n     society,'' said Carole Rogin, president of the Hearing \n     Industries Association. The group, in partnership with the \n     National Council on the Aging, just completed a survey of the \n     social, psychological and physiological impact of hearing \n     loss. It's telling that the two organizations decided to drop \n     the age of those polled from 65 to 50.\n       For the estimated 28 million Americans with a hearing loss, \n     noise is a leading cause, experts say. Once that would have \n     traced back to the machinery din of mills and factories, but \n     federal regulations have helped protect workers in industrial \n     settings. Now it's more the hours away from work that are the \n     problem. There's even a term for those who study excessive \n     noise from leisure-time pursuits: recreational audiologists.\n       Dick Melia, of Arlington, never paid much attention to how \n     annoying the lawn mower or tools were that summer during \n     graduate school when he worked for a contractor. The same \n     goes for the civil rights demonstrations he participated in \n     during the 1960s, and later, the pro basketball games at \n     which he cheered. He'd leave the arena with his ears ringing.\n       But during his forties, he noticed other things: how he'd \n     replay his voice mail several times to get all of a message, \n     how he'd race to keep up in discussions, wondering what words \n     he had missed. Then, one night at his office, a fire broke \n     out. The alarm went off. ``I never heard it,'' Melia \n     recounted.\n       His procrastination ended; at 50, he got hearing aids. \n     ``There is a problem of stigma,'' said Melia, who directs \n     disability and rehabilitation research within the U.S. \n     Department of Education. ``There is something about hearing \n     aids and the way society over the years has characterized \n     hearing loss.''\n       For one, the subject is freighted with fears about growing \n     old. But some scientists and audiologists question whether \n     diminished hearing is an unavoidable consequence of aging, or \n     rather the cumulative assault of a cacophonous world. Both \n     loud, sustained sound and extreme, sudden sound can damage \n     and ultimately destroy the delicate hair cells in the inner \n     ear that translate sound waves into nerve impulses. High-\n     frequency sounds are usually the first casualty--consonants \n     such as S and F and children's and women's voices. The \n     ability to distinguish sounds and block background noise also \n     deteriorates.\n       Because all that generally occurs over time, the onset of \n     hearing loss is slow and insidious.\n       ``People aren't concerned if it doesn't happen now,'' said \n     Laurie Hanin, who leads the audiology department at the \n     League for the Hard of Hearing in New York City. The league \n     is analyzing voluminous data from 20 years of screenings in \n     the New York metropolitan area, and Hanin expects to find a \n     decided decline in hearing acuity.\n       Hanin, 42, sometimes has trouble understanding \n     conversation, an unwelcome portent of the future. ``My \n     hearing tests normally, but I'm starting to have some \n     problems,'' she said.\n       Last month, the National Institute on Deafness and Other \n     Communication Disorders gathered 100 representatives of \n     medical, research, volunteer and union organizations to talk \n     about noise-induced hearing loss--how it occurs and how it \n     can be prevented. The institute plans to launch a public \n     awareness campaign on the issue in the spring.\n       Prevention and education were an ongoing effort at the \n     Environmental Protection Agency until its Office of Noise \n     Abatement was eliminated in 1982. That's about the time a \n     push to require decibel labels on lawn equipment gave way to \n     voluntary notices, which were ``a miserable failure,'' in \n     Kenneth Feith's view, and explain why instructions on lawn \n     mowers or leaf blowers virtually never advise hearing \n     protection.\n       ``I think we're going to see a population suffering from \n     hearing loss that will impair learning, impair our ability to \n     carry out tasks,'' said Feith, an EPA senior scientist and \n     policy adviser who headed the Office of Noise Abatement.\n       Musicians may be getting the message faster than others, \n     thanks to groups such as Hearing Education and Awareness for \n     Rockers. The 10-year-old nonprofit California organization \n     was founded by Kathy Peck, 39, whose bass career ended the \n     morning after her band opened for Duran Duran. ``I had \n     ringing in my ears that lasted three days. It felt like a \n     bongo drum was in my head.'' She sustained substantial, \n     irreversible damage.\n       Early on, HEAR gained visibility when Pete Townshend of the \n     Who wrote it a $10,000 check and publicly acknowledged his \n     own hearing loss. It soon will begin examining audiograms, \n     demographic data and questionnaires from thousands of \n     patients seen at HEAR's clinic in San Francisco. Most have \n     been in their twenties and thirties.\n       Nightclubs such as the Capitol Ballroom and the 9:30 Club \n     in the District now offer foam earplugs to patrons. Symphony \n     orchestras increasingly make earplugs and plexiglass screens \n     available to their musicians, especially those sitting within \n     or near the percussion and brass sections. As part of the \n     Navy bands' hearing conservation program, specially designed \n     plugs are handed out even before a musician gets an \n     assignment.\n       In the meantime, despite many people's refusal to admit \n     they need help, sales of hearing aids are booming. Nearly 2 \n     million were purchased last year, almost 25 percent more than \n     in 1996, at a cost of $600 to $3,100 each. The most expensive \n     are individually programmed digital devices capable of \n     processing sounds 1 million times per second. When fitted \n     within the ear canal, they are literally invisible.\n       One buyer in 1997 was President Clinton, who attributed his \n     situation to an adolescence spent playing in school bands and \n     rocking at concerts. According to staff members, the \n     country's most prominent baby boomer wears his hearing aids \n     sporadically. He is most likely to insert them for ceremonies \n     or political gatherings, where he finds it harder to \n     distinguish sounds.\n       Stephen Wells, a Washington lawyer who recently received \n     bad news of his own, is weighing his options. Because of a \n     childhood spent around tractors and harvesters on his \n     family's Idaho farm, his right ear measures only borderline. \n     And that's his better ear.\n       ``My wife has been saying for a long time that I ought to \n     see about a hearing test,'' said Wells, 51. He compares \n     hearing aids to glasses in function but is uncertain how well \n     they'll work for him day to day. ``I expect that I will at \n     least try them.''\n\n\n                               SAY AGAIN?\n\n       A number of conditions may disrupt the hearing process and \n     lead to hearing loss. How the ear works and what commonly \n     causes damage:\n     How the ear Hears\n       1. The outer ear collects sound waves and funnels them into \n     the ear canal.\n       2. Sound waves strike the eardrum, causing it to vibrate.\n       3. Three tiny bones conduct the vibrations to the cochlea \n     in the inner ear.\n       4. Tiny nerve endings in the cochlea, called hair cells, \n     become stimulated. They transform the vibrations into \n     electro-chemical impulses.\n       5.

Mr. President, I am pleased to announce the \nconfirmation by the Senate last night of Mr. Montie Deer to become \nChairman of the National Indian Gaming Commission--the federal \nregulatory body overseeing certain Indian gaming activities nationwide.\n  After a hearing in February of this year, the Committee on Indian \nAffairs reported Mr. Deer to the full Senate. Mr. Deer is a qualified \nand dedicated public servant who most recently was the United States \nAttorney in Kansas.\n  Since 1988, Indian gaming has become a source of much-needed revenue \nfor Indian tribal governments to provide jobs, services and frankly, \nhope, where there is not much. There are now some 185 tribes operating \nsome form of gaming operations, with annual revenues of nearly $7 \nbillion.\n  The National Indian Gaming Commission was created 11 years ago. This \nthree-member agency has the responsibility to monitor and regulate \ncertain forms of gaming conducted on Indian lands. The NIGC has the \nauthority to approve management contracts; conduct background \ninvestigations; approve tribal gaming ordinances; and review and \nconduct audits of the books and records of Indian gaming operations.\n  The NIGC also has the authority and the responsibility to enforce \nviolations of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, NIGC regulations and \napproved tribal gaming ordinances. Those involved with Indian gaming \nunderstand the need for a strong, effective Commission--one that \nprotects the integrity of games offered by tribes. As we did last \nsession, the Committee on Indian Affairs will soon consider legislation \nto strengthen the Commission and ensure it has the resources it needs \nto fulfill its obligations.\n  A strong Commission is meaningless without strong leadership and last \nnight the Senate acted to ensure that strong and effective leadership \nwill be the order of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/10/senate-section/article/S2502-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DECEPTIVE MAIL PREVENTION AND ENFORCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I'm here to announce my strong support of \nSenator Collins' bill S. 335, the ``Deceptive Mail Prevention and \nEnforcement Act.'' I chose to be an original co-sponsor of this bill \nafter hearing from several constituents who were confused, irritated, \nand even outraged by the deceptive language that is all too often found \nin sweepstakes and other promotional mailings.\n  I think every one of us has received at least a few junk mailings \nwhich brazenly inform us that we have just won millions of dollars or \nthat we are about to receive a car, a luxury cruise, or some other \nprize that sounds too good to be true. Well, the sad truth is that it \nalmost always IS too good to be true.\n  To many of us, these promotional mailings represent nothing more than \na minor annoyance and are easily tossed into the garbage without a \nsecond thought. But for many others, these mailings are nothing more \nthan a cruel hoax, a trap designed to play on the hopes and dreams of \ntrusting folks who were raised in a time when most people meant what \nthey said and said what they meant.\n  As an example of the misleading and downright dangerous content found \nin many of these mailings, I'd like to read into the record a portion \nof a letter that was sent to me last year by a constituent of mine who \nresides in Columbia Falls, Montana. This gentleman writes,\n\n       My father is a resident in a nursing home. He is 84, and \n     suffers from mild dementia aggravated by high-powered \n     medications which treat his incessant headaches. (The \n     magazine he subscribes to) endlessly sends him these \n     misleading and deliberately-designed ``You've Won!!!'' \n     bulletins that he cannot understand except to believe \n     fervently that he's just got to go pick up his check for \n     hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars.\n       I believe these kinds of letters are deliberately designed \n     to prey on the infirmities of old people, and of course get \n     them to sign things that obligate them to free trials and \n     unneeded products. Every episode brings my father increased \n     stress, more headaches, and the need for additional \n     medication. I am sure there are hundreds of thousands of \n     people like Dad who want nothing to do with these phony \n     promotions, but who can't get the mailers to remove them from \n     the lists. Many, like Dad, don't have the daily clarity of \n     thought to deal with mass-mailed deceptive come-ons like \n     this.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe that the Deceptive Mail Prevention and \nEnforcement Act will go a long way towards preventing this kind of \nabuse of our senior citizens and other trusting individuals. Senator \nCollins' bill would not only establish strict new standards for honesty \nand disclosure in promotional mailings, but would provide strong new \nfinancial penalties for those who continue to violate these standards. \nIt is my hope that the Committee on Governmental Affairs will be able \nto approve this legislation quickly, on a bi-partisan basis, so that we \ncan bring an end to this plague of deceptive sweepstakes mailings which \nprey on our most vulnerable citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/10/senate-section/article/S2502-4", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/10/senate-section/article/S2502-5", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2502-S2503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT CONCERNING THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH \n           RESPECT TO IRAN--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 15\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the\n\n[[Page S2503]]\n\nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

A bill to prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from issuing \nregulations dealing with hybrid transactions; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                   SUBPART F OF INTERNAL REVENUE CODE\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today Mr. Mack and I are again introducing \nlegislation to place a permanent moratorium on the Department of the\n\n[[Page S2504]]\n\nTreasury's authority to finalize any proposed regulations issued \npursuant to Notice 98-35, dealing with the treatment of hybrid branch \ntransactions under subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code. Our bill \nalso prohibits Treasury from issuing new regulations relating to the \ntax treatment of hybrid transactions under subpart F and requires the \nSecretary to conduct a study of the tax treatment of hybrid \ntransactions and to provide a written report to the Senate Committee on \nFinance and the House Committee on Ways and Means.\n  By way of background, the United States generally subjects U.S. \ncitizens and corporations to current taxation on their worldwide \nincome. Two important devices mitigate or eliminate double taxation of \nincome earned from foreign sources. First, bilateral income tax \ntreaties with many countries exempt American taxpayers from paying \nforeign taxes on certain types of income (e.g. interest) and impose \nreduced rates of tax on other types (e.g. dividends and royalties). \nSecond, U.S. taxpayers receive a credit against U.S. taxes for foreign \ntaxes paid on foreign source income. To reiterate, these devices have \nbeen part of our international tax rules for decades and are aimed at \npreventing U.S. businesses from being taxed twice on the same income. \nThe policy of currently taxing U.S. citizens on their worldwide income \nis in direct contrast with the regimes employed by most of our foreign \ntrading competitors. Generally they tax their citizens and domestic \ncorporations only on the income earned within their borders (the so-\ncalled ``water's edge'' approach).\n  Foreign corporations generally are also not subject to U.S. tax on \nincome earned outside the United States, even if the foreign \ncorporation is controlled by a U.S. parent. Thus, U.S. tax on income \nearned by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies--that is, from foreign \noperations conducted through a controlled foreign corporation (CFC)--is \ngenerally deferred until dividends paid by the CFC are received by its \nU.S. parent. This policy is referred to as ``tax deferral.''\n  In 1961, President John F. Kennedy proposed eliminating tax deferral \nwith respect to the earnings of U.S.-controlled foreign subsidiaries. \nThe proposal provided that U.S. corporations would be currently taxable \non their share of the earnings of CFCs, except in the case of \ninvestments in certain ``less developed countries.'' The business \ncommunity strongly opposed the proposal, arguing that in order for U.S. \nmultinational companies to be able to compete effectively in global \nmarkets, their CFCs should be subject only to the same taxes to which \ntheir foreign competitors were subject.\n  In the Revenue Act of 1962, Congress rejected the President's \nproposal to completely eliminate tax deferral, recognizing that to do \nso would place U.S. companies operating in overseas markets at a \nsignificant disadvantage vis-a-vis their foreign competitors. Instead, \nCongress opted to adopt a policy regime designed to end deferral only \nwith respect to income earned from so-called ``tax haven'' operations. \nThis regime, known as ``subpart F,'' generally is aimed at currently \ntaxing foreign source income that is easily moveable from one taxing \njurisdiction to another and that is subject to low rates of foreign \ntax.\n  Thus, the subpart F provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (found in \nsections 951-964) have always reflected a balancing of two competing \npolicy objectives: capital export neutrality (i.e. neutrality of \ntaxation as between domestic and foreign operations) and capital import \nneutrality (i.e. neutrality of taxation as between CFCs and their \nforeign competitors). While these competing principles continue to form \nthe foundation of subpart F today, recent actions by the Department of \nthe Treasury threaten to upset this long-standing balance.\n  On January 16, 1998, the Department of the Treasury announced in \nNotice 98-11 its intention to issue regulations to prevent the use of \nhybrid branches ``to circumvent the purposes of subpart F.'' The hybrid \nbranch arrangements identified in Notice 98-11 involved entities \ncharacterized for U.S. tax purposes as part of a controlled foreign \ncorporation, but characterized for purposes of the tax law of the \ncountry in which the CFC was incorporated as a separate entity. The \nNotice indicated that the creation of such hybrid branches was \nfacilitated by the entity classification rules contained in section \n301.7701-I through -3 of the Income Tax Regulations (the ``check the \nbox'' regulations).\n  Notice 98-11 acknowledged that U.S. international tax policy seeks to \nbalance the objectives of capital export neutrality with the objective \nof allowing U.S. businesses to compete on a level playing field with \nforeign competitors. In the view of the Treasury and IRS, however, the \nhybrid transactions attacked in the Notice ``upset that balance.'' \nTreasury indicated that the regulations to be issued generally would \napply to hybrid branch arrangements entered into or substantially \nmodified after January 16, 1998, and would provide that certain \npayments to and from foreign hybrid branches of CFCs would be treated \nas generating subpart F income to U.S. shareholders in situations in \nwhich subpart F would not otherwise apply to a hybrid branch as a \nseparate entity. This represented a significant expansion of subpart F, \nby regulation rather than through legislation.\n  Shortly after Notice 98-11 was issued, the Administration released \nits Fiscal Year 1999 budget proposals which, among other things, \nincluded a provision requesting Congress to statutorily grant broad \nregulatory authority to the Treasury Secretary to prescribe regulations \nclarifying the tax consequences of hybrid transactions in cases in \nwhich the intended results are inconsistent with the purposes of U.S. \ntax law. . . . While the explanation accompanying the budget proposal \nargued that this grant of authority as applied to many cases ``merely \nmakes the Secretary's current general regulatory authority more \nspecific, and directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations pursuant \nto such authority,'' the explanation conceded that in other cases, \n``the Secretary's authority may be questioned and should be \nclarified.''\n\n  Notice 98-11 and the accompanying budget proposal generated \nwidespread concerns in the Congress and the business community that the \nTreasury was undertaking a major new initiative in the international \ntax arena that would undermine the ability of U.S. multinationals to \ncompete in international markets. For example, House Ways and Means \nCommittee Chairman Bill Archer wrote to Treasury Secretary Rubin on \nMarch 20, 1998 requesting that ``Notice 98-11 be withdrawn and that no \nregulations in this area be issued or allowed to take effect until \nCongress has an appropriate opportunity, to consider these matters in \nthe normal legislative process.'' The Ranking Democrat on the \nCommittee, Charles Rangel, wrote to Secretary Rubin expressing strong \nconcerns about the Treasury's increasing propensity to ``legislate \nthrough the regulatory process as evidenced by Notice 98-11.''\n  Despite these concerns, on March 23, 1998, the Treasury department \nissued two sets of proposed and temporary regulations, the first \nrelating to the treatment of hybrid branch arrangements under subpart \nF, and the second relating to the treatment of a CFC's distributive \nshare of partnership income. As Notice 98-11 had promised, the \nregulations provided that certain payments between a controlled foreign \ncorporation and a hybrid branch would be recharacterized as subpart F \nincome if the payments reduce the payer's foreign taxes.\n  The week after the temporary and proposed regulations were issued, \nthe Senate Finance Committee considered H.R. 2676, the Internal Revenue \nService Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. A provision was included \nin the bill prohibiting the Treasury and IRS from implementing \ntemporary or final regulations with respect to Notice 98-11 prior to \nsix months after the date of enactment of H.R. 2676. The Senate bill \nalso included language expressing the ``sense of the Senate'' that \n``the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service \nshould withdraw Notice 98-11 and the regulations issued thereunder, and \nthat the Congress, and not the Department of the Treasury or the \nInternal Revenue Service, should determine the international tax policy \nissues relating to the treatment of hybrid transactions under subpart F \nprovisions of the Code.''\n  Opposition to Notice 98-11 and the temporary and proposed regulations\n\n[[Page S2505]]\n\ncontinued to mount. On April 23, 1998, 33 Members of the House Ways and \nMeans Committee wrote to Secretary Rubin expressing concern about the \nTreasury's decision to move forward and issue regulations pursuant to \nNotice 98-11 without an appropriate opportunity for Congress to \nconsider this issue in the normal legislative process, urging Treasury \nto withdraw the regulations.\n  In the face of these and other pressures from the Congress and the \nbusiness community, on June 19, 1998, the Treasury Department announced \nin Notice 98-35 that it was withdrawing Notice 98-11 and the related \ntemporary, and proposed regulations. According to Notice 98-35, \nTreasury intends to issue a new set of proposed regulations to be \neffective in general for payments made under hybrid branch arrangements \non or after June 19, 1998. These regulations, however, will not be \nfinalized before January 1, 2000, in order to permit both the Congress \nand Treasury Department the opportunity to further study the issues \nthat were raised following the publication of Notice 98-11 earlier this \nyear.\n  While we applaud the Treasury's decision to withdraw Notice 98-11 and \nthe temporary regulations, we believe that additional legislative \naction is needed to prevent the Treasury from finalizing the \nforthcoming regulations until Congress considers the issues involved. \nWe believe that only the Congress has the authority to achieve a \npermanent resolution of this issue. Notice 98-35, like its predecessor, \nNotice 98-11 continues to suffer from a fatal flaw; it is the \nprerogative of Congress, and not the Executive Branch, to pass laws \nestablishing the nation's fundamental tax policies. Simply put, Notice \n98-35 adds restrictions to the subpart F regime that are not supported \nby the Code's clear statutory language, and there has been no express \ndelegation of regulatory authority to the Treasury that relates \nspecifically to the issues presented in the Notice.\n  More importantly, we question the policy objectives to be achieved by \nNotice 98-35 and the accompanying proposed regulations. We do not \nunderstand the rationale for penalizing U.S. multinational companies \nfor employing normal tax planning strategies that reduce foreign (as \nopposed to U.S.) income taxes. Moreover, Notice 98-35 is contrary to \nrecent Congressional efforts to simplify the international tax \nprovisions of the Code. For example, the Congress reduced complexity \nand ridded the code of a perverse incentive for U.S. companies to \ninvest overseas by repealing the Section 956A tax on excess passive \nearnings in 1996. Again in 1997, the Congress repealed the application \nof the Passive Foreign Investment Company regime to U.S. shareholders \nof controlled foreign corporations because of the complexity involved \nin applying both regimes, in addition to enacting a host of other \nforeign tax simplifications. The Senate Finance Committee will hold a \nhearing on March 11, 1999 to further investigate the reforms needed in \nthe international tax arena that not only reduce complexity, but also \nencourage U.S. global economic competition. I fully expect Notice 98-35 \nto be discussed at this hearing.\n  In order for Congress to gain a better understanding of the Treasury \nDepartment's position on this matter, our bill would require the \nTreasury to conduct a thorough study of the tax treatment of hybrid \ntransactions under subpart F and to provide a report to the Senate \nCommittee on Finance and House Committee on Ways and Means on this \nissue.\n  If the forthcoming regulations are permitted to be finalized by the \nTreasury, U.S. multinational businesses will be placed at a competitive \ndisadvantage vis-a-vis foreign companies who remain free to employ \nstrategies to reduce the foreign taxes they pay. Clearly, such a result \nshould be permitted to take effect only if Congress, after having an \nopportunity to fully consider all of the tax and economic issues \ninvolved, agrees that the arguments advanced by the Treasury are \ncompelling and determines that additional statutory changes to subpart \nF are necessary and appropriate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 572\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. HYBRID TRANSACTIONS UNDER SUBPART F.\n\n       (a) Prohibition on Regulations.--The Secretary of the \n     Treasury (or his delegate)--\n       (1) shall not issue temporary or final regulations relating \n     to the treatment of hybrid transactions under subpart F of \n     part III of subchapter N of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 pursuant to Internal Revenue Service Notice 98-\n     35 or any other regulations reaching the same or similar \n     result as such notice,\n       (2) shall retroactively withdraw any regulations described \n     in paragraph (1) which were issued after the date of such \n     notice and before the date of the enactment of this Act, and\n       (3) shall not modify or withdraw sections 301.7701-1 \n     through 301.7701-3 of the Treasury Regulations (relating to \n     the classification of certain business entities) in a manner \n     which alters the treatment of hybrid transactions under such \n     subpart F.\n       (b) Study and Report.--The Secretary of the Treasury (or \n     his delegate) shall study the tax treatment of hybrid \n     transactions under such subpart F and submit a report to the \n     Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives \n     and the Committee on Finance of the Senate. The Secretary \n     shall hold at least one public hearing to receive comments \n     from any interested party prior to submitting such report.\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today Senator Breaux and I introduce a bill \nreaffirming that the lawmaking power is the province of the Congress, \nnot the executive branch. Our bill prohibits the Treasury Department \nfrom issuing regulations that would impose taxes on U.S. companies \nmerely because one of their subsidiaries pays money to itself.\n  As a general rule, U.S. corporations pay U.S. corporate income tax on \nthe earnings of their foreign subsidiaries only when those earnings are \nactually distributed to the U.S. parent companies. An exception to this \ngeneral rule is contained in subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code, \nwhich accelerates the income tax liability of U.S. parent companies \nunder certain circumstances. The Treasury Department has announced, in \nNotice 98-35, an intention to issue regulations that will accelerate \nincome tax liability for U.S. companies--not based on the specific \ncircumstances enumerated in subpart F, but instead on a new \n``interpretation'' of the ``policies'' that Treasury infers from that \n36-year-old provision. This action crosses the line between \nadministering the laws and making the laws, and cannot be allowed by \nCongress.\n  Notice 98-35 concerns so-called ``hybrid arrangements.'' These \ninvolve business entities that are considered separate corporations for \nforeign tax purposes, but are viewed as one company with a branch \noffice for U.S. purposes. U.S. companies organize their subsidiaries in \nthis manner to reduce the amount of foreign taxes they owe. \nTransactions between a subsidiary and its branch have no impact on U.S. \ntaxable income of the parent, as its subsidiary is merely paying money \nto itself. But the Treasury Department intends to impose a tax on the \nU.S. parent to penalize it for reducing the foreign taxes it owes.\n  This effort is wrong for several reasons. First, the Treasury \nDepartment possesses only the power to issue regulations to administer \nthe laws passed by Congress. New rules based on Congressional purpose \nare known as laws, and under the Constitution laws are made by \nCongress.\n  Second, the Treasury Department is elevating one policy underlying \nsubpart F--taxing domestic and foreign operations in the same manner--\nover the other policy of maintaining the competitiveness of U.S. \ncompanies in foreign markets. This proposed tax would put U.S.-owned \nsubsidiaries at a competitive disadvantage.\n  Finally, the Treasury Department should not impose a tax on U.S. \ncompanies to force these companies to reorganize in a way that \nincreases the taxes they owe to foreign countries. The Treasury \nDepartment is not the tax collector for other nations. And by raising \nthe foreign tax bills of U.S. companies, the Treasury Department is \nalso increasing the size of foreign tax credits and thereby reducing \nU.S. tax revenues.\n  The Treasury Department is not only making policy that it has no \nright to make, it is also making bad policy. Our bill places a \nmoratorium on this lawmaking. It also directs the Treasury\n\n[[Page S2506]]\n\nSecretary to study these issues and submit a report to the tax-writing \ncommittees of Congress. Many people and organizations, including the \nTreasury Department, desire changes in the tax laws. But only Congress \nhas the power to make these changes, and this is a power we intend to \nkeep.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. \n        Dorgan):\n  S. 573. A bill to provide individuals with access to health \ninformation of which they are a subject, ensure personal privacy with \nrespect to health-care-related information, impose criminal and civil \npenalties for unauthorized use of protected health information, to \nprovide for the strong enforcement of these rights, and to protect \nStates' rights; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n              Medical Information Privacy and Security Act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Kennedy, Daschle and Dorgan in introducing the Medical \nInformation Privacy and Security Act (MIPSA). I am also pleased that a \ncompanion bill will be introduced in the House by Congressman Edward \nMarkey.\n  The Millennium Bug is not the only computer-related problem Congress \nconfronts this year. We face the deadline that Congress set for itself \nof August 21, 1999, to solve the multitude of privacy glitches in the \nhandling of our medical records.\n  At a time when some states are selling driving license photos and \ninformation, when our leading computer chip and software companies have \nbuilt secret identifiers into their products to trace our every move in \ncyberspace without our consent, it is time for Congress to wake up to \nthe privacy rights and expectations of all Americans before it is too \nlate.\n  The trouble is this: If you have a medical record, you have a medical \nprivacy problem.\n  A guiding principle in drafting this legislation has been that the \nmovement to a more integrated system of health care in our country will \nonly continue to be supported by the American people if they are \nassured that the personal privacy of their health care information is \nprotected. In fact, without the confidence that one's personal privacy \nwill be protected, many will be discouraged from seeking medical help.\n  Most of us envision that our medical records are held in a manila \nfile folder under the watchful care of our health care provider. If \nthis is what you are picturing, you are sorely mistaken. Increased \ncomputerization of medical records and other health information is \nfueling both the supply and demand for our personal information. I do \nnot want advancing technology to lead to a loss of personal privacy, \nand I do not want the fear that confidentiality is being compromised to \ndeter people from seeking medical treatment or to stifle technological \nor scientific development.\n  The traditional right of confidentiality between a health care \nprovider and a patient is at risk. This erosion may reduce the \nwillingness of patients to confide in physicians and other \npractitioners and may inhibit patients from seeking care.\n  Unlike some, I believe that computerization can assure more privacy \nto individuals than the current system, if MIPSA is enacted. But if we \ndo not act the increased potential for embarrassment and harassment is \ntremendous.\n  The ability to compile, store and cross reference personal health \ninformation has made our intimate health history a valuable commodity. \nIn 1996 alone, the health care industry spent an estimated $10 to $15 \nbillion on information technology.\n  This data can be very useful for quality assurance, and to provide \nmore cost effective health care. But I doubt that the American public \nwould agree with a Fortune magazine article which lauded a health \ninsurer that poked through the individual medical records of clients to \nfigure out who may be depressed and could benefit from the use of the \nanti-depressant Prozac. Are we now encouraging the replacement of sound \nclinical judgment of doctors with health insurance clerks who look at \nrecords to determine whether you are not really suffering from a \nphysical illness, but a mental illness?\n  Just a few days ago The Wall Street Journal wrote about a company \nthat is ``seeking the mother lode in health `data mining.' '' This \ncompany wants to get medical data on millions of Americans to sell to \nany buyer. Currently there are no laws constraining the creation of \nlarge data bases filled with sensitive personally identifiable \ninformation on any of us. Our information is like gold to these ``data \nminers.''\n  If this battle is between American families who want some privacy and \nbig business buying access to their personal medical records, I will \nstand with American families every time.\n  Last year, an article in the Washington Post described the story of a \nwoman whose prescription purchases were tracked electronically by a \npharmacy benefits management company two states away, hired by her \nemployer. With every swipe of her prescription-drug card she saved 50% \non her prescriptions. At the same time, however, without her knowledge \nher sensitive health information was being compiled. Her doctor was \nsoon informed that she would be enrolled in a ``depression program,'' \nwatched for continued use of anti-depression medications, and be \ntargeted for ``educational'' material on depression. All of this was \ndone at the behest of her employer who had unfettered access to all of \nher personal health information.\n  This woman was not suffering from a depression-related illness; her \ndoctor prescribed the medication to help her sleep. This woman had no \nidea that by signing up for her managed care plan she was signing up to \nhave her personal health information disclosed to individuals she had \nnever even met.\n  Employer access to personal health information of their workers is a \nreal problem. A recent University of Illinois study found that 35 \npercent of all Fortune 500 companies regularly review health \ninformation before making hiring decisions. On-work-site health care \nproviders have testified before Congress that they are routinely \npressured for employee health information and must comply or lose their \njobs.\n  What MIPSA makes clear is that there must be a ``fire wall'' between \nthose within a company involved in providing health services and \nbenefits, and other managers. The goal of privacy legislation is to be \nthe first line of defense, so that individuals are not put in the \nsituation of possibly being discriminated against. Our bill complements \nother laws and proposed legislation that bar discrimination based on \nhealth status.\n  We must not let privacy slide to the point that the only way for a \nperson to ensure confidentiality is to avoid seeking medical treatment.\n\n  The simple fact is that many patients will not agree to participate \nin health research or to be tested if they fear the information that is \nrevealed in the course of the research could be released, bringing them \nharm. In genetic testing studies at the National Institutes of Health, \nthirty-two percent of eligible people who were offered a test for \nbreast cancer risk declined to take it, citing concerns about loss of \nprivacy and the potential for discrimination in health insurance.\n  The bill we are introducing today, the Medical Information Privacy \nand Security Act, would be the first comprehensive federal health \nprivacy law.\n  Our bill is broad in scope: It applies to medical records in whatever \nform--paper or electronic. It applies to each release of medical \ninformation, including re-releases. It comprehensively covers entities \nother than just health care providers and payers, such as life \ninsurance companies, employers and marketers and others who may have \naccess to sensitive personal health data.\n  It gives individuals the right to inspect, copy and supplement their \nprotected health information.\n  It allows individuals to require the segregation of portions of their \nmedical records, such as mental health records, from broad viewing by \nindividuals who are not directly involved in their care.\n  It gives individuals a civil right of action against anyone who \nmisuses their personally identifiable health information. It \nestablishes criminal and civil penalties that can be invoked if \nindividually identifiable health information is knowingly or \nnegligently misused.\n  It creates a set of rules and norms to govern the disclosure of \npersonal\n\n[[Page S2507]]\n\nhealth information and narrows the sharing of personal details within \nthe health care system to the minimum necessary to provide care, allow \nfor payment and to facilitate effective oversight. Special allowances \nare made for situations such as emergency medical care and public \nhealth requirements.\n  We have been very careful to balance the right to privacy with the \nneeds of providers and health care plans, who can use medical \ninformation to improve the care of patients. MIPSA does not force \npatients to sign a blanket authorization allowing their information to \ngo to anyone for any purpose in order to receive care. Unfortunately, \nindividuals now have no choice but to sign away their rights if they \nwant any health care treatment at all.\n  MIPSA changes the authorization procedure by requiring that \nproviders, health plans and hospitals clearly lay out to patients how \ntheir protected health information will be used, who will have access \nto their protected health information, and for what purpose. If anyone \nwants to use or disclose personally identifiable health information for \na purpose that is not directly related to their treatment or billing, \nthe patient has that right to say no without losing the ability to \nreceive needed health care.\n  It also takes special care to make sure that important medical \nresearch continues. MIPSA extends the protective practices currently \nfollowed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to all health \nresearch efforts--whether publicly or privately funded.\n  It establishes a clear and enforceable right of privacy for all \npersonally identifiable medical information including information \nregarding the results of genetic tests.\n  We have tried to accommodate legitimate oversight concerns so that we \ndo not create unnecessary impediments to health care fraud \ninvestigations. Effective health care oversight is essential if our \nhealth care system is to function and fulfill its intended goals. \nOtherwise, we risk establishing a publicly sanctioned playground for \nthe unscrupulous. Health care is too important a public investment to \nbe the subject of undetected fraud or abuse.\n  It prohibits law enforcement agents from searching through medical \nrecords without a warrant. It does not limit law enforcement agents in \ngaining information while in hot pursuit of a suspect.\n  We also require anyone who maintains your medical information to have \nstrong safeguards in place. And MIPSA offers strong enforcement \nprovisions and remedies for the misuse of medical information.\n  It sets up a national office of health information privacy to aid \nconsumers in learning about their rights and about how they can seek \nrecourse for violations of their rights.\n  Most importantly, our bill does not preempt any federal or state law \nor regulation that offers stronger privacy safeguards. We propose a \nfloor rather than a ceiling, achieving two goals:\n  First, a strong federal privacy law will eliminate much of the \ncurrent patchwork of state laws governing the exchange of medical \ninformation, and will replace the patchwork with strong, clear \nstandards that will apply to everyone.\n  Second, MIPSA makes room for the many possible future threats to \nmedical privacy that we may not even anticipate today. As medical and \ninformation technology moves forward into the next century we must \nmaintain the public's right to seek stronger medical privacy laws \ncloser to home.\n  The elements of MIPSA are essential to any strong medical privacy \neffort.\n  I am encouraged that a variety of public policy and health \nprofessional organizations, across the political spectrum, are \nsignaling their intentions to step forward to join forces with \nconsumers during this debate.\n  We have 164 days to implement a strong federal medical privacy law. \nWith the clock ticking toward the August deadline, let us act sooner \nrather than later.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are here today to propose legislation \nto protect the privacy of personal medical information in our rapidly \nchanging health care system. Today, video rental records have greater \nprotection than sensitive medical information. Last month, we learned \nthat the University of Michigan Medical Center posted information from \nthousands of patient records on the Internet, without any password \nprotection or other safeguards. In many other cases, individual \npatients have been harmed by improper release of their private medical \nrecords.\n  The legislation that Senator Daschle, Senator Leahy, Congressman \nMarkey, and I are introducing today--the Medical Information Privacy \nand Security Act--puts patients first, while allowing for legitimate \nuses of medical information to improve health care.\n  Congress recognized the need to act to protect the privacy of medical \ninformation when we passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy Act in 1996. That \nlegislation contained a provision requiring Congress to pass \nlegislation on the issue by August of this year. If the deadline is not \nmet, the Administration has the power to act by regulation.\n  The measure we are introducing ensures strong protections nationwide. \nIt also allows individual states to take additional action. Stronger \nstate laws are not pre-empted.\n  The goal of these protections is to safeguard the confidential \nrelationship between patients and physicians. Patients concerned about \ntheir privacy are less likely to disclose important information to \ntheir physicians. A recent survey by the California HealthCare \nFoundation found that one in six adults has taken steps to protect \ntheir personal medical information, such as providing inaccurate \ninformation in their medical history, or asking physicians not to \ninclude certain information in their medical records.\n  Our legislation recognizes the fundamental right of patients to limit \ndisclosure of personally-identifiable medical information. We have \nbalanced that right with the needs of providers and health care plans \nto use medical information to improve patient care. Our proposal does \nnot force patients to sign a blanket authorization in order to receive \ncare. Instead, it contains a flexible framework that can be modified to \nfit different situations.\n  Medical research is essential for progress against disease. But it is \nalso essential for patients to have confidence that research is \nbeneficial, not an invasion of privacy. In genetic testing studies at \nthe National Institutes of Health, 32 percent of eligible people who \nwere offered a test for breast cancer declined to take it, because of \nconcerns about loss of privacy and the potential for discrimination in \nhealth insurance.\n  Currently, most federal health research is governed by the ``Common \nRule'', which includes evaluations by Institutional Review Boards in \norder to protect patients involved in the research. Our proposed \nlegislation strengthens the privacy provisions in the ``Common Rule,'' \nand extends those protections to all health research.\n  These issues are important, and I am optimistic that Congress will \nact in time to meet the August deadline. We have a responsibility to \nenact strong protections for privacy in all aspects of health care, and \nnow is the time to act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND (for himself and Mr. Coverdell):\n  S. 575. A bill to redesignate the National School Lunch Act as the \n``Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act''; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n              richard b. russell national school lunch act\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nrename the National School Lunch Act after Senator Richard Russell. I \nam pleased to have Senator Coverdell as a original co-sponsor.\n  Having met Senator Russell over 30 years ago when I was an intern on \nCapitol Hill, I gained a deep respect and reverence for the ``Senator \nfrom Georgia'' Richard B. Russell. Since being elected to the Senate \nover two years ago, I have been looking for a way to appropriately \nhonor and express my appreciation for the contributions of Senator \nRussell. Honestly, I, like many others, usually associate Senator \nRussell with military issues and the work he did to provide our nation \nwith a strong national defense. However, in researching his history in \nthe Senate, I noticed that, time and again, Senator Russell stated that \nhe viewed his proudest achievement in the Senate as the School Lunch \nAct.\n\n[[Page S2508]]\n\n  On February 26, 1946, speaking on the Senate floor, Senator Russell \nnoted that the School Lunch Program, ``has been one of the most helpful \nones which has been inaugurated and promises to contribute more to the \ncause of public education in these United States than has any other \npolicy which has been adopted since the creation of free public \nschools.'' Strong words, not only about the school lunch program, but \nabout Senator Russell's commitment to the same.\n  Starting the first grade in 1947, I, like some of you, have always \nconsidered myself to be a true product of the national school lunch \nprogram. The program has been woven into the fabric of the American \nfamily. Today, the National School Lunch Program operates in more than \n95,000 public and nonprofit private schools and residential child care \ninstitutions throughout the country, providing nutritionally balanced, \nlow-cost or free lunches to more than 26 million children each school \nday. The knowledge that every one of our children is ensured a healthy \nand affordable meal every school day provides us all with a great deal \nof comfort and satisfaction. The program is available in almost 99 \npercent of all public schools, and in many private schools as well. \nAbout 92 percent of all students nationwide have access to meals \nthrough the National School Lunch Program. As cited in several studies, \na well fed child is more likely to do better in school and is less \nlikely to misbehave--both highly desirable outcomes.\n  Senator Russell was a tireless champion for establishing a program to \ndeliver a healthy meal to our nation's schoolchildren. Senator Russell \nbegan his campaign to make school feeding programs available in the mid \n1930's by utilizing Section 32 funds of the Act of August 24, 1935. As \nChairman of the Subcommittee on Agricultural Appropriations, Senator \nRussell exerted a great deal of influence and was a vigilant advocate \nof directing the Section 32 food surpluses towards school feeding \nprograms. In the early 1940's, Senator Russell introduced several bills \nauthorizing a national school lunch program. And, after several \nunsuccessful attempts, Senator Russell sponsored and pushed through the \nNational School Lunch Act in 1946.\n  Senator Russell's strong commitment to domestic agriculture \nproduction strengthened his support for the school feeding programs. In \nfact, Senator Russell's commitment to a strong national defense may \nhave also played a role in his support for the program. As you know, \nSenator Russell served as a member, and later Chairman, of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee. During World War II and in post war hearings \nbefore the Armed Services Committee, testimony was provided by General \nHershey and Surgeon General Parran and others indicating that a large \npercentage of men rejected from military service had diet-related \nhealth problems. This revelation resulted in the recognition by many \nthat the school lunch program is a matter of national security.\n  As stated in a report I received from the Congressional Research \nService, ``Senator Russell played a key role in the creation and \nformation of the national school lunch program. The historical record \nof Senator Russell's actions on behalf of this program in the 1930's \nand 1940's give him a strong claim to being regarded as the ``father'' \nof the national school lunch program, and make a strong case for \nrenaming the 1946 Act after him.'' There have most certainly been \nseveral other members from the House and Senate, both past and present, \nwho have played an irreplaceable role in developing and championing the \ncause of the school lunch program and I believe that all of these \nmembers should be commended for their dedication. This proposal is not \nmeant to diminish the contribution of countless others, but simply to \nrecognize that Senator Russell played a primary role in the passage of \nthe National School Lunch Act. I am convinced that no other member was \nas significant as Senator Russell in seeing the National School Lunch \nAct enacted into law. I am pleased to have received the strong \nendorsement of the Georgia School Food Service Association in their \nResolution of support on January 23, 1999.\n  Considering Senator Russell's vital role in making the school lunch \nprogram a reality and the passion he expressed for being its author, I \nbelieve that by renaming the School Lunch Act in his honor, we can \nfittingly memorialize his contribution, as well as call renewed \nattention to this vital national program. I ask for my colleagues \nsupport.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text, a letter of \nsupport, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n   Georgia School Food Service Association Resolution in Support of \n   Senator Max Cleland's Proposal to Memorialize Senator Richard B. \n                                Russell\n\n       Whereas, The Georgia School Food Service Association \n     (GSFSA) has learned that Senator Max Cleland wishes to \n     sponsor legislation to permanently associate the name of \n     Senator Richard B. Russell with and to memorialize the \n     contribution that he made to the establishment of the \n     National School Lunch Act by naming The National School Lunch \n     Act of 1946 (NSLA), the Richard B. Russell National School \n     Lunch Act, and\n       Whereas, Senator Richard B. Russell has been known as ``the \n     father of the school lunch act'' as documented in a 1973 \n     publication, ``Education in the States,'' published by The \n     National Education Association in cooperation with The Chief \n     State School Officers, and\n       Whereas, a review of the 1945-46 Congressional debates \n     leading up to the passage of the Act in May 1946 and signing \n     by President Harry Truman on June 4, 1946 reflects the \n     leadership role of Senator Russell as author of the bill that \n     finally was approved by the Congress, and\n       Whereas, Senator Russell's success in getting the \n     legislation passed was greatly enhanced by the outstanding \n     bi-partisan support in the Senate by Senator George D. Aiken, \n     Vermont and Senator Allen J. Ellender, Louisiana and in \n     collaboration with The House of Representatives under the \n     committee leadership of Congressman Flannagan of Virginia, \n     and\n       Whereas, with the passage of time the names of NSLA \n     pioneers are faded from memory and we believe there should be \n     an appropriate memorial established to perpetuate the memory \n     of the contribution made by the visionary Richard B. Russell \n     for the program.\n       Whereas, the year 2000 will mark the 55th Anniversary of \n     The National School Lunch Act and GSFSA joins with Senator \n     Max Cleland in believing that the time is right for the name \n     of Richard B. Russell to be memorialized and permanently \n     attached to The National School Lunch Act, and\n       Whereas, the vision of this program defined by Senator \n     Russell and articulated in The NSLA, Section 1 Policy, to \n     ``safeguard the health and well-being of all children . . . \n     by supporting the establishment of programs and promoting the \n     consumption of nutritious agricultural commodities'' laid the \n     foundation as a nutrition program for all children, and\n       Whereas, this vision enacted into legislation in 1946 has \n     provided the framework for the growth of Child Nutrition \n     Programs, which began as a single meal, and has been expanded \n     many times by many Congressional sessions promoted by the \n     leaders in Congress to a year round, all day program serving \n     breakfast, lunch, after school supplements, summer food \n     service, and the child and adult care food program, and\n       Whereas, the leadership and commitment of Senator Richard \n     B. Russell as Chairman of the US Senate Committee on \n     Agriculture and Forestry in close collaboration with a bi-\n     partisan group in the Senate and a collaborative relationship \n     with the US House of Representatives, persisted through 10 \n     years of year-to-year appropriations for the program and two \n     long years of debate and resulted in the enactment of \n     permanent legislation that established an infrastructure for \n     the school lunch program and a framework for all child \n     nutrition programs, and\n       Whereas, his leadership for the program did not stop at \n     that point as he had a major role in having the school lunch \n     program designated as an educational program in the states as \n     many state agencies were vying to have administration of the \n     program, and\n       Whereas his leadership continued into the 1960's during his \n     final years in the US Senate when he was Chair of the Armed \n     Services Committee, and he provided leadership to have the \n     apportionment formula changed to allocate money to the states \n     on the number of meals served rather than on state enrollment \n     of children,\n\n\n    the georgia school food service association therefore recommends\n\n       That the General Assembly of Georgia be requested to adopt \n     this resolution in support of Senator Cleland's proposal to \n     have the National School Lunch Act of 1946 renamed the \n     Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, and\n       The American School Food Service Association be requested \n     to provide support for Senator Cleland's proposal for \n     permanently associating Senator Russell's name with the NSLA, \n     which would be an appropriate memorial to his leadership in \n     authoring legislation that established the foundation for a \n     program that has been successful for more than half-a-\n     century, and,\n       The GSFSA expresses its appreciation to Senator Max Cleland \n     for recognizing the importance of memorializing Senator \n     Russell\n\n[[Page S2509]]\n\n     as ``the father of the school lunch program'' by attaching \n     his name to the Act, and pledges its support to Senator \n     Cleland in having his proposal turned into reality, and \n     finally,\n       That copies of this resolution be provided all members of \n     the Georgia Congressional delegation as a means of seeking \n     their support for honoring an outstanding statesman from \n     Georgia who has been memorialized in many ways, including \n     having a Senate Office Building named in his honor, but has \n     never been publicly honored for the ``piece of legislation \n     that he often claimed to be his proudest work'' that of the \n     passage of the NSLA, as it served all children, the education \n     program and the agriculture programs of the nation. ``this \n     program has been one of the most helpful ones which has been \n     inaugurated and promises to contribute more to the cause of \n     public education in these United States than has any other \n     policy which has been adopted since the creation of free \n     public schools.''--Richard B. Russell, Feb. 26, 1946.

A bill to provide for injunctive relief in Federal district \ncourt to enforce State laws relating to the interstate transportation \nof intoxicating liquors; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               The Twenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Twenty-\nFirst Amendment Enforcement Act. This legislation will provide a \nmechanism enabling States to more effectively enforce their laws \nregulating the interstate shipment of alcoholic beverages.\n  Interstate shipments of alcohol directly to consumers are increasing \nexponentially. Unfortunately, along with that growing commerce, \nproblems associated with that trade are also growing. While I certainly \nbelieve that interstate commerce should be encouraged, and while I do \nnot want small businesses stifled by unnecessary or overly burdensome \nand complex regulations, I do not subscribe to the notion that \npurveyors of alcohol are free to avoid State laws which are consistent \nwith the power bestowed upon them by the Twenty-First Amendment.\n  All States, including the State of Utah, need to be sure that the \nliquor that is brought into their State is labelled properly and \nsubject to certain quality control standards. States need to protect \ntheir citizens from consumer fraud and have a claim to the tax revenue \ngenerated by the sale of such goods. And of the utmost importance, \nStates need to ensure that minors are not provided with unfettered \naccess to alcohol. Unfortunately, indiscriminate direct sales of \nalcohol have opened a sophisticated generation of minors to the perils \nof alcohol abuse.\n  I can tell you that my home State of Utah, which has some of the \nstrictest controls in the nation on the distribution of alcohol, is not \nimmune from the dangers of direct sales. A recent story which ran on \nKUTV in Salt Lake City showed how a thirteen year old was able to \npurchase beer over the internet and have it shipped directly to her \nhome--no questions asked. If a thirteen year old is capable of ordering \nbeer and having it delivered by merely borrowing her brother's credit \ncard and making a few clicks with her mouse, there is something very \nwrong with the level of control that is being exercised over these \nsales. Of course the Utah case is not an isolated example. Stings set \nup by authorities in New York and Maryland have also shown how easy it \nis for minors to obtain alcohol.\n  Debate over the control of alcoholic beverages has been raging for as \nlong as this country has existed. Prior to 1933, every time individuals \nor legislative bodies engaged in efforts to control the flow and \nconsumption of alcohol, whether by moral persuasion, legislation or \nConstitutional Prohibition, others were equally determined to repeal, \ncircumvent or ignore those barriers. However, the Twenty-First \nAmendment did, for a time, create an ordered system for the \ndistribution of alcohol.\n  The Twenty-First Amendment was ratified in 1933. That amendment ceded \nto the States the right to regulate the importation and transportation \nof alcoholic beverages across their borders. By virtue of that grant of \nauthority, each State created its own unique regulatory scheme to \ncontrol the flow of alcohol. Some set up State stores to effectuate \ncontrol of the shipment into, and dissemination of alcohol within, \ntheir State. Others refrained from direct control of the product, but \nset up other systems designed to monitor the shipments and ensure \ncompliance with its laws. But whatever the type of State system \nenacted, the purpose was much the same: to protect its citizens and \nensure that its laws were obeyed.\n  Although not perfect, the systems set up by the States worked \nreasonably well for many years. However, modern technology has opened \nthe door for abuse and created the need for further governmental action \nto address those abuses. No longer must a State prosecute just an \nerrant neighborhood retailer for selling to a minor--now, the ones \nselling to minors and others in violation of a State's regulatory laws \nare a continent away. A small winery can create its own web page and \naccept orders over the internet; a large retailer can advertise \nnationally in the New York Times and accept orders over the phone; an \nad can be placed in a magazine with a national circulation offering \nsales through an 800 number.\n  Let me emphasize that there are many companies engaged in the direct \ninterstate shipment of alcohol who do not violate State laws. In fact, \nmany of these concerns look beyond their own interests and make \ndiligent efforts to disseminate information to others to ensure that \nState laws are understood and complied with by all within the \ninterstate industry.\n  I should also note that I am certainly sympathetic to the small \nwineries and specialty micro-breweries who feel that the requirement \nthat they operate through a three tier system (producer-wholesaler-\nretailer) which does not embrace them may, in effect, shut them out of \nthe marketplace. They make the argument that if wholesalers do not \ncarry their product, they have no other avenue to the consumer other \nthan through direct sales. However, if there is a problem with the \nsystem, we need to fix the system, not break the laws.\n  Federal law already prohibits the interstate shipment of alcohol in \nviolation of State law. Unfortunately that general prohibition lacks \nany enforcement mechanism. The legislation I am introducing simply \nprovides that mechanism by permitting the Attorney General of a State, \nwho has reasonable cause to believe that his or her State laws \nregulating the importation and transportation of alcohol are being \nviolated, to be permitted to file an action in federal court for an \ninjunction to stop those illegal shipments.\n  This bill is balanced to ensure due process and fairness to both the \nState bringing the action and the company or individual alleged to have \nviolated the State's laws. The bill:\n  1. Permits the chief law enforcement officer of a State to seek an \ninjunction in federal court to prevent the violation of its laws \nregulating the importation or transportation of alcohol;\n  2. Allows for venue for the suit where the defendant resides and \nwhere the violations occur;\n  3. Does not require the posting of a bond by the requesting party;\n  4. Does not permit an injunction without notice to the opposing \nparty;\n  5. Requires that any injunction be specific as to the parties, the \nconduct and the rationale underlying that injunction;\n  6. Allows for quick consideration of the application for an \ninjunction and conserves court resources by avoiding redundant \nproceedings;\n  7. Mandates a bench trial; and\n  8. Does not preclude other remedies allowed by law.\n  Some will argue that State courts are capable of handling this issue. \nUnfortunately, States have had mixed success in enforcing their laws \nthrough State court actions. Companies and individuals have raised \njurisdictional, procedural and legal defenses that have stalled those \nefforts, and that continue to hamper effective enforcement. It is, in \npart, because of those inconsistent rulings, that federal leadership is \nneeded in this area.\n  Moreover, the scope and limitations of a State's ability to \neffectively enact laws under the Twenty-First Amendment are essentially \nfederal questions that need to be decided by a federal court, and \nperhaps ultimately, by the Supreme Court. Only through such rulings can \nboth the States and companies seeking to conduct interstate shipments \nbe assured of consistency in interpretation and enforcement of the \nlaws.\n\n[[Page S2510]]\n\n  The introduction of a bill is just the beginning of the legislative \nprocess. It is my hope that, working together, we can reach an \nagreement on how best to balance legitimate commercial interests with \nthe Constitutional rights of the States as ceded to them by the Twenty-\nFirst Amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 577\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to ensure confidentiality with respect to medical \nrecords and health care-related information, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n     the health care personal information nondisclosure act of 1998\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I am pleased to join the Chairman of the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Senator Jeffords, in \nintroducing the Health Care Personal Information Nondisclosure (PIN) \nAct of 1999. This legislation is designed to offer Americans the peace \nof mind that comes with knowing that their most personal and private \nmedical information is protected from misuse and exploitation.\n  Medicine has changed dramatically since the time Norman Rockwell \npainted the scene of a doctor examining his young patient's doll. The \nflow of medical information is no longer confined to doctor-patient \nconversations and hospital charts. Recent technological advances have \nintroduced more efficient methods of organizing data that allow \ninformation to be shared instantaneously--helping to contain costs--and \neven save lives.\n  But in the view of many Americans, the widespread sharing of medical \nrecords without appropriate safeguards, even in the pursuit of \nadmirable goals, creates a staggering potential for abuse.\n  In fact, concerns that medical information is not being adequately \nprotected from misuse has led some patients to avoid full disclosure of \nmental health or other sensitive conditions to their physicians and to \nunnecessarily forego opportunities for treatment--in effect negating \nthe benefits of the new technology.\n  The Health Care PIN Act offers the privacy protections that the \npublic demands. This legislation sets clear guidelines for the use and \ndisclosure of medical information by health care providers, \nresearchers, insurers, employers and others. The Health Care PIN Act \nprovides individuals with control over their most personal information, \nyet promotes the efficient exchange of health data for the purposes of \ntreatment, payment, research and oversight. To ensure the \naccountability of entities and individuals with access to personal \nmedical information, the legislation impose stiff penalties for \nunauthorized disclosures.\n  Just as you lock your doors to protect your home, this measure can \nact as deadbolt against those who would exploit your medical privacy.\n  This legislation represents common-sense middle ground in the range \nof proposals that have been offered both this and the previous \nCongress. I look forward to working with Senator Jeffords, as well as \nwith Senators Bennett, Leahy, and Kennedy, who have contributed so much \nto this debate, to move forward quickly to enact comprehensive, \nbipartisan legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 581. A bill to protect the Paoli and Brandywine Battlefields in \nPennsylvania, to authorize a Valley Forge Museum of the American \nRevolution at Valley Forge National Historical Park, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n            pennsylvania battlefields protection act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce the Pennsylvania Battlefields Protection Act, legislation \nwhich will protect two important Revolutionary War sites in \nPennsylvania and authorize the construction and operation of a new \nmuseum and visitor center dedicated to the American Revolution at \nValley Forge National Historical Park. Representative Curt Weldon has \nintroduced similar legislation in the House, with the remaining twenty \nMembers of the Pennsylvania House delegation joining him in this \neffort.\n  The first part of this legislation authorizes $3 million for the \nacquisition of the 472-acre area generally known as the Meetinghouse \nRoad Corridor, where the largest engagement of the American Revolution, \nthe Battle of Brandywine, took place from September 10-11,\n\n[[Page S2511]]\n\n1777. During the 1777 British campaign to capture Philadelphia, British \nGeneral William Howe defeated but proved unable to demoralize General \nGeorge Washington's Continental Army of 12,500 men at the Battle of \nBrandywine.\n  While George Washington's and the Marquis de Lafayette's headquarters \nare preserved as part of the Brandywine Battlefield Park, the area \nwhere the actual fighting took place is not. The land is privately held \nand is in immediate danger of being sold and developed. The battlefield \nwas declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961, and local officials, \npreservation groups, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have been \nworking together to protect the battlefield. This legislation will \nprovide half of the $6 million needed to purchase the land from willing \nbuyers, with the remaining $3 million to be raised from non-federal \nsources on a dollar for dollar basis. As with all aspects of this \nlegislation, I have worked closely with the National Park Service, and \nthey are supportive of federal assistance to protect this important \nRevolutionary War site.\n  This legislation will also protect the Paoli Battlefield, in Malvern, \nPennsylvania, where at least fifty-three Americans were killed. Shortly \nafter the Battle of Brandywine, General Washington ordered General \n``Mad'' Anthony Wayne and 2,000 of his men to move to the rear and \ncontain the British army. The British learned of General Wayne's move \nand attacked and bayoneted Wayne's men on September 20, 1777 in what \nhas infamously become known as the Paoli massacre.\n  While the Senate passed legislation which I introduced late in the \n105th Congress to authorize the addition of the Paoli Battlefield site \nto Valley Forge National Historical Park, at that time the bill did not \nenjoy the support of the National Park Service and eventually died in \nthe House of Representatives. I have worked with Congressman Weldon on \nthis legislation, and we believe that the federal government should \nprovide assistance to acquire the 40-acre Paoli Battlefield, an \nunprotected Revolutionary War site that is privately owned by the \nMalvern Preparatory School. The School intends to sell the land in \norder to strengthen its endowment, but officials have agreed to give \nthe community a first chance to purchase the land for historical \npreservation purposes. Thus, the Paoli Battlefield will become open to \nresidential or commercial development if $2.5 million is not raised by \nSeptember 1999 to purchase the land. This bill envisions a combination \nof public and private financing to purchase the battlefield by \nauthorizing a purchase price of $2.5 million with not less than $1 \nmillion in nonfederal funds. After much consultation with the National \nPark Service, I am now informed that they are supportive of this \napproach to protecting Paoli Battlefield.\n  The bill also authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into \na cooperative agreement with the Borough of Malvern, which has agreed \nto manage the 45-acre Paoli Battlefield site in perpetuity. A similar \nprovision authorizes the Secretary of Interior to enter into a \ncooperative agreement with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the \nBrandywine Conservancy to manage the Meetinghouse Road Corridor area of \nthe Brandywine Battlefield. Moreover, the bill directs the Secretary of \nInterior to undertake a resource study of Paoli and Brandywine \nBattlefields to identify the full range of their resources and historic \nthemes and alternatives for National Park Service involvement at these \ntwo sites.\n  Finally, the last section of the bill authorizes the Secretary of \nInterior to enter into an agreement with the private, non-profit Valley \nForge Historical Society to construct and operate a museum and visitor \ncenter within the boundaries of Valley Forge National Historical Park. \nAfter the Battles of Brandywine, the Clouds, Paoli, Germantown, and \nWhitemarsh, the Continental Army made Valley Forge its camp from \nDecember 19, 1777 to June 19, 1778, when it emerged as a new, better \nequipped, and well trained American army. Currently, there is no museum \nin the United States dedicated to the American Revolution. I believe it \nis important that Congress provide the authorization to bring this \nworthwhile project to fruition, which will not only tell the story of \nthe Philadelphia campaign, but the story of the entire American \nRevolution as well.\n  This museum will combine the holdings of the Valley Forge National \nHistorical Park and the Valley Forge Historical Society, making it the \nlargest collection of Revolutionary War era artifacts in the world. The \nValley Forge Historical Society, established in 1918, has a long \nhistory of service to the park, and has amassed one of the best \ncollections of artifacts, art, books, and documents relating to the \n1777-1778 encampment of the Continental Army at Valley Forge, the \nAmerican Revolution, and the American colonial era. Their collection is \ncurrently housed in a facility that is inadequate to properly maintain, \npreserve, and display the Society's ever-growing collection. \nConstruction of a new facility will rectify this situation.\n  This project is supported by local officials, and a new facility is \npart of the Valley Forge National Historical Park's General Management \nPlan, which has identified inadequacies in the park's current visitor \ncenter and calls for the development of a new or significantly \nrenovated museum and visitor center. The museum will educate an \nestimated 500,000 visitors a year about the critical events surrounding \nthe birth of our nation.\n  This legislation authorizes the Valley Forge Historical Society to \noperate the museum in cooperation with the Secretary of Interior. This \nproject will directly support the historical, educational, and \ninterpretive activities and needs of Valley Forge National Historical \nPark and the Valley Forge Historical Society while combining two \noutstanding museum collections.\n  Mr. President, too many important historical sites, especially \nRevolutionary War battlefields, have already been lost to residential \nand commercial development. The 105th Congress made a commitment to \nprotecting battlefield sites. I have been pleased to support these \nefforts as well as the successful effort to obtain funding in the FY99 \nInterior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill to begin conducting \nthe Revolutionary War and War of 1812 Historic Preservation Study. I \nhope the 106th Congress will continue that commitment by protecting the \nBrandywine and Paoli Battlefields. In addition, this legislation holds \nenormous potential for all Americans to learn about our country's rich \nhistory by establishing a new visitor center and museum at Valley Forge \nNational Historical Park, which will then be better able to tell the \nstory of the American Revolution. I therefore urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 582. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter \ninto an agreement for the construction and operation of the Gateway \nVisitor Center at Independence National Historical Park; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n            gateway visitor center authorization act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nreintroduce legislation to authorize the operation of the Gateway \nVisitor Center in Independence National Historical Park in \nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania. Similar legislation has already been \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by Representatives Robert \nBorski, Curt Weldon, and Robert Brady.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, Independence National Historical \nPark is one of the National Park Service's crown jewels, home to the \nLiberty Bell and Independence Hall and the birthplace of the \nConstitution and the Declaration of Independence. In the Spring of \n1997, the Final General Management Plan for Independence Park was \nreleased, which spells out the vision for the Park for the next fifteen \nyears. The first block of Independence Mall will contain a new home for \nthe Liberty Bell, the second block the Gateway Visitor Center, and the \nthird block the National Constitution Center. The revitalization of \nIndependence Mall is well underway, but legislation is needed to fully \nimplement the General Management Plan with regards to the Gateway \nVisitor Center.\n  The National Park Service is aware that this type of site-specific \nlegislation is necessary for the Gateway Visitor Center. I have worked \nclosely with the National Park Service and the Gateway Visitor Center \nCorporation in\n\n[[Page S2512]]\n\ndeveloping this legislation, and the National Park Service expressed \nits full support for this legislation during hearings held in the 105th \nCongress.\n  I would note that the $24 million needed to construct the Gateway \nVisitor Center has already been committed, with the City of \nPhiladelphia contributing $5 million, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \n$10 million, and various Foundations $15 million, of which $6 million \nwill fund an endowment. The legislation I am introducing today merely \nprovides the authorization for the operation of the Center. The Gateway \nVisitor Center will be financially self-sustaining, with only a modest \ncontribution coming from the National Park Service for operations and \nmaintenance.\n  While the Gateway Visitor Center will provide the traditional \nservices to visitors to the Park, the Center will also provide some \nservices which are somewhat beyond the scope of existing National Park \nService legislation. In addition to its role as the Park's primary \nvisitor center, providing visitor orientation to the Park, the city, \nand the region as a whole, the Gateway Visitor Center will be permitted \nto charge fees, conduct events, and sell merchandise, tickets, and food \nto visitors to the Center. These activities will allow the Gateway \nVisitor Center to meet its parkwide, citywide and regional missions \nwhile defraying the operating and management expenses of the Center.\n  The current visitor center in Independence National Historical Park \nis poorly located, making it underutilized and inconvenient to the \nmillions of people who visit the Park each year. The Gateway Visitor \nCenter will serve far more people than ever possible with the current \nfacility by providing information, interpretation, facilities, and \nservices to visitors to the Park, its surrounding historic areas, the \nCity of Philadelphia, and the region in order to assist visitors in \ntheir enjoyment of the historical, cultural, educational, and \nrecreational resources of the area. The Gateway Visitor Center will be \na major asset for the Park and critical to the central management goal \naddressed in the General Management Plan of creating an outstanding \nvisitor experience. The Gateway Visitor Center holds enormous potential \nfor Independence National Historical Park and the greater Philadelphia \nregion as a whole, and I therefore urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (by request):\n  S. 583. A bill to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act to authorize programs for pre-disaster \nmitigation, to streamline the administration of disaster relief, to \ncontrol the Federal costs of disaster assistance, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                    disaster mitigation act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today, at the administration's request, I \nam introducing the Disaster Mitigation Act of 1999. This bill is \ndesigned to promote pre-disaster mitigation and streamline the \noperations of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n  Last year, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, \nwhich has oversight over FEMA, considered S. 2361, legislation authored \nby Senators Inhofe and Graham that was based in part on the \nadministration's 1997 proposal. While S. 2361 was reported by the \ncommittee, it was not considered by the Senate before it adjourned last \nNovember.\n  I believe it makes sense for Congress and FEMA to pay attention to \npre-disaster mitigation efforts--i.e., the steps that can be taken \nbefore a disaster strikes. It also makes sense for us to ensure that \nFEMA's operations are streamlined so that the administering of disaster \nrelief proceeds as smoothly and efficiently as possible. Taking these \nsteps not only would be easier on the budget, but also would help \nprevent needless human suffering.\n  It is my hope that working with the administration, we will be able \nto craft legislation that will accomplish our goals. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues and administration officials toward that \nend.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 583\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Disaster \n     Mitigation Act of 1999''.\n       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act \n     is as follows:\nSec. 1.

Stafford Disaster \n     Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.).\n\n                TITLE I--PREDISASTER HAZARDS MITIGATION\n\n     SEC. 101. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) natural disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis, \n     tornadoes, hurricanes and flooding, cause great danger to \n     human life and to property throughout the United States.\n       (2) greater emphasis needs to be placed on identifying and \n     assessing the risks to State and local communities and on \n     implementing adequate measures to reduce losses from such \n     disasters, and to ensure that communities' critical public \n     infrastructure and facilities will continue to function after \n     a disaster.\n       (3) expenditures for post-disaster assistance are \n     increasing without commensurate reductions in the likelihood \n     of future losses from such natural disasters;\n       (4) high priority in the expenditure of Federal funds under \n     this Act should be given to mitigate hazards for existing and \n     new construction at the local level;\n       (5) with a unified effort of economic incentives, awareness \n     and education, technical assistance, and demonstrated Federal \n     support, States and local communities can form effective \n     community-based partnerships for hazard mitigation purposes, \n     implement effective hazards mitigation measures that reduce \n     the existing disaster potential, ensure continued \n     functionality of communities' critical public infrastructure, \n     leverage additional non-Federal resources into their disaster \n     resistance goals, and make commitments to long-term \n     mitigation efforts in new and existing construction.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish a \n     national disaster mitigation program that--\n       (1) reduces the loss of life and property, human suffering, \n     economic disruption and disaster assistance costs resulting \n     from natural hazards, and\n       (2) provides a source of pre-disaster mitigation funding \n     that will assist states and local governments in implementing \n     effective mitigation measures that are designed to ensure the \n     continued functionality of their critical facilities and \n     public infrastructure after a natural disaster.\n\n     SEC. 102. PRE-DISASTER HAZARD MITIGATION.\n\n       (a) Title II of the Act is amended by adding new section \n     203 as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 203.

Stafford Disaster \n     Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. This section states that \n     unless otherwise specified, any amendment or repeal of a \n     section or provision shall be considered to be made to the \n     Stafford Act.\n\n\n                 title i--predisaster hazard mitigation\n\n       Sec. 101. Findings and purpose. Adopts the findings and \n     statement of purpose found in S. 2361, 105th Congress. \n     Section 101 describes four findings of Congress: (1) greater \n     emphasis needs to be placed on hazard identification and \n     hazard mitigation, (2) expenditures for disaster assistance \n     are increasing without evidence of potential reduction of \n     future losses, (3) a high priority should be placed on the \n     implementation or predisaster mitigation activities, and (4) \n     a unified effort will be successful in reducing future losses \n     from natural disasters.\n       These findings signal the importance of commitments by \n     States and local communities to long-term disaster mitigation \n     efforts (including developing appropriate construction \n     standards, practices and materials) for new and existing \n     structures. Such commitments can help reduce the rise of \n     future damage to life and property and ensure that critical \n     facilities and public infrastructure will function after a \n     disaster strikes.\n       Sec. 102. Pre-Disaster Hazard Mitigation. Section 102 \n     creates a new Section 203 in the Stafford Act that authorizes \n     the Director to establish a program for States, local \n     governments, and other entities for carrying out predisaster \n     mitigation activities that exhibit long-term, cost-effective \n     benefits and substantially reduce the risk of future damage \n     from major disasters. For the purposes of this section, the \n     term ``entities'' refers to governmental entities of the \n     State or local government, regional planning organizations, \n     governmental units organized along watershed or other \n     planning foci, or tribal governments.\n       In selecting a site, the Director must consider the \n     likelihood of damage resulting from a natural disaster; the \n     identification of cost effective mitigation activities with \n     meaningful outcomes; the consistency with State mitigation \n     programs; the opportunity to maximize net benefits to \n     society; the ability of a State or local government or entity \n     to fund mitigation activities; private sector interest; and \n     other criteria established in coordination with State and \n     local governments. The Director must take into account\n\n[[Page S2515]]\n\n     the level and nature of risks to be mitigated, grantee \n     commitment to reduce damages from future disasters, and \n     commitment by the State or local government to support \n     ongoing non-Federal support for the mitigation measures to be \n     undertaken when establishing priorities for pre-disaster \n     mitigation grants.\n       With regard to mitigation activities, this section requires \n     the President and the States to consult on a list of those \n     activities that are appropriate, and delegates decisions \n     regarding selections from the list to local governments.\n       States receiving financial assistance under this section \n     may use the assistance to fund activities to disseminate \n     information about cost-effective mitigation technologies. \n     Certain construction standards, practices, and materials have \n     been proven effective in mitigating the risks or impacts of \n     actual natural disasters. Public awareness of these \n     technologies can allow communities to make informed decisions \n     that can substantially reduce the risk of future damage, \n     hardship or suffering from a major disaster.\n       Sec. 103. Maximum contribution for mitigation costs. \n     Section 103 amends Section 404(a) of the Stafford Act by \n     changing maximum hazard mitigation contributions from 15% to \n     20% of aggregate amount of grants. The changes made by this \n     section are applicable to all major disasters declared after \n     January 1, 1999.\n       Sec. 104. Conforming amendment. This section amends to the \n     heading of Title II to read ``Title II--Disaster Preparedness \n     and Mitigation Assistance''.\n\n\n       TITLE II--DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND MITIGATION ASSISTANCE.\n\n       Sec. 201. Insurance. Section 201 amends Sec. 311(a)(2) of \n     the Stafford Act to authorize the President to require by \n     regulation that States, communities or other applicants \n     protect property through self-insurance or adequate \n     mitigation measures if the State's insurance commissioner \n     certifies that insurance is not reasonably available. Under \n     current law if the State insurance commissioner certifies \n     that insurance is not reasonably available, an applicant need \n     not take any further action to insure or mitigate the \n     property against future damage. This provision authorizes the \n     President to require further action to reduce future \n     potential damage to the affected property.\n       Sec. 202. Management costs. Section 203 adds a new Section \n     322 to the Stafford Act. It provides a definition for \n     management costs and directs the President to establish \n     management cost reimbursement rates, subject to periodic \n     review, for grantees and subgrantees receiving assistance \n     under the Act. Appropriate costs are to be established by \n     Federal regulation. The current reimbursement system will \n     remain in effect for disasters declared before the new rates \n     are established.\n       Sec. 203. Assistance to repair, restore, reconstruct, or \n     replace damaged facilities. Section 203 amends and \n     reorganizes the section of the Stafford Act (Section 406) \n     that provides authority to the President to make \n     contributions to a State, local government, or person for the \n     repair, restoration, or replacement of public facilities or \n     private nonprofit facilities. As amended, this section \n     establishes a minimum Federal share of 75 percent of the \n     cost of such activities. Section 203 would also amend \n     Section 206 to authorize reduction in Federal disaster \n     assistance for facilities which had received disaster \n     assistance in the past and for which insurance had not \n     been maintained since receipt of the disaster assistance.\n       This section also sets new rules for cost estimates by \n     allowing the cost of repairs in situations where the actual \n     cost is above 120 percent or below 80 percent of the \n     estimated cost to be reconsidered. In addition, it directs \n     the President to establish an expert panel for development of \n     procedures for cost estimations.\n       Sec. 204. Federal assistance to households. Section 204(a) \n     amends Section 408 of the Stafford Act to combine the Housing \n     and Individual and Family Grant (IFG) Programs. As amended, \n     this section establishes the type of assistance available for \n     housing, repairs, and construction, and caps total assistance \n     per individual or household under the combined program at \n     $25,000 per major disaster. It authorizes the President to \n     assist individuals by replacing their homes under certain \n     conditions or allowing them to rent alternate housing \n     accommodations, and by providing financial assistance for \n     medical, dental, funeral, personal property, and \n     transportation expenses. The President is to issue \n     regulations to determine eligibility for assistance.\n       Section 204(b) deletes the term ``temporary housing'' from \n     Sec. 502(a)(6) of the Stafford Act. Section 502 specifies and \n     limits the emergency assistance that the President may \n     provide when he declares an emergency under the Act. \n     Paragraph (a)(6) states that he may provide ``temporary \n     housing assistance'' under Sec. 408 of the Act. This \n     amendment would give the President authority to provide \n     assistance under Sec. 408, which would encompass both housing \n     and assistance to individuals and households in the \n     consolidated section.\n       Sec. 204(c) repeals the Individual and Family Grant \n     programs, which under this legislation are consolidated with \n     the Temporary Housing program.\n       Sec. 205. Repeals. Section 205 repeals Section 406(f) and \n     Section 417 of the Stafford Act (providing for Associated \n     Expenses and for Community Disaster Loans), as well as \n     Section 422 (regarding simplified procedure), in order to \n     conform with the amendment made under Section 202(d) of the \n     bill.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       Ramseyer/Cordon Comparison\n\n    Materials deleted within bold brackets [  ], new text in italic.\n\n     SEC. 101. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (d) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) natural disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis, \n     tornadoes, hurricanes and flooding, cause great danger to \n     human life and to property throughout the United States.\n       (2) greater emphasis needs to be placed on identifying and \n     assessing the risks to State and local communities and on \n     implementing adequate measures to reduce losses from such \n     disasters, and to ensure that communities' critical public \n     infrastructure and facilities will continue to function after \n     a disaster.\n       (3) expenditures for post-disaster assistance are \n     increasing without commensurate reductions in the likelihood \n     of future losses from such natural disasters;\n       (4) high priority in the expenditure of Federal funds under \n     this Act should be given to mitigate hazards for existing and \n     new construction at the local level;\n       (5) with a unified effort of economic incentives, awareness \n     and education, technical assistance, and demonstrated Federal \n     support, States and local communities can form effective \n     community-based partnerships for hazard mitigation purposes, \n     implement effective hazards mitigation measures that reduce \n     the existing disaster potential, ensure continued \n     functionality of communities' critical public infrastructure, \n     leverage additional non-Federal resources into their disaster \n     resistance goals, and make commitments to long-term \n     mitigation efforts in new and existing construction.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish a \n     national disaster mitigation program that--\n       (1) reduces the loss of life and property, human suffering, \n     economic disruption and disaster assistance costs resulting \n     from natural hazards, and\n       (2) provides a source of pre-disaster mitigation funding \n     that will assist states and local governments in implementing \n     effective mitigation measures that are designed to ensure the \n     continued functionality of their critical facilities and \n     public infrastructure after a natural disaster.\n\n     SEC. 102.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \npermit the Secretary of Health and Human Services to waive recoupment \nunder the medicaid program of certain tobacco-related funds received by \na State if a State uses a portion of such funds for tobacco use \nprevention and health care and early learning programs; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n  Children's Smoking Prevention, Health, and Early Learning Trust Fund\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which \nwill insure that the federal share of the state Medicaid settlements \nnegotiated with the tobacco industry is used by the states to prevent \nyouth smoking, to improve health care, and to promote child \ndevelopment. Fifty-seven cents of every Medicaid dollar spent by the \nstates comes from the federal government. The cost of Medicaid \nexpenditures to treat people suffering from smoking-induced disease was \nat the core of state lawsuits against the tobacco industry. While the \nfederal government could legally demand that the states reimburse \nWashington from their settlements, I believe the states should be \nallowed to keep one hundred percent of the money. However, the federal \nshare should be used by the states for programs that will advance the \ngoals of protecting children and enhancing public health which were at \nthe heart of the litigation and are consistent with the purposes of \nMedicaid. That would be an eminently fair and reasonable compromise of \nthis contentious issue.\n  While there were a variety of claims made by the states against the \ntobacco industry, the Medicaid dollars used to treat tobacco-related \nillness constituted by far the largest claim monetarily, and it formed \nthe basis for the national settlement. As part of that settlement, \nevery state released the tobacco companies from federal Medicaid \nliability, as well as state Medicaid liability. Medicaid expenditures \nheavily influenced the distribution formula used to divide the national \nsettlement amongst the states. In light of these undeniable facts, the \ndollars obtained by the states from their settlements cannot now be \ndivorced from Medicaid. States are free to use the state share of their \nrecoveries in any way they choose. However, Congress has a vital \ninterest in how the federal share will be used.\n  My legislation would require states to use half of the amount of \nmoney they receive from the tobacco industry each year (the federal \nshare) to protect children and improve public health. At least thirty-\nfive percent of the federal share would be spent on programs to deter \nyouth smoking and to help smokers overcome their addiction. This would \ninclude a broad range of tobacco control initiatives, including school \nand community based tobacco use prevention programs, counter-\nadvertising to discourage smoking, cessation programs, and enforcement \nof the ban on sale to minors. Three thousand children start smoking \nevery day, and one thousand of them will die prematurely as a result of \ntobacco-induced disease. Prevention of youth smoking should be, without \nquestion, our highest priority for the use of these funds. The state \nsettlements provide the resources to dissuade millions of teenagers \nfrom smoking, to break the cycle of addiction and early death. We must \nseize that opportunity.\n  The remainder of the federal share would be available for states to \nuse to fund health care and early learning initiatives which they \nselect. States can either use the additional resources to supplement \nexisting programs in these\n\n[[Page S2519]]\n\nareas, or to fund creative new state initiatives to improve public \nhealth and promote child development.\n  Smoking has long been America's foremost preventable cause of disease \nand early death. It has consumed an enormous amount of the nation's \nhealth care resources. Finally, resources taken from the tobacco \ncompanies would be used to improve the nation's health. A state could, \nfor example, use a portion of this money to help senior citizens pay \nfor prescription drugs, or to provide expanded health care services to \nthe uninsured. Funds could be used to support community health centers, \nto reduce public health risks, or to make health insurance more \naffordable.\n  For years, the tobacco companies callously targeted children as \nfuture smokers. The financial success of the entire industry was based \nupon addicting kids when they were too young to appreciate the health \nrisks of smoking. It is particularly appropriate that resources taken \nfrom this malignant industry be used to give our children a better \nstart in life. States could use a portion of these funds to improve \nearly learning opportunities for young children, or to expand child \ncare services, or for other child development initiatives.\n  Congress has a compelling interest in how the federal share of these \ndollars is used. They are Medicaid dollars. They should not be used for \nroad repair or building maintenance. They should be used by the states \nto create a healthier future for all our citizens, and particularly for \nour children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day":

ATTEMPT TO RESTORE ITS INDEPENDENCE\n\n  Mr. MACK (for himself, Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Lott) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 60\n\n       Whereas during the period 1949-1950, the newly established \n     communist government of the People's Republic of China sent \n     an army to invade Tibet;\n       Whereas the Tibetan army was ill equipped and out-numbered, \n     and the People's Liberation Army overwhelmed Tibetan \n     defenses;\n       Whereas, on May 23, 1951, a delegation sent from the \n     capital city of Lhasa to Peking to negotiate with the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China was forced under \n     duress to accept a Chinese-drafted 17-point agreement that \n     incorporated Tibet into China but promised to preserve \n     Tibetan political, cultural, and religious institutions;\n       Whereas during the period of 1951-1959, the failure of the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China to uphold \n     guarantees to autonomy contained in the 17-Point Agreement \n     and the imposition of socialist reforms resulted in \n     widespread oppression and brutality;\n       Whereas on March 10, 1959 the people of Lhasa, fearing for \n     the life of the Dalai Lama, surrounded his palace, organized \n     a permanent guard, and called for the withdrawal of the \n     Chinese from Tibet and the restoration of Tibet's \n     independence;\n       Whereas on March 17, 1959 the Dalai Lama escaped in \n     disguise during the night after two mortar shells exploded \n     within the walls of his palace and, before crossing the \n     Indian border into exile two weeks later, repudiated the 17-\n     Point Agreement;\n       Whereas during the ``Lhasa Revolt'' begun on March 10, \n     1959, Chinese statistics estimate 87,000 Tibetans were \n     killed, arrested, or deported to labor camps, and only a \n     small percentage of the thousands who attempted to escape to \n     India survived Chinese military attacks, malnutrition, cold, \n     and disease;\n       Whereas for the past forty years, the Dalai Lama has worked \n     in exile to find ways to allow Tibetans to determine the \n     future status of Tibet and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize \n     for his efforts in 1989;\n       Whereas it is the policy of the United States to support \n     substantive dialogue between the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China and the Dalai Lama or his representatives; \n     and\n       Whereas the Dalai Lama has stated his willingness to \n     negotiate within the framework enunciated by Deng Xiaoping in \n     1979: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) March 10, 1999 should be recognized as ``Tibetan \n     National Day'' in solemn remembrance of those Tibetans who \n     sacrificed, suffered, or died as a result of Chinese \n     aggression against their country and of the inherent right of \n     the Tibetan people to reject tyranny and to determine their \n     own political future, including independence, if they so \n     determine; and\n       (2) March 10 of each year should serve as an occasion to \n     renew calls by the President, Congress, and other United \n     States Government officials on the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China to enter into serious negotiations with the \n     Dalai Lama or his representatives until such a time as a \n     peaceful solution, satisfactory to both sides, is achieved.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the Tibetan people are suffering today in \nthe name of freedom, and I am pleased to rise with Senator Moynihan to \nsubmit a resolution in solemn commemoration of this day, March 10, in \nTibetan history.\n  It was on March 10, 1959 that the Tibetan people said, ``enough is \nenough.'' The city of Lhasa organized into what later became known as \nthe ``Lhasa revolt'' on this day forty years ago, to protect their \nbeloved leader, the 14th Dalai Lama, and to reject the impositions of \nBeijing. Let me provide some details.\n  The new communist government in Beijing sent an army to invade Tibet \nin 1949. The People's Liberation Army quickly overwhelmed Tibetan \ndefenses. In 1951, a Tibetan delegation went to Beijing to negotiate a \npeace agreement. But negotiation is too kind of a word. The Tibetan \ndelegation was forced to sign a PRC-written document known as the ``17 \nPoint Agreement.'' Even though it was forced upon the Tibetan \ngovernment, it promised to preserve Tibetan political, cultural, and \nreligious institutions, and so was warily accepted by the Tibetan \ngovernment.\n  Mr. President, going back to the early days of the PRC, we can see a \npattern. The terms on paper protected the Tibetan way of life. But the \npromises proved empty. I suggest this is a lesson our President today \nwould be wise to learn. Whether regarding Hong Kong, weapons \nproliferation, or trade, we must remember what Ronald Reagan taught \nus--``trust, but verify.'' This is especially true of our dealings with \ncommunists and authoritarian rulers.\n  In Tibet, nine years of trying to compromise with the communists, \nfrom 1951 to 1959, failed. In fact, the restrictions on Tibet increased \nprogressively, as did the oppression and brutality of Beijing's rule.\n  March 10, 1959 stands out as an important day, not only in Tibet's \nhistory, but also in the history of humanity's struggle for freedom. On \nthis day, the people of Lhasa organized a permanent guard around the \nDalai Lama's palace, and demanded the withdrawal of the Chinese from \nTibet and the restoration of Tibet's independence.\n  One week later, the Dalai Lama was forced to flee his home and his \npeople while his palace was being shelled by the PLA. It is important \nto note that, in a great and triumphant official act, he repudiated the \n17-Point agreement.\n  According to Chinese statistics, 87,000 Tibetans were killed, \narrested, or deported to labor camps during this ``Lhasa Revolt.'' \nCountless tried to follow the Dalai Lama to India--unfortunately, only \na very small percentage of the thousands who attempted to escape \nthrough the Himalayas to India survived. If they could successfully \navoid the Chinese military--then they would succumb to malnutrition, \ncold, and disease.\n  Mr. President, we are today honoring the memory of the more than \n87,000 Tibetans who paid with their lives for the preservation of \nTibet. We also honor the 6 million Tibetans today who keep alive the \nhope of one-day returning home.\n  Mr. President, we believe in certain inalienable rights; it is part \nof our constitution. I believe that our freedom cannot be complete, and \nwe as a nation cannot achieve our fullest greatness, so long as others \nsuffer from the yoke of tyranny and oppression. Tibet today suffers \nfrom cultural genocide at the hands of the PRC. And yet, don't they \nalso have inalienable rights: to reject tyranny? to determine their \npolitical future including independence? to chose freedom and reject \noppression?\n  The answer, very clearly, must be a resounding ``yes.'' We have \nintroduced\n\n[[Page S2521]]\n\nthis resolution today, to register this ``yes.'' We do it for His \nHoliness, the Dalai Lama of Tibet. We do it for the 6 million Tibetans \nin the world today facing the very real and unfortunate threat of \nseeing their homeland destroyed and culture obliterated. And, we do it \nfor each of us who believe that the gifts we have in our lives here do \nnot excuse us from caring about the struggles of others.\n  I am pleased to submit this resolution, and ask my colleagues to \nsupport its immediate adoption.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement issued by the \nDalai Lama of Tibet be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n  Statement by the Dalai Lama on the 40th Anniversary of the Tibetan \n                   National Uprising, March 10, 1999\n\n       My sincere greetings to my compatriots in Tibet as well as \n     in exile and to all our friends and supporters all over the \n     world on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Tibetan \n     national uprising of 1959.\n       Four decades have passed since we came into exile and \n     continued our struggle for freedom both in and outside Tibet. \n     Four decades are a considerable time in a person's life. Many \n     fellow countrymen, both those who stayed back in Tibet in \n     1959 and those who came out at that time, are now gone. \n     Today, the second and third generations of Tibetans are \n     shouldering the responsibility of our freedom struggle with \n     undiminished determination and indomitable spirit.\n       During our four decades of life in exile, the Tibetan \n     community has gone through a process of increasing \n     democratization and has made tremendous progress in \n     education. We have also been able to preserve and promote our \n     unique cultural and religious heritage. Our achievement on \n     all these fronts is now widely recognized and acknowledged by \n     the international community. The credit for this achievement \n     goes to the determination and hard work of the Tibetan \n     people. However, our success would not have been possible \n     without the generous assistance of many international aid \n     organizations and individuals. We are especially grateful to \n     the people and government of India for their unsurpassed \n     generosity and hospitality ever since the late Prime Minister \n     Jawaharlal Nehru gave asylum to the Tibetan refugees and laid \n     down the programmes for education and rehabilitation of our \n     exile community.\n       During the same four decades, Tibet has been under the \n     complete control of the government of the People's Republic \n     of China and the Chinese authorities have had a free hand in \n     governing our country. The late Panchen Lama's 70,000-\n     character petition of 1962 serves as a telling historical \n     document on the draconian Chinese policies and actions in \n     Tibet. The immense destruction and human suffering during the \n     Cultural Revolution, which followed shortly afterwards are \n     today known world-wide and I do not wish to dwell on these \n     sad and painful events. In January 1989, a few days before \n     his sudden death, the Panchen Lama further stated that the \n     progress made in Tibet under China could not match the \n     amount of destruction and suffering inflicted on the \n     Tibetan people. Although some development and economic \n     progress has been made in Tibet, our country continues to \n     face many fundamental problems. In terms of history, \n     culture, language, religion, way of life and geographical \n     conditions, there are stark differences between Tibet and \n     China. These differences result in grave clashes of \n     values, dissent and distrust. At the sight of the \n     slightest dissent the Chinese authorities react with force \n     and repression resulting in widespread and serious \n     violations of human rights in Tibet. These abuses of \n     rights have a distinct character, and are aimed at \n     preventing Tibetans as a people from asserting their own \n     identity and culture, and their wish to preserve them. \n     Thus, human rights violations in Tibet are often the \n     result of policies of racial and cultural discrimination \n     and are only the symptoms and consequences of a deeper \n     problem. The Chinese authorities identify the distinct \n     culture and religion of Tibet as the root cause of Tibetan \n     resentment and dissent. Hence their policies are aimed at \n     decimating this integral core of the Tibetan civilian and \n     identity.\n       After a half a century of ``liberation'' the Tibetan issue \n     is still very much alive and remains yet to be resolved. \n     Obviously this situation is of no benefit to anyone, either \n     to Tibet or to China. To continue along this path does \n     nothing to alleviate the suffering of the Tibetan people, nor \n     does it bring stability and unity to China or help in \n     enhancing China's international image and standing. The only \n     sensible and responsible way to address this problem is \n     dialogue. There is no realistic alternative to it.\n       It is with this realization that in the early seventies I \n     discussed and decided with my senior officials the main \n     points of my ``Middle Way Approach''. Consequently, I opted \n     for a resolution of the Tibet issue, which does not call for \n     the independence of Tibet or its separation from China. I \n     firmly believe that it is possible to find a political \n     solution that ensures the basic rights and freedoms of the \n     Tibetan people within the framework of the People's Republic \n     of China. My primary concern is the survival and preservation \n     of Tibet's unique spiritual heritage, which is based on \n     compassion and non-violence. And, I believe it is worthwhile \n     and beneficial to preserve this heritage since it continues \n     to remain relevant in our present-day world.\n       With this spirit I responded immediately when Deng \n     Xiaoping, in late 1978, signalled a willingness to resume \n     dialogue with us. Since then our relation with the Chinese \n     government has taken many twists and turns. Unfortunately, a \n     lack of political will and courage on the part of the Chinese \n     leadership has resulted in their failure to reciprocate my \n     numerous overtures over the years. Thus, our formal contact \n     with the Chinese government came to an end in August 1993. \n     But a few informal channels through private persons and semi-\n     officials were established after that. During the past one-\n     and-a-half year one informal channel seemed to work smoothly \n     and reliably. In addition, there were some indications that \n     President Jiang personally had taken an interest in the \n     Tibetan issue. When US President Clinton visited China last \n     June, President Jiang discussed Tibet with him at some \n     length. Addressing a joint press conference, President Jiang \n     sought a public clarification from me on two conditions \n     before resuming dialogues and negotiations. We, on our part, \n     communicated to the Chinese government my readiness to \n     respond to President Jiang's statement and our desire for an \n     informal consultation before making it public. Sadly, there \n     was no positive response from the Chinese side. Late last \n     autumn, without any obvious reason, there was a noticeable \n     hardening of the Chinese position on dialogue and their \n     attitude towards me. This abrupt change was accompanied by \n     a new round of intensified repression in Tibet. This is \n     the current status of our relation with the Chinese \n     government.\n       It is clear from our experiences of the past decades that \n     formal statements, official rhetoric and political expediency \n     alone will do little to either lessen the suffering of the \n     concerned people or to solve the problem at hand. It is also \n     clear that force can control human beings only physically. It \n     is through reason, fairness and justice alone that the human \n     mind and heart can be won over. What is required is the \n     political will, courage and vision to tackle the root cause \n     of the problem and resolve it once and for all to the \n     satisfaction and benefit of the concerned people. Once we \n     find a mutually acceptable solution to the Tibetan issue, I \n     will not hold any official position, as I have clearly stated \n     for many years.\n       The root cause of the Tibetan problem is not the difference \n     in ideology, social system or issues resulting from clashes \n     between tradition and modernity. Neither is it just the issue \n     of human rights violations alone. The root of the Tibetan \n     issue lies in Tibet's long, separate history, its distinct \n     and ancient culture, and its unique identity.\n       Just as in late 1978, so also today, resumption of contact \n     and dialogue is the only sensible and viable way to tackle \n     this complex and grave problem. The atmosphere of deep \n     distrust between Tibetans and Chinese must be overcome. This \n     distrust will not go away in a day. It will dissipate only \n     through face-to face meetings and sincere dialogues.\n       I feel that the Chinese leadership is sometimes hindered by \n     its own suspicions so that it is unable to appreciate sincere \n     initiatives from my side, either on the overall solution to \n     the Tibetan problem or on any other matter. A case in point \n     is my consistent and long-standing call for the need to \n     respect the environmental situation in Tibet. I have long \n     warned of the consequences of wanton exploitation of the \n     fragile environment on the Tibet plateau. I did not do this \n     out of selfish concern for Tibet. Rather, it has been acutely \n     clear that any ecological imbalance in Tibet would affect not \n     just Tibet, but all the adjacent areas in China and even its \n     neighbouring counties. It is sad and unfortunate that it \n     took, last year's devastating floods for the Chinese \n     leadership to realize the need for environmental protection. \n     I welcome the moratorium that has been placed on the \n     denudation of forests in Tibetan areas and hope that such \n     measures, belated though they may be, will be followed by \n     more steps to keep Tibet's fragile ecosystem intact.\n       On my part, I remain committed to the process of dialogue \n     as the means to resolve the Tibetan problem. I do not seek \n     independence for Tibet. I hope that negotiations can begin \n     and that they will provide genuine autonomy for the Tibetan \n     people and the preservation and promotion of their cultural, \n     religious and linguistic integrity, as well as their socio-\n     economic development. I sincerely believe that my ``Middle \n     Way Approach'' will contribute to stability and unity of the \n     People's Republic of China and secure the right for the \n     Tibetan people to live in freedom, peace and dignity. A just \n     and fair solution to the issue of Tibet will enable me to \n     give full assurance that I will use my moral authority to \n     persuade the Tibetans not to seek separation.\n       As a free spokesman for the people of Tibet, I have made \n     every possible effort to engage the Chinese government in \n     negotiations on the future of the Tibetan people. In this \n     endeavor, I am greatly encouraged and inspired by the support \n     we receive from many governments, parliaments, non-\n     governmental organizations and the public throughout the \n     world. I am deeply grateful for their concern and support. I \n     would like to make a special mention of the efforts being \n     made by President Clinton and his Administration to encourage \n     the Chinese government to engage in dialogues with us. In \n     addition, we are fortunate to continue to enjoy\n\n[[Page S2522]]\n\n     strong bipartisan support in the United State Congress.\n       The plight of the Tibetan people and our non-violent \n     freedom struggle has touched the hearts and conscience of all \n     people who cherish truth and justice. The international \n     awareness of the issue of Tibet has reached an unprecedented \n     height since last year. Concerns and active support for Tibet \n     are not confined to human rights organizations, governments \n     and parliaments. Universities, schools, religious and social \n     groups, artistic and business communities as well as people \n     from many other walks of life have also come to understand \n     the problem of Tibet and are now expressing their solidarity \n     with our cause. Reflecting this rising popular sentiment, \n     many governments and parliaments have made the problem of \n     Tibet an important issue on the agenda of their relations \n     with the government of China.\n       We have also been able to deepen and broaden our relations \n     with our Chinese brothers and sisters, belonging to the \n     democracy and human rights movement. Similarly, we have been \n     able to establish cordial and friendly relations with fellow \n     Chinese Buddhists and ordinary Chinese people living abroad \n     and in Taiwan. The support and solidarity that we receive \n     from our Chinese brothers and sisters are a source of great \n     inspiration and hope. I am particularly encouraged and moved \n     by those brave Chinese within China who have urged their \n     government or publicly called for a change in China's policy \n     towards the Tibetan people.\n       Today, the Tibetan freedom movement is in a much stronger \n     and better position than ever before and I firmly believe \n     that despite the present intransigence of the Chinese \n     government, the prospects for progress in bringing about a \n     meaningful dialogue and negotiations are better today than \n     ever. I, therefore, appeal to governments, parliaments and \n     our friends to continue their support and efforts with \n     renewed dedication and vigour. I strongly believe that such \n     expressions of international concern and support are \n     essential. They are vital in communicating a sense of urgency \n     to the leadership in Beijing and in persuading them to \n     address the issue of Tibet in a serious and constructive \n     manner.\n       With my homage to the brave men and women of Tibet, who \n     have died for the cause of our freedom, I pray for an early \n     end to the suffering of our people.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, every year on March 10th we reflect on \nthe plight of the Tibetan people. Forty years ago many Tibetan citizens \ngave their lives to defend their freedom and to prevent the Dalai Lama \nfrom being kidnaped by the Chinese army. For those who are committed to \nstanding with the Tibetan people, it is a day to consider what can be \ndone to lend support to Tibetan people, it is a day to consider what \ncan be done to lend support to Tibetan aspirations. The United States \nSenate will mark the occasion by considering a resolution to mark this \nsolemn occasion.\n  The United States Congress takes the position that Tibet is an \noccupied country whose true representatives are the Dalai Lama and the \nTibetan Government in exile. The International Commission of Jurists \n(ICJ), which has closely followed the situation in Tibet since the \nDalai Lama was forced to flee into exile, and has published reports in \n1959, 1960, 1964, and 1997. After examining Chinese policies in Tibet, \nit reported its findings to the Secretary-General of the United \nNations. The 1960 report made the important international legal \ndetermination that ``Tibet demonstrated from 1913 to 1950 the \nconditions of statehood as generally accepted under international \nlaw.''\n  Now the ICJ has returned to the issue of Tibet and produced another \nimportant report. It finds that repression in Tibet has increased since \n1994. This is an assessment which my daughter Maura shares after having \nvisited Tibet and having worked closely for many years with Tibetan \nrefugees who continue to make the dangerous journey over the Himalayan \nmountains to flee persecution in their homeland. In 1996 she returned \nfrom Tibet to report that,\n\n       . . . in recent months Beijing's leaders have renewed their \n     assault on Tibetan culture, especially Buddhism, with an \n     alarming vehemence. The rhetoric and the methods of the \n     Cultural Revolution of the 1960s have been resurrected--\n     reincarnated, what you will--to shape an aggressive campaign \n     to vilify the Dalai Lama.\n\n  The Dalai Lama, of course, remains unstained, but it is time for the \nChinese to consider a policy of ``constructive engagement'' of their \nown--with the Tibetans. For many years now, the United States Congress \nhas called on the People's Republic of China to enter into discussions \nwith the Dalai Lama or his representatives on a solution to the \nquestion of Tibet. Today we continue that message. This resolution \ndeclares March 10, 1999 as ``Tibetan National Day in solemn recognition \nof those Tibetans who sacrificed, suffered, or died as a result of \nChinese aggression among their country.'' It also affirms the right of \nthe Tibetan people to ``determine their own political future, including \nindependence if they so determine.'' The government of the People's \nRepublic of China should know that as the Tibetan people and His \nHoliness the Dalai Lama of Tibet go forward on their journey toward \nfreedom the Congress and the people of the United States stand with \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/10/senate-section/article/S2522-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2522-S2529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  LOTT (AND ABRAHAM) AMENDMENT NO. 60\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS (for Mr. Lott for himself and Mr. Abraham) proposed an \namendment to the bill (S. 280) to provide for education flexibility \npartnerships; as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Today's youth face far greater social risks than did \n     their parents and grandparents.\n       (2) Students spend more of their waking hours alone, \n     without supervision, companionship, or activity, than the \n     students spend in school.\n       (3) Law enforcement statistics show that youth who are ages \n     12 through 17 are most at risk of committing violent acts and \n     being victims of violent acts between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.\n       (4) The consequences of academic failure are more dire in \n     1999 than ever before.\n       (5) After school programs have been shown in many States to \n     help address social problems facing our Nation's youth, such \n     as drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and gang involvement.\n       (6) Many of our Nation's governors endorse increasing the \n     number of after school programs through a Federal/State \n     partnership.\n       (7) Over 450 of the Nation's leading police chiefs, \n     sheriffs, and prosecutors, along with presidents of the \n     Fraternal Order of Police and the International Union of \n     Police Associations, which together represent 360,000 police \n     officers, have called upon public officials to provide after \n     school programs that offer recreation, academic support, and \n     community service experience, for school-age children and \n     teens in the United States.\n       (8) One of the most important investments that we can make \n     in our children is to ensure that they have safe and positive \n     learning environments in the after school hours.\n\n     SEC.    04.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       ``This part may be cited as the ``Class Size Reduction and \n     Teacher Quality Act of 1999''.\n\n     ``SEC. 6602. FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress finds as follows:\n       ``(1) Rigorous research has shown that students attending \n     small classes in the early grades make more rapid educational \n     progress than students in larger classes, and that these \n     achievement gains persist through at least the elementary \n     grades.\n       ``(2) The benefits of smaller classes are greatest for \n     lower achieving, minority, poor, and inner-city children. One \n     study found that urban fourth-graders in smaller-than-average \n     classes were \\3/4\\ of a school year ahead of their \n     counterparts in larger-than-average classes.\n       ``(3) Teachers in small classes can provide students with \n     more individualized attention, spend more time on instruction \n     and less on other tasks, cover more material effectively, and \n     are better able to work with parents to further their \n     children's education.\n       ``(4) Smaller classes allow teachers to identify and work \n     more effectively with students who have learning disabilities \n     and, potentially, can reduce those students' needs for \n     special education services in the later grades.\n       ``(5) Students in smaller classes are able to become more \n     actively engaged in learning than their peers in larger \n     classes.\n       ``(6) Efforts to improve educational achievement by \n     reducing class sizes in the early grades are likely to be \n     more successful if--\n       ``(A) well-prepared teachers are hired and appropriately \n     assigned to fill additional classroom positions; and\n       ``(B) teachers receive intensive, continuing training in \n     working effectively in smaller classroom settings.\n       ``(7) Several States have begun a serious effort to reduce \n     class sizes in the early elementary grades, but these actions \n     may be impeded by financial limitations or difficulties in \n     hiring well-prepared teachers.\n       ``(8) The Federal Government can assist in this effort by \n     providing funding for class-size reductions in grades 1 \n     through 3, and by helping to ensure that the new teachers \n     brought into the classroom are well prepared.\n\n     ``SEC. 6603. PURPOSE.\n\n       ``The purpose of this part is to help States and local \n     educational agencies recruit, train, and hire 100,000 \n     additional teachers over a 7-year period in order to--\n       ``(1) reduce class sizes nationally, in grades 1 through 3, \n     to an average of 18 students per classroom; and\n       ``(2) improve teaching in the early grades so that all \n     students can learn to read independently and well by the end \n     of the third grade.\n\n     ``SEC. 6604.

The Tibetan people have a right to their freedom, a \nright to openly practice their religion, and a right to live with \ndignity and without fear.\n  These human rights--that belong to Tibetans, and to people \neverywhere--bind us to the Tibetan people with a tie stronger than the \nChinese government's oppression, mightier than the Chinese government's \npolicies of destruction, and more powerful than the Chinese or any \ngovernment's attempt to take that which cannot be taken--the dignity of \nthe human spirit.\n  I am calling on the Administration to pursue a resolution condemning \nChina's human rights practices in China and Tibet at the upcoming U.N. \nCommission on Human Rights in Geneva, an action the Senate unanimously \nendorsed by recorded vote in late February. Only through strong U.S. \nleadership can we build the international consensus necessary to \npressure China to provide the basic human rights the Tibetan people \ndeserve. The time to press for these fundamental rights is now and the \nplace is the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/10/senate-section/article/S2529-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2529-S2530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GINNIE MAE GUARANTY FEE\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Grams, \nintroduced S. Con. Res. 16 last week. I am a cosponsor of that \nlegislation expressing the Sense that the Government National Mortgage \nAssociation (Ginnie Mae) guaranty fee should not be increased.\n  Ginnie Mae was established to help provide affordable homeownership \nopportunities for all Americans by facilitating the sale of securities \nbacked by mortgages insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing \nAdministration, the Department of Veteran's Affairs, and the Rural \nHousing Service. The Ginnie Mae guaranty assures investors in the \nsecurities that they will receive all payments due in a timely manner. \nGinnie Mae assesses a fee on lenders who issue such securities and \nnotes for this guaranty. Currently, lenders are charged six basis \npoints per loan.\n  The Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities program has been a \nuniversal success. Almost 19 million homes have been financed through \nGinnie Mae securities. Ginnie Mae creates a way for Americans who are \nunable to find other financing options to partake in the dream of \nhomeownership. More than 95 percent of all FHA and VA mortgages are \nsecuritized through Ginnie Mae. It is no secret that first-time \nhomebuyers comprise more than two-thirds of FHA home purchase loans and \nthat about 34 percent of FHA borrowers are minorities. In its most \nbasic form, Ginnie Mae creates homeownership opportunities for those \nborrowers who are typically unserved or underserved by the conventional \nmortgage markets.\n  During the last Congress, there were several attempts to increase the \nGinnie Mae guaranty fee. Fortunately, most of these attempts failed. \nHowever, an increase of three basis points was adopted during \ndeliberations on the Higher Education Reauthorization Act effective in \n2004. All of the attempts sought to use the revenue gained by the \nincrease to pay for spending elsewhere. This pattern must be stopped. \nNot only should Congress refuse to raise the guaranty fee under any \ncircumstances, but it should also seek to have this arbitrary increase \nrepealed prior to effect.\n  I believe that any increase in the Ginnie Mae guaranty fee is an \nunnecessary tax on homeownership that would cost homebuyers hundreds of \ndollars in additional expense at closing and prevent thousands of \nfamilies from achieving the dream of homeownership. It would defeat the \nvery mission of Ginnie Mae.\n  In addition, an increase in the Ginnie Mae guaranty fee has \nabsolutely no financial basis. Recently, the independent auditor, KPMG, \nconfirmed that Ginnie Mae is financially sound. In fact, Ginnie Mae had \na record profit of\n\n[[Page S2530]]\n\n$601 million in 1997. In that year alone, Ginnie Mae collected a total \nof $326 million in guaranty fees. It paid out only $11 million in \nunreimbursed claims. It is apparent that Ginnie Mae does not need the \nfinancial boost from the increase fee.\n  Even in this era of low interest rates, the dream of homeownership is \nelusive for many American families. Extensive efforts should be made to \neliminate the barriers to affordable housing. Any increase in the \nGinnie Mae guaranty fee creates a substantial impediment to \nhomeownership. Such a result is unacceptable.\n  I ask Senators to please join me in opposing this unjustified tax on \nhomeownership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/10/senate-section/article/S2530-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BOB MORROW\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to pause for a few \nmoments to acknowledge that those of us in Massachusetts are mourning \nthe loss of one of our state's finest citizens, a graduate and loyal \nalumnus of Assumption College, a friend of the Massachusetts \ncongressional delegation, and someone I had the privilege over the \nyears to know as a good friend.\n  Mr. President, Bob Morrow's death was a shock to those of us who knew \nhim--this wonderful man taken from his family and friends at the age of \nforty-five--and to those of us who looked forward to the contributions \nhe would make in the years still ahead of us.\n  Although it seems a gesture wholly insufficient to honor the life of \na friend lost too soon--to come to terms with the fact that a friend \nwho was never comfortable behind a desk, who could never sit still, has \ncome to a final rest--we can at least take the time today to remember \nthe kind of person--and the type of friend--Bob Morrow was to those \nwhose lives he touched.\n  We can certainly remember Bob's extraordinary capacity as an advocate \nfor two of Massachusetts' pioneering high technology firms, The Riley \nCorporation in Worcester and Stone and Webster in Boston. Bob Morrow \nwas a man who lived his life in a way that proved not only that you can \nbe involved in government and brush against the legislative process \nwithout losing your soul, but that politics can be a way for the needs \nof our citizens to be communicated to those who represent them in \nWashington, D.C. In this age of seemingly endless cynicism, Bob Morrow \ntruly enjoyed the work of advocating on behalf of the companies he \nrepresented--and they were well served by both the depth of his \nknowledge and the levels of his idealism.\n  Many of us forget that although Bob was a terrific representative of \nthese companies in Washington--expertly guiding their federal \nrelations--this was just one component of a job that he truly loved. \nBob was also responsible for human resources management, training, \npublic relations, and range of other services for an eight thousand \nemployee firm. Although it is incredible to believe that a single \nperson managed not just to juggle, but to excel, in all these \nenterprises, we all knew that Bob was one of those rare people capable \nof packing his days with wall to wall activity, because no task proved \ntoo difficult for a man who genuinely loved working with people.\n  Bob drew on these enormous personal talents again and again--in his \nwork in Worcester and Boston, but also in his willingness to bring \ntogether citizens from across Massachusetts to share in a political \ncause or to help one of his friends. I will always be grateful for \nBob's efforts to help me in 1996 in my tough battle for the Senate \nagainst Bill Weld. Whether the task was large or small, organizing an \nevent for a handful of supporters, or pulling together a dinner with \nthe President of the United States at my home in Boston, Bob was always \neager to serve--and he had a tremendous capacity to enlist others in \nthe fights in which he was engaged.\n  The real measure, though, of Bob Morrow, was in his devotion to \nfamily. Few conversations with Bob did not come back to Linda and the \nboys. He was incredibly proud of his family. He was a wonderful son to \nhis mother Mary, a terrific brother to his sisters. I know that, as \nmuch as we will all miss him, his wife Linda and his sons Bobby, Sean, \nand Tim will miss him infinitely more. I hope they know in this time of \ngrief and sadness, we extend to them our most sincere condolences and \nsupport.\n  It is impossible to capture in words alone the essence of Bob Morrow. \nFrom a humble background, through hard work and an absolutely genuine \noptimism and enthusiasm, Bob made himself an important contributor to \nour state, a wonderful and loyal friend, an exemplary husband and \nfather, and the kind of outstanding citizen that is the foundation and \nstrength of this nation. Bob Morrow was loved by so many--and he will \nbe missed by us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/10/senate-section/article/S2530-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JOHN HOFFMAN\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to honor a very special person \nwith whom many of us have worked over the years on a variety of \ntechnical and important issues. These issues have been and continue to \nbe of great importance to the American consumer and the world \nmarketplace.\n  I learned recently that John Hoffman, currently Senior Vice President \nof Sprint Communications, has decided to leave and remit the ongoing \ntelecommunications debate to others. I think that what I, and others, \nwill perhaps miss most, is the calm, rational and fair presence that \nJohn brought to the telecommunications debate here in Congress and \nelsewhere.\n  John has spent his entire career, some thirty years, with Sprint, \nhelping bring it from a small local exchange company to a major state-\nof-the-art communications company providing services to millions of \nbusinesses and consumers.\n  Throughout John's career, which began in 1970 while John was still in \nlaw school at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and Sprint was \ncalled United Telecom, he persevered through tough times and retained \nhis vision of what the small company could become. I don't think there \nis any doubt that his ideas and efforts were right.\n  Sprint, today, is a global communications company at the forefront in \nintegrating long distance, local and wireless communications services \nand one of the world's largest carriers of internet traffic. With \nJohn's help and diligence, Sprint built the nation's only all-digital, \nfiber optic network and is the leader in advanced data communications \nservices.\n  John has been a good friend to me over the years. He should be very \nproud of his contributions to making Sprint the world class company it \nis today.\n  I wish the best to John, his wife Linda and daughter Heather. Good \nluck John, and feel free to call me--I know you have a phone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/10/senate-section/article/S2530-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2530-S2531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CRAGIN & PIKE'S 90TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one of \nNevada's oldest and most respected businesses on the occasion of its \n90th Anniversary. The Las Vegas insurance firm of Cragin & Pike was \nbegun in 1909 by Ernie Cragin and William Pike, pioneers in the truest \nsense of the word. In 1909, Las Vegas was a newborn city, having been \nfounded just four years earlier as a railroad division point for the \nSan Perdro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad.\n  Since its 20th century birth, when Las Vegas was established as a \nrailroad community, the Las Vegas Valley has seen dynamic change. \nCragin & Pike has enjoyed as colorful a history as the city it calls \nhome, both witnessing and shaping the events that would make Las Vegas \nthe world's premier city for entertainment and tourism. Ernie Cragin \nhimself served as the mayor of Las Vegas for 25 years. William Pike saw \nthe legalization of Nevada gambling in 1931 and the construction of the \nBoulder Dam completed four years later. Cragin & Pike has been a full \npartner to many of the city's most familiar names in business.\n  In a city that defines itself by the ever changing view from the Las \nVegas Strip, Cragin & Pike has endured through its dedication to its \ncustomers and its rock solid business philosophies. I know that its \nname sake founders would be as proud as I am today to see this \ninnovative yet faithful member of the Las Vegas community observe yet \nanother achievement in the celebration of its 90th Anniversary. I\n\n[[Page S2531]]\n\ncongratulate the partners and associates of Cragin & Pike on this \naccomplishment, and look forward to many more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/10/senate-section/article/S2531-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on my \ndecision to support two resolutions concerning the Middle East peace \nprocess. Both of these resolutions express congressional opposition to \nany efforts by either party in the peace process to attempt, through \nunilateral actions, to pre-judge or pre-determine the outcome of the \nnegotiations currently taking place between the Palestinians and the \nIsraelis. I would like to take a moment to explain why I decided to \ncosponsor these resolutions.\n  I believe that one of the most important foreign policy issues facing \nAmerica today is how to encourage peace in the Middle East. Reaching a \npeace agreement at this time is extremely critical, not only to our \nstrategic interests in the region, but to the parties themselves. I \nremain optimistic that despite the various setbacks, it will still be \npossible for the parties to achieve a just and lasting peace.\n  However, in my view, the only way to achieve such a peace is for the \nparties to abide by the plan of negotiations as set out in the context \nof Madrid, Oslo, and most recently, in the Wye Plantation Agreement. \nThis plan clearly sets forth a structure which dictates the timetable \nand order of discussing certain very critical issues.\n  I am particularly concerned that any unilateral actions by the \nparties or co-sponsors which might pre-judge the outcome or change this \nplan would have a great potential to undermine what limited chance we \nhave for peace in the Middle East.\n  Within this context, the parties, with the full support of the co-\nsponsors, agreed to delay the discussion of many of the most critical \nand difficult issues until final status negotiations, and promised not \nto take any unilateral actions which might pre-judge or pre-determine \nthe outcome of those issues. My opposition to unilateral actions by any \nparty or co-sponsor, including the United States, is well known and on \nthe record. It was, for example, the principal basis for my opposition \nin 1995 to S. 1322, which mandated the relocation of the U.S. Embassy \nfrom Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n  Similarly, just as I was concerned about the potentially injurious \nimpact on the peace process of prematurely addressing issues relating \nto Jerusalem, I am equally concerned about the impact of a unilateral \nand premature declaration by the Palestinians regarding statehood. I \nbelieve such a unilateral declaration by the Palestinian Authority \nwould almost certainly undermine future progress toward a peace accord.\n  It is my understanding that the Administration's position is \nconsistent with these congressional resolutions, and in fact the United \nStates has maintained ongoing discussions with the Palestinians to \ndiscourage them from unilaterally declaring a state outside the context \nof the negotiations.\n  My support for both of these resolutions are based on this principle \nalone: That any unilateral actions by either parties or co-sponsors are \ndisruptive and damaging to the peace process as a whole. My support for \nthese resolutions is not a comment regarding what the Palestinian \nauthorities should do if the peace process fails and no final status \nagreement can be reached. Nor is it a comment on the merits of a \nPalestinian state. Nor, finally, is it a suggestion that a Palestinian \nstate should not be created as part of the final status agreement \nshould the parties decide upon that themselves. Indeed, for the process \nto be successful, the Palestinians must be permitted to exercise their \nindependence.\n  My support for these resolutions is thus exclusively and solely a \nstatement that in my opinion, a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian \nstate at this time would probably destroy any chance to reach a just \nand lasting peace between the parties. Peace is too important--and too \nmuch effort toward achieving such a peace has been expended by all \nparties and co-sponsors for it to be jeopardized in this way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/10/senate-section/article/S2531-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMMENDING HAZEL WOLF ON HER 101ST BIRTHDAY\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to \nrecognize Ms. Hazel Wolf of Seattle, Washington, in honor of her 101st \nbirthday on Wednesday, March 10, 1999. Ms. Wolf, a great, great grand-\nmother, is a tireless advocate for conservation, environmental \nprotection and social justice throughout the Pacific Northwest. A \ndedicated volunteer, community activist and leader, Ms. Wolf serves as \nan outstanding example for all Americans.\n  Ms. Wolf became involved in the Audubon Society in the early-1960s \nand had a hand in starting 21 of the 26 Audubon Society chapters in \nWashington State, plus one in her birthplace of Victoria, British \nColumbia. In 1979, she worked to organize the first statewide \nconference to bring together environmentalists and Native American \ntribes. For three decades she has served as Secretary of the Seattle \nAudubon Society chapter, and for 17 years she has edited an \nenvironmental newsletter, ``Outdoors West''. In addition, she is among \nthe founders of Seattle's Community Coalition for Environmental \nJustice. She is a frequent speaker at schools and environmental \nconferences throughout the Northwest.\n  In 1997, the National Audubon Society awarded her the prestigious \nMedal of Excellence. The Seattle Audubon chapter has created the Hazel \nWolf ``Kids for the Environment'' endowment, which will help educate \nyouth about conservation. Ms. Wolf is also the recipient of the 1997 \nChevron Conservation Award, the $2,000 prize from which she contributed \nto the Seattle Audubon Society. In Issaquah, Washington, there is a \n116-acre wetland named after her and on the other side of the Cascade \nMountains near Yakima, a bird sanctuary bears her name.\n  Hazel Wolf retired from her career as a legal secretary in 1965. She \nhas proven repeatedly that significant and lasting contributions to \nsociety are a function neither of career nor of age, but of hard work, \nperseverance and vision. As her family and friends gather to celebrate \nher 101st birthday, I want to wish Ms. Wolf continued success and good \nhealth, and to thank her for being an inspiration to me and countless \nothers. Happy Birthday, Hazel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/10/senate-section/article/S2531-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY\n\n Mr. LUGAR.
