The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Social Security \nlockbox amendment as offered by the distinguished majority leader, \nSenator Lott, and the Budget Committee chairman, Senator Domenici.\n  You can't spend IOUs. Right now, Social Security is a marked trust \nfund,\n\n[[Page S4072]]\n\nbut it is a box of IOUs. This amendment represents an unparalleled \ncommitment by the Senate to pay off some IOUs, truly lock the Social \nSecurity money up and thereby assure present seniors and following \ngenerations of seniors that their Social Security benefits will be \nthere when they need them most. When Social Security first started, \nthere were 45 people working to take care of one person who is retired. \nIt has been a huge pyramid, but it is now becoming inverted. We are \nfast approaching a time when only two or three people will be funding \nthe one who is retired. If you have kids, think about how you would \nfeel about making your children pay your Social Security by themselves \nout of their paychecks. That is what the future looks like. You can see \nwhat a bite out of a paycheck that is going to be for two or three \npeople to be able to pay the monthly benefit of one retiree.\n  Being fiscally responsible is one way to remedy this problem. Passing \nthis lockbox amendment is a means to avoiding a last-minute Draconian \nevent. As an accountant, I have an appreciation and respect for \nnumbers. They can be just as misleading as they are truthful. But there \nshould be no misconception about what our Nation's budget projections \ntell us. The surplus we expect to get over the next 15 years is Social \nSecurity revenue.\n\n  This is an important point to understand. Budget surplus revenue, \nduring the next 15 years, comes from mandatory Federal payroll taxes \npaid by working Americans. What is paid into the Federal Government as \nFICA taxes goes towards keeping the Social Security program running. \nWhat is paid in by the people working gets paid out to the people who \nare on retirement, and there is a slight excess at the moment. It just \nhappens to match up with what we called the surplus last year.\n  I have never seen an administration squeeze so much political mileage \nas there has been on the budget surplus. That is not hard to do when \nfolks are promised funding for every popular Federal program, including \na few that don't even exist at the moment. Unfortunately, I am unable \nto look people in the eye and tell them that the budget surplus is \nAmerica's ``golden calf.'' Not only is it unconscionable, it is simply \nnot true.\n  These empty promises are how folks get the impression that the budget \nsurplus is based on general revenue. It could be in just a few years, \nif we only respect and act on what the numbers really tell us, that the \ncurrent surplus isn't general revenue but actually Social Security \nreceipts. There can be some surplus if we have some discipline. If the \nSenate adopts the Social Security lockbox amendment, Congress could be \ndebating what to do with true general revenue surplus shortly.\n  For now, we have a duty to do what is right, preserve Social Security \nby retiring part of the $5.5 trillion debt and locking out the spending \nof Social Security money. Even though the economy is strong, I am \nsurprised that so few people are aware that we, as a Nation, are in \ndanger of passing on to our kids and our grandkids a $5.5 trillion debt \nand a potentially bankrupt Social Security system. Our society has \nbecome so tied to the immediate gratification received from spending \nmoney that we fail to recognize the danger that looms from this Federal \ncredit card spending.\n  Congress has no room to talk. Our massive Federal debt and ever-\nchanging demographics will place a tremendous amount of pressure on our \nyoung workforce. Future generations deserve the same opportunities we \ndemand for ourselves. Neglecting our responsibility to ensure Social \nSecurity solvency for future retirees begs distrust from our kids. We \nmust not leave a financial burden we created for them to repay and no \nSocial Security. If this amendment fails, we will continue to pay 13\\1/\n2\\ percent of total budget outlays in interest on the Federal debt. \nThat alone amounts to $231 billion that could be used to help preserve \nSocial Security each year.\n  If this amendment does not pass, over $10 trillion of interest \npayments over the next 30 years will continue to be paid by taxpayers. \nPreserving the Social Security program by retiring our debt is the only \nway to avoid such senseless spending without a major reform. It isn't \njust Members of the Senate that believe in fiscal responsibility. I \nencourage the administration to read the testimony of Federal Reserve \nChairman Alan Greenspan before the Senate Budget Committee earlier this \nyear. He advises caution in our spending because Federal revenues are \nnot guaranteed and they may fall short of expectations. Rather, we \nshould be aiming for budget surpluses, true budget surpluses, and using \nthe proceeds to retire outstanding Federal debt. That, he said, will \nhelp the economy and protect Social Security for a long time to come. \nThat is Alan Greenspan.\n\n  This amendment does just what Alan Greenspan said and recognizes \nreal-life economic situations. We are in one of those real-life \neconomic situations now with the war. Senators Domenici and Abraham \nhave gone to great lengths to ensure that the pending Social Security \nlockbox amendment is sound and fair, providing flexible administration. \nIf passed, it would authorize adjustments to the debt limits \nestablished for any Social Security modernization legislation that \nCongress and the administration enacts in the coming years.\n  I continue to hope that the administration is serious about sensible \nstructural changes to the program itself. In addition, the requirements \nof this amendment would be suspended during a period of economic \nrecession, as well as for emergency spending and a declaration of war. \nMost would agree that such situations should not be subjected to \nstatutory debt limitations.\n  No tricks or gimmicks here. This is upfront fiscal responsibility. By \nretiring our debt, this amendment would protect the Social Security \nbudget surplus from being spent on non-Social Security programs. It \nbegins an overdue process of paying back the Government creditors and \nhelping the taxpaying workers. Why should the Federal Government be \nallowed to incur a debt it currently has no intention of paying back? \nRepayment is the responsible thing to do. It makes sound economic \nsense.\n  I strongly support the passage of the Social Security lockbox \namendment. I commend the authors for this legislation. Their dedication \nto preserving Social Security through fiscal responsibility is \nadmirable. I encourage all of my Senate colleagues to vote in favor of \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENZI. If it is off your time, yes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes. The distinguished Senator said, as I was coming \nin, that there was a box of IOUs. How do you think in the Social \nSecurity trust fund you got the IOUs?\n  Mr. ENZI. The Social Security trust fund is lent to the Federal \nGovernment and we spend every dime that is lent to us. It is a loan.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is right. While spending every dime of the trust \nfund, we reduce the public debt, so that what we have is the unified \ndebt. I have heard the Senator and everybody else say, this time, leave \nit out of the unified deficit. That is how you bring out the unified \ndeficit, and rather than the regular deficit, and the unified budget; \nisn't that correct?\n  Mr. ENZI. No. If you paid the Social Security portion of the debt, \nyou are really taking money out of the bank and putting it right back \ninto the piggy bank. It has to be reloaned. There is no other \nalternative. Until there is reform on it, there is no other alternative \nexcept to loan it out. When it gets loaned out, we spend every penny.\n  We are not supposed to spend the Social Security money. We are not \nsupposed to be robbing the piggy bank. But that is what happens. That \npiggy bank, that trust fund, is IOUs. It is money lent to the Federal \nGovernment again, and spent again.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is exactly right. It is a Social Security piggy \nbank. That is the whole point I am trying to make--the same point the \nSenator from Wyoming is making--that we have been robbing the Social \nSecurity piggy bank, as I show you here, and other banks, incidentally, \nwhereby this year we owe Social Security $857 billion.\n  Isn't that correct?\n  Mr. ENZI. That is correct.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Then we apply it using these trust funds to pay down \nthe debt. That is what we have been doing, by any and every other \nprogram, whether it is a tax cut, whether it is\n\n[[Page S4073]]\n\ndefense spending, whether it is disaster in the farm areas, whatever it \nis. That runs up the debt. When you pay down the debt, you get to the \nunified deficit.\n  That is what they have all been bragging about--how the unified \ndeficit has been coming down and we have a surplus. We don't have an \nactual surplus. We spend $100 billion more than we take in this year--\n$100 billion more than we take in this year. But yet we say we have a \nsurplus, because it is unified, because we have used Social Security to \npay down the public debt.\n  Mr. ENZI. Absolutely. We have used Social Security, and then we put \nthe money back into Social Security again, and then we spend it again. \nThere has to be some major reform if we are going to have some Social \nSecurity money that is actually a trust fund that people will be able \nto use on their own.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming \nis exactly right. We have to do something. That is what we did. We say \nthis charade has to stop. We are really looting Social Security while \nwe say we are trying to save it. As a result, we have gotten Social \nSecurity into a tremendous debt. We have savaged the fund. Now \neverybody comes to say they want to save Social Security.\n  That's why I put in the bill S. 605. We will introduce it. I ask \nunanimous consent to have it printed in the Record as if delivered \nright now.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 605\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Social Security Fiscal \n     Protection Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. OFF BUDGET STATUS OF SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts \n     and disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \n     Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance \n     Trust Fund shall not be counted as new budget authority, \n     outlays, receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of--\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President,\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n\n     SEC. 3. EXCLUSION OF RECEIPTS AND DISBURSEMENTS FROM SURPLUS \n                   AND DEFICIT TOTALS.\n\n       The receipts and disbursements of the old-age, survivors, \n     and disability insurance program established under title II \n     of the Social Security Act and the revenues under sections \n     86, 1401, 3101, and 3111 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     related to such program shall not be included in any surplus \n     or deficit totals required under the Congressional Budget Act \n     of 1974 or chapter 11 of title 31, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 4. CONFORMITY OF OFFICIAL STATEMENTS TO BUDGETARY \n                   REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       Any official statement issued by the Office of Management \n     and Budget or by the Congressional Budget office of surplus \n     or deficit totals of the budget of the United States \n     Government as submitted by the President or of the surplus or \n     deficit totals of the congressional budget, and any \n     description of, or reference to, such totals in any official \n     publication or material issued by either of such Offices, \n     shall exclude all receipts and disbursements under the old-\n     age, survivors, and disability insurance program under title \n     II of the Social Security Act and the related provisions of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (including the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund).\n\n     SEC. 5. REPOSITORY REQUIREMENT.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, throughout each \n     month that begins after October 1, 1999, the Secretary of the \n     Treasury shall maintain, in a secure repository or \n     repositories, cash in a total amount equal to the total \n     redemption value of all obligations issued to the Federal \n     Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal \n     Disability Insurance Trust Fund pursuant to section 201(d) of \n     the Social Security Act that are outstanding on the first day \n     of such month.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, that is drawn up with the counsel of the \nSocial Security Administration whereby we do exactly what the \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming would like to do. We get the \ninterest. We allow the Government to buy our Social Security moneys and \ngive us the Treasury bills. Then each month, at the first of the month, \nwe transfer that same amount of money back into a trust fund to be \nspent on Social Security, and only Social Security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today the Senate is debating the so-called \nSocial Security lockbox. This is legislation that was intended to \nprotect the Social Security surpluses. Unfortunately, it failed.\n  Throughout my tenure in the Senate, as a member of the Senate Budget \nCommittee and the Senate Finance Committee, I have done my level best \nto support balancing the budget without counting Social Security \nsurpluses and to protect those surpluses.\n  That is why I was looking forward to this debate. I was hoping we \nwere going to have a chance to really engage in a discussion about how \nto protect Social Security--to go through the normal legislative \nprocess, to offer amendments, to have votes and to let Senators decide \nthe outcome.\n  Unfortunately, the advocates of this particular approach apparently \nare so insecure about their approach that they won't permit any \namendments. They don't want a debate. They do not want votes to decide \nthe outcome. That is unfortunate.\n  But I think it speaks volumes about the weakness of their position. \nIt seems incredibly ironic to this Senator that a bill whose sponsors \nsay is designed to protect Social Security actually puts Social \nSecurity benefit payments at risk.\n  Let me repeat that.\n  This bill which is advertised to protect Social Security actually \nputs Social Security benefit payments at risk.\n  That is not just the view of this Senator. That is the view of the \nSecretary of the Treasury, who has the responsibility for making Social \nSecurity payments. The Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Rubin, in a \nletter dated yesterday, wrote in part:\n\n       Our analysis indicates that this provision could preclude \n     the United States from meeting its financial obligations to \n     repay maturing debt and to make benefit payments--including \n     Social Security checks--and could also worsen a future \n     economic downturn.\n\n  The Secretary of the Treasury says this bill is the wrong way to \nprotect Social Security.\n  Interestingly enough, it is not just the Secretary of the Treasury \nwho says that and has reached that conclusion. We also have a letter \nfrom the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in the House of \nRepresentatives, Chairman Archer. Chairman Archer in a letter to the \nChairman of the Budget Committee in the House of Representatives, dated \nApril 9, says:\n\n       One has only to read the arguments presented in the March \n     17, 1999, letter from Secretary Rubin to appreciate the dire \n     consequences always presented during a debt limit crisis--\n     disruption of Treasury bond management and worldwide \n     financial markets, doubts about making government payments \n     including Social Security benefits, and raising borrowing \n     costs to the taxpayers--and why Congress always votes to \n     raise the limit.\n\n  Chairman Archer, the Republican Chairman of the Ways and Means \nCommittee in the House of Representatives that has jurisdiction over \nthis issue, says in conclusion in his letter:\n\n       I see no need to enact limits, even if merely advisory, \n     that do not directly protect the Social Security surplus and \n     re-ignite the debt limit controversy that proved so bitter \n     and futile for everyone four years ago.\n\n  That is the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in the House of \nRepresentatives warning that this legislation is not the way to protect \nSocial Security.\n  Instead, he says:\n\n       In my view, strict budget enforcement measures are the most \n     effective way to control spending. To reduce debt, the \n     President and the Congress, like every American household, \n     must commit themselves to spending constraint.\n\n  The Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee is exactly right. The \nSecretary of the Treasury is exactly right. We are pursuing an illusion \nhere. It is an attractive illusion. It is an illusion that suggests if \nwe just will adopt it, that it is going to save Social Security. \nUnfortunately, it will not.\n  I would really like to know what the sponsors of this legislation are \nso afraid of. Why have they, through a contorted plan, blocked anybody \nfrom offering an amendment? Why do they want to prevent Senators from \nvoting on alternatives? Why? Because they are afraid of the results. \nThey are\n\n[[Page S4074]]\n\nafraid they would lose in the cold, hard light of day. They fear that \nif we have a real debate out here about options and alternatives that \ntheir alternative wouldn't hold up.\n  What is there to fear by having votes right here on the floor of the \nSenate, and deciding this issue the way we decide all others? Why have \nthey gone through their contorted legislative process, this legislative \nscheme, to prevent people from voting their conscience? I think it is \nbecause they know they have a plan that does not hold up.\n  I think you really have to wonder. Are they really interested in \nprotecting Social Security, including its trust funds and benefit \npayments? Or do they just want a quick vote on a bill whose provisions \ncan't withstand scrutiny?\n  Mr. President, I think we should subject this legislation to scrutiny \njust as we do other legislation. If we do, we will see that instead of \nprotecting Social Security, this legislation endangers Social Security, \nwhile risking more Government shutdowns and default on our obligations.\n  Mr. President, the lockbox that has been offered here today creates \nlimits on publicly-held debt that are supposedly enforceable with 60-\nvote points of order.\n  I strongly support the goal of paying down publicly-held debt. But \ncreating supermajority points of order against raising the debt limit \nwon't accomplish that goal. The ability of the Federal Government to \npay down publicly-held debt is created through tough fiscal \ndecisions, decisions to control spending, decisions not to squander the \nsurpluses that are projected to occur over the next 10 years.\n\n  If Congress fails to make those tough decisions and spends the \nsurpluses, debt will rise. Creating a debt crisis at that point in time \nis too late. At that point, the Federal Government has obligations it \nsimply must meet.\n  Interestingly enough, Chairman Archer agrees with me on this point as \nwell. He says:\n\n       . . . debt limits have a long history of failure in \n     preventing spending and deficits. Hitting a debt limit, like \n     a credit card limit, merely represents the consequences of \n     government spending already approved by the President and \n     Congress.\n\n  So these new limits on debt could preclude the United States from \nmeeting its future financial obligations to repay debt and to honor its \ncommitments. They would produce permanent damage to our credit \nstanding. The debt obligations of the United States are currently \nrecognized as the most creditworthy of any investment in the world. It \nis in our interest to maintain that standard. Even the appearance of \nrisk would impose significant additional costs on American taxpayers.\n  I think we all remember November of 1995. A debt crisis was \nprecipitated when Government borrowing reached the debt limit; two \nmonths later, in January, Moody's, the credit-rating firm, placed \nTreasury securities on review for possible downgrade. It is absurd to \nput us back in that position--endangering the credit rating of the \nUnited States to supposedly protect us against rising debt, when this \nlegislation doesn't do that.\n  In addition to the damage that can be done to the U.S. credit rating, \nthis lockbox also puts Social Security benefit payments at risk, as I \nhave indicated before. Again, that is not just my opinion, it is the \nopinion of the Secretary of the Treasury who has the responsibility to \nmake those payments. It is the opinion of the Chairman of the Ways and \nMeans Committee in the House of Representatives who has jurisdiction \nover these issues.\n  The point is simple: during a debt crisis, the Treasury Department \nhas no ability to prioritize the payment of Government benefits that \nare coming due. If Congress cannot raise the debt limit, Social \nSecurity benefits cannot be made.\n  The sponsors of this lockbox claim they have addressed this problem \nin their legislation. They say they have directed Treasury to give \npriority to Social Security payments. Unfortunately, the Treasury \nDepartment has no ability to do that now. If the Treasury Department \nruns out of borrowing authority and has no cash coming in, \nprioritization of payments won't help anyway. The Treasury would have \nno ability to pay Social Security benefits that are due. Using the debt \nlimit as a fiscal policy tool is bad policy. It directly places at risk \nthe benefit payments to Social Security recipients.\n  These are not the only shortcomings of this legislation. Another of \nthe serious problems with the legislation before the Senate is that it \nrisks creating longer and deeper recessions than our economy might \notherwise experience.\n  I am concerned about the economic and fiscal impact these debt limit \ntargets could have on the economy during a time of recession. I believe \nthese limits would require the Federal Government to take the wrong \nactions during recessionary periods, making recessions more severe and \nnegating the stabilizing counter-cyclical tools the Federal Government \ncan use during times of recession.\n  Sometimes I wonder if we learn from the past. Sometimes I wonder if \nwe are not condemned to repeat the unfortunate experiences of the past \nbecause we don't learn those lessons. We suffered depression after \ndepression in this country before we finally figured out how to counter \nthe cycle of recession and depression. What this legislation could do \nis take away those tools at the very time they are most needed.\n  This lockbox legislation requires the Federal Government to hit a \ndebt limit target on May 1 of each year. Throughout the year, the debt \ntarget could not be exceeded. During years when we are heading towards \nthe trough of the business cycle, revenues grow more slowly because \nmore people are unemployed and expenditures for programs like \nunemployment insurance and food stamps rise. When those two things \nhappen, the deficit gets larger and the Treasury has to issue more \ndebt. Under this proposal, the Treasury couldn't issue more debt. At \nthat point, the lockbox would become a noose on this economy, making \nthe recession worse, requiring the Congress to either raise taxes or \ncut spending at precisely the wrong time.\n\n  That is economic folly. It is at that very time that the counter-\ncyclical tools ought to be used to lessen the recession, to prevent \ndepression. That is what our economic history teaches. We should not \nforget the lessons so bitterly learned.\n  Our friends advocating this legislation say they have included an \nexception for recession in their lockbox. The problem is, it won't \nwork. The exception allows the debt limit targets in the lockbox to \nturn off if the U.S. economy experiences two quarters of real GDP \ngrowth that is less than 1 percent.\n  This chart shows a few examples of recessions over the last 20 years \nto see what would have happened had this legislation been in place. For \nexample, the recession of 1981-1982 lasted from July of 1981 to \nNovember of 1982. The chart shows what was happening with economic \ngrowth during that period. The recession began back in July of 1981. \nBut the trigger under this lockbox legislation would come nine months \nafter the recession had already begun. It chokes off the counter-\ncyclical tools needed for the first nine months, guaranteeing a deeper \nrecession and perhaps even plunging this economy into depression.\n  This is truly dangerous legislation. It should not be passed. We have \nthe Secretary of the Treasury warning, ``Do not pass this \nlegislation;'' we have the Republican chairman of the House Ways and \nMeans Committee warning, ``Do not pass this legislation.'' What is \nwrong with those who continue to advocate, in the face of those \nwarnings, legislation that will not protect Social Security, that will \nendanger it, that further endangers plunging this economy into a worse \nrecession or perhaps even a depression in a time of economic downturn--\nespecially when we have alternatives that we know will work.\n  Those alternatives can't be considered because the advocates of this \nlegislation have engaged in a legislative scheme to prevent amendments, \nto prevent the consideration of alternatives. What a way to legislate.\n  If we look at another example, the recession of 1973-1975, we see the \nquarterly economic growth fluctuated greatly. That recession lasted \nfrom November of 1973 to March of 1975. The lockbox provided for in \nthis legislation would not have kicked in until January of 1975, when \nthe recession had been going on for more than a year. We can see on the \nchart why that is the case. The recession started back in\n\n[[Page S4075]]\n\n1973. We can see economic growth fluctuated back and forth--growing, \nfalling; growing, falling. It would have only been late in the \nrecession that this lockbox legislation would have allowed the counter-\ncyclical policies of the Government to come into play. This legislation \nsimply does not work. This data shows that a recession in the U.S. \neconomy will very likely precipitate a debt crisis, despite the \nexemption provided in the lockbox.\n\n  These are not the only defects of this legislation. There is another \nmajor problem with the lockbox that is before us, because there is \nsomething not included in the lockbox. Medicare is not included in this \nlockbox. Not one penny of non-Social Security surpluses is included in \nthis lockbox, not one penny. Medicare is under more severe fiscal \npressure than Social Security, but Medicare has been left out. Why? \nBecause our friends who are the advocates of this proposal prefer to \nuse the surplus for a tax break scheme. They prefer a tax break scheme, \nso they do not guarantee one penny of the non-Social Security surplus \nfor Medicare.\n  We have an important decision to make. Do we use the non-Social \nSecurity surplus in a tax cut scheme that will provide the greatest \nrelief for the wealthiest among us? Or do we save the Social Security \nsurpluses for Social Security, extend the solvency of Medicare, and \nstill provide room for targeted tax relief and high-priority domestic \nneeds like education, agriculture, health care, and defense? To me, the \nchoice is absolutely clear; we must honor our commitments to the \nseniors of America.\n  That does not mean we do not need to reform Medicare; obviously we \ndo. I think everybody understands we need to take action to put \nMedicare on a more sound financial footing, and I have voted \nconsistently in the Finance Committee to do that. But we must also \nensure that whatever we do to put Medicare on a more sound financial \nfooting also preserves affordable access to high-quality health care \nfor our senior citizens.\n  Responsible Medicare reform will be much more difficult if we do not \nprovide additional resources to Medicare during this time of severe \npressure, because of the demographic changes in this country. The very \nreal pain the balanced budget act of 1997 is already causing suggests \nto me that making additional cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars \nover the next 10 years in Medicare, without providing additional \nresources, would be irresponsible. That is why the lockbox I have \nsupported protects Social Security and Medicare.\n  Senator Lautenberg and I have an alternative lockbox that really does \nprotect Social Security, that does protect Medicare, that does pay down \nthe Federal debt even more aggressively than what our friends on the \nother side of the aisle are proposing, that does provide room for \ntargeted tax relief and for high-priority domestic needs like \neducation, agriculture, health care, and defense.\n  Our Social Security and Medicare lockbox creates supermajority points \nof order against any legislation that does not save the entire Social \nSecurity surplus in each year and does not save at least 40 percent of \nthe non-Social Security surplus for Medicare. Our lockbox is enforced \nwith points of order and sequestration. It is not enforced through the \ndebt limit. It follows the advice of the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. \nRubin. It follows the advice of the Chairman of the Ways and Means \nCommittee in the House of Representatives.\n  Our amendment provides a remedy if Social Security surpluses are \nspent--across-the-board cuts in other programs. That is a real defense \nof Social Security. That is something we know works. Our amendment also \nadds a new supermajority point of order against a budget resolution \nthat violates the off-budget treatment of Social Security. Our \namendment reserves $65 billion for Medicare over the next 5 years, and \n$376 billion over the next 10 years. After passage of comprehensive \nSocial Security and Medicare reform, our alternative provides $385 \nbillion over the next 10 years for targeted tax relief and for high-\npriority needs like education, agriculture, health care, and defense. \nAnd our amendment reduces publicly-held debt by $300 billion more than \nthe Republican lockbox. It protects Social Security, the surpluses and \nthe benefit payments, and it provides additional resources for \nMedicare.\n  That is the type of lockbox the Senate should approve. I hope we have \nan opportunity to consider this alternative. But under the current \nlegislative structure we will not, because the advocates of the \nlegislation before us do not want an alternative considered. They do \nnot want any amendments. They do not want any alternatives. They do not \nwant to give Senators a chance to choose. They want it their way or no \nway.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have ended my presentation. I will be happy to respond \nto a question.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. If the Senator will yield, perhaps I will seek time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Who yields time?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will in a moment yield to the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, just a quick response. The cloture vote \nwhich we will be having is cloture on the amendment. It is not cloture \non the bill. If we were able to invoke cloture, then we would go to a \nvote ultimately on this amendment. But assuming that amendment was then \ndispensed with, either by passage or failure in a final vote, the bill \nitself would remain on the floor subject to other amendments which \ncould include, of course, the ones that have been alluded to by the \nSenator from North Dakota and a variety of other people; the Senator \nfrom South Carolina has talked about his approach; and so on.\n  Our goal is simply to get a vote on this amendment, and then we can \nconsider other options after that. So I want to clarify this for all \nSenators. This is a vote on cloture on this amendment. It is not \ncloture on the bill, so the bill would still be subject to other \namendments if and when we dispense with this.\n  At this time I yield such time as he may need to the distinguished \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank our colleague for clarifying that.\n  When our colleague says he doesn't get a chance to present his \nproposal--obviously, being in the majority, we have the opportunity to \npresent bills and the majority leader has the right to offer amendments \nfirst. We have offered our proposal and we are trying to move toward \nthe passage of a bill. But the amendment of the Senator would be in \norder if it was relevant to the underlying bill--actually, even if it \nwere not relevant it would be in order--after we had completed action \non the amendment by the majority leader. So that part of the argument \nsimply will not hold water. But that makes it parallel to every other \npart of the argument, since none of it will hold water.\n  What our colleague has said and what we are hearing here is basically \nthis: That a lockbox is a bad, terrible, destructive, dangerous idea \nthat could cause a recession or a depression and be catastrophic for \nAmerica. That is argument No. 1. But argument No. 2 is: If you want to \ndo it, we have a better way of doing it and ours will do all these \nthings better.\n  If logic could speak for itself on the floor of the Senate, it would \nscream at the torture that it is being put to here. What we are seeing \nhere is very simply the President being called on a commitment he has \nmade, and the President was not telling the truth when he made the \ncommitment, and he desperately does not want to have to live up to it. \nThose are strong words and I would not say them if I could not back \nthem up.\n  Here is the reality of where we are. In 1993 Social Security took in \n$45 billion more than it spent in benefits, and under the Clinton \nadministration and the Congress every penny of that $45 billion was \nspent on something other than Social Security.\n  In 1994, Social Security took in $56 billion more than it paid out in \nbenefits, and under the Clinton administration and the Congress every \npenny of that $56 billion was plundered and spent on something else.\n  In 1995, $62 billion was taken in in Social Security taxes above the \namount\n\n[[Page S4076]]\n\nwe needed to pay benefits, and every penny of that $62 billion was \nplundered and spent funding other Government programs.\n  In 1996, it was $67 billion that was plundered.\n  In 1997, it was $81 billion that was plundered.\n  In 1998, the President said, ``Save Social Security first; don't \nspend a penny of this surplus on Government programs; don't give a \npenny of it back in tax relief.'' Everybody remembers the President \nsaying that. But in 1998, we spent $30 billion of the $99 billion that \nSocial Security took in above the amount it needed to pay benefits.\n  The plain truth, despite all this talk about saving the Social \nSecurity trust fund, is we have consistently spent the money that came \ninto the trust fund on other Government programs.\n  Let's get one thing clear from the language. Nobody is talking about \nsaving Social Security here. To save Social Security, you have to have \na program to replace all these IOUs with wealth. You have to have a \nprogram to replace all this debt with investment.\n  As you will remember, when the President said, ``Save Social Security \nfirst,'' he was going to study the problem for a year. He studied it \nfor a year. Then he had a big meeting down at the White House, which I \nand many others here attended. We were waiting for some proposal from \nthe President. What we got was a political copout which, for all \npractical purposes, did nothing and it continued plundering the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  Senator Domenici has come up with a very simple program. It has not \nsaved Social Security. It does not deal with the huge financial \nliability in Social Security in the future. What it does is it tries to \nprevent us from taking the Social Security surplus and spending it on \nsomething else, something that many of our colleagues desperately want \nto do, but they do not want people to know they want to do it.\n  How does the Domenici proposal work and the proposal that has been \nrefined by Senator Abraham? What the Abraham-Domenici proposal does is \nthis: It sets the amount of money that the Government can borrow each \nyear so that the Social Security surplus has to be used to buy down the \nGovernment debt, so that the Social Security surplus cannot be spent, \nand so that it cannot be used for tax cuts.\n  The proposal before us is not very complicated, despite all the cloud \nof rhetoric and doublespeak. The proposal before us is very, very \nsimple. It says that next year, we are going to be taking in $138 \nbillion of surplus in Social Security, so that we want to set the \namount of money the Government can borrow without having to vote on \nborrowing again, such that none of that $138 billion can be spent.\n  That is pretty simple. If it is spent, what we will have to do is \nhave a vote in the Senate where someone will have to get 60 votes in \norder to plunder that money from Social Security.\n  This is not unlike what families do when they sit around the kitchen \ntable and get out their pencil and on the back of an envelope and set \nout a budget and say: I want to save this much money, and we are \nsetting this limit on the amount of money that we can spend because we \nwant to use this money to pay off some of the debt we have, or we want \nto use this money to send our children to college or buy a new \nrefrigerator, go on vacation, or whatever they want to do.\n  In response to our proposal to prevent the Social Security surplus \nfrom being spent or used for tax cuts, for that matter, since our \ncolleague launched off on that program, what do our Democrat colleagues \nsay, and what does the administration say? They say, if you do not \nleave the law as it is so we can plunder the Social Security surplus, \nwe could have a recession. They say: If you don't allow us to plunder \nthe Social Security surplus, the creditworthiness of the Government \ncould be lowered because we could have trouble borrowing money. In \nessence, they are saying that the financial world, the prosperity of \nAmerica, the creditworthiness of the Federal Government will all come \nto an end if we do not let the Federal Government steal money from the \nSocial Security surplus.\n\n  It seems to me if we are talking about the creditworthiness of the \nGovernment, in terms of its credibility with working Americans, that \nthe way we get real credibility in the Government is to stop stealing \nthe Social Security surplus.\n  In terms of the Secretary of the Treasury saying we are doing it the \nwrong way, the reality is, they do not want to do it any way. If they \nhave a better proposal, let's see it. If it is enforceable, let's \nconsider it. If they are willing to set out a procedure which \nstrengthens our ability to stop stealing money from the Social Security \ntrust fund, I would like to get a chance to look at it.\n  Let me tell you, the reality is that the opposition to the proposal \nby Senator Abraham and Senator Domenici is, they do not want to stop \nstealing from the Social Security trust fund, so they create this giant \nruse that somehow the Treasury will not be able to operate if it cannot \ntake money out of the Social Security trust fund; that we are going to \nhave a recession if we cannot take money out of the Social Security \ntrust fund. Any legitimate concern about the flexibility of the \nTreasury in borrowing, we have said from the beginning we are willing \nto work on. Any flexibility they need in dealing with short-term cash \nproblems, we are willing to work on. But what we are not willing to \nnegotiate away is a commitment to stop this plundering of the Social \nSecurity trust fund. That is what this issue is about.\n  The President's budget this year, and I have the budget right here, \nif we do everything the President proposes to do, most of which we are \nnot going to do, it says he will take $42 billion out of the Social \nSecurity trust fund this year and spend it on other things. We believe \nthat is wrong. We do not believe the Social Security trust fund should \nbe spent on other Government programs.\n  What we are trying to do with this lockbox is to guarantee that none \nof this Social Security money is spent and none of this Social Security \nmoney is used for tax cuts; that the money is used, until we decide how \nwe are going to fix Social Security, to simply buy down the Government \ndebt.\n  The amazing thing to me is that this is exactly what the President \nsays he wants to do. It is exactly what our Democrat colleagues say \nthey want to do. But when we try to put teeth in it and make it \nenforceable with a supermajority vote, suddenly they do not want to do \nit. Suddenly, when we try to make it enforceable, they say, ``Well, we \ncould have a recession; the Federal Government could lose its \ncreditworthiness and its ability to borrow.''\n  What does it tell you when the President says, ``Save Social Security \nfirst, don't spend the surplus, don't give it back in taxes''; when our \nDemocrat colleagues say, ``Save Social Security, don't spend the \nsurplus, don't give it back in taxes''; and then we have two of our \nMembers, Senator Abraham and Senator Domenici, come forward with a \nproposal that actually does what they say they want to do, and not only \ndoes it, but would require 60 votes in the Senate, rather than 51, in \norder to actually violate the commitment. In other words, the \ndifference here is, we are not talking about words, we are not talking \nabout rhetoric, we are talking about a real lockbox program.\n  A real lockbox program is put forward that would require a \nsupermajority vote in order to plunder the Social Security trust fund. \nThen, all of a sudden, the President does not want to do what he told \nus he wanted to do.\n  All of a sudden, our Democrat colleagues have all kinds of concerns: \nWe are going to have a recession; we are going to destroy the \ncreditworthiness of the Federal Government; prosperity as we know it is \ngoing to come to an end--if we stop the Federal Government from \nplundering the Social Security trust fund. It would lead one to believe \nthat they did not mean it when they said it.\n  We are all in agreement if we say do not plunder the Social Security \ntrust fund. If we held up our hands here, 100 Members would say do not \nplunder the Social Security trust fund. But when two Members come \nforward with a program to really prevent it from being plundered, then \nall of a sudden we do not agree anymore. I know these issues get \nconfusing, but I think people are going to have to make a judgment here \nas to who is serious about protecting the Social Security surplus and \nwho is not.\n  We have a proposal to stop the plundering of Social Security by \nsimply requiring that the debt be bought down\n\n[[Page S4077]]\n\nby the amount of the surplus and that if you do not do that, you have \nto get 60 votes in the Senate; in other words, you have to prove that \nsomething extraordinary happened to convince 60 Members of the Senate \nto go back on their word. That is all this bill does. It is not \ncomplicated.\n  If you do not want to do that, it suggests to me that you were not \nserious to begin with, that you did not mean it when you said, ``Save \nSocial Security first,'' that you did not mean it when you said, \n``Don't plunder the Social Security trust fund.''\n  We know the President did not mean it because in his budget he \nplunders $42 billion right here in black and white. The question is \nnot, Was the President being straight with the American people? We know \nhe was not. The question is, Is Congress being straight with the \nAmerican people when we say we are not going to do it?\n  If our Democrat colleagues have a better way to do this, I would like \nto see it. I do not believe we have any monopoly on wisdom. But the \nplain truth is, I do not believe everybody wants to stop plundering the \nSocial Security trust fund. I believe there are people who want to \ncontinue to plunder it. And I think that is what this debate is about.\n  Let me run over some of these issues.\n  ``It is risky to stop stealing from the Social Security trust fund.'' \nThat is what our colleagues say. I think it is risky to continue to \nsteal from the Social Security trust fund because when the baby boomers \nstart to retire, unless we begin to invest this money, there is no way \nwe can pay benefits, and we are going to have to raise the payroll tax \nor cut benefits. So our colleagues say it is risky not to steal the \ntrust fund. I say it is risky to continue to steal it.\n  They say using the debt limit as a policy tool is dangerous. Well, \nwhat other tool do we have? They act as if we are just simply robots--\nthat every time the President goes out and spends money, that when the \nbill collector is knocking on the door, all we do is just pay out the \nmoney and go on about our business. That is not the way America works.\n  When the bill collector comes and knocks on the door of the modest \ndwellings of working men and women in America, they do have to pay the \nbill collector. But they do not just keep merrily going along their \nway. They sit down, get out their credit cards, get out the butcher \nknives, cut up the credit cards, they write out a budget, they have a \n``come to Jesus'' meeting at the kitchen table, and then they start \nagain.\n  What we are trying to do in Government with this amendment is nothing \nless than what Joe and Sarah Brown do on the first day of the month \nevery month that comes along; and that is, set out priorities and set \nsome kind of limit on our spending. If we cannot use the debt collector \nbeing at the door to do something about spending and plundering the \nSocial Security trust fund, what can we use? If you do not get alarmed \nwhen the bill collector is knocking on your door, you are going to end \nup going bankrupt. Now is the time, when the bill collector is at the \ndoor, to try to change the way we are doing business. That is all this \nbill does.\n\n  As far as the suggestion that if we try to prevent stealing from the \nSocial Security trust fund, we are going to have a recession, I mean, \nplease, it is one thing to try to confuse people, it is another thing \nto insult their intelligence. How can reducing Government debt cause a \nrecession? How can stopping stealing from the trust fund send the \neconomy into a tailspin? Exactly the opposite is true.\n  Now then, the final bromide, unimaginable suggestion is, ``Well, what \nabout Medicare? They are solving the Social Security problem, but \nthey're not solving the Medicare problem.'' There are a lot of problems \nwe are not solving here. This bill does not bring peace in Kosovo \neither. This bill does not stop violence in our schools either. This \nbill does not make people love their families and pay their bills \neither. This bill does not make people feel good about themselves in \nall cases either. But the bill does not claim to do all those things.\n  Why don't we solve the Social Security problem today, and then start \nworking on Medicare? But to suggest that there is something wrong with \nthis bill because it only stops plundering from Social Security and \nthat we have not fixed the Medicare problem--we can always find \nsomething we have not done, but what we ought to be concerned about is \nwhat we are doing.\n  There is no surplus in the Medicare trust fund. Medicare is a very \ndifferent program from Social Security. But I would like to say that on \na bipartisan basis, led by Senator Breaux, we had a bipartisan majority \non a commission that wanted to fix Medicare; and this President, Bill \nClinton, killed that effort--killed that effort. So to stand up here \nand suggest that when Senator Abraham is trying to stop the stealing \nfrom Social Security, that there is something wrong because he had not \nsolved the problems of Medicare is absolutely outrageous--outrageous.\n  Let's solve the problem with Social Security today, and start working \non Medicare tomorrow. And, by the way, it seems to me that Senator \nBreaux and Senator Bob Kerrey and most Members who sit on this side of \nthe aisle are ready to deal with Medicare and the President and most \nMembers who sit on the other side of the aisle do not seem to care.\n  The next thing is, somehow this has to do with tax breaks for the \nrich. Our colleagues can never debate an issue without engaging in \nclass warfare. They can never debate an issue without saying somehow \nthis is helping the rich: ``If you stop stealing from the Social \nSecurity trust fund, you are helping the rich. If you let people keep \nmore of what they earn, you are helping the rich.'' Of course, whenever \nthey are raising taxes, they are taxing only the rich, even if the rich \nmake $25,000 a year.\n  The point is, this bill has absolutely nothing to do with tax cuts \nfor the rich, the poor, or the people in between. In fact, this bill \nsays that the Social Security surplus cannot be used for tax cuts. And \nto suggest that somehow, by locking away the Social Security trust \nfund, and not letting it be plundered either to spend, which is the \nreal danger, or to be used for tax cuts, that somehow to suggest that \nhelps rich people, what it does is it helps the creditworthiness of the \nGovernment and it puts us in a position to fix Social Security.\n  But the idea that this somehow helps the wealthiest among us--anytime \nthe Democrats do not want to do something, always their excuse is, the \nwealthiest among us are going to benefit. ``If we do not keep \nplundering the Social Security trust fund, the wealthiest among us are \ngoing to benefit. If we can't steal that money and spend it on all \nthese programs, the wealthiest among us are going to benefit. Let us \nkeep stealing the Social Security trust fund because, if you don't keep \nstealing it, the wealthiest among us will benefit.''\n\n  I do not know who these people are talking about. The wealthiest \namong us do not depend on Social Security as much as middle-income \nAmericans depend on Social Security. What does this wealthiest among us \nbusiness have to do with stealing from Social Security?\n  Finally, they say they have another way. It reminds me when we were \ndebating a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and we were \none vote short of sending it to the States. We know the States would \nhave ratified it. Our colleagues who were against it and who voted \nagainst it and who killed it, they weren't really against it. They just \ndidn't like the way we were doing it. They had other ways of doing it. \nThey had a better program, which by the way contained a limit on debt \nheld by the public, the very mechanism contained in this amendment. \nThey would have done it better than we would have done it. They killed \nthe balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. It failed by one \nvote. It could have changed American history.\n  They didn't say they were against it. They are not against the \nlockbox. They are not against what Senator Abraham is trying to do. \nThey just want to do it differently. They think it is a bad idea and it \ncould cause a recession and it could help the wealthiest among us and \nit could do all those things, but they want to do it. If you decide you \nwant to do it after they tell you what a terrible idea it is to quit \nstealing from Social Security, after you have crossed that\n\n[[Page S4078]]\n\nthreshold, then they say, well, actually we are not against it, but we \nwant to do it a different way. If we took their way, they would be for \ndoing it another way.\n  The problem is, they are not for it. The problem is, they want to \nkeep stealing this money out of the Social Security trust fund. That is \nwhat this debate is about.\n  The sadness of this whole deal is that instead of debating a \nlegitimate issue, we are engaged in this gigantic ruse to confuse and \nbefuddle the American people. We have a proposal before us that is very \nsimple. It says we are going to collect $138 billion more than we are \nspending in Social Security, and we do not want any of that money \nspent. So we are going to adjust the amount of money Government can \nborrow and force that $138 billion to be used to reduce the \nindebtedness of the Federal Government. That is what this amendment \ndoes.\n  But rather than our colleagues standing up and saying, no, we do not \nwant to do that because we want to spend part of that money on other \nthings, instead of standing up and saying, here is what we want to \nspend it on, we want to spend it on A, B, C, D, and E, and these are \nall vitally important and it is worth stealing the money from the \nSocial Security trust fund to fund it, rather than standing up and \nsaying that, they say you are going to cause a recession. You are going \nto destroy the creditworthiness of the Federal Government. You are \ngoing to help the richest among us. The richest among us are going to \nbenefit if you don't steal from the Social Security trust fund.\n  Maybe the American people are confused or maybe with all the terrible \nthings that are happening in the world today, maybe they do not care. \nBut it seems to me that we can't have a meaningful political dialogue \nwhen we do not debate the issues that are before us. If you are not for \npreventing the Social Security trust fund from being spent for other \nthings, stand up and say it. But this tortured logic that if you really \nforce the money to be used to buy down the debt of the Federal \nGovernment, you are risking a recession or you are helping the richest \namong us or that if you decide to get through all that, well, but there \nis a better way to do it, they could do it in a better way if we just \nlet them do it, I wish for once we could have a straightforward debate. \nDo you want to stop taking this money out of the Social Security trust \nfund and spend it on other things or not? Yea or nay. Yes or no. Black \nor white. But you know why we are not having that debate--because our \ncolleagues have already said they want to do this. The President has \nalready said he wants to do this. He has urged us to do it.\n\n  What is the difference between what they are saying and what Senator \nAbraham is doing? The difference is simple. They are saying it, and he \nis doing it. The difference is, they are getting the rhetoric right; he \nis getting the program right. The difference is, they are saying don't \nspend it, don't use it for tax cuts, use it to pay off debt. The \nproblem they have is that the Abraham amendment actually pays the debt \noff, and it would force the Federal Government to get a supermajority \nvote in order to violate that principle.\n  If you say you are for something and then somebody has a way of doing \nit and you vote no, what does it mean? Well, to finish and yield the \nfloor, what it means is, you weren't serious when you said it to begin \nwith.\n  The debate here is between people who do want to pillage the trust \nfund and those who do not. It is that simple.\n  Using this to buy down debt does not solve the Social Security \nproblem, but we have in this amendment the vehicle that would let us \nuse this money we are saving to solve the Social Security problem, if \nwe could reach a bipartisan agreement. But we can't solve it if we \ndon't have the money, and if we don't do something very much like the \nAbraham amendment has proposed, we are going to end up spending this \nmoney.\n  Do you want to spend the money or do you want to see it buy down \ndebt? If you want to buy down debt, support the Abraham amendment. If \nyou don't, vote no but say so. I think that is really what the debate \nis about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from South Carolina \nis recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Texas \nsaid we ought to have a good political debate, and he allows me to make \na good political debate in that he made it political talking about \nDemocrats and taxes and the wealthy.\n  The truth of the matter is, that is how the economy got this way, \noutstandingly good, in that we taxed the wealthy back in 1993 on Social \nSecurity. It was that gentleman, the Senator from Texas, who said they \nare going to be hunting us down in the street and shooting us like \ndogs.\n  He raises these strawmen. Another strawman--I am going to use his \ntext; I wouldn't say these things if I couldn't back them up--he says, \nthe trouble here is that we feel that a lockbox is a dangerous thing.\n  That is exactly what he said back in July 1990. I made the motion on \nthe Budget Committee and we voted 19 to 1 for a lockbox, bipartisan \nexcept for one. It was the distinguished Senator from Texas who said it \nwas a dangerous thing. But we went ahead, passed it in the House and \nSenate, and President George Bush, on November 5, 1990, signed that \nlockbox into law. That lockbox is part of the amendment of the majority \nleader and the Senator from Michigan. Look on page 3. You see they \nreiterate 13301, but on page 10 they take it away.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer heard me tell about that \ninsurance company slogan that ``Capital Life will surely pay, if the \nsmall print on the back don't take it away.''\n  My Republican colleague talked about how we always get into a wealth \nargument. They get into any and every effort to get rid of Social \nSecurity. They don't like it. In 1964, I remember, in the Goldwater \ncampaign, they were going to abolish Social Security. In 1990, I \nfinally got the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Heinz, to agree with me, \nand he changed around the mindset. I wish we had him here now and in \nthe caucus to straighten out this nonsense, because what they are doing \nis exactly what they are not doing. They guarantee that every dime that \nis spent is going to be spent on either tax cuts or other spending \nrather than Social Security, when you pay down the debt. That is what \nthey are saying.\n  How is the debt caused? The debt is caused by spending too much. \nSpending too much on what? Any and every program. It could be defense. \nIt could be Kosovo. It could be food stamps. It could be foreign aid. \nIt could be law enforcement. But when you spend too much, you have a \ndebt.\n  We haven't spent too much on Social Security. That is one particular \npoint on which I agree with the distinguished Senator from Texas. When \nhe says, plundering, plundering--I use the word ``loot''--we can just \nsay: Trust funds plundered in order to give that balanced budget, that \nunified budget, that unified debt--you don't hear that word--that is \nthe same thing as paying down the public debt.\n  So, yes, we plundered Social Security for $857 billion, and we \nplundered military retirement, civil retirement, unemployment, highway, \nairport, and even Medicare, and we have been violating our very \ndoctrine, making it a criminal penalty to use trust funds, pension \nfunds, to pay the company debt. That is the Pension Act of 1994. I know \nthe distinguished Presiding Officer--he and I ended up talking about \nDenny McLain. I won't have to say that again. I can tell you now what \nwe say in the private economy is, if you use the company pension fund \nto pay down the company debt, it is a felony. But it is good Government \nup here.\n  But back to my poor Republican friends. Not only '64 and '90, but in \n'93 we got to the balanced budget amendment and we said, gentlemen, on \nthe other side of the aisle, I will vote for you on a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution if you do not plunder Social Security. It \nis section 7, on page 5--I remember it well--where they said, no, we \nhave to still plunder it. They could have gotten a group of us Senators \non this side of the aisle, but they demanded to plunder Social \nSecurity. Then, Mr. President, right on up to the present date, read \nwhat they say. They say that the surplus shall not be used for non-\nSocial Security\n\n[[Page S4079]]\n\nspending or tax cuts, but then when they say it uses the Social \nSecurity surplus to reduce the debt, that is exactly what it does.\n  The distinguished Senator from Texas says there is no plan here to \nsave Social Security or make up for its debt. Why don't we say, use the \nSocial Security surplus for only Social Security purposes, namely, pay \ndown the $857 billion we owe it? They don't come and say that, Mr. \nPresident, no siree. They just demand, at every particular turn, that \nwe get rid of it and now they want to privatize it. I refer, of course, \nto the particular language in section 202 of the budget resolution that \nthey just brought in here as a group. This says that when the Committee \non Ways and Means of the House and the Finance Committee in the Senate \ngets a conference report submitted that enhances retirement security--\nthat is nebulous; they think it is enhanced when they savage it, \nplunder it--through structural programmatic reform, the appropriate \nchairman of the Committee on the Budget--that means Mr. Kasich on the \nHouse side and Mr. Domenici on the Senate side--they can do anything: \nincrease the appropriate allocations and aggregates of the budget \nauthority; they can adjust the levels to determine compliance with pay-\nas-you-go, which in essence repeals the pay-as-you-go provision; and \nthey can reduce the revenue aggregates.\n  What does it mean? You have to call New Mexico and find out from the \nSenator from New Mexico what it means. That is what is going to happen. \nMonkeyshines here is going into the particular amendment.\n  I can tell you here and now, Mr. President, that this is really a \ndisaster. What we are doing is formalizing spending, spending all the \nSocial Security surplus. At least the President of the United States \nsays he wants to save 62 percent and he is going to spend 38 percent on \nsomething else. That is what the President said in his budget. We are \ngoing to save 62 percent, but we are going to spend 38 percent on \nsomething else.\n  Do you know what this Republican amendment says? It says we want to \nmake sure we spend 100 percent on something else because it is not for \nSocial Security, it is for the debt. When they use that euphemism \n``public debt,'' as I have explained many times, you have an American \nExpress and a Visa card. The Senator from Texas has abandoned Dickie \nFlats; he has gone to Joe and Sarah Brown. He says when Joe and Sarah \nBrown sit around the kitchen table and pay their bills--but I can tell \nyou what Joe and Sarah Brown never do: They don't take their Visa card \nand pay off their American Express. But that's what this amendment \ndoes. It says take your Social Security card, the surplus, and pay off \nthe debt of any and every other program or tax cut--100 percent. They \nformalize what we tried to stop having been done in the law, when we \npassed the Balanced Budget Act of 1990. This amendment repeals that \nparticular discipline, the pay-as-you-go program. It goes right on down \nthere plundering. That is all it can be used for. It can't be used for \nSocial Security. There, Mr. President, is the fiscal cancer. This \nSenator has been working on it for years.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed this chart in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the chart was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                  TRUST FUNDS LOOTED TO BALANCE BUDGET\n                      [By fiscal year, in billions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 1999     2000     2004\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSocial Security..............................      857      994    1,624\nMedicare:\n    HI.......................................      129      140      184\n    SMI......................................       39       44       64\nMilitary Retirement..........................      141      148      181\nCivilian Retirement..........................      490      520      634\nUnemployment.................................       79       88      113\nHighway......................................       25       26       32\nAirport......................................       11       14       25\nRailroad Retirement..........................       23       24       28\nOther........................................       57       59       69\n                                              --------------------------\n  Total......................................    1,851    2,057    2,954\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

Hsitorical Tables, Budget of the U.S. Government FY 1998, beginning in 1962 CBO's 2000 Economic and Budget\n  Outlook.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as you pay down the debt--that was the \nunified--that is how it was going down. That is where they got here \nthis year to talk about a surplus for the first time. But we got \ntogether with the Concord Coalition and we got together with Barrons \nand several other responsible groups and they said there isn't any \nsurplus. This Barrons headline says, ``Hey, Guys, There is No Budget \nSurplus.''\n  The only reason they can call it a surplus is because of what they \nrecommend in this amendment, paying down the public debt. That is the \nunified budget. But in the regular overall budget, the debt continues \nto increase and increase, and the interest costs continue to increase \nand increase, and you can't give a tax cut without raising taxes. You \ncan't just cut your revenues without increasing your debt.\n  We have had all the spending cuts for 8 years of Reagan, 4 years of \nBush, 6 years of Clinton. Nobody is recommending around here any cut in \nspending. The first order of business was $18 billion more for the \nmilitary pay. The next order of business we are going to vote on is \nanother $6 billion to $10 billion for Kosovo. Everybody is going to \nsupport that. So the spending goes up, up and away. We are down to bare \nbones. Yes, instead of abolishing the Department of Education, now they \nwant to increase spending for education. So we can save, and the \nPresiding Officer can save, $10 billion or $20 billion; any individual \ncan. But, collectively, as a Congress, we are not going to do it. What \nhappens is that we need revenues in here, and we need to quit playing \nthe game of paying down the public debt.\n  Our problem is that the White House doesn't know how to run a war and \nour Republican Congress doesn't know how to run a peace. They come up \nhere with this Mickey Mouse amendment, saying exactly the opposite of \nwhat it really provides. They say you can't use it or any spending. You \nhave to use it on all spending but Social Security, because you are \nusing Social Security money. You can't use it on tax cuts, you have to \nuse it for tax cuts. Certainly, you can't use it for Social Security.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am glad to yield to the Senator from North Dakota for \na question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator yielding for a \nquestion. I wanted to note that for, I guess, the seventh year now that \nI have been here in the Senate, the one consistent voice on this issue \nhas been the Senator from South Carolina. I find it interesting, and I \nwonder if he sees the same irony as I do, that the very people that now \nbring us the notion of a lockbox, because they are worried about the \nSocial Security trust fund, were just a few years ago on the floor of \nthe Senate ridiculing the Senator from South Carolina, myself, my \ncolleague from North Dakota, and others, because we said what you want \nto do with a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget is \nto put a provision in the Constitution that says Social Security \nrevenues must be counted not as part of a trust fund, but as part of \nthe ordinary operating revenues of the Federal budget.\n  In other words, they wanted to put in the Constitution the misuse of \nthe Social Security trust funds and decide that you have a budget \nsurplus only when you have used the Social Security trust funds to get \nthere. So we said no; if you are going to do something in the \nConstitution about a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, \nlet's at least be honest with the trust funds and say the budget is \nonly balanced when you have not misused Social Security trust funds.\n  I should have brought the charts. I was thinking about bringing the \ncharts over to read all of the comments that were made on the floor of \nthe Senate about our position at that point.\n  They have three stages of denial:\n  First, we are not misusing the Social Security trust funds.\n  Second, they said but if we are misusing them, we promise to stop.\n  If we promise to stop, we can't do it for the first 8 years. We will \npromise to stop 12 years from now.\n  Those were the three stages of denial when we debated the issue of a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  But I just find it interesting that those who now say they are the \nprotectors are the ones who are building a lockbox and are the very, \nvery same interests who are on the floor of the Senate saying we should \namend the Constitution in a manner that provides that Social Security \nrevenues will be treated like all other revenues of government. It is \nno protection at all, and they would cement that in the Constitution of \nthe United States. When we objected, they said: You are wrong; this is \nexactly what we want to do. Now we have this little pirouette on this \nfloor when they come back and say we are the ones who want to protect \nSocial Security.\n  I just wanted to ask the question if the Senator from South Carolina \nsees the same irony here, although this amendment doesn't do what it is \nadvertised to do. The Senator from South Carolina is absolutely \ncorrect; the rhetoric in support of this amendment is directly in \ncontradiction to the kind of things we heard from that side of the \naisle just 3 to 4 years ago.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. This the same trickery. It is one grand farce. It is \none grand fraud.\n  So to the lockbox everyone is given the keys, whether you want a tax \ncut, or spending for a particular program on policy, or otherwise. They \nare given the key, except Social Security. That is the only crowd that \ncan't spend it. You can spend it for any and everything but Social \nSecurity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Republican lockbox proposal is deeply \nflawed, and does not deserve to be adopted. It does nothing to extend \nthe life of the Social Security Trust Fund for future beneficiaries. In \nfact, it would do just the reverse. This legislation actually places \nSocial Security at greater risk than it is today. It would allow \npayroll tax dollars that belong to Social Security to be spent instead \non risky privatization schemes. And, because of the harsh debt ceiling \nlimits it would impose, this plan could produce a governmental shutdown \nthat would jeopardize the timely payment of Social Security benefits to \ncurrent recipients.\n  It is time to look behind the rhetoric of the proponents of the \nlockbox. Their statements convey the impression that they have taken a \nmajor step toward\n\n[[Page S4081]]\n\nprotecting Social Security. In truth, they have done nothing to \nstrengthen Social Security. Their proposal would not provide even one \nadditional dollar to pay benefits to future retirees. Nor would it \nextend the solvency of the Trust Fund by even one more day. It merely \nrecommits to Social Security those dollars which already belong to the \nTrust Fund under current law. At best, that is all their so-called \nlockbox would do.\n  By contrast, President Clinton's proposed budget would contribute 2.8 \ntrillion new dollars of the surplus to Social Security over the next 15 \nyears. By doing so, the President's budget would extend the life of the \nTrust Fund by more than a generation, to beyond 2050.\n  There is a fundamental difference between the parties over what to do \nwith the savings which will result from using the surplus for debt \nreduction. The Federal Government will realize enormous savings from \npaying down the debt. As a result, billions of dollars that would have \nbeen required to pay interest on the national debt will become \navailable each year for other purposes. President Clinton believes \nthose debt savings should be used to strengthen Social Security. I \nwholeheartedly agree. But the Republicans refuse to commit those \ndollars to Social Security. They are short-changing Social Security, \nwhile pretending to save it.\n  Currently, the Federal Government spends more than 11 cents of every \nbudget dollar to pay the cost of interest on the national debt. By \nusing the Social Security surplus to pay down the debt over the next 15 \nyears, we can reduce the debt service cost to just 2 cents of every \nbudget dollar by 2014; and to zero by 2018. Sensible fiscal management \nnow will produce enormous savings to the Government in future years. \nSince it was payroll tax revenues which make the debt reduction \npossible, those savings should in turn be used to strengthen Social \nSecurity.\n  That is what President Clinton rightly proposed in his budget. His \nplan would provide an additional $2.8 trillion to Social Security, most \nof it debt service savings, between 2030 and 2055. As a result, the \ncurrent level of Social Security benefits would be fully financed for \nall future recipients for more than half a century. It is an eminently \nreasonable plan. But Republican Members of Congress oppose it.\n  Not only does the Republican plan fail to provide any new resources \nto fund Social Security benefits for future retirees, it does not even \neffectively guarantee that existing payroll tax revenues will be used \nto pay Social Security benefits. They have deliberately built a \ntrapdoor in their lockbox. Their plan would allow Social Security \npayroll taxes to be used instead to finance unspecified reform plans. \nThis loophole opens the door to risky schemes to finance private \nretirement accounts at the expense of Social Security's guaranteed \nbenefits. If these dollars are expended on private accounts, there will \nbe nothing left for debt reduction, and no new resources to fund future \nSocial Security benefits. Such a privatization plan could actually make \nSocial Security's financial picture far worse than it is today, \nnecessitating deep benefit cuts in the future.\n  A genuine lockbox would prevent any such diversion of funds. A \ngenuine lockbox would guarantee that those payroll tax dollars would be \nin the Trust Fund when needed to pay benefits to future recipients. The \nRepublican lockbox does just the opposite. It actually invites a raid \non the Social Security Trust Fund.\n  Republican retirement security reform could be nothing more than tax \ncuts to subsidize private accounts disproportionately benefiting their \nwealthy friends. Placing Social Security on a firm financial footing \nshould be our highest budget priority, not further enriching the \nalready wealthy. Two-thirds of our senior citizens depend upon Social \nSecurity retirement benefits for more than 50 percent of their annual \nincome. Without it, half the Nation's elderly would fall below the \npoverty line.\n  To our Republican colleagues, I say: ``If you are unwilling to \nstrengthen Social Security, at least do not weaken it. Do not divert \ndollars which belong to the Social Security Trust Fund for other \npurposes. Every dollar in that Trust Fund is needed to pay future \nSocial Security benefits.''\n  The proposed lockbox poses a second, very serious threat to Social \nSecurity. By using the debt ceiling as an enforcement mechanism, it \nruns the risk of creating a government shutdown crisis. The Republicans \npropose to enforce their lockbox by mandating dangerously low debt \nceilings. Such a reduced debt ceiling could make it impossible for the \nFederal Government to meet its financial obligations--including its \nobligation to pay Social Security benefits to millions of men and women \nwho depend upon them. The risk is real.\n  The misguided debt ceiling proposal would create a Sword of Damocles \nwhich could fall at any time with the slightest miscalculation. If the \nCongressional Budget Office's economic projections are slightly off, if \nthere is an economic downturn and unemployment rises, if the on-budget \nsurplus is not quite as large as anticipated--any of these events could \ncause the sword to fall. The proposal is so extreme that it could \ntrigger a shutdown crisis even if the level of debt was declining, \nmerely because it was not declining as quickly as projected. The \nGovernment shutdown provoked by irresponsible Republican tactics in \n1995 taught us the danger inherent in  taking such risks. Yet, the \ncurrent debt ceiling scheme seems to suggest that the Republican \nelephant's memory is failing.\n\n  There would be many innocent casualties of a new government shutdown. \nIt is ironic that many of those who would be harmed most by a shutdown \nare the elderly and disabled citizens dependent on Social Security. If \nthe debt ceiling is reached, the government would be unable to issue \ntheir benefit checks. The law is very clear. The President would have \nno discretion. Social Security benefits could not be paid.\n  The sponsors of the lockbox claim that the legislation protects \nSocial Security benefits by making them a ``priority'' for payment. \nHowever, that will not solve the problem. Once the debt limit has been \nreached, payment priorities will be irrelevant. The debt ceiling will \nprevent all payments from being made. There will be no money to pay any \nobligation of the federal government--including Social Security \nbenefits.\n  Those advocating this harsh bill will also claim that Congress would \nnever allow Social Security recipients to go without their checks for \nlong. However, this bill would require a super-majority to raise the \ndebt ceiling so that the checks could be issued. Getting the necessary \nvotes would take time. I believe even a few days would be too long for \nus to ask the elderly and disabled to wait. For many Social Security \nrecipients, that monthly check is a financial lifeline. They need it to \nbuy food and prescription drugs, to pay the rent, and for other \nnecessities of life. They can't afford to wait while Congress debates. \nThis legislation, if enacted, would make Social Security recipients \npotential pawns in a future debt ceiling crisis. That may not be the \nsponsor's intent, but it could very well be the result. It is \nfundamentally wrong to put those who depend on Social Security at risk \nin this way.\n  The lockbox which proponents claim will save Social Security actually \nimperils it. As Treasury Secretary Rubin has said, ``This legislation \ndoes nothing to extend the solvency of the Social Security Trust Fund, \nwhile potentially threatening the ability to make Social Security \npayments to millions of Americans.''\n  While this lockbox provides no genuine protection for Social \nSecurity, it provides no protection at all for Medicare. The \nRepublicans are so indifferent to senior citizens' health care that \nthey have completely omitted Medicare from their lockbox.\n  By contrast, Democrats have proposed to devote 15 percent of the \nsurplus to Medicare over the next 15 years. Those new dollars would \ncome entirely from the on-budget portion of the surplus. The \nRepublicans have adamantly refused to provide any additional funds for \nMedicare. Instead, they propose to spend the entire on-budget surplus \non tax cuts disproportionately benefitting the wealthiest Americans.\n  According to the most recent projections of the Medicare Trustees, if \nwe do not provide additional resources, keeping Medicare solvent for \nthe next 25\n\n[[Page S4082]]\n\nyears will require benefit cuts of almost 11 percent--massive cuts of \nhundreds of billions of dollars. Keeping it solvent for 50 years will \nrequire cuts of 25 percent.\n  The conference agreement passed by House and Senate Republicans \nearmarks the money that should be used for Medicare for tax cuts. \nEight-hundred billion dollars are earmarked for tax cuts--and not a \npenny for Medicare. The top priority for the American people is to \nprotect both Social Security and Medicare. But this misguided budget \nputs Medicare and Social Security last, not first.\n  Democrats oppose this ``lockbox'' because we want real protection for \nSocial Security and Medicare. Our proposal says: save Social Security \nand Medicare first, before the surpluses earned by American workers are \nsquandered on new tax breaks or new spending. It says: extend the \nsolvency of the Medicare Trust Fund, by assuring that some of the \nbounty of our booming economy is used to preserve, protect, and improve \nMedicare.\n  Our proposal does not say no to tax cuts. Substantial amounts would \nstill be available for tax relief. It does not say no to new spending \non important national priorities. But it does say that protecting \nMedicare should be as high a national priority for the Congress as it \nis for the American people.\n  Every senior citizen knows--and their children and grandchildren \nknow, too--that the elderly cannot afford cuts in Medicare. They are \nalready stretched to the limit--and often beyond the limit--to purchase \nthe health care they need. Because of gaps in Medicare and rising \nhealth costs, Medicare now covers only about 50 percent of the health \nbills of senior citizens. On average, senior citizens spend 19 percent \nof their limited incomes to purchase the health care they need--almost \nas large a proportion as they had to pay before Medicare was enacted a \ngeneration ago. By 2025, if we do nothing, that proportion will have \nrisen to 29 percent. Too often, even with today's Medicare benefits, \nsenior citizens have to choose between putting food on the table, \npaying the rent, or purchasing the health care they need. This problem \ndemands our attention.\n  Those on the other side of the aisle have tried to conceal their own \nindifference to Medicare behind a cloud of obfuscation. They say that \ntheir plan does not cut Medicare. That may be true in a narrow, \nlegalistic sense--but it is fundamentally false and misleading. Between \nnow and 2025, Medicare has a shortfall of almost $1 trillion. If we do \nnothing to address that shortfall, we are imposing almost $1 trillion \nin Medicare cuts, just as surely as if we directly legislated those \ncuts. No amount of rhetoric can conceal this fundamental fact. The \nauthors of the Republican budget resolution had a choice to make \nbetween tax breaks for the wealthy and saving Medicare--and they chose \nto slash Medicare.\n  I urge my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to reject this ill-\nconceived proposal. It jeopardizes Social Security and ignores \nMedicare. It is an assault on America's senior citizens, and it does \nnot deserve to pass.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I support this effort to wall off the \nsurplus Social Security revenues.\n  By establishing a lockbox we ensure that all savings in the program \nare used to build the trust fund and extend the solvency of Social \nSecurity.\n  We learned last year that to leave unobligated money lying around \nWashington is a bad idea because it gets spent!\n  This is one of several budget reforms that I have been actively \nsupporting.\n  First, the budget process is too complicated and frequently abused. I \nfeel it needs to be simplified. This is a step in that direction.\n  With this provision we can remove the temptation that the Social \nSecurity surplus presents to those who tend to spend our money \ncarelessly.\n  As we search for ways to modernize Social Security, it makes sense to \ndedicate the Social Security surplus to repaying debt owed to the trust \nfund. Paying down the debt and modernizing Social Security need to \nhappen together.\n  It is important to take this issue up now, especially since we have \nalready considered three requests for supplemental spending for this \nyear, totaling $1.36 billion.\n  These proposals spend the surplus without regard to major budgetary \ncommitments such as Social Security.\n  I have long been a supporter of debt repayment.\n  I believe that Federal debt retirement should be a priority when \ndecisions must be made regarding a Federal budgetary surplus. That is \nwhy I sponsored the American Debt Repayment Act, which requires \nrepayment of the federal debt.\n  Likewise, I support the legislation before us today that sets a \nstatutory limit on federal debt held by the public.\n  We must obligate ourselves to a plan in order to make any progress \ntoward paying down the debt; otherwise, the surplus will most likely \ninvite increased spending.\n  Consider the impact that debt reduction would have on the fate of \nSocial Security.\n  We would be making positive changes to ensure the solvency of Social \nSecurity for future generations.\n  We would be making payments on the national debt which is the best \nway to provide flexibility and a source of funds for changes in Social \nSecurity that will modernize it for the generations of the next \ncentury.\n  So long as the federal government carries a $5.6 trillion debt, we \ncannot tell our children and grandchildren that we have provided for \ntheir future.\n  By enacting this plan we will be helping to preserve Social Security \nfor future generations.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the Social Security \nlock box to keep the Social Security surplus safe from raids that \nfurther threaten the financial condition of the fund.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to announce my position on the \ncloture petition on the so-called Social Security lockbox legislation \nbefore the Senate.\n  First, let me say that I am disappointed with our Republican \ncolleagues for making this a political issue. The fact of the matter is \nthat both Democrats and Republicans in this body believe that Social \nSecurity surpluses should be protected and, absent extraordinary \ncircumstances, should be used to reduce the public debt. Budget \nresolutions sponsored by both Democrats and Republicans abided by that \nrule. In essence, then, the legislation presented to us today is \ndesigned as little more than a political show vote that will give a \nbasis for claiming that Republicans alone are committed to protecting \nSocial Security while Democrats are not. Nothing could be more \ndisingenuous.\n  Let me also say that we could use some truth-in-advertising around \nhere. This is not even a true lockbox. There are significant exceptions \nincluded in this legislation. No. 1, the so-called lockbox allows for \nadjustment of its scriptures for emergency spending, with the \nlikelihood that significant defense-related emergency spending will be \nenacted. As one individual commented, ``if we don't have an on-budget \nsurplus to fund emergencies, then we adjust the debt limits to borrow \nfrom the Trust Fund.'' No. 2, it should also be pointed out that the \ndebt limits can also be adjusted for whatever is deemed Social Security \nreform. That is so open-ended in my view it gives Congress a loophole \nthrough which it could easily evade the so-called lockbox altogether.\n  What concerns me most in this proposal, however, is that it gives the \nAmerican people the false impression that this is the answer to our \nfiscal problems. Instead of just resisting the temptation to go on a \ntax-cutting or spending spree, dealing honestly with solving the long-\nterm funding challenges in Social Security and Medicare, and paying \ndown our enormous debt with the entire surplus, we claim that the \nlockbox, an artificial mechanism which only commits part of the total \nsurplus to reduce the debt, is the most fiscally responsible thing we \ncan do. What makes this proposal all the more disingenuous from our \nRepublican colleagues is that the large tax cut that they hope to enact \nthreatens most our ability to meet the scriptures of the so-called \nlockbox.\n  In the final analysis, this political stunt isn't worth risking the \ncredit worthiness of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I agree wholeheartedly with the thrust of this \nlegislation that the Social Security surplus\n\n[[Page S4083]]\n\nshould be used to pay down the publicly held debt, although I would \ncommit the entire surplus to that purpose. My concern is that the \nproposal before us is nothing more than an attempt to politicize an \nissue on which we all agree, and that it has the potential to do more \nharm than good by risking the credit worthiness of the United States.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President. I rise today to express my strong \nopposition to Senator Domenici's amendment ``The Social Security \nSurplus Preservation and Debt Reduction Act''. I supported the original \nlegislation, S. 557, which was reported out of the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, and would have provided guidance for the \ndesignation of emergencies. But this amendment uses S. 557 as a vehicle \nto introduce a highly controversial and partisan proposal on Social \nSecurity. It also changes an important provision in the original bill \nregarding emergency designations, in a way that undermines the \nbipartisan compromise which we had reached in Committee. As Ranking \nDemocrat of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, I will limit my \ncomments to the bill we reported out of committee, and to the reasons I \nobject to the changes made to those emergency designation provisions.\n  First, I would like to provide some background about why I support \nthe unamended version of S. 557, and how it came to be reported out of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee. Passed in 1990, the Budget \nEnforcement Act requires that the cost of appropriations legislation \nstay within spending caps and that the cost of all other legislation \nsatisfies the ``pay-as-you-go'' requirements. At the time the bill was \npassed, however, there was a legitimate concern that these new limits \non spending could impede Congress' ability to provide additional funds \nfor emergencies. As a result, Congress provided that if the President \ndesignates a provision as an emergency requirement and the Congress \nagrees in legislation, then the spending caps and ``pay-go'' \nlimitations do not apply to that provision. Congress did not provide \nany guidance regarding what constitutes an emergency.\n  Not counting 1991, when emergency spending spiked because of the \nPersian Gulf War, the annual emergency expenditure had ranged from $16 \nbillion to $5 billion before last year's Omnibus spending legislation \nset a new record, at $21.5 billion. The emergency spending designation \nhas been used appropriately in many cases. Every year money is provided \nto the Federal Emergency Management Agency to respond to natural \ndisasters such as hurricanes and floods. Emergency spending has \nincluded military funding for Operation Desert Storm and for \npeacekeeping efforts in Bosnia. The emergency designation has also been \nused to provide funds after other cataclysmic domestic events, such as \nthe riots in Los Angeles in 1992 and the terrorist bombing in Oklahoma \nCity in 1995. The 1999 emergency funds addressed a wider variety of \nneeds than in prior years. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, last year emergency funds were used for the first time for \nincreased security at U.S. embassies, for price supports for U.S. \nfarmers, to respond to the Year 2000 Computer problem, for counter-drug \nand drug interdiction efforts, for ballistic missile defense \nenhancements, and to address funding shortfalls in the defense health \nprogram, among other things.\n  While these expenses may all be legitimate uses of tax dollars, \nSenators on both sides of the aisle feel that some of the past \ndesignations of emergency spending were inappropriate, and have been \nlooking for a statutory solution. The problem is the complete absence \nof guidelines on what constitutes an emergency, as well as insufficient \nprocedural safeguards to prevent the misuse of the subjective emergency \ndesignation.\n  The provision on emergency spending originally contained in Senator \nDomenici's ``Budget Enforcement Act of 1999'' addressed this problem by \nestablishing a 60-vote point of order against any emergency spending \nprovision contained in a bill, amendment, or conference report. A \nnumber of Senators in the Committee on Governmental Affairs, myself \nincluded, felt that the super-majority point of order was neither \nnecessary nor appropriate. It would have trampled on the rights of the \nMinority, and might have led to scenarios where aid is held up in cases \nof regional emergencies, particularly if a determined bloc of senators \nhoped to extract some unrelated legislative concession in return for \nthe release of funds. We have seen cases where floods have ravaged the \nriver valleys of the Dakotas, or tornadoes have decimated swaths of \ncountryside in just one or two rural states. Severe droughts are \nemergencies to the farmers suffering their long-term effects, but may \nnot seem quite so urgent to Senators representing other states. \nAllowing a reticent voting bloc to hold up funding for emergencies that \nare recognized by both the President and a majority of Senators seems \nto be an extreme measure to take, before having attempted a more \nmeasured response.\n  Accordingly, I was quite pleased when we were able to work out an \nagreement with Senator Domenici and Chairman Thompson regarding \nemergency spending. Our compromise preserved the point of order against \nall emergency spending, but converted it from a super-majority point of \norder to a simple majority point of order. The agreement retained \ncriteria defining what constitutes an emergency.\n  The bill we reported out frames the debate whenever an emergency \nexpenditure is challenged. The bill requires the President and \ncongressional committees to analyze whether a proposed emergency \nfunding requirement is necessary, sudden, urgent, unforeseen, and not \npermanent. If a proposed requirement does not meet one of these five \ncriteria, the President or committee must justify in writing why the \nrequirement still constitutes an emergency. Although the five criteria \nare not binding, the existence of this new statutory guidance, along \nwith the explanations that may be contained in any accompanying report, \nwill provide an essential framework for emergency spending designation \ndecisions that has heretofore been lacking. A Senator raising a point \nof order against an emergency spending designation would have codified \ncriteria to point to, and the process contained in this legislation \nencourages more challenges of abuses of the emergency spending \ndesignation.\n  After our bipartisan bill was reported to the full Senate, Senator \nDomenici included in his budget resolution a 60-vote point of order \nagainst any emergency designation. During the ensuing consideration of \nthe resolution, Senators Durbin, Byrd and I co-sponsored an amendment \nbringing back the simple-majority point of order. Senator Domenici \naccepted this amendment rather than hold a roll-call vote; \nnevertheless, our measure was subsequently stripped out in Conference. \nAccordingly, for the next year we will be governed by a Senate rule \nwhich requires a super-majority to designate emergencies, a rule which \nhas not won the approval of even a simple majority of any Senate body.\n  Now we have before us an amendment that goes even further than the \nprovision contained in the budget resolution. The amendment would re-\nestablish the 60-vote point of order against emergency designations \nwhich had been removed by consensus in the committee. This point of \norder would last for ten years, and it would be codified rather than be \na Senate rule. For reasons that are not clear, there would be an \nexception for Defense emergencies, but not for any other type of \nemergency, including natural disasters.\n  Importantly, the amended point of order applies to the emergency \ndesignation and not the spending itself. If it is raised and sustained, \nthe bill's spending for scoring purposes would be increased, thereby \npotentially causing it to exceed its allocation. That would leave the \nentire bill vulnerable to a second point of order. This potential for \nprocedural logjams would only complicate Congress' efforts to provide \nadequate funding to cope with real and pressing emergencies.\n  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment to S. 557, \nand to accept instead the bill originally reported out of Committee, \nwhich addresses the issue of emergency designations in a sensible way, \nand which has won the support of members of both parties in the \nCommittee.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the measure now before the \nSenate. This bill would create new budget procedures to prevent the \nspending of any surpluses attributed to\n\n[[Page S4084]]\n\nSocial Security, other than for reducing the public debt or for Social \nSecurity reform. Although this bill is well intended, in my view the \nbill is unlikely to accomplish its objectives and, worse, may have \nnegative, unintended consequences.\n  Before describing specific objections, let me first commend Senator \nDomenici for his leadership on the budget resolution and his commitment \nto Social Security. The FY 2000 budget resolution that passed Congress \nlast week sets aside every penny of every dollar of the $1.8 trillion \nin Social Security surpluses expected over the next 10 years. This \nmeasure demonstrates unequivocally our commitment to protecting Social \nSecurity and to restoring confidence and accountability in Social \nSecurity's financing.\n  On the other hand, the President's budget would spend $158 billion of \nthe Social Security surpluses over the next 5 years, and even more \nthereafter. The differences between the President's budget plan and \nCongress's could not be more clear.\n  Mr. President, the bill now before the Senate intends to provide \nadditional protections against spending so-called ``off budget'' \nsurpluses, by, among other things, creating a new public debt limit.\n  In my view, the bill has serious substantive problems. The simple \nfact is that if Congress does not authorize spending, money cannot be \nspent. Debt is issued solely to pay for spending Congress authorizes. \nIndeed, Congress delegated its exclusive constitutional authority to \nborrow money on the credit of the United States in 1917 to the Treasury \nDepartment. Prior to 1917, Congress individually authorized each debt \nissue, specifying interest rates and maturity\n  Over the years, debt ceilings have made little difference in \npreventing spending or deficits. But, as those of us who have been \ninvolved with debt ceiling legislation know too well, the need to raise \nthe debt ceiling can and has often created a sense of crisis. Indeed, \nthis bill could hamper the Federal government from paying its bills in \na timely manner; injure the Federal government's credit standing; and \nlimit the Treasury's flexibility to manage the debt in the most \nefficient manner.\n  Having said that, the legislation before us does attempt to address \nsome of these problems. For example, the bill contains exceptions for \nemergency spending, recession, and war. However, these exceptions seem \nto undo the very purposes of the bill, without providing the \nflexibility needed to properly manage the debt. Moreover, the language \nof the bill ensuring the timely payment of Social Security benefits \nshould be strengthened.\n  The best solution is to prevent spending, not to undo spending with a \nnew type of debt limit. Indeed, the whole point of the 1974 \nCongressional Budget Act, and subsequent budget process legislation, \nhas been to provide an organized, disciplined framework for \nconsideration of the nation's budget and of public spending. If the \ncurrent budget procedures are not adequate to prevent spending \nauthorizations, new remedies should be devised without creating a new \ntype of debt limit.\n  I received a letter from Treasury Secretary Rubin which addresses the \npending amendment. In this letter Secretary Rubin raises concern that \nthe amendment, if enacted, could actually jeopardize the payment of \nSocial Security benefits. This concerns me as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the letter from the \nTreasury Secretary in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, let me turn now to one other issue before \nclosing--the importance of prompt action on Social Security reform. The \nbill before us is at best intended to be a stopgap measure until Social \nSecurity reform is accomplished. Social Security has long-term \nfinancial problems, which the President and Congress must address. \nIndeed, there is broad agreement--in Congress and by the President--\nthat Social Security reform is better done sooner than later. I \nstrongly agree, although any action will require Presidential \nleadership and a bipartisan consensus in Congress.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 1999.\n     Hon. William Roth,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bill: This letter transmits an analysis of the Social \n     Security Surplus Preservation and Debt Reducation Act, the \n     amendment offered by Chairman Domenici and Senators Abraham \n     and Ashcroft to S. 557, which is currently being debated on \n     the Senate floor. This Act would create new statutory limits \n     on debt held by the public in addition to the existing \n     ceiling on the total debt held by the public and the Federal \n     trust funds. Our analysis indicates that this provision could \n     preclude the United States from meeting its financial \n     obligations to repay maturing debt and to make benefit \n     payments--including Social Security checks--and could also \n     worsen a future economic downturn. Let me refer you to my \n     earlier letter as I will not repeat here all of the concerns \n     I have with this proposal. For all of the reasons I mention \n     there, I would recommend to the President that he veto this \n     Act if it were presented to him for his signature.\n       It is still my view and the view of the Administration that \n     fiscal restraint is best exercised through the tools of the \n     budget process. Debt limits should not be used as an \n     additional means of imposing restraint. By the time a debt \n     limit is reached the Government is already obligated to make \n     payments and must have enough money to meet its obligations. \n     These proposed new debt limits, despite the changes made, \n     could run the risk of precipitating a debt crisis in the \n     future.\n       The proposal makes only limited exceptions for \n     unanticipated developments on the non-Social Security side of \n     the budget. However, the potential for forecast error is \n     great even for estimates made for one year in the future, let \n     alone for ten years. Projections of future budget surpluses \n     are made using hundreds of assumptions, any of which is \n     subject to error. Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office \n     (CBO) studied the errors in its own five-year estimates and \n     concluded that, based on their average deviation, the annual \n     surplus estimate for 2004 could vary by $250 billion. Much \n     smaller forecast errors could cause these new debt limits to \n     be reached.\n       The amendment's shift of the effective date from October 1 \n     to May 1 may provide some degree of cushion but it does not \n     eliminate the risk that the debt limit could be reached in \n     the normal course of business. It reduces the debt limit just \n     after the large revenue bulge in April. However, the size of \n     the cushion and the impact of the timing shift can be far \n     smaller than the deviations from surplus projections \n     described above.\n       The amendment could run the risk of worsening an economic \n     downturn. The debt limit would be suspended following two \n     consecutive quarters of real GDP growth below one percent. \n     However, an economic slowdown of any duration that did not \n     result in real growth of less than one percent for two \n     consecutive quarters could increase spending and reduce \n     receipts--and both CBO and OMB estimates indicate that such a \n     moderate slowdown could require the borrowing of hundreds of \n     billions of dollars over a period of just a few years. Absent \n     a super-majority vote to raise the debt limit, Congress would \n     need to reduce other spending or raise taxes. Either cutting \n     spending or raising taxes in a slowing economy could \n     aggravate the economic slowdown and substantially raise the \n     risk of a significant recession. In addition, there would be \n     a lag of at least seven months from the onset of a recession \n     to the time that the statistics were available to demonstrate \n     two consecutive quarters of real growth of less than one \n     percent. During these seven or more months, as in the first \n     case, revenues would likely decline and outlays increase \n     necessitating that Congress either reduce other spending or \n     raise taxes. In both cases, the tax increases and spending \n     cuts could turn out to be inadequate to satisfy all existing \n     payment obligations and to keep the debt under the limit, and \n     the debt-limit crisis could worsen.\n       In addition, the Act does not guarantee that Social \n     Security benefits will be paid as scheduled in the event that \n     the debt ceiling were reached. The Act requires the Treasury \n     Secretary to give priority to the payment of Social Security \n     benefits but, if the Treasury could no longer borrow any \n     money, there might not be enough cash to pay all Social \n     Security benefits due on a given day. We believe that all \n     obligations of the Federal government should be honored. We \n     do not believe that prioritizing payments by program is a \n     sound way to approach the government's affairs (e.g., giving \n     Social Security payments precedence over tax refunds or other \n     benefits, such as those for veterans). In addition, this Act \n     does not indicate how this complex prioritization process \n     should be implemented, no system currently exists to do so, \n     and any such system would be impractical.\n       Clearly, there could be very serious risks to Social \n     Security and other benefits and to the credit worthiness of \n     the United States if this Act were enacted into law. To \n     ensure fiscal discipline, the Administration recommends \n     instead that the pay-go rules and the discretionary spending \n     caps in current law be extended beyond FY 2002. These tools \n     of fiscal discipline--which do not rely on debt limits--have \n     been highly effective since they were adopted in 1990 on a \n     bipartisan basis. I urge the Congress to consider these \n     provisions--rather than new debt ceilings--as the best choice \n     for maintaining our hard-won fiscal discipline.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert E. Rubin.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning \nthe\n\n[[Page S4085]]\n\nSocial Security lockbox legislation. Last year, as chairman of the \nSocial Security Subcommittee in the House of Representatives, I \nintroduced legislation which would have reserved 100 percent of the \nanticipated budget surpluses for Social Security.\n  When that bill was marked up in committee, it was changed to 90 \npercent. Subsequently, that bill was passed by the full House of \nRepresentatives but it was attacked viciously by the President and our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle because it did not protect \n100 percent of the Social Security surplus.\n  The bill we are considering now in the Senate would do exactly what I \noriginally set out to do in 1998. It would do exactly what the \nPresident promised to do in 1998. It locks up the Social Security \nsurpluses to protect them and to insure those surpluses are not used \nfor other programs, tax cuts, or additional spending. It locks up 100 \npercent of the Social Security surpluses--not 62 percent--not 90 \npercent--but 100 percent. It requires that those surpluses--and we are \ntalking about a lot of money, as much as $1.8 trillion over the next 10 \nyears--are not recycled out as debt and spent on other Government \nprograms as we have done in the past.\n  This is a good bill. It is a good concept. It pays down the debt and \nit protects Social Security. I urge my colleagues to support this bill \nand to vote for the motion to invoke cloture.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to express my profound concern \nwith several provisions in the Abraham ``lock box'' amendment pending \nbefore us here today. I share many of the objectives the sponsors of \nthis amendment portend to support, such as preserving the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund, promoting fiscal responsibility and paying down \nthe debt. However, I fear this amendment could potentially have \ndangerous and disastrous effects on our nation's economy and Social \nSecurity.\n  The Abraham ``lock box'' proposal establishes statutory annual, \ndeclining limits for debt held by the public over the next ten years, \nbased on projections from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). \nProponents of the amendment contend that these statutory limits will \nforce a greater degree of fiscal responsibility upon the federal \ngovernment. In order to raise the debt limit, a 60-vote point of order \nin the Senate would be required.\n  On the surface, this legislation may appear to provide potential \nbenefits to the American economy and government spending. However, \nthere are several fundamental flaws to this approach, which is why I am \nunable to support the proposal.\n  First, the Abraham proposal relies upon CBO budget projections to \nderive the statutory public debt limits. While CBO budget projections \nare an insightful and beneficial tool for policymakers, they are in no \nway an exact measure of future budget levels. As any economist would \ntell you, there are too many uncontrolled factors that can come into \nplay. By CBO's own admission, unanticipated developments in the \neconomy, demographics, or other factors may alter the nations' budget \nlandscape.\n  For instance, an assessment of CBO budget projections between fiscal \nyears 1988 and 1998 found that projections were off by an average of 13 \npercent per year. Looking ahead to 2004, this margin of error would \nmean that CBO's current budget projections could be off by as much as \n$250 billion. Yet, under this proposal, these inaccurate projections \nwould become the standard.\n  Second, the statutory debt limits proposed by the Abraham amendment \ncould make the federal government's responsibility to meet daily \nfinancial obligations extremely difficult. Treasury Secretary Robert \nRubin has stated that debt limits may drastically hinder the Treasury's \nability to cover near-term shortfalls in the government balance sheet. \nThe government receives revenues and makes payments on a daily basis. \nDaily, weekly, or monthly swings in cash flows can exceed balances, and \nunder the ``lock box'' scenario, debt limits as well. If the government \nhas reached the debt limit, it would likely become necessary to \ntemporarily suspend unemployment benefits, or other payments, until \nbudget cuts or tax increases are implemented to make up the difference.\n  Third, arbitrary debt limits could exasperate economic downturns. The \namendment includes a provision that its supporters claim would lift the \ndebt limit during a recession, which is defined as two consecutive \nquarters where real economic growth is less than one percent. However, \nlags in economic reporting mean that data on GDP growth are generally \nnot available until several months after an economic downturn has \nactually begun.\n  For example, the recession that started in July 1990 was not revealed \nthrough economic data until April 1991. When the economy slows, \nunemployment compensation and other outlays rise, while tax revenues \nslow or decline. As a result, debt limits could be breached more \nquickly. However, unless Congress musters 60 votes to breach the debt \nlimit, cutting government expenditures or raising taxes would be \nrequired. These delays could push an already weak economy into a \nrecession.\n  Fourth, effective measures are already in place to ensure fiscal \nrestraint. Over the last ten years, pay-as-you go and discretionary \nspending caps have been highly successful in producing fiscal \ndiscipline without threatening budget cuts or tax increases. These \nenforcement mechanisms, which were enacted as part of the Budget \nEnforcement Act of 1990, have been key elements in maintaining fiscal \ndiscipline over the past decade. Supplementing these successful laws is \nunnecessary and may create greater volatility in our budget process.\n  Lastly, I would be remiss if I did not point out that the ``lock \nbox'' proposal does nothing to stimulate meaningful Social Security \nreform, nor does it extend the solvency of the program. In fact, the \namendment contains a clause that would allow money dedicated to the \npayment of Social Security benefits to be siphoned off for other \npurposes, like the creation of private accounts. It also completely \nignores the solvency problems facing Medicare.\n  Mr. President, although the ``lock box'' amendment is seemingly well \nintended, if enacted, it could dramatically impact the federal \ngovernment's ability to meet its financial obligations and react to \neconomic downturns. Furthermore, it could exacerbate times of economic \nhardship and tie the hands of the federal government in meeting its \nfinancial commitments to the American people. Most importantly, the \namendment does nothing to secure the solvency of Social Security and \nMedicare. I urge my colleagues to reject this potentially harmful \namendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senators Lott, \nDomenici, and others in cosponsoring this amendment to S. 577, The \nBudget Reform Act. I was an original cosponsor along with Senator \nAbraham and others of the legislation upon which the Lott-Domenici \namendment is based.\n  This amendment expresses clearly our commitment to protect the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund for current and future beneficiaries. This \nlegislation reiterates the importance of adhering to the provisions of \nthe 1990 law that prevented Congress and the President from using \nSocial Security surpluses to mask the size of annual budget deficits. \nIt also urges the establishment of a budgetary ``lock box'' for Social \nSecurity funds, with effective enforcement mechanism, to prevent \nCongress and the President from using Social Security receipts to pay \nfor other government spending or to offset tax cuts.\n  We all have seen the predictions that the Social Security system will \nbe bankrupt in 2032, short-changing the millions of Americans who \nincluded Social Security benefit payments in their retirement planning. \nSimply walling off the Trust Fund from depletion for other purposes \nwill not solve this long-term problem. Clearly, we must continue to \nwork to find a viable long-term solution to the financial problems of \nthe Social Security system that restructures the system in a manner \nwhich provides working Americans with the opportunity, choices, and \nflexibility necessary to ensure their future retirement needs are fully \nmet. At the same time, we must guarantee that everyone who has worked \nand invested in the Social Security system receives the benefits they \nwere promised, without placing an unfair burden on today's workers.\n\n[[Page S4086]]\n\n  Saving Social Security should not be a partisan issue. For our \nparents today and our grandchildren tomorrow, saving Social Security is \ntoo important for politics to guide us rather than principle. With \npredictions of sustained budget surpluses for at least the next ten \nyears, saving Social Security should be our first priority.\n  I endorse the President's proposal to set aside two-thirds of the \nestimated $2.8 trillion non-Social Security surplus to shore up the \nSocial Security system. However, I question whether the President is \ntruly wedded to saving Social Security. His own budget shows that he \ndoes not set aside a single extra dollar for Social Security for at \nleast ten years. Instead, he spends the surplus on new government \nprograms.\n  It is also alarming that the President feels that the government \nshould become an institutional investor in the stock market, using \nSocial Security funds. The government has no business going into \nbusiness. How could the government bring action against a company for \nviolating anti-trust laws if it has a large equity investment in that \nsame company? And can anyone fathom how the forces of political \ncorrectness might distort the market? Would the government eventually \nbecome the majority stockholder in Ben and Jerry's?\n  Saving Social Security has one simple objective: to guarantee that \neveryone who has worked and invested in Social Security receives the \nbenefits they were promised. We must establish an effective ``lock \nbox'' to ensure that 100 percent of Social Security receipts go to the \nSocial Security trust fund and stay there earning interest. We must \nstop the federal government from stealing money from the Social \nSecurity trust fund to pay for its excessive spending habits. Social \nSecurity is a sacred promise which must not be broken. Fiscally \nresponsible members of Congress must stand up and not allow the Federal \nGovernment to take the hard-earned money of taxpayers and threaten the \nfinancial security of our nation's retirement system.\n  Let me just point out that walling off the Social Security Trust Fund \nand reserving future surpluses to ensure the solvency of our nation's \nretirement system does not mean we can not also have a tax cut. \nAmericans need and deserve a tax cut. Federal taxes consume nearly 21 \npercent of America's gross domestic product, the highest level since \nWorld War II. A recent Congressional Research Study found that over the \nnext ten years an average American family will pay $5,307 more in taxes \nthan the government needs to operate. Congress did not balance the \nbudget so Washington spending could grow unnecessarily at the \ntaxpayer's expense. Letting the American people keep more of their own \nmoney to spend on their priorities will continue to fuel the economy \nand help create more small business jobs and other employment \nopportunities.\n  We can provide meaningful tax relief to American families and still \nsave Social Security. The Federal Government wastes billions of dollars \nevery year on pork-barrel spending projects, much of which is earmarked \nby powerful Members of Congress for their home states and districts. \nJust this past year, Congress directed over $9 billion to special-\ninterest projects. We also continue to allow businesses to use tax \nloopholes and other subsidies that do not make economic sense. \nAccording to the Progressive Policy Institute, we could easily save \n$200 billion over the next five years by eliminating inequitable \ncorporate subsidies, including phasing out operating subsidies for \nAmtrak and eliminating the ethanol tax credit.\n  We can and should pay for tax relief for middle-class Americans and \nfamilies with the money we throw away on pork-barrel projects and \ninequitable corporate subsidies, not money raided from Social Security \nsurpluses.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the millions of Americans who have paid \ninto the Social Security system for decades and those who are working \nand paying into the system today, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment and demonstrate their continued commitment to truly saving \nSocial Security for future generations.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, there is an old saying heard quite often \nin the midwest and perhaps other parts of the country as well. The \nsaying is ``what you see is what you get.'' The adage is as simple as \nit is straightforward. It's a way of letting another person know there \nwill be no surprises--good or bad--associated with the person or object \nin question. Things are pretty much as they appear.\n  Unfortunately, the proponents of this legislation, the so-called \n``Social Security Surplus Preservation And Debt Reduction Act,'' do not \nsubscribe to this plainspoken logic. In fact, quite the contrary. What \nyou see when you examine their language is quite different from what \nyou get when you listen to their rhetoric. They argue they are \npreserving Social Security. Their own bill language says otherwise. \nThey argue they are reducing the public debt. Again, their bill \nlanguage betrays them. And finally, they argue they have created a \nsound mechanism to lock away Social Security. The Treasury Department \ntells us differently. Mr. President, if votes on this bill are based on \nwhat people see and not on what they would actually get, I am confident \nthis measure will be defeated. I strongly recommend that course of \naction.\n  Let me state at this time that I and every member of the Democratic \ncaucus totally support the objectives expressed by this bill's authors. \nWe must ensure that every dollar of Social Security taxes is dedicated \nsolely and exclusively to Social Security benefits. I have joined with \nDemocrats to fight for this principle earlier this year on the budget \nresolution. Furthermore, Democrats advocate taking an additional step. \nWe feel Medicare also faces grave challenges and will need additional \nresources to ensure that radical reform is not necessary. The \nDemocratic alternative to the bill before us today locks away every \ndollar of Social Security and helps Medicare. It does so in a secure \nmanner that will not threaten the fiscal stability of this country.\n  Unless there is a change in the current procedural situation, \nDemocrats will be precluded from getting a vote on our proposal at this \ntime. If the proponents of this legislation were truly interested in a \nserious, substantive debate on how to protect Social Security and \nMedicare, they would not, as a first step, seek to limit Senators' \nrights to offer amendments. There is only one reason you would stack \nthe deck in this manner on such an important bill before the Senate \ncould even begin debating the merits of the legislation. That reason is \npartisan politics. The proponents of this bill have decided they would \nrather play politics with this issue than work together to produce good \npolicy. Only by voting against cloture will Senators be allowed to work \ntheir will and offer improvements or substitutes to the Republican \nbill.\n  I would like to spend a few moments discussing my concerns about the \nspecifics of the Republican bill. To do that, I must take a brief look \nback. Earlier this year, we witnessed an event that many members of \nCongress, indeed many Americans, never thought we would see in our \nlifetimes. After decades of deficits and trillions of debt, the \nCongressional Budget Office issued its fiscal report projecting budget \nsurpluses as far as the eye could see. According to CBO, surpluses \nwould total $2.6 trillion, including $787 billion in non-Social \nSecurity surpluses. Over 15 years, these totals would reach $4.6 \ntrillion and $1.8 trillion, respectively. Democrats proposed on the \nbudget resolution last month that we lock away every penny of the $2.8 \ntrillion Social Security surplus and set aside close to $700 billion of \nthe remaining surplus to keep our commitments to Medicare. Republicans \nopposed this approach then, and their actions today indicate they have \nnot changed their minds. A $4.6 trillion surplus and the Republicans \ncontinue to say nothing for Medicare. Not a dollar. Not a dime.\n  This attitude might be somewhat easier to explain if the Republican \nbill truly set aside the $2.8 trillion in surplus Social Security taxes \nfor Social Security benefits. Unfortunately, Mr. President, the title \nof the bill notwithstanding, the Republican proposal fails to preserve \nSocial Security taxes for Social Security benefits. What is the basis \nfor my assertion? Take a look at page 16 of the Republican bill. This \npage contains language that all Social Security taxes will be set aside \nunless Congress enacts ``Social Security Reform Legislation.'' And what \nis ``Social Security Reform Legislation''? Reading from the Republican \nbill, ``[it]\n\n[[Page S4087]]\n\nmeans a bill or joint resolution that is enacted into law and includes \na provision stating the following: Social Security Reform Legislation. \nFor the purposes of the Social Security Surplus Preservation and Debt \nReduction Act, this act constitutes Social Security reform \nlegislation.''\n  In other words, Social Security Reform is anything a majority of \nCongress says it is. And, once declared, this same majority can spend \nSocial Security taxes on anything they choose. Far from setting aside \nSocial Security taxes for Social Security and paying off the national \ndebt, this language allows its supporters to use these proceeds to \nbankroll tax cuts or other spending programs--hardly a sound means for \npreserving Social Security or reducing the federal debt. If you are \nserious about protecting Social Security taxes for Social Security \nbenefits, this is not the bill for you. If you think we should lock in \ndebt reduction, this bill falls short. In light of this huge loophole, \nit is Orwellian for Republicans to entitle their bill the Social \nSecurity Surplus Preservation and Debt Reduction Act.\n  My third criticism of this bill centers on the impact its enactment \nwould have on the full faith and credit of the United States government \nand our economy. This bill creates new statutory limits on debt held by \nthe public. By linking enforcement of its provisions to the publicly \nheld debt ceiling, the Secretary of the Treasury has concluded, ``this \nprovision could preclude the United States from meeting its financial \nobligations to repay maturing debt and to make benefit payments--\nincluding Social Security checks--and could also worsen a future \neconomic downturn.'' In spite of the alterations made to the original \nversion of this bill, the Treasury Secretary has wisely concluded the \nbill still puts at risk the creditworthiness of the federal government, \nthe U.S. economy, and indeed, Social Security itself. Not surprisingly, \nSecretary Rubin recommends that the President veto this bill.\n  Now the proponents of this bill have challenged the statement that \nenactment of their bill could threaten Social Security payments. They \npoint to section 203 of their bill. This section purports to protect \nSocial Security benefits by asking the Secretary of the Treasury to \ngive priority to the payment of Social Security benefits if Treasury \nfunds are running low. Secretary Rubin has looked at this provision \nvery carefully. His conclusion? ``The act does not guarantee that \nSocial Security benefits will be paid as scheduled in the event that \nthe debt ceiling were reached. . ..We do not believe that prioritizing \npayments by program is a sound way to approach the government's \naffairs. In addition, this act does not indicate how this complex \nprioritization process should be implemented, no system currently \nexists to do so, and any such system would be impractical.''\n  Mr. President, clearly the bill before us is fatally flawed. In spite \nof the desires and remarks of its supporters, the Social Surplus \nPreservation And Debt Reduction Act actually accomplishes neither. \nSocial Security is not truly preserved, and debt reduction is by no \nmeans guaranteed. Ideally, Senators would be able to offer amendments \nto improve this bill and accomplish the stated objectives of its \nsupporters. Unfortunately, that choice is not currently before the \nSenate. Instead, we are being asked to cut off debate before it has \neven begun. This is an option we can afford to pass up. I ask that my \ncolleagues oppose cloture.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that each side of \nthe aisle be allotted 1 hour each for debate on the pending amendment, \nand that all time consumed to this point count against the time \nlimitation, and the scheduled vote occur at the expiration of that \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, how much \ntime is that?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Let me explain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes to a side, in answer to the \nquestion.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. In effect, we started late, and the original plan was to \nhave a 2-hour discussion, equally divided, from 9:30 until 11:30. We \nstarted 10 minutes late. So the purpose of this unanimous consent \nagreement would be to add in the additional 5 minutes to each side \nbecause of our late initiation. That isn't how much time is left. That \nis how much time will be added to each side because of the loss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Minnesota for \n5 minutes to speak to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to be here this morning to strongly support \nsafe deposit box legislation that would lock in any future Social \nSecurity surpluses, again only to be used for Social Security.\n  That doesn't sound like rhetoric to me, although that is what others \nare charging. But this is an effort to make sure the surpluses for \nSocial Security go forward to making sure that Social Security is going \nto be solvent in the future.\n  I commend the Senate majority leader and Senator Domenici for making \nthis legislation a top priority. I am pleased to join Senators Abraham, \nAshcroft, and Domenici to offer this important substitute amendment.\n  The recently released 1999 Social Security Trustee's Report shows the \nfinancial status of the Social Security Trust Funds has slightly \nimproved due to our strong economy.\n  The Trustee's report that Social Security will begin operating in the \nred in 2014, a year longer than last year's report, and it will go \nbroke in 2034, two years later than projected last year.\n  This does not mean we don't need to worry about Social Security any \nmore, and that future economic growth will wipe out all of our problems \nwith Social Security as some suggest.\n  On the contrary, it reveals that Social Security unfunded liability \nhas increased by $752 billion, which means Social Security is falling \ndeeper into debt. It makes reform of Social Security more urgent than \never.\n  Although the increased surplus has slightly pushed back the date of \ninsolvency, the significant increase of unfunded liability makes it \nharder to fix Social Security. Clearly, nearly $20 trillion in unfunded \nliability makes Social Security reform more imperative, not less--$20 \ntrillion in unfunded liability. That means $20 trillion worth of \nbenefits that the Government has promised that is not available in the \nSocial Security Trust Funds.\n  That's why we are introducing this legislation today as an essential \nfirst step to save and strengthen Social Security.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is an enforceable mechanism to \npreserve the surplus generated by Social Security. It is designed to \nlock in every penny of the $1.8 trillion Social Security surplus in the \nnext 10 years to be exclusively used for Social Security.\n  Pending reforms, these surpluses would retire debt held by the public \nto increase cash reserves in the Social Security trust funds. This \nmechanism ensures the surplus will be used in the future to pay for \npromised Social Security benefits once retired baby boomers threaten \nthe solvency of the trust funds.\n  Although I prefer an immediate reform to move Social Security to a \nfully-funded retirement system, I believe this is the only way to \nactually save Social Security at this time, and to provide the dollars \nneeded of any reform package in the offing.\n  President Clinton unveiled his Social Security proposal under his FY \n2000 budget. The bottom line of his plan is that it allows the \nGovernment to control the retirement dollars of the American people by \ninvesting for them. It does nothing, however, to save Social Security \nfrom bankruptcy.\n  Worse still, despite his rhetoric about saving every penny for Social \nSecurity, President Clinton has proposed to take $158 billion in Social \nSecurity dollars to finance Government programs unrelated to Social \nSecurity.\n\n[[Page S4088]]\n\n  The only positive aspect of his proposal is that the President has \nadmitted the insolvency of Social Security and has recognized the power \nof the markets to generate a better rate of return, and therefore \nimproved benefits.\n  The fundamental problem with our Social Security system is that it's \nbasically a Ponzi scheme--a pay-as-you-go pyramid that takes the \nretirement dollars of today's workers to pay benefits for today's \nretirees.\n  It has no real assets and makes no real investment. With changing \ndemographics that translate into fewer and fewer workers supporting \neach retiree, the system has begun to collapse.\n  There is a lot of double-counting and double talk in President \nClinton's Social Security framework. The truth of the matter is the \nPresident spends the same money twice and claims that he has saved \nSocial Security.\n  All the President has done is create a second set of the IOUs in the \ntrust fund. It is like taking the money he owes Paul out of one pocket \nand applying it to the money he owes Peter in the other pocket, and \nthen pretending that he has doubled his money and is now able to pay \nthem both.\n  In addition, the President has proposed to spend $58 billion of \nSocial Security money in FY 2000 for new Government spending. Over the \nnext five years, he will spend $158 billion of our Social Security \nmoney.\n  President Clinton's plan does not live up to his claim of saving \nSocial Security. He has not pushed back the date when the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund will begin real deficit spending. That date is \nstill the same--2014. Social Security will have a shortfall that year \nand the shortfall will continue to grow larger year after year.\n  There are no longer surpluses building up in the Social Security \naccount. There will actually be a deficit, and the shortfall will be \n$200 billion a year by the year 2021. By the year 2048, that deficit \nwould run $1.5 trillion a year.\n  Since the government has spent the surplus and has not set aside \nmoney to make up for this shortfall, it will have to raise taxes to \ncover the gap--something that economists estimate will require a \ndoubling of the payroll tax.\n  The proposal by the President to have the government invest a portion \nof the Social Security Trust Funds is no solution. It would give the \ngovernment unwarranted new powers over our economy, and it will not \nprovide retirees the rate of return they deserve.\n  Mr. President, it's going to take real reform, not Washington \nschemes, to help provide security in retirement for all Americans. The \nfirst essential step is to stop raiding from the Social Security Trust \nFunds, and truly preserve and protect the Social Security surplus to be \nused exclusively for Social Security.\n  This is exactly what this safe-deposit box legislation will achieve.\n  Mr. President, the best part of this legislation is that it will \nprevent Congress and the Administration from spending the Social \nSecurity surplus.\n  As I mentioned earlier, Social Security operates on a cash-in and \ncash-out basis. In 1998, American workers paid $489 billion into the \nsystem, but most of the money, $382 billion, was immediately paid out \nto 44 million beneficiaries the same year.\n  That left a $106 billion surplus. The total accumulated surplus in \nthe trust fund is $763 billion.\n  Unfortunately, this surplus exists only on paper. The government has \nconsumed all the $763 billion for non-Social Security related programs. \nAll it has are the Treasury IOUs that ``fit in four ordinary brown \naccordian-style folders that one can easily hold in both hands.''\n  Despite the President's rhetoric of using every penny of Social \nSecurity surplus to save Social Security, last year's Omnibus \nAppropriations bill alone spent over $21 billion of the Social Security \nsurplus.\n  Without the enforceable lockbox created by this legislation, future \nsurpluses are likely to be spent to fund other government programs, \nleaving nothing for baby boomers and future generations.\n  Another important component is that this legislation would use the \nSocial Security surplus to reduce the amount of federal debt held by \nthe public.\n  Clearly, there is a valid economic reason to pay down the federal \ndebt. Although I join most economists who agree that paying off the \nfederal debt with a budget surplus would not stimulate growth in the \nsame way that a tax cut would, it is still far preferable to having the \ngovernment spend all the surplus.\n  Mr. President, many of us in Congress agree with the President that \nwe should, and indeed must, devote the entire Social Security surplus \nto saving Social Security. However, his plan does not do what he says \nwhile our legislation does.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will be an essential first step to \nsave and strengthen Social Security. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this Republican \nlockbox for two very basic reasons: No. 1, it does nothing to extend \nthe solvency of Social Security which we all, as Americans, ought to be \nconcerned about; No. 2, the so-called lockbox is really no lockbox at \nall; it does not provide the protection we need.\n  First, let me speak to this issue of the extension of the financial \nviability of Social Security. We know from projections that Social \nSecurity's financial viability is expected to last through the year \n2034. This proposal does nothing to extend that time. It adds no funds \nto the Social Security fund at all. We have a very fundamental problem. \nThis is not pocket money we are talking about; this is money that \nelderly Americans all over this country and in North Carolina depend on \nfor their livelihood.\n  For example, over 90 percent of Americans over the age of 65 depend \non Social Security and receive Social Security benefits. Nine out of \nten elderly Americans who have escaped poverty as a result of \nGovernment or Federal help have done so as a result of Social Security. \nIn my home State of North Carolina, over half of the elderly would be \nin poverty--54 percent--in the absence of Social Security.\n  I have a simple question and I think it is a question the American \npeople ask: What will happen when the year 2034 arrives and these folks \ncan no longer receive their Social Security payments? We made a promise \nto these people. They spent their lives working, doing exactly what \nthey were obligated to do, paying their payroll taxes. Now the question \nis whether we, as a government, are going to meet our promise and our \nresponsibilities to them.\n  There is a second fundamental problem with this proposal. The lockbox \nis really no lockbox at all. It is a lockbox with lots of keys. The \nproblem is, those keys are in the hands of folks who in the past have \nshown a willingness to let Social Security go to the side and instead \nuse the money for tax cuts and other such things. What we need is a \nreal lockbox, a lockbox that cannot be opened, a lockbox that does not \nhave a provision, as this bill does, that provides for Social Security \nreform. This lockbox can be opened.\n  The elderly Americans need to know this Social Security money is, in \nfact, locked. We need to do what is necessary to accomplish that. We \nhave an obligation to our elderly Americans. We made them a promise. \nThey fulfilled their part of that obligation.\n  There is a fundamental question. If we are going to lock up this \nSocial Security money, we need to lock it up in the correct way, in a \nway that it can't be reached. We need to do what is necessary to extend \nthe life of Social Security. We have an obligation to do that. We have \nan obligation not to undermine the integrity of the Social Security \nsystem. We need to meet our promise and our obligation to elderly \nAmericans who spent their whole lives working, expecting they would \nreceive these benefits when they retired.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nMontana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment before the Senate, which I \ndo not favor, saddens me. It is not\n\n[[Page S4089]]\n\nbeing straight with the American people. It is packaged in a way to \nlook as if it is protecting Social Security. It is like a lot of \nproducts: They are packaged, with a promise on the label which may or \nmay not describe what is inside the package.\n  The package here is called a lockbox to save Social Security. That is \nthe package. That is the wrapping around the product. It is not \nindicative of the product inside. What is the product inside? Inside \nthe package, the so-called lockbox package, not one penny is added to \nSocial Security. The Social Security trust fund is due to expire in \nroughly the year 2034. The passage of this amendment does not extend \nthat by one day. There is no difference, no change.\n  What is the product inside this so-called package? What is inside is \nessentially a provision which will be in the law which says public debt \nhas to decline by the amount that the Congressional Budget Office \nprojects. If at any date it does not, then the debt ceiling is in \neffect. That means that Government cannot make its payments and meet \nits obligations as we bump up against the debt ceiling.\n  The amendment before the Senate, the public debt ceiling limit, \ndeclines right along with reductions in public debt as projected by the \nCBO. Why is that a problem? It is a problem because the debt limit is \nnot the way we force fiscal discipline. It is a charade. I have been in \nthe Senate for almost 20 years. I have been part of many debt limit \nextension debates. They are very embarrassing, very embarrassing. The \nGovernment has, through the Congress, through authorization programs, \nobligations. Of course we have to increase the debt limit or we don't \nmeet our obligations and the creditworthiness is in jeopardy, as in \n1975 when Moody put us on a list for possible downgrade. At that point, \nwe were flirting with whether or not to raise the debt limit.\n  Some Senators wanted to add different provisions. It was a political \nnonargument because we all knew we had to pass the debt. It is a game \nthat is being played here. That is why I stood at the outset to say I \nam saddened by this amendment. It is not being straight with the \nAmerican people.\n  Enforce fiscal discipline by spending less, pay-go, or through \nspending caps we enact and adhere to. That is the main reason the \nbudget deficit declined and now we are reaching surpluses. It is not \nbecause of any debt limits. We already have a total debt limit in \nexistence--the public debt plus the debt the Government owes to itself. \nWe have that. This is inside the package, a new debt limit, which is \nmeaningless, totally meaningless, because, obviously, if we meet the \ndebt limit, we have to either raise the debt limit or we do not meet \nour obligations, which means we cannot spend money we are obligated to \nspend.\n  Social Security is supposed to be protected, but it is only a \npriority. If the debt limit is exceeded by such a great amount, it is \npossible that Social Security beneficiaries will not be receiving their \npayments. It is a priority above veterans. Veteran benefits could be \ncut if we pass the debt limit.\n  In addition, the usual debates in the past of whether to extend or \nraise debt limit ceilings are only majority votes. They are very, very \ndifficult to get even though we all know it has to happen. The \namendment before the Senate says it has to be a supermajority, 60 \nvotes. We all know that is practically impossible.\n\n  The honest approach to saving Social Security and the honest approach \nto fiscal discipline is to continue the pay-go provisions, extend the \ncaps on discretionary spending. We do our job here because this so-\ncalled lockbox, public debt limit provision, is not what it is cracked \nup to be. The other side is trying to make it look like they are \nprotecting Social Security when, in fact, that is not what they are \ndoing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we don't have a lockbox for Social \nSecurity before the Senate. We should be clear; this lockbox as it \npertains to Social Security has no lock; it has no box. The fact is, \nthere is a huge, giant crack in the box that says, ``Exception: Social \nSecurity reform.''\n  We have heard it before from the other side of the aisle: \nPrivatization of Social Security. That is another way to say end Social \nSecurity as we know it.\n  My mother used to say, just because someone says he is your friend \ndoes not mean he is your friend. Listen to who is speaking. Know who \nthe true friends of Social Security are.\n  Vote ``no.''\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Like all the Democrats, I strongly support the \npurported goal of this amendment to secure the future funding of Social \nSecurity. I, like some of the other speakers on our side, believe this \nlegislation is seriously flawed. We cannot rely on this plan to protect \nSocial Security.\n  This lockbox, by any other name, could be called a leaky sieve. \nFirst, the amendment poses a direct threat to Social Security \nbeneficiaries. Treasury Secretary Rubin has explained that under the \nproposal, an unexpected economic downturn could block the issuance of \nSocial Security checks, as well as Medicare, veterans, and other \nbenefits.\n  Additionally, the amendment changes a huge loophole, a minefield that \nwould allow Social Security contributions to be diverted for purposes \nother than Social Security benefits. It is described as Social Security \n``reform'' that would be exempt from the lockbox. That tells us beware, \nbe on your guard, because it says something along the way might permit \nus, in the interest of reform, to divert funds that should be directed \nexclusively to Social Security. Things suggested could be risky \nprivatization plans, tax cuts--who knows what?\n  The second problem with the amendment is that it does absolutely \nnothing to protect Medicare. Instead, it allows Congress to use what \nmight be necessary funds for Medicare on tax breaks for wealthy \nindividuals. I had hoped to be able to offer an amendment to establish \na lockbox, one that is truly locked, one that is truly secure, to \nprotect both Social Security and Medicare. That lockbox proposal would \nreserve all of Social Security surpluses exclusively for Social \nSecurity, and 40 percent of the non-Social Security surpluses for \nMedicare. Unfortunately, the majority is unwilling to even give us an \nopportunity to offer an amendment. They are not willing to subject it \nto the wishes of the Senate. Why? Is there something they are afraid \nof?\n  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this amendment could present \nus with a Government default in the long term. In the short term, it \ncould undermine our Nation's credit standing and increase interest \ncosts. Ultimately, blocked benefit payments could lead to a world \neconomic crisis. Our Nation has never defaulted on an obligation that \nis backed by the full faith and credit of our country. Yet, according \nto the Treasury Secretary, Bob Rubin, who is very respected, \nthe creditworthiness of the United States could be subject to very \nserious risks if this legislation were enacted, and that is why he \nwould recommend the President veto the bill if it ever reached his \ndesk.\n\n  We Democrats have a proposal, a lockbox that protects both Social \nSecurity and Medicare, and our lockbox would not require a new debt \nlimit, and it would not risk a default. It would use supermajority \npoints of order and across-the-board cuts to guarantee enforcement. \nThat is a better, more responsible approach. Unfortunately, the \nmajority is not going to give us an opportunity to present our plan to \nthe Senate. I do not think it is right. I wish we could have a reversal \nof the majority opinion or the majority view on that.\n  Social Security lockbox legislation is a new proposal. It has not \ngone through a committee. It has not been subjected to hearings. In \nfact, it was not even introduced until a couple of days ago, and it \nresulted from a conference in the privacy of a single room. Yet the \nmajority is using parliamentary tricks to prevent us from offering any \namendments to improve the bill. It is not the right way to do business, \nespecially given the high stakes involved both for Social Security and \nfor our entire country. So I am going to ask my colleagues to oppose \ncloture on this legislation. Let us continue this debate. Let us find \nout what really is in this proposal. Let us make it a real lockbox, not \none that could be threatening Social Security benefits and does not do\n\n[[Page S4090]]\n\nanything for Medicare and risks our national credit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield myself an initial 5 minutes, and \nif the Chair will let me know when that time is reached, we will see \nhow much time is remaining to speak.\n  I have had the pleasure of listening now for about 3 days to a \nvariety of criticisms raised by the other side of the aisle on this \namendment, almost all of which are baseless in every conceivable way. \nSome of them, I think, are caused by failure to read it, some because \nof a reliance on letters received from the Department of Treasury \nbefore it had even been drafted, and some for reasons that are frankly, \nto me, still confusing--the most recent being the comments of the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Budget Committee that they have had \nno opportunity to address the issue. What we have before us is cloture \non this amendment, not cloture on this bill. If cloture is invoked, \nthen we will go ultimately to a vote on this amendment, and once it is \ndispensed with, up or down, the bill will still be available for \namendment. If there are better lockbox proposals or alternative \nproposals, there will be an opportunity for that.\n  Let me also say, this Senator certainly is receptive to, and anxious \nto hear from, the Secretary of the Treasury or anybody else with \nrespect to ways to perfect the approach we have taken. But what we have \ntried to do is simply put into a legislative form that which we passed \nas part of our budget resolution on a 99-0 vote. What that said, very \nsimply, was we were going to reduce the Federal debt held by the public \nbecause it is a national priority; that Social Security surpluses \nshould be used for Social Security reform, or to reduce the debt held \nby the public and should not be used for any other purpose.\n  Mr. President, 99 people voted for this. Now, all of a sudden, we \nhear that having the words ``Social Security reform'' in this amendment \nis some kind of diabolical plot; or using the Social Security surplus \nto pay down the national debt is somehow a threat to the economy. If \npeople believe that, I cannot imagine why they voted in the first place \n99-0 for this amendment when it was offered by myself and others during \nthe budget resolution debate. The only thing that has happened since \nthen is that we have tried to put into legislative context that which \neverybody said they were for. If there are criticisms of this, I think \nthey would have to be technical ones because the basic principles that \nwere voted on 99-0 are exactly what are embodied in this amendment \nbefore us today.\n  We recently heard the statement: Who are the real friends of Social \nSecurity? We will find that out here in a few minutes. The question \nwill be this, and this will be a question for seniors and those who \nwill soon be recipients of Social Security benefits to answer for \nthemselves: Are your friends the people who want to make sure the \nSocial Security surpluses are protected from being spent or used for \nother Government programs or tax cuts or anything other than to reduce \nthe national debt? Or are your friends the people who want to spend the \nSocial Security surplus, such as the President proposed in his budget, \nor those who will vote against a provision, this amendment, that would \nprotect the surpluses from being spent?\n  Every time I talk to seniors in my State, I hear complaints that we \nhave plundered the Social Security trust fund and spent those dollars \non other things. This amendment is designed to put an end to that, to \nrequire 60 Senators to stand on this floor and to vote to spend Social \nSecurity money on something other than Social Security. Yet all of a \nsudden we find all kinds of excuses to oppose that.\n  We will let the seniors decide who their friends really are. I think \nfor too long we have seen these surplus dollars spent on other \nGovernment programs. It is time for that to stop. It is time for those \ndollars to be protected, to be used to pay down the public debt, or \nused as part of a Social Security modernization program. And that is \nnot going to happen until we have bipartisan consensus on such a \nprogram.\n  In the meantime, do we send those dollars off to other priorities in \nthe budget, or do we put them into the reduction of the publicly held \ndebt so that we, in fact, strengthen the economy, reduce our interest \npayments, and make more funds available in the future for Social \nSecurity when it will need it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire \ntext of Senate Amendment No. 143, as well as the results of the Senate \nvote on that amendment be entered in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n                           Amendment No. 143\n\n     SEC. XX. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE PROTECTION OF THE \n                   SOCIAL SECURITY SURPLUSES.\n\n       (a) The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Congress and the President should balance the budget \n     excluding the surpluses generated by the Social Security \n     trust funds;\n       (2) reducing the federal debt held by the public is a top \n     national priority, strongly supported on a bipartisan basis, \n     as evidenced by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's \n     comments that debt reduction ``is a very important element in \n     sustaining economic growth,'' as well as President Clinton's \n     comments that it ``is very, very important that we get the \n     government debt down'' when referencing his own plans to use \n     the budget surplus to reduce federal debt held by the public;\n       (3) according to the Congressional Budget Office, balancing \n     the budget excluding the surpluses generated by the Social \n     Security trust funds will reduce debt held by the public by a \n     total of $1,723,000,000,000 by the end of fiscal year 2009, \n     $417,000,000,000, or 32 percent, more than it would be \n     reduced under the President's fiscal year 2000 budget \n     submission;\n       (4) further according to the Congressional Budget Office, \n     that the President's budget would actually spend \n     $40,000,000,000 of the Social Security surpluses in fiscal \n     year 2000 on new spending programs, and spend \n     $158,000,000,000 of the Social Security surpluses on new \n     spending programs from fiscal year 2000 through 2004; and\n       (5) Social Security surpluses should be used for Social \n     Security reform or to reduce the debt held by the public and \n     should not be used for other purposes.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the functional totals \n     in this concurrent resolution on the budget assume that \n     Congress shall pass legislation which--\n       (1) Reaffirms the provisions of section 13301 of the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 that provides that \n     the receipts and disbursements of the Social Security trust \n     funds shall not be counted for the purposes of the budget \n     submitted by the President, the congressional budget, or the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, \n     and provides for a Point of Order within the Senate against \n     any concurrent resolution on the budget, an amendment \n     thereto, or a conference report thereon that violates that \n     section.\n       (2) Mandates that the Social Security surpluses are used \n     only for the payment of Social Security benefits, Social \n     Security reform or to reduce the federal debt held by the \n     public, and not spent on non-Social Security programs or used \n     to offset tax cuts.\n       (3) Provides for a Senate super-majority Point of Order \n     against any bill, resolution, amendment, motion or conference \n     report that would use Social Security surpluses on anything \n     other than the payment of Social Security benefits, Social \n     Security reform or the reduction of the federal debt held by \n     the public.\n       (4) Ensures that all Social Security benefits are paid on \n     time.\n       (5) Accommodates Social Security reform legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    Rollcall No. 58, March 24, 1999\n\n                                YEAS--99\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n[[Page S4091]]\n\n\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Lugar\n       \n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes and about 5 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And then we vote, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, me thinks they doth protest too much. \nThat is my paraphrasing of what some great writer said applying it in \nthe singular. I am applying it in the plural.\n  First of all, I recall vividly my very good friend and one-time \nchairman of the Budget Committee coming to the floor of the Senate with \na big sign that said: ``Quit embezzling Social Security money.'' In \nfact, he said embezzlement is what is happening when we use their trust \nfund money for Government. Isn't it interesting that there are many \nSenators who at least feel that way enough to talk about it as \nembezzlement or stealing money from the senior citizens?\n  Today, the seniors ought to ask: If it is embezzlement, what are you \nall going to do to prevent the embezzlement from continuing? The answer \nis going to be: Little or nothing, because whatever you try to do that \nis really serious and makes it hard to embezzle, they have some reason \non that side of the aisle for not doing it.\n  If you think this Senator, who has listened attentively and asked his \nstaff to summarize the arguments on that side, is not frustrated when \nhe hears, first, that a financial crisis will occur--let me tell you, \nthe seniors think a financial crisis has already occurred because we \nare taking their money and spending it for Government.\n  Secretary Rubin, for whom I have the highest respect, who does not \nwant to tie the future debt limit of the United States to whether or \nnot you use this Social Security trust fund, has written a letter and, \nessentially, the letter says he needs more flexibility because the \nmoney does not come in every month at the same level. We gave him the \nflexibility. Read the statute before you. If Secretary Rubin is worried \nabout that, we gave him the flexibility.\n  Now he raises a new argument: We may not be able to pay Social \nSecurity beneficiaries--an absurd argument. But we gave him the \nauthority in this statute. We said if that the Secretary should give \npayments of Social Security checks priority.\n  We thought we clearly took care of the most significant problem and \nconcern of the Secretary of the Treasury.\n  Then we hear: You have done nothing to extend the solvency of Social \nSecurity. Of course, we haven't. We said don't touch their fund until \nyou have a reform package that helps with the solvency of Social \nSecurity, and if you have that, you can use it for that.\n  Why wouldn't the senior citizens like that? Do they want us to just \nleave it there or they want us to use it in case we need it for Social \nSecurity reform or transition? Of course, that is an argument in favor \nof this statute, not against it.\n  Then we were accused of perhaps putting Medicare in this Social \nSecurity trust fund. That was last week. It should just be for Social \nSecurity. Right? That was the big argument. We made it just for Social \nSecurity.\n  Now what is the argument? You did not take care of Medicare. This \nmoney does not belong to Medicare. This money belongs to Social \nSecurity. If you want to take care of Medicare, take care of it another \nway. Do not use the Social Security money for Medicare.\n\n  Last week, the Democrats were saying that lockbox is not going to be \ngood because you might be able to use the money for Medicare. We agreed \nwith them. We did not put it in this statute. Now we are not doing \nenough for Medicare.\n  Then we are accused of making this Government live on too rigid a \nbudget for the appetite for spending or tax cuts. We are being accused \nof tying the hands too tightly.\n  What do we do? We say, OK, we want to be reasonable about this. If we \nhave a recession for two quarters, then this does not apply. Who would \nwant this to apply in the middle of a recession if you needed money for \nunemployment compensation? Of course, you would not want it to. If you \nneeded to do something to help the economy come up so the Social \nSecurity program would be helped by recovery and prosperity, who would \nobject to that?\n  Put that alongside of having no lockbox so you could use it for \nanything, like the President wanted to in his budget. It is amazing. \nThe President wants to spend $158 billion of this trust fund for just \nprograms, not emergencies, not a war, just for programs to expand on \nthe Government. You can count on it, seniors. You cannot do that if \nthis lockbox is put in effect. You will have to find the money in other \nprogram cuts or do something else, but you could not use it.\n  We also said, if there is a war, if there is an emergency with \nreference to the defense of our country, you could use it, but not for \nordinary expenditures of Government.\n  I remind everyone, this is a lot of money, $1.8 trillion going in \nthis trust fund over a decade which belongs to the seniors and takes \ndown our national debt while it sits there waiting for us to use it for \nSocial Security purposes only. Now we have somebody arguing it may be \nsome new Social Security program that just Republicans want that you \nwould use it for. That is kind of preposterous.\n  When you have a reform Social Security program, it is going to have \nto clear both Houses of Congress and be signed by a President. It is \nobviously going to be a good program. Seniors are going to be watching \nit. But that is what we think this money ought too be used for.\n  As I view it, everybody on both sides of the aisle and the White \nHouse talk about not using this trust fund for anything but Social \nSecurity. I worked very hard to find a way that will clearly say: You \ncan't do it; you can't spend it; you need 60 votes, and you are going \nto have to increase the debt limit in order to spend this money.\n  I thought that was something everybody would like. Frankly, I thought \nthose running across America saying, ``We want to take care of Social \nSecurity,'' would not be for this.\n  Do you know what I think? I think it is just too tight a lockbox. It \nis not a loose lockbox like they are talking about. It is too tight. \nYou are not going to be able to embezzle from it anymore. You are not \ngoing to be able to rob from it anymore. You are not going to be able--\nif you do not think it was embezzlement or robbery; if you just think \nwe were spending the money--you are not going to be able to spend the \nmoney anymore.\n  What is wrong with that? I believe that is exactly what we ought to \ndo. Frankly, I anxiously await the vote. I do not believe we will get \ncloture, but everybody knows by not giving us cloture, the Democratic \nside of this Senate is clearly saying: We want to make sure you cannot \nspend the money, but don't make too sure that we can't spend the money; \ndon't make it too certain that we can't spend the money; just leave a \nlittle bit open there so in case we need it, we can spend it, because \nwe would like some new programs or we would like to cut taxes.\n  Actually, this applies to tax cuts, too. You cannot use it for tax \ncuts because it says in there what it can be used for and nothing else.\n  I thank everyone for the debate. It has probably been a healthy one. \nIn particular, I thank Senator Abraham, a valid member and respected \nmember of our Budget Committee. He is the principal sponsor of this \nproposal. I think he has carried the load admirably on the floor, and I \nthank him for his efforts.\n  Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would Senator Lautenberg like 1 minute of my time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That would be very generous.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I give the Senator 1 minute of my time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee knows his products very well. \nBut I am forced to ask this question, and that is whether or not, under \nany\n\n[[Page S4092]]\n\nstretch of view, Social Security reform could include a tax cut \nmeasure, perhaps in the interest of raising some retirement benefit \nthat someone might have?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No, unequivocally no.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. So it could only be used for Social Security reform, \nwhich would mean what?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It means any programmatic reform that the Congress of \nthe United States passed and a President signed that increases the \nlongevity of the trust fund and makes the Social Security program \navailable for longer periods of time, increasing the solvency of the \nfund and guaranteeing the payments.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me close this. If nobody objects, we can vote 30 \nseconds early.\n  I thank everybody for their participation. From my standpoint, I wish \nwe had a reform-Social-Security package before us. That is my wish. But \nsince we do not, we ought to leave the money there until we do. I hope \neverybody understands it is easy to make excuses; it is hard to come up \nwith things that will really lock this money up. We have one before us \ntoday.\n  I yield back my time. And obviously, the yeas and nays have been \nordered; have they not?\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I regret having to file a cloture motion on \nthis important piece of legislation. However, we need to have a vote on \nMonday afternoon so that Members will be here. We can have committee \nmeetings hopefully Monday and Tuesday.\n  We have a number of very important issues that need to be considered \nby committees. We need to move forward on the now two supplemental \nappropriations requests that we have. So we are going to have a vote on \nMonday in any case.\n  But also I think this is very important legislation in and of itself. \nIt is important that we get up and get started on the discussion. I had \nhoped we could actually work on it today and tomorrow. But because of \nthe NATO meeting and the congestion and the concerns about access to \nand from the Capitol, we will not be in session on tomorrow. That gives \nthe Members who are working together--Senator McCain I know is working \nwith others, Senator Biden, Senator Dodd--time to try to work out some \nof the remaining problems on this legislation.\n  We can go forward with this cloture vote on Monday afternoon. Or, if \nsomething is worked out where it is not necessary, we could still \nvitiate the cloture vote.\n  We need to get this done. This is urgent. The clock is ticking. We \nare moving towards 2000. This liability, this problem, is hanging over \nus like a sword. I think it is important that we go forward. I hope \nthat next week--Tuesday or Wednesday, certainly--we will be in the \nsubstance of the bill and we can get to a final conclusion on the \nsubstance.\n  I encourage Members on both sides of the aisle to work together to \nsee if we can't resolve this issue and move it on into conference.\n  I thank Senator McCain, Senator Hatch, and Senators from both sides \nwho have been working on it.\n  Having said that, I ask unanimous consent that Friday be considered \nthe intervening day under the provisions of rule XXII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could, if there was not an objection, I \nwould be glad to yield to the Senator from Massachusetts for a \nquestion.\n  May I confirm that there is not an objection to that request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would be glad to yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for yielding. I \nsimply wanted to inform him, I wasn't on the floor at the moment the \nobjection was raised to the Senate proceeding as Senator McCain hoped \nto do.\n  I want to say that I had a discussion with Senator McCain, Senator \nDodd,\n\n[[Page S4093]]\n\nSenator Hollings, and others. A bona fide effort is being made right \nnow to work with the technology community as well as with the legal \ncommunity. I think there is the capacity to come together around some \nform of compromise.\n  I thank Senator McCain for his leadership on this. I think it may be \npossible within hours to come together around something.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is certainly my hope. It is encouraging that the \nSenator from Massachusetts would say that.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes. I am happy to yield to the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We are trying to work out the matter of the quorum call \nthat is required with, of course, the vote on Monday. I would have to \nobject to dispensing with that call for a quorum on Monday, and maybe \nwe can change it by the end of the afternoon. I am trying to check \naround right now.\n  The Senator from Arizona doesn't mind, does he?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No. I will always do what the Senator from South Carolina \nsays.\n  (Laughter.)\n  Mr. LOTT. Did the Senator from South Carolina have anything further \nhe wanted to say?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No. That is all.\n  Mr. LOTT. Then I will go ahead and ask unanimous consent that the \ncloture vote occur at 5 p.m. on Monday, and that the mandatory quorum \nunder rule XXII be waived.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I object to the mandatory waiver of the quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Of course under the request that has already been agreed to \nand under the rules of the Senate, we will have a vote on Monday \nafternoon. It is just a question of time. I know there is an effort \nhere to try to set the schedule at a later time.\n  I remind Senators that I wrestle with this all the time. For every \ntwo Senators you are trying to protect who won't get here until 6, you \nare hurting a couple of Senators who may have to leave at 5:30. This is \na very delicate dance.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I understand. That is why we are calling around now \ntrying to work it out with the leader. He just hasn't gotten it worked \nout yet.\n  Mr. LOTT. I hope the Senator would keep in mind that we are going to \nbe squeezed on both ends. We will try to work out a time that benefits \nthe maximum number of Senators. But if you go into the night beyond 6 \no'clock, you have all kinds of problems on the other side of the issue.\n  With that, I yield the floor. Mr. President, we are ready to proceed \nwith the debate on the issue.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, obviously I am disappointed that we did \nnot proceed to S. 96. I am encouraged by the comments of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and others. The Senator from Oregon and I are \ncontinuing to have a dialog also with the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nDodd, and, of course, with the distinguished Democrat on the committee, \nSenator Hollings.\n  So I hope we can come to some agreement. I am given occasionally to \nflights of rhetoric, but the fact is, this is a very, very serious \nissue and one that we really cannot delay too much longer. The clock is \nticking. We need to move forward. There may be some differences. I \ndon't think anybody believes that we need to do something destructive.\n\n  This problem is critically important. The potential for litigation to \noverwhelm the judicial system for the most egregious cases involving \nY2K problems is very real. Litigation costs have been estimated as high \nas $1 trillion. Certainly the burden of paying for litigation will be \ndistributed to the public in the form of increased costs in \ntechnological goods and services.\n  The potential drain on the Nation's economy and the world's economy \nfrom fixing computer systems and responding to litigation is \nstaggering. While the estimates being circulated are speculative, the \ncosts of making the corrections in all the computer systems in the \ncountry are astronomical. Chase Manhattan Bank has been quoted as \nspending $250 million to fix problems with its 200 million lines of \naffected computer codes. The estimated costs of fixing the problem in \nthe United States ranges from $200 billion to $1 trillion. The \nresources which would be directed to litigation are resources that \nwould not be available for continued improvements in technology-\nproducing new products and maintaining the economy that supports the \nUnited States position as a world leader.\n  Time is of the essence. If the bill is going to have the intended \neffect of encouraging proactive prevention and remediation of Y2K \nproblems, it has to be passed quickly. This bill will have limited \nvalue if it is to be passed after the August recess. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for cloture on Monday when we move forward with \nthat.\n  I have a number of letters, studies, and a lot of information I will \npresent when we move to the bill. I will be very clear. From the \ntechnology network, we have letters of support from Cisco Systems, \nIntel, Microsoft, American Online, Merrill Lynch, Novell, Adobe \nSystems, Alexander Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide, Platinum \nSoftware, American Electronics Association, Marimba, Inc., NVCA, \nKleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers, LSI Logic--the list goes on and on.\n  This is an important issue to the high-tech industry in America. It \nis very important. It is of critical importance as to how these \ncorporations that are leading the American economy are able to proceed \nwith the business of business rather than the business of litigation.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will support this legislation and that we \ncan move forward. As the Senator from Connecticut will state, we still \nhave differences but we are working hard on working those out with the \nSenator from Oregon, the Senator from Massachusetts, and of course, the \nmuch esteemed Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Hollings.\n  I see my other colleagues would like to make comments on this very \nimportant issue. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I'll be brief because I know my colleagues \nfrom Oregon and South Carolina and others may want to speak on this. I \nthink there is a need to try to come up with some legislation to \nminimize what could be runaway litigation in this Nation. There have \nalready been some 80 lawsuits, many of them class action lawsuits, \nfiled on the Y2K issue.\n  I think all of my colleagues are aware that the leaders asked Senator \nBennett of Utah and myself to chair this Special Committee of the \nSenate to examine the Y2K problem. We have been working for well over a \nyear. We have had some 17 hearings in which we have invited various \nsectors of our economy --both private and public--to give their \nassessment of how the remediation efforts are progressing and the \ncondition of our institutions. Both of us, I think, feel confident that \nthings are progressing well, that we are not going to have as much of a \nproblem as we thought a few months ago, but that there still could be \ndifficulties. Y2K issues internationally may be a much greater problem \nthan those here at home.\n  There is a report out which has been sent to each and every Senate \noffice, which I encourage our colleagues to take a look at to get a \nsense of how the issue is progressing. It is an open-ended question \nwhether we are going to have a whole new area of litigation here--\nunwarranted litigation--which could destroy some small companies that \nlack the capacity to take on the kind of predatory lawsuits that too \noften do more damage than good.\n  Simultaneously, I adamantly oppose any legislation to try to use this \nissue as a way of rewriting the tort laws of the country. This ought \nnot to be that kind of vehicle. There is a legitimacy to the Y2K \nproblem, but no one should think it possible to take advantage of the \nY2K problem to achieve tort reform beyond the scope of the actual \nproblem. I don't think our colleagues would support it--at least not a \nmajority, and the legislation, if it managed to get through Congress, \nwould be vetoed. As the Senator from Arizona pointed out, we would have \nfailed in our obligation to try to do something in an intelligent, \nthoughtful, common-sense way\n\n[[Page S4094]]\n\nthat legitimately deals with the issue presented by the Y2K problem \nwithout going overboard and doing, as some have suggested, a lot more \ndamage than good.\n  I am hopeful we can work something out here. Senator Wyden has been \nworking on it. I know the Senator from South Carolina has strong \ninterests in this issue, as he has on so many other issues. We can find \nsome common language here. My hope is that we will enjoy broad-based \nsupport in the Congress, achieve the desired effects, and provide some \nreal assistance in the face of this potential problem that lurks 253 \ndays from today, which begins the new millennium.\n  Senator Bennett and I have spent the last year serving on a Senate \ncommittee totally devoted to the Y2K issue. We've held 18 hearings \nexploring every sector of our economy that might be affected by the Y2K \nproblem, including financial institutions, utilities, healthcare, \ntelecommunications, and business. Throughout this year one thing has \nbeen made abundantly clear. Wherever the Y2K problem exists next year, \nlitigation will follow.\n  Americans have become accustomed to living in a litigious society. \nThe occasional abuses of the legal system that come along arise from \nproblems that are limited in scope. As a result, the numbers of \nlawsuits related to those problems are limited, and our legal system \nand economy continue to function notwithstanding these occasional \nabuses. But the Y2K problem is not limited in scope. Potentially, any \nbusiness in the country might be swept into the Y2K problem, either \nbecause it is itself not prepared or because a firm it depends upon is \nnot prepared. Just six weeks ago the committee reported that as many as \n15 percent of the businesses in this country will suffer Y2K-related \nfailures of some kind. Even now we read that small and medium-sized \nbusinesses across the globe are not taking the necessary steps to \nbecome Y2K-compliant, and many think they don't have a Y2K problem. \nSince businesses are interconnected these days, just one failure in one \nbusiness may generate cascading failures that may then generate \nnumerous lawsuits.\n  It has been suggested that as a result of Y2K, the United States \ncould easily find itself witnessing a huge surge in litigation. This \npotential litigious bloodletting could have long-term consequences on \nthe economic well-being of our country. Various experts, including the \nGartner Group from my own state of Connecticut, have estimated that the \ncosts of litigation may rise to $1 trillion, a phenomenal figure. Such \na massive amount of litigation has the potential to overwhelm the court \nsystem, disrupting already-crowded dockets for years into the next \nmillennium. We must be careful that an avalanche of lawsuits does not \nsmother American corporations and bury their competitive edge. A \nmaelstrom of class action lawsuits could have long-term consequences on \nthe American economy and the American people. The rush to file lawsuits \nmight curb the future economic development in a number of different \nsectors. Moreover, all of the money that would be set aside this year \nby businesses for legal expenses associated with the Y2K problem, both \nas defendants and as plaintiffs, cannot be spent on fixing the Y2K \nproblem. As we heard in our hearing on this issue, both large and small \nbusinesses are concerned that the fear of litigation later is \npreventing them from solving problems now.\n  For this reason, I have long believed that the Congress could perform \nan essential service to the nation's economy by developing legislation \nthat would encourage companies, in the first instance, to solve their \nown Y2K problems instead of going to court right away, and to curtail \nthe inevitable frivolous litigation that accompanies any national \nproblem. We should not force businesses to choose between spending \nmoney on remediation or spending money on preparing for litigation. An \nalternative to this choice is reasonable litigation reform.\n  Within the Banking Committee, I am on record for supporting \nsignificant securities litigation reform. Our 1995 bill, which was \npassed, despite veto by the White House, spoke to definitive and \nrepetitive litigation abuse. At that time the legal system was no \nlonger an avenue for aggrieved investors seeking justice and \nrestitution. Instead, it had become a pathway for a few enterprising \nattorneys to manipulate legal procedures for their own profit. This \nprofit came at the expense and the detriment of legitimate companies \nand investors across the nation. The crucial factor driving securities \nreform legislation was a specific, clear-cut pattern of abusive \nlitigation. In the case of Y2K, however, we don't yet know what abuses \nmight arise.\n  In other words, I have strongly supported litigation reform efforts \nin the past. But clearly we need a bipartisan, narrowly crafted, well-\nstructured, and easily understandable bill. As with securities \nlitigation reform, the need for Y2K litigation reform arises from a \nnational problem amenable to a narrow, tailored solution, such as the \nbill I introduced.\n\n  I have great concerns that the bill before us today does not \nrepresent the narrow, tailored solution to the Y2K problem that I \nbelieve is necessary. It contains broad provisions tantamount to \nmassive tort reform, which should be saved for another day. The Y2K \nproblem should not be used as an excuse to pile on these broad \nmeasures. I think we can all agree on what we'd like a bill to do; \nindeed, the bill before us today and the Hatch-Feinstein bill contain \nmany of the same provisions as are in my bill. I take issue, however, \nwith a few provisions in both of these bills that I veiw as unnecessary \nwindow dressing for interests unrelated to the Y2K problem.\n  First, the bill before us places caps on punitive damages except \nwhere the defendant acted intentionally. Nothing inherent in the Y2K \nproblem requires that this be done. No state allows for the award of \npunitive damages unless the defendant has acted in some egregious \nmanner. Defendants who have behaved responsibly will not be assessed \npunitive damages, and defendants who have behaved egregiously should \nnot be rewarded by limiting the amount of punitive damages which they \nmight be required to pay. My bill does not cap punitive damages because \nit is not necessary to do so.\n  Second, the bill before us places caps on the personal liability of \nofficers and directors, those individuals with the ultimate \nresponsibility for the management of their firms. For years now Senator \nBennett and I have done everything possible to get upper management, \nincluding officers and directors, not only to pay attention to the Y2K \nefforts of their firms but to become directly involved and responsible \nfor those efforts. After a lot of hard work in this area, our efforts \nhave finally paid off and most upper management of major firms have \nappropriately shouldered these responsibilities. To come in now and \nplace caps on the personal liability of officers and directors would \nset back our efforts to get management's attention on this issue. \nPassing such caps gives these ultimate decision-makers less incentive \nto maintain their active involvement in Y2K remediation efforts. A \nrelated provision in the bill that raises the standard of proof for \nsuch individuals for many tort actions gives them the same excuse. My \nbill does not contain such provisions because I believe they are an \nexcessive solution to an uncertain problem.\n  What my bill does do is provide the narrow, tailored provisions I \nthink necessary to address the problem presented by the spectre of Y2K \nlitigation. Just as the other two Y2K liability bills introduced in the \nSenate do, my bill provides for a 90-day cooling off period to allow \nbusinesses to work out their Y2K problems together before they are \nforced to go to court. Just as the other bills do, my bill places a \nduty to mitigate damages on all parties which gives them an incentive \nto seek out solutions to their own Y2K problems. Just as the other \nbills do, my bill discourages frivolous litigation by including \nspecific pleading requirements and a requirement that defects alleged \nin class action lawsuits by material. Just as the other bills do, my \nbill rewards companies that have taken steps to become Y2K compliant by \nallowing for a reasonable balance between proportionate liability and \njoint and several liability.\n  While I strongly believe that a Y2K liability bill is necessary, I \nhave great concerns about this Y2K liability bill in its present form. \nNo one wants to see a solution to this problem more\n\n[[Page S4095]]\n\nthan I do, but I am not willing to compromise efforts to solve the Y2K \nproblem to satisfy unrelated interests, nor am I willing to trade in \nthe Y2K problem only to get a litigation problem down the road. While \nwe are rushing to solve the Y2K problem and the policy issues therein, \nwe should above all strive to enter the next century with a sense of \nvision, and this vision should include a prudent analysis of the \nlooming challenges of potential Y2K litigation. I assure you that no \none wants to begin the next millennium by trading a vision of the \nfuture for a subpoena.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I know the Senator \nfrom South Carolina has important remarks to make this morning.\n  I have joined with Senator McCain in cosponsoring this legislation \nthat comes before the Senate, after voting against the bill that came \nout of the Senate Commerce Committee. I have done so because there have \nbeen at least seven major changes made in the legislation after it came \nout of committee so that now when it comes before the Senate it is a \nbalanced bill. It is a bill, in my view, that will ensure that innocent \nconsumers are fully protected while at the same time helping to prevent \nthe kind of chaos we could have in our economy if we have scores and \nscores of unwarranted lawsuits as a result of the Y2K problem.\n  As we all know, the Y2K issue is not a partisan issue. It affects \nevery computer system that uses date information, every piece of \nhardware, every piece of an operating support system and all software \nthat uses date-related information. Our goal ought to be to try to \nbring about Y2K compliance. That is our principal focus. The Senate is \nalready on record in that regard. At the same time, we ought to put in \nplace a safety net to ensure that innocent consumers, particularly \nsmall businesses, will have a remedy and will not see their businesses \ndevastated.\n  I wrap up my brief remarks this morning by outlining a few of the \nchanges that Senator McCain and I worked on with Senator Dodd, Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Lieberman, and others, so that the Senate has a \nsense of the many changes that have been made to ensure consumers get a \nfair shake and that are in the bill before the Senate today.\n  The first that I think is particularly important is we will make sure \nthere is a sunset provision in this legislation. The original bill \ncontained no sunset provision. There were some who said this is just \nopening up brand new areas of tort law that are going to exist forever, \nthis is just a backdoor effort to hot wire the legal system and ensure \nthat we are restricting liability suits in the future. That is not the \nfuture. There is a sunset date to ensure that we are addressing just \nlegitimate problems that have come about as a result of the Y2K \nfailures.\n\n  Second, and another area I feel so strongly about, is we ensure, when \nthere are really egregious, outrageous offensive instances of conduct \nin the private marketplace, fraudulent conduct, that punitive damages \nwill still be available. It is important to us that there not be new \npreemptive Federal standards in that area. That has been done.\n  Next, we have made changes with respect to the principle of joint \nliability. This is especially important where you have defendants who \nare involved, again, in committing these outrageous acts, essentially \nfraudulent acts. That is kept in place as well.\n  So I do believe this is a bill that is targeted specifically at the \nkinds of problems that are going to be seen if we do not pass a \nbalanced, responsible piece of legislation. This involves business-to-\nbusiness activity. I suggest to some of our colleagues this has nothing \nto do with personal injury issues. If someone is injured, for example, \nas a result of an elevator accident because computers have broken down, \nand is maimed or killed, all of those personal remedies will lie.\n  So those are briefly some of the changes since the bill came from \ncommittee. We have seen, again, the Senate wants to work in a collegial \nway on this. My good friend from South Carolina and I have had several \nspirited discussions on this issue in recent days. He feels very \nstrongly about it. My part of the country has looked at technology as a \nbig part of our economic future. We want to come up with a responsible, \nbalanced bill.\n  The Senator from Connecticut and I have put on the desks of all \nDemocratic Members of the Senate today a letter which outlines a number \nof the changes that have been made. We heard earlier Senator Kerry is \npursuing some discussions as well. So I am hopeful between now and next \nweek we can have a bipartisan bill that is balanced, that comes before \nthe Senate and builds on the work Senator McCain and I have tried to do \nsince the partisan vote in committee. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues towards that end, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, with respect to the Y2K problem, it is \nvery interesting to note, the problem has been prepared for \ntechnologically, by the very groups they say the bill is to protect, \nfor 30 years. They have the technology. There is no hocus-pocus about \nthat.\n  I wish everyone would look back about 4 weeks ago and pull out of an \nedition of Business Week an extensive article to the effect that the \nmarket force is working. Large businesses, the GEs, the Ford Motors, \nthe Xeroxes, the IBMs and everybody else, working with their suppliers \ndown the line, have long since put them on notice. I do not have my \nfile with me, but the drop dead date is the end of this particular \nmonth, April 1999, where you still have several more months to comply. \nBut the market, knowing the technology is there, knowing of course you \nare going to be facing this, is trying to, like a Paul Revere, wake the \ntown and tell the people. And they have been doing it. We did it last \nyear, on a bipartisan basis, when we said: ``Wait a minute, if we \ncannot work these problems out, we will be slammed with antitrust.'' We \ngot together quickly, the Senator from Connecticut and others, and on a \nbipartisan basis we passed that measure. Everything has been working \nfine.\n  I spoke earlier this year--I do not want to mislead--I spoke with my \nfriend, Mr. Andy Grove of Intel, who is very much concerned about \nproportionality. But other than that, we spent a good hour in my office \ntalking about large computerization and everything else. That community \nknows. They are way ahead of lawyers and lawsuits, I can tell you that, \nas the business leaders.\n  William Gates--Bill Gates, out at Davos, Switzerland, at the \nconference, said there was no problem. And this past week the New York \nTimes wrote a summary article on the Y2K problem.\n  Mind you me, this is the middle of April 1999, months ahead, of \ncourse, of January 2000. They said people are moving along and \neverything else. You see, it is a practical problem. There is a bunch \nof old equipment on hand. Every automobile dealer faces this every year \nbecause they are going to bring out another model. So they all know \nabout bringing out new models and everything else like that. Of course \nthe new model needed for 2000 is the Year 2000-compliant model.\n  But what happens is that a side group has come in, upon this \nparticular concern and interest, not at all interested in the Y2K. We \ncould win this debate hands down on Y2K. But they are interested in \ndistorting the tort liability laws of America. They have been about it \nand I have been with them for 20 years. There is a wonderful gentleman \nnamed Victor Schwartz with the National Association of Manufacturers, \nand he sends me a wonderful Christmas greeting, thanking me for the \nwonderful year he has had, because I keep his clients current as long \nas we can continue to defeat product liability.\n  But now we have another gentleman who has come over to the Chamber of \nCommerce named Tom Donohue, and I know him well. I worked with him in \nthe Truckers'. He is coordinating this conspiracy. There is a great \nproblem. ``We have legitimate business folks in the computerization \nbusiness who are going to front for us. We don't want to argue about \ntaking away the rights of trial by jury that we have beat upon.'' They \ndon't want to have to take on the Association of State Supreme Court \nJustices and everything else of that kind. ``We want to talk about Y2K, \nY2K, Y2K, crisis, crisis, crisis.'' And they even act like there is \none, 7 months ahead of time.\n\n[[Page S4096]]\n\n  My little State of South Carolina just reported they would be \ncompliant in July of this particular year, 1999. If South Carolina can \nget ready, everybody and anybody can get ready by the year 2000, I can \ntell you that. But they come in under the auspices of a crisis, to try \nto change punitive damages, try to change trial by jury, try to change \njoint and several liability--they are trying to change it all. Anywhere \nthey can get a foot in the door for this particular precedent by this \nparticular Congress under the general phraseology ``tort reform,'' they \nthink they are home free. And I am afraid they would be.\n  The truth of the matter is, under the present legal system of the \nStates', we are having the finest, most booming economy you have ever \nseen. The stock market has gone over 10,000, the interest rates are \nlow, the unemployment rate is about the lowest it has ever been in 30 \nyears, and right on down the list. So what you are finding out, right \nto the point, is that there is not a problem. Business is doing well.\n  In fact, the analysis done in this particular debate over 20 years \nhas found it has not been greedy trial lawyers bringing fanciful suits \nwith no substance whatsoever, just harassing. Mr. President, the good \ntrial lawyer has no time for that nonsense. He does not get paid until \nhe wins. He has to prevail. He has to come to court, he has to prove \nhis case by the greater preponderance of evidence. He has to get not \njust 5 or 6 votes, he has to get all 12 votes. Then he has to go \nthrough the obstacle course of an appeal to the Supreme Court. Why? \nBecause corporate America continues to get paid as long as the clock \nruns.\n  It is a tragic thing that has been occurring in the system of \njurisprudence in America, because I practiced law for 20 years and I \npracticed representing businesses, incorporated and otherwise, but \npredominantly on the trial side with poor clients. I did not get a \nrecovery unless the client got a recovery.\n  I was against continuances, against motions, against more \ndepositions, against more discoveries. You see that mahogany-wall, \noriental-rug crowd down here. There are 60,000 registered to practice \nin the District of Columbia trying to fix your vote and my vote, just \nfixing juries. They will never get to the courtroom. They sit around \nand tell the clients: Come on, computer industry, we can change the \ntort system so we can take away the rights of the very group, Mr. \nPresident, that it is supposed to protect--mainly small business.\n  They have the National Federation of Independent Businesses. That is \nthe small business group that the law now protects. Instead, under the \nbill as proposed, a small business owner will have to wait 90 days \nbefore he or she could bring proceedings in court to recover damages. \nThey know at the very beginning what is contracted for and what is \nwrong, but this requirement is going to delay them, increasing the time \nand costs of the suit. Then you have to prove various other measures by \none of the highest standards of proof, almost like in a civil case. In \ncases where a party generally is required to prove by a preponderance, \nthey seek to have the standard to be clear and convincing.\n  I say that advisedly because with this particular system, as it has \nworked out over the years--come to South Carolina. We had tort reform, \nbut I have, they say, the competitive businesses. I am bringing in the \nHondas, the BMWs, as well as the expansion of the GEs and other \nindustries from all over the United States and the world coming into \nSouth Carolina where we have a civil statewide tort system.\n  Actually, these contracts are under the Uniform Commercial Code and \nought to be tried on a contract basis. But, no, they do not want to \neven talk about the defect in the entire measure. The measure is not \nneeded. The measure is misguided. The measure is an adulteration of the \nsystem, and bringing it to the Federal level, trying to tell the \nStates--and that is what I hear from the other side of the aisle, that \nthe people back home know best, they keep quoting Jefferson to me, less \nGovernment, let the States operate and everything else of that kind. \nThey do that until they get something for big business. Now they want \nto come in and make sure they can have that clock run, that they can \nmake a fortune, and the little man cannot even afford to bring his \nparticular action.\n  I have every objection in the world to this measure. I do not mind \ncompromising. I have always dealt with that particular approach for the \nalmost 50 years now that I have been in public service. But I can tell \nyou what this is. This is not Y2K. They have everybody running all \naround. Look at the morning Washington Post and you will see the \ndifferent people. It is like: ``Sooey, pig, you come, we got them, \nwe're going to get you to do this, get them to do that,'' and take the \nperson who has made the contract--and right now they can look at their \ncontract and see what is what in April 1999, months ahead of January 1.\n  They know whether they have the bad model or the right contract, and \nthey know what is going to be required. This really allows an industry \nto offload all the old stuff and then come in with an adaptation next \nyear that is going to cost over and above the particular computer.\n  It is bad business. It really distorts the jury system and the tried-\nand-true system of American jurisprudence. That is why I had to object, \nbecause I have been busy on this other farce, this so-called lockbox \nthat allows everybody to have the key but the poor Social Security \ncrowd that is bringing about the surplus. There is not any question \nabout that farce that is going on. They are just trying to make for a \nTV short in next year's campaign. We are going to make TV spots and \nshow the inaccuracy of it. That is exactly what we have been doing, \npaying down public debt with Social Security money, thereby running up, \nup, up and away the Social Security debt. When you pay down someone \nelse's debt with your money, you incur an indebtedness increase in your \nown program, namely Social Security.\n\n  There we are. They are trying their best to ram it through on Y2K, \nand they are all going around oozing and goozing how reasonable we are \nand we are trying to work this out. It ought to be killed dead in its \ntracks. Anybody who is looking out for the individual rights of the \nsmall businessman, the little doctor, the little law firm--any little \nbusiness person who does not keep a lawyer on retainer and they have an \ninstrumentality, namely a computer, that they say is ready to comply, \nand then they find out it does not comply, that is a breach of contract \nunder the Uniform Contract Code. They can bring that action. Mr. \nPresident, unless there is a fraudulent breach, it does not come under \ntort law, it comes under the contract law.\n  Incidentally, it is businesses suing businesses. That is the big \nlogjam. Any study, any research done with respect to the actual \nincrease in the volume of lawsuits in America will find businesses \nsuing businesses. I am exhibit 1 on this particular issue, for the main \nand simple reason, we worked for 4 years to get through the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act. Once we got it through, rather than businesses \ndoing what they said, namely competing, they all started with their \nlawyers: It was unconstitutional, take it up to this court--they have \nall been in court. Why? The ratepayers are paying for the lawyers. It \ndoes not cost them any money, and they are going around buying up each \nother, combining rather than competing.\n  They have a legal game going, which is in some measure the same thing \nthey had going with AT that caused Judge Greene to break it up. It \nseems to me that we are going to have to break it up again. That is \nwhat we are looking at now with the FCC: getting a drop-dead date for \nthem to comply with the law that they wrote.\n  They do not want to comply. They want to combine. They want to use \ntheir monopolistic powers with their lawyers in business. But it is not \nthe poor little injured party in court with a jury trial that is at \nissue, generally speaking, with respect to Y2K. It is the downtown \ncrowd that is scaring up clients and scaring up fees and scaring up \nactivity against the States.\n  The States have their own laws. The State of Illinois is well \nregarded as a place of high jurisprudence, and they do not need the \nFederal Government coming in and telling them how to protect the little \nman. Here, under the auspices of protecting the little man, we are \ngoing to take away his rights and drag him out, as if he had a lawyer\n\n[[Page S4097]]\n\nwaiting. It is to discourage the little man's day in court. That is why \nwe will be watching it very closely.\n  I don't know that this one will be worked out. In all reality, I \nthink we can get the votes--not necessarily on the matter of \nproceeding. We do not mind proceeding, we are just trying to get the \ntime. We can get the votes on the cloture to kill this measure.\n  If the computer industry is really serious about it, there may be \nsome compromise, but for this particular Senator, I have no plans at \nall of compromising on the fundamental constitutional rights of a trial \nby jury and what the States have developed over many, many years, which \nis the finest business environment that exists in the world today. \nNothing is hurting them. I do not have any of these foreign industries \ncoming in and saying, ``But, Senator, we're worried about product \nliability, we are worried about joint and several, we are worried about \ntrial by jury, we are worried about all these other punitive \ndamages.'' You do not hear that until you can get politicians running \nfor national office, and then they put it in the polls.\n\n  Under ``Henry V,'' Shakespeare said, ``Kill all the lawyers.'' Of \ncourse, it was the biggest compliment. The only way that individual \nrights and freedom could not be sustained is to kill off the crowd that \nwas going to protect individual rights and freedom. So it really was \nthe greatest of all compliments. It was not that they were against \nlawyers, but they knew how to start anarchy. So that is what they told \nDick the Butcher when they shouted, ``Kill all the lawyers.''\n  That is what you have on Monday when we get to the regular debate. We \nwill see which lawyer crowd we are going to kill off.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the sweeping terms of the bill before us \nare not justified. Senator McCain's substitute, like the underlying \nbill, unfortunately, remains a wish list for special interests that are \nor might become involved in Y2K litigation. The broad liability \nlimitations in the legislation risk rewarding irresponsible parties at \nthe expense of the responsible and the innocent. That is not fair or \nresponsible.\n  I cannot support such one-sided legislation that restricts the rights \nof American consumers, small business owners and family farmers who \nseek redress for harms caused by Year 2000 computer problems.\n  I remain open to continuing to work with interested members of the \nSenate on bipartisan, consensus legislation that would deter frivolous \nY2K lawsuits and encourage responsible Y2K compliance. In my judgment, \ntoday's bill would more likely have the opposite effect. It proposes \nsweeping liability protection that will encourage more Y2K litigation \nand discourage curing Y2K problems.\n  The right approach is to fix as many of these problems ahead of time \nas we can. Ultimately, the best defense against any Y2K-based lawsuit \nis to be Y2K compliant.\n  Let me offer a few examples how this bill would restructure the laws \nof the 50 states and cause great harm to the nationwide effort to fix \nour Y2K computer problems in 1999.\n  First, this bill provides special liability protection to directors \nand officers of companies involved in Y2K disputes. Why are we doing \nthis? Directors and officers are already protected by the business \njudgment rule, which has been adopted by each of the 50 states. How \nwill this special legal protection for corporate directors and officers \naffect the well-established precedents interpreting the business \njudgment rule in our states?\n  Moreover, every director and officer of a corporation has standard \ninsurance coverage to protect him or her from personal liability in the \ncourse of their duties. Will insurance companies reap windfall profits \nfrom this special legal protection for corporate directors and \nofficers? Or should insurance companies rebate the premiums they have \ncharged for existing insurance coverage for corporate directors or \nofficers because it might be superfluous now? Who knows? But these \nquestions will be hot spots for future litigation if this bill becomes \nlaw.\n  Providing special Y2K liability protection to the key decision makers \nin a company at this juncture sends the wrong message to the business \ncommunity.\n  We want to encourage these key decision makers to be overseeing \naggressive year 2000 compliance measures. Instead, this bill says to \ncorporate officers and directors: ``Don't worry, be happy.''\n  I want those corporate officers motivated to fix their company's Y2K \nproblems now. After their corporation is Y2K compliant and they have \nworked with their suppliers and customers and business partners and we \nhave avoided Y2K problems is the time to be happy.\n  Second, this bill caps punitive damages to 3 times the amount of \ncompensatory damages or $250,000, whichever is greater. If the \ndefendant is a small business, then $250,000 is the ceiling for any \npunitive damage award.\n  These punitive damages caps again send the wrong message to the \nbusiness community by protecting the bad actor, instead of rewarding \nthe responsible business owner.\n  The bill contains an exception to these punitive damages caps if a \nplaintiff can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant \nintentionally defrauded the plaintiff. This exception will prove \nmeaningless in the real world because no one will be able to meet this \nhigh and specific standard for proving the injury was specifically \nintended. How in the world is a plaintiff going to prove some \nintentionally tried to injury him or her in a Y2K case? Get real.\n  Punitive damages are awarded only in cases of outrageous conduct. If \na business takes responsible steps to become Y2K compliant, it will not \nbe subject to punitive damages. These caps on punitive damages, like \nmany other parts of the bill, discourage responsible Y2K remediation \nefforts.\n  Indeed, by limiting punitive damage to a dollar figure, $250,000, \nthese special legal protections may encourage some companies to analyze \nthe costs and potential risks of Y2K noncompliance and make the \ncalculated business decision not to make the investment needed to come \ninto compliance. The same type of calculation, for example, apparently \nmade by Ford in the exploding Pinto gas tank case.\n  A cost-benefit approach does not fix a corporation's Y2K problems, \nbut only leads to more litigation. Litigation with punitive damages \ncaps may, in the judgment of the company's accountants, be worth \nenduring if it costs less than Y2K compliance.\n  Third, the bill severely restricts the amount of damages that an \ninnocent plaintiff can recover from a guilty defendant by abolishing \njoint and several liability in most cases. The exceptions to this \nproportionate liability are so complex that they invited more \nlitigation, not less.\n  This proportionate liability may unfairly penalize innocent consumers \nand small businesses and reward irresponsible companies.\n  For example, a small business forced to shut down temporarily because \nof a Y2K computer malfunction may not be able to recoup all of its \nlosses under proportionate liability if it fails to identify all the \nresponsible parties that caused that Y2K problem. As a result, that \nsmall business may be forced to file for bankruptcy because of its \nlimited resources. Why is the innocent small business owner, who may \nnot know and should not know all the responsible parties in the \nmanufacturing chain of a non Y2K compliant product, forced to go out of \nbusiness?\n  Moreover, this bill's many federal preemptions of state contract and \ntort law are all one-sided. The bill's provisions benefit only \ndefendants, not plaintiffs, in Y2K disputes.\n  The bill raises the standards of proof from a preponderance test to a \nclear and convincing test for plaintiffs to prove negligence and other \ntorts claims without any corresponding responsibility on defendants. \nThe bill adds new state of mind requirements on plaintiffs to prove \ntort claims without any corresponding responsibility on defendants.\n  The bill also greatly expands the jurisdiction of the federal courts \nto consider Y2K cases under its class action provisions--an approach \nsoundly rejected last month by Chief Justice Rehnquist and the Judicial \nConference. The Judicial Conference found that shifting Y2K cases from \nstate courts ``holds the potential for overwhelming the federal courts, \nresulting in substantial costs and delays.''\n\n[[Page S4098]]\n\n  In addition, the Judicial Conference concluded ``the proposed Y2K \namendments are inconsistent with the objective of preserving the \nfederal courts as tribunals of limited jurisdiction.'' I ask unanimous \nconsent that a letter from the Judicial Conference opposing this \nexpanded federal court jurisdiction be printed in the Record.\n  Finally, the bill adds a sunset date of January 1, 2016, according to \nthe latest public draft. A bill that stays effective for the next 17 \nyears is not narrow in scope. This sunset date is not reasonable. Is \nthis bill intended to cover year 2015 computer problems?\n  I agree with Assistant Attorney General Eleanor Acheson who testified \nat the Judiciary Committee hearing a few weeks ago on similar Y2K \nliability legislation that ``this bill would be by far the most \nsweeping litigation reform measure ever enacted.''\n  So why do we need these sweeping litigation reforms to address year \n2000 computer problems? I don't know. The proponents of this \nlegislation have offered no solid evidence to justify these sweeping \nprovisions.\n  There is no reasonable justification for the sweeping liability \nprotections in this bill because these protections are not reasonable. \nThis bill overreaches again and again. It is not close to being \nbalanced.\n  Worst of all, this bill as presently drafted would preempt the \nconsumer protection laws of each of the 50 states and restrict the \nlegal rights of consumers who are harmed by Y2K computer failures. Why \nis this bill taking away existing protections for the ordinary citizen?\n  We all know that individual consumers do not have the same knowledge \nor bargaining power in the marketplace as businesses with more \nresources. Many consumers may not be aware of potential Y2K problems in \nthe products that they buy for personal, family or household purposes.\n  Consumers just go to the local store downtown or at the mall to buy a \nhome computer or the latest software package. They expect their new \npurchase to work. But what if it does not work because of a Y2K \nproblem?\n  Then the average consumer should be able to use his or her home \nstate's consumer protection laws to get a refund, replacement part or \nother justice. During the Judiciary Committee consideration of similar \nlegislation, I offered an amendment to allow consumers to do just that. \nI may offer a similar amendment on this bill.\n  Those of us in Congress who have been active on technology-related \nissues have struggled mightily, and successfully, to act in a \nbipartisan way. It would be unfortunate, and it would be harmful to the \ntechnology industry, technology users and to all consumers, if that \npattern is broken over this bill.\n  I sense that some may be seeking to use fear of the Y2K millennium \nbug to revive failed liability limitation legislation of the past. \nThese controversial proposals may be good politics in some circles, but \nthey are not true solutions to the Y2K problem. Instead, we should be \nlooking to the future and creating incentives in this country and \naround the world for accelerating our efforts to resolve potential Y2K \nproblems before they cause harm.\n  Last year, I joined with Senator Hatch to pass into law a consensus \nbill known as ``The Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure \nAct.'' We worked on a bipartisan basis with Senator Bennett, Senator \nDodd, the Administration, industry representatives and others to reach \nagreement on a bill to facilitate information sharing to encourage Y2K \ncompliance.\n  The new law, enacted six months ago, is working to encourage \ncompanies to work together and share Y2K solutions and test results. It \npromotes company-to-company information sharing while not limiting \nrights of consumers. That is the model we should use to enact balanced \nand narrow legislation to deter any frivolous Y2K litigation while \nencouraging responsible Y2K compliance.\n  I am continuing to work with Senators from both sides of the aisle to \nnegotiate a narrow and balanced bill.\n  Unfortunately, this special interest legislation before us today is \nnot narrow and it is not balanced.\n  I must oppose it.\n  Mr. President, I ask Unanimous Consent that a letter received by the \nJudiciary Committee from the Judicial Conference of the United States \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            Judicial Conference of\n\n\n                                            the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 1999.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the Judicial Conference of \n     the United States, I write to transmit views with respect to \n     pending year 2000 (``Y2K'') legislation. S. 461, as well as \n     S. 96 and H.R. 775, seeks to promote the resolution of \n     potentially large numbers of Y2K disputes. The federal \n     judiciary recognizes the commendable efforts of Congress to \n     resolve Y2K disputes short of full-scale litigation so as to \n     alleviate the burden of such litigation on private parties as \n     well as on federal and state courts. These are clearly \n     laudable public policy objectives.\n       Some of the provisions, however, will affect the \n     administration of justice in the federal courts. The Judicial \n     Conference, at its March 16th session, determined to oppose \n     the provisions expanding federal court jurisdiction over Y2K \n     class actions in bills (S. 461, S. 96, and H.R. 775) \n     currently under consideration by the 106th Congress. In \n     addition, because the Y2K pleading requirements included in \n     these bills circumvent the Rules Enabling Act, the Conference \n     also opposes these provisions.\n\n\n                             class actions\n\n       These bills create no federal cause of action. Instead, \n     they assume that plaintiffs will rely on typical state causes \n     of action to provide relief in Y2K disputes. Under the bills, \n     individual plaintiffs, as opposed to class action plaintiffs, \n     can bring their tort, contract, and fraud suits in a state \n     court where they will remain until resolved. While federal \n     defenses and liability limitations established in the \n     legislation may be raised in such litigation, the bills \n     recognize that state courts are fully capable of applying \n     these provisions and carrying out federal policy. This \n     reliance on state courts, which today handle 95 percent of \n     the nation's judicial business, follows the traditional \n     allocation of work between the state and federal courts.\n       The provisions of these Y2K bills take a radically \n     different approach to Y2K class actions--one that would \n     effect a major reallocation of class action workloads. These \n     bills create original federal court jurisdiction over any Y2K \n     class action based on state law, regardless of the amount in \n     controversy, where there is minimal diversity of \n     citizenship--that is, where any single member of the proposed \n     plaintiff class and any defendant are from different states. \n     They also provide for the removal of any such Y2K class \n     action to federal court by any single defendant or any single \n     member of the plaintiff class who is not a representative \n     party. While these bills do identify limited circumstances in \n     which a federal district court may abstain from hearing a Y2K \n     class action, it is unlikely that many actions will meet the \n     specified criteria. The net result of these provisions will \n     be that most Y2K class action cases will be litigated in the \n     federal courts.\n       This assignment of the class action workload to the federal \n     courts is particularly troubling because the Y2K problem may \n     result in a very large number of class actions. While no one \n     knows how many cases will be filed, Senator Robert Bennett, \n     Chair of the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology \n     Problem, has predicted that there could be a ``tidal wave'' \n     of litigation resulting from Y2K problems. Given the nature \n     of the Y2K problem, it is reasonable to expect that similar \n     claims will often arise in favor of multiple plaintiffs \n     against the same defendant or defendants. Thus, it can be \n     expected that a substantial portion of these cases will be \n     brought as class actions. Responding to class actions, \n     regardless of where they are filed, will likely be a \n     monumental task. If the current class action provisions \n     remain in these bills, however, the important contribution \n     the state courts would otherwise make to meeting this \n     challenge will be lost, and the burden of the federal system \n     will be correspondingly increased. The transfer of this \n     burden of the federal courts holds the potential of \n     overwhelming federal judicial resources and the capacity of \n     the federal courts to resolve not only Y2K cases, but other \n     causes of action as well.\n       Federal administration of these state-law class actions \n     will impose other substantial burdens. By shifting state-\n     created claims into federal court, the bills confront the \n     federal courts with the responsibility to engage in difficult \n     and time-consuming choice-of-law decisions. The Erie doctrine \n     requires that federal district courts, sitting in diversity, \n     apply the law of the forum state of determine which body of \n     state law controls the existence of a right of action. The \n     wholesale shift of state-law class actions into federal court \n     makes this choice-of-law obligation all the more daunting as \n     the sheer number of possible subclasses and relevant bodies \n     of state law multiples. Some federal courts have taken the \n     position that such multiplicity of law itself stands as a \n     barrier to the certification of a nationwide class action. \n     Even where a district court agreed to certify a class, it \n     would have to make choice of law\n\n[[Page S4099]]\n\n     and substantive determinations that would have no binding \n     force in subsequent Y2K litigation in the states in question.\n       In addition to the potential adverse docket impact on the \n     federal courts, the proposed bills infringe upon the \n     traditional authority of the states to manage their own \n     judicial business. State legislatures and other rule-making \n     bodies provide rules for the aggregation of state-law \n     claims into class-wide litigation in order to achieve \n     certain litigation economies of scale. By providing for \n     class treatment, state policymakers express the view that \n     the state's own resources can be best deployed not through \n     repetitive and potentially duplicative individual \n     litigation, but through some form of class treatment. The \n     proposed bills could deprive the state courts of the power \n     to hear much of this class litigation and might well \n     create incentives for plaintiffs who prefer a state forum \n     to bring a series of individual claims. Such individual \n     litigation might place a greater burden on the state \n     courts and thwart the states' policies of more efficient \n     disposition.\n       Federal jurisdiction over class action litigation is an \n     area where change should be approached with caution and \n     careful consideration of the underlying relationship between \n     state and federal courts. The Judicial Conference Advisory \n     Committee on Civil Rules has recently devoted several years \n     of study to the rules in class action litigation. One \n     outgrowth of that study was the appointment by the Chief \n     Justice of a Mass Torts Working Group. The Working Group \n     undertook a study which revealed the complexities of \n     litigation that aggregates large numbers of claims and \n     illustrates the need for a deliberative review of the issues \n     that must be addressed in attempting to improve the process \n     for resolution of such litigation. Such issues involve not \n     only procedural rules, but also the jurisdiction of federal \n     and state courts and the interaction between federal and \n     state law. Y2K class action litigation implicates the same \n     complex and fundamental issues that the Working Group \n     identified. Even for familiar categories of litigation, these \n     issues can be satisfactorily resolved only by further study. \n     An attempt to address them in isolation, for an unfamiliar \n     category of cases that remains to be developed only in the \n     future, is unwise.\n       It may well be that extending minimal diversity to mass \n     torts may be appropriate if accompanied by suitable \n     restrictions. The Judicial Conference, for example, has \n     endorsed in principle the use of minimal diversity \n     jurisdiction in single-event, mass tort situations, like \n     airplane crash litigation, and there may be other situations \n     in which the efficiencies to be gained from consolidating \n     mass tort litigation in federal courts are justified. \n     Expansion of class action jurisdiction over Y2K class actions \n     in the manner provided in the pending bills, however, would \n     be inconsistent with the objective of preserving the federal \n     courts as tribunals of limited jurisdiction and the reality \n     that the federal courts are staffed and supported to function \n     as tribunals of limited jurisdiction.\n       Judicial federalism relies on the principle that state and \n     federal courts together comprise an integrated system for the \n     delivery of justice in the United States. There appears to be \n     no substantial justification for the potentially massive \n     transfer of workload under these bills, and such a transfer \n     would seem to be counterproductive. State courts provide most \n     of the nation's judicial capacity, and a decision to limit \n     access to this capacity in the face of the burden that Y2K \n     litigation may impose could have significant consequences for \n     the efficient resolution of Y2K disputes.\n\n\n                         pleading requirements\n\n       S. 461, as well as S. 96 and H.R. 775, sets forth specific \n     pleading provisions in Y2K litigation that would require a \n     plaintiff to state with particularity certain matters in the \n     complaint regarding the nature and amount of damages, \n     material defects, and the defendant's state of mind. These \n     requirements are inconsistent with the general notice \n     pleading provisions found in the Federal Rules of civil \n     Procedure (i.e., Rule 8), which apply to civil cases. The \n     bills' provisions bypass the rulemaking provisions in the \n     rules Enabling Act (28 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2071-77). They have \n     not been subjected to bench, bar, and public scrutiny \n     envisioned under the Rules Enabling Act and are inconsistent \n     with the policies underlying the Act, which the Judicial \n     Conference has long supported.\n       Not only do the statutory pleading requirements bypass the \n     Rules Enabling Act, they do so in a particularly \n     objectionable way because they are contained in stand-alone \n     statutory provisions outside the federal rules. This will \n     cause confusion and traps for unwary lawyers who are \n     accustomed to relying on the Federal Rules of civil Procedure \n     for pleading requirements. It also would signal yet another \n     departure from uniform, national procedural rules, following \n     closely in the wake of similar pleading requirements \n     contained in the Private Securities Reform Litigation Act.\n       On behalf of the federal judiciary, I appreciate your \n     consideration of these views.

Mr. President, in the past several months when radio \npersonalities--sometimes known as ``shock jocks''--have gone beyond the \nbounds of propriety, their employers have been quick to dismiss them.\n  For example, the Charlotte, NC, station just yesterday fired a radio \ntalk show host who made an on-the-air joke about this week's tragedy in \nLittleton, CO. There was also a Washington, DC, station that \nimmediately fired the ``Greaseman'' for his racist remarks after the \ntragic dragging death of a Texas man that we all remember.\n  Now in Chicago we learn of another one of these offensive on-the-air \npersonalities who has stepped over the line. He made insulting remarks \nagainst Special Olympians. What he said about these brave athletes is \nindefensible.

I ask unanimous consent that this article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 14, 1999]\n\n                  U.S. NATO Study WWII Yugoslav Rebels\n\n                           (By John Diamond)\n\n       Washington, (AP).--Pentagon and NATO officials considering \n     ground troop options for Yugoslavia are studying the history \n     of Yugoslav resistance during World War II, when hundreds of \n     thousands of German soldiers\n\n[[Page S4100]]\n\n     failed to pacify determined guerrilla opposition.\n       The Nazi campaign was called Operation Punishment, \n     reflecting Adolf Hitler's rage against Yugoslav partisans who \n     overthrew their own government after Belgrade made a pact \n     with Berlin. The campaign was well-named--Yugoslav civilians \n     were attacked with an intensity far beyond anything NATO \n     would contemplate.\n       In the end, though, the Wermacht took plenty of punishment. \n     And five decades later, the campaign offers lessons for any \n     force reckoning to do battle with the hardy ``South Slavs'' \n     who plagued the German army in a costly guerrilla war.\n       When NATO first studied ground troop options last fall, \n     Clinton administration planners cited the German experience \n     as one reason to rule out ground troops as an option in the \n     Kosovo crisis.\n       ``We always look at historic campaigns--that's something we \n     always do'' when planning a deployment, said Maj. Shelly \n     Stellwagen, an Army spokeswoman. But she cautioned, ``History \n     alone is not enough--you've got to look at the big picture.''\n       After insisting for weeks that no plans for ground troops \n     were in the works, top Clinton administration officials now \n     concede that some contingencies were studied and that plans \n     could be activated quickly if NATO decided on ground assault. \n     U.S. lawmakers, frustrated with the continuing ethnic \n     cleansing in the Kosovo province of Yugoslavia despite a \n     three-week NATO air campaign, are pushing a resolution to \n     authorize ground troops.\n       Pentagon planners said they were careful not to overdo the \n     comparison of two markedly different armies fighting with \n     different equipment in different political contexts. \n     Moreover, Yugoslavia today constitutes a country less then \n     half the size of the one the German army invaded in 1941. But \n     the difficulty of the terrain and the stubbornness of the \n     Yugoslav people remain powerful common denominators, they \n     said.\n       The German invasion force of nearly 200,000--a figure some \n     U.S. officials have cited as necessary to invade Yugoslavia \n     today--fluctuated after 1941 from a low of 60,000 to a high \n     of 700,000. Through it all, the German were never able to \n     quell the multiple and dogged Yugoslav resistance forces.\n       An official U.S. Army history of the campaign, written in \n     the early 1950s, contained a warning for any future force \n     contemplating challenging Yugoslavia on the ground.\n       ``The success achieved by the (Yugoslav) guerrillas against \n     the Germans . . . strengthened considerably the tradition of \n     resistance to foreign occupation forces,'' the Army history \n     concluded. ``There is little doubt that a foreign invader \n     today, whether from East or West, would be confronted with a \n     formidable task of pacification following a successful \n     campaign against the regular forces of the Balkan nations.''\n       As Hitler planned Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion \n     of the Soviet Union, he wanted to secure his southern flank \n     by neutralizing Greece. To do that he needed Yugoslavia's \n     cooperation, and in early 1941 he thought he had it.\n       But Hitler badly misjudged the sentiments of the Yugoslav \n     people.\n       A coup in March 1941 toppled Yugoslavia's royal government, \n     setting a precedent that undoubtedly influences the thinking \n     of Yugoslavia's current leadership: Governments that cave in \n     the foreign pressure will be ousted from within.\n       Hitler, in a rage, ordered the carpet-bombing of Belgrade.\n       Hitler's War Directive No. 25 said, ``The ground \n     installations of the Yugoslav air force and the city of \n     Belgrade will be destroyed from the air by continual day and \n     night attacks.'' The strikes began 58 years ago this month, \n     on April 6, 1941.\n       The Germans aimed specifically at killing civilians during \n     48 hours of near-continuous bombing. Hitler wanted to spare \n     Yugoslavia's factories for his own use. NATO, by contrast, \n     has been seeking to avoid civilian casualties while aiming at \n     destroying Yugoslav military and weapons installations. The \n     Germans used 1,000 attack and escort aircraft in those 48 \n     hours. NATO has employed 700--soon to be 1,000--strike and \n     support aircraft in three weeks of attacks.\n       Estimated death tolls from the Nazi bombing range widely, \n     but published German and American estimates put the total as \n     high as 17,000.\n       The German ground invasion consisted of a dozen divisions--\n     roughly 180,000 troops--supplemented by forces from Bulgaria \n     and Italy. German forces completed their conquest of the \n     Balkans in 11 days.\n       But the lightning conquest only began Germany's troubles in \n     the Balkans.\n       Despite brutal tactics, summary executions and wholesale \n     burning of villages, German forces assaulted guerrilla \n     strongholds again and again only to see the rebels slip into \n     the hills and forests. By mid-1943, the U.S. Army history \n     recounted, ``It was obvious that more German troops would be \n     required if the Balkans were to be held.''\n       Total German forces peaked at 700,000 at the beginning of \n     1943, though many of these troops were either green or \n     battle-weary veterans resting from the Russian front. No \n     precise casualty figures exist for German forces in \n     Yugoslavia.\n       Belgrade fell to the westward-marching Russians on Oct. 20, \n     1944.\n\n\n                   poland, hungary and czech republic\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Today we have three new members in NATO--Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic.\n  I have long been an ardent supporter of what we use to call ``the \nCaptive Nations.'' There are many events that I remember as mayor of \nCleveland and Governor of Ohio where we celebrated the resolve of these \npeople to one day taste the freedoms that we have here in America.\n  In those days, I often wondered if I would ever witness a free Poland \nor a free Hungary or other nations hat used to be dominated by the \nthen-Soviet Union. This morning I attended a reception sponsored by the \nPolish American Congress where Prime Minister Buzek shared with me that \nthe wondered if it would happen in his lifetime that the would see a \nfree and independent Poland--going from the iron curtain to solidarity \nto NATO.\n  And let me say--it's just wonderful that these nations now have self-\ndetermination and they are making great progress politically and \neconomically from where they were 20 or even 10 years ago.\n  I am very proud that I was one of those who encouraged the inclusion \nof these three nations into the NATO alliance.\n  And as NATO opened its arms to these three nations, I hope NATO will \nopen its arms to take-in the Republic of Slovenia as a member. This \nwould be an additional of particular importance considering the events \nhappening in Kosovo today.\n\n\n                                slovenia\n\n  I strongly support the NATO membership of the Republic of Slovenia.\n  As many of my colleagues know, a large number of the countries of \ncentral and eastern Europe who formerly were considered ``Warsaw Pact'' \nnations have struggled economically and politically in the years since \nthe collapse of the Soviet Union.\n  The former Yugoslavia, with whom we are now at war with, has been one \nof our greatest foreign policy challenges in recent years.\n  However, despite facing many of the same challenges that have \nhampered other states, Slovenia has emerged as the one state in the \nBalkans that has established itself as the model of our democratic \nideals. Slovenia possesses a stable political system, has committed to \nfree market principles and has modernized their armed forces. It is \nclearly a beacon in the region.\n  I believe that Slovenia's involvement in NATO would powerfully \nunderscore to the other nations of the region that reforms bring \nrewards, and that full acceptance by the international community is a \nreal and attainable goal.\n  Further, and I think this is important, I believe that the Alliance \nwould be strengthened by Slovenia's participation.\n  And let me just add that I know that my colleague, Senator Roth has \nbeen a champion for the inclusion of Slovenia in NATO and I would be \nremiss if I did not mention his efforts in that respect.\n\n\n                           Candidacy for NATO\n\n  NATO's 1995 Study on Enlargement laid out the general guidelines to \nbe used by NATO member governments during the consideration of \nadditional members.\n  Candidates must have five qualifications:\n  (1) free-market economies;\n  (2) a democratic political system based on the rule of law;\n  (3) a commitment to the norms of the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), including resolution of ethnic and \nterritorial disputes with neighboring countries;\n  (4) civilian control over militaries; and\n  (5) the ability to contribute to NATO's collective defense as well as \nto NATO's new missions.\n  Since gaining independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, Slovenia has met \nall of these obligations and has surpassed the standard set for NATO \nmembership established with the invitation of Poland, the Czech \nRepublic and Hungary to the NATO Alliance.\n\n\n                        (1) Free-Market Economy\n\n  Slovenia has committed to a market economy and enjoys the highest per \ncapita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in central and eastern Europe. This \nhas given them the highest international credit rating in the region.\n  In a further indication of Slovenia's economic development, the \nEuropean Union, EU, began membership talks with Slovenia in March of \n1998. A November 1998 Commission report indicated that Slovenia ``can \nbe regarded\n\n[[Page S4101]]\n\nas a functioning market economy.'' Clearly, Slovenia has met this \ncandidacy requirement.\n\n\n                    (2) Democratic Political System\n\n  Slovenia has a vibrant parliamentary democracy characterized by \npeaceful and meaningful political debate. Elections are free, fair, and \nopen. There is an independent judiciary.\n  As the U.S. State Department's Report on Human Rights Practices for \n1998 mentioned, ``the press is a vigorous institution'' and ``in theory \nand practice, the media enjoy full freedom in their journalistic \npursuits.''\n  Further, the Report states that ``the Government respects the human \nrights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provide adequate \nmeans of dealing with individual instances of abuse.'' Slovenia has met \nthe NATO candidacy requirement.\n\n\n                         (3) Commitment to OSCE\n\n  With regards to Slovenia's role in the international community thus \nfar, it is a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope, OSCE, the Council of Europe, NATO's Partnership for Peace and \nEuro-Atlantic Partnership Council, the World Trade Organization, the \nInternational Monetary Fund as well as the World Bank.\n  Property rights concerns that had existed with Italy were resolved in \n1996 with the Association Agreement between Slovenia and the European \nUnion. Slovenia has again met the NATO candidacy requirement.\n\n\n                   (4) Civilian Control Over Military\n\n  Since Slovenia had not fielded a military prior to its independence, \nensuring civilian control was not as problematic as it might have been \notherwise.\n  Specifically, the armed forces are controlled by the civilian defense \nminister while the legislative branch plays an oversight role. The NATO \ncandidacy requirement has been met.\n\n\n  (5) Ability to Contribute to NATO's Collective Defense and Missions\n\n  While Slovenia has more than exceeded the other requirements for NATO \nmembership, there have been some criticisms regarding its ability to \ncontribute to NATO's collective defense as well as future NATO \nmissions.\n  Slovenia's population is just under 2 million people. This reality \nlimits the viable size of its armed forces.\n  In response to this challenge, Slovenia has focused on developing a \nprofessional force that is smaller in size than many of the NATO \naspirants but which may be more effective in the field.\n  To that end, Slovenia has set defense spending at 1.89 percent of its \nGDP--which I might add is a higher percentage than a number of current \nNATO member countries. Plans are in place to raise this to 2.3 percent \nby the year 2003.\n  Thus far, these monies have largely been spent on air defense, \nantiarmor weapons and communications equipment that are designed to be \ninteroperable with existing NATO forces and equipment.\n  While Slovenia's forces are comparatively small in size, they have \nbeen actively involved in a variety of international operations over \nthe years. Slovenia is involved in peacekeeping missions in Albania, \nthe NATO-led Stabilization Force in Bosnia (SFOR) and United Nations \nefforts in Cyprus.\n  Finally, Slovenia has expressed its willingness to participate in any \nNATO deployment initiated to promote peace in Kosovo. Again, Slovenia \nhas met difficult challenges to achieve NATO membership and has \nresponded creatively and positively.\n\n\n                      economic interest to america\n\n  Let me point out that in addition to these strategic foreign policy \nconcerns, there is a very real economic interest for the United States \nin bringing Slovenia further into the international community.\n  During the 1992 through 1997 time period, U.S. exports to Slovenia \nincreased by 197 percent. Over the same period, Ohio's exports have \nincreased a staggering 220 percent.\n\n\n                            trade with ohio\n\n  In an effort to further develop these trade ties, as Governor of the \nState of Ohio, I had the opportunity to lead two trade missions of \nbusiness leaders to Slovenia in 1993 and 1995. Soon after these \nmissions, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company of Akron, OH, made the largest \ndirect U.S. investment in Slovenian history. The inclusion of Slovenia \nin the NATO community would provide an important incentive for this \ntype of trading relationship in the future.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Our nation is on a path to enlarge NATO and ensure that the freedom \nand prosperity that western Europe has enjoyed for decades spreads to \nthe nations of central and eastern Europe.\n  With those goals in mind, we must support Slovenia's entrance into \nNATO. And there is no perfect time than this, the 50th Anniversary of \nANTO summit to let the people of Slovenia, as well as the rest of \nEurope, know that their democratic changes, economic reforms and \nmilitary modernization will be rewarded with full participation in the \ninternational community.\n  Mr. President, with your permission, I will make a statement in \nregard to one of Ohio's outstanding citizens who is celebrating his \n80th birthday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/22/senate-section/article/S4101-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4101-S4102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     80TH BIRTHDAY OF CARL LINDNER\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today, my dear friend, and one of \nOhio's and America's most successful businessmen, Carl Lindner, is \ncelebrating his 80th birthday. I extend to him my sincere best wishes.\n  Carl got his business start in 1940, founding United Dairy Farmers \nalong with his father and his brothers, Bob and Dick and his sister \nDorothy.\n  From that first beginning, Carl Lindner fine-tuned his business \nacumen and has never looked back. As he says, ``only in America.'' \nToday, he is chairman of the board and chief executive officer and \nfounder of American Financial Group, one of our Nation's largest \ninsurance firms.\n  He is also chairman of the board and CEO of Chiquita Brands \nInternational as well as the Great American Group of Insurance \nCompanies.\n  He is active in a number of organizations and institutions in the \nCincinnati area and in Washington.\n  He is the recipient of numerous awards and accolades--and there are a \nnumber of them--including the Golden Plate Award by the American \nAcademy of Achievement in 1978. He is also a 33rd degree Mason and is \nthe recipient of the Van Rensselaer Medal--one of only 14 people \nworldwide to receive such a distinction.\n  In 1998, he was awarded the Gourgas Medal, which is the most \ndistinguished honor given by the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite \n``in recognition of notably distinguished service in the cause of \nFreemasonry, country or humanity.''\n  A religious man, Carl Lindner has given of himself to those of faiths \nother than his own. In 1989, the Hebrew Union College awarded Carl the \nJewish Institute of Religion Interfaith Award. In 1995 he received the \nJewish National Fund's International Peace Award--the highest \ninternational honor and award given by the Jewish National Fund.\n  Carl's civic and business accomplishments run the gamut, from the \nFriars Club's Centennial Award in 1985 to the National Council of the \nBoy Scouts of America's ``Silver Beaver'' award in 1995 to the \nDistinguished Service Citation by the National Conference of Christians \nand Jews.\n  He has also been inducted into the Greater Cincinnati Business Hall \nof Fame and the Junior Achievement National Business Hall of Fame. \nFurther, in 1997, he received the Heritage Award from the Cincinnati \nUrban League.\n  Carl Lindner is also a great believer in quality education, and has \ndevoted his time, energy and resources to encourage students and \nprovide them with institutions in which to learn. His service and \ngenerosity have earned him three honorary doctorates from Judson \nCollege in 1983, the University of Cincinnati in 1985 and Xavier \nUniversity in 1991. He was also presented with the Lincoln Award from \nNorthern Kentucky University in 1993.\n  In addition, the College of Business Administration at the University \nof Cincinnati is housed in Carl Lindner Hall and the school has \nestablished the Carl Lindner Annual Medal for Outstanding Business \nAchievement and a new honors program--the Carl Lindner Honors-Plus \nprogram. Xavier University has dedicated the Carl Lindner Family \nPhysics Building. Carl and his\n\n[[Page S4102]]\n\nwife Edyth are also major benefactors of Cincinnati Hills Christian \nAcademy, a school founded by their son, Carl Lindner III.\n  The generosity of Carl and Edyth Lindner has been felt by the \nCincinnati Zoo with its Lindner Family Center for Reproduction of \nEndangered Wildlife, the Museum Center with its Lindner Ice Age \nExhibit, the Health Alliance of Cincinnati with its Lindner Center for \nClinical Cardiovascular Research Center, and the Scottish Rite with its \nLindner Learning Center.\n  Carl Lindner's success in business is only surpassed by his \noutstanding service to his fellow man. He is not a man to point to his \nachievements; people only know a fraction of what he has contributed to \nthe community. He has given to scores of charities that no one knows \nabout, and he gives because he has a tremendous heart. In fact, he goes \nout of his way to avoid publicity.\n  I will never forget that when in 1996 the gambling interests in the \ncountry were trying to bring casino gambling into Ohio. As the \nGovernor, I didn't think it was in the best interest of the State to \nhave casino gambling, that the liabilities far outweighed the benefits. \nThose in favor of gambling were spending money like water on \nadvertising. I wanted to oppose it, but I didn't have the money to \nmatch even a fraction of what they were spending. I called upon Carl \nLindner.\n  I explained to him the other side of the story on gambling and why we \nneeded to keep it out of Ohio. Fortunately, I didn't have to convince \nhim. He, too, agreed that gambling was not the way for Ohio and he \noffered whatever assistance we needed to ensure that gambling did not \ncome to our state. The proponents of gambling fought hard, but we \nfought back thanks to Carl. And we won--two-thirds of the voters \nrejected casino gambling in Ohio. I will say today on the Senate floor, \nwithout Carl Lindner's help we would not have won that battle.\n  It is because of his selflessness and humility that I felt it \nimportant to rise on the Senate floor today to pay tribute to this \ngreat American. There are few people in this nation who have the kind \nof strength of their beliefs that Carl Lindner has, and usually they \nend at people's wallets, but Carl backs up his beliefs with his support \nboth in time and money. We need more people in this country like Carl \nLindner.\n  And one more thing that impresses me about Carl is his relationship \nwith his wonderful family. Carl rejoices in his marvelous family, his \nchildren and particularly his wife, Edyth. Edyth has been a wonderful \npartner of his over the years, and they have a great marriage. And I \nknow Carl is especially proud of his sons. As a father, I understand \nthat so often the successes of our children surpasses anything we do in \nour own right.\n  Mr. President, there are few Americans I know who have done as much \nand have given as much to their nation as Carl Lindner. I have been \ntruly blessed with his friendship and I am inspired by his warmth and \nhumility, and Mr. President, if you look up humility in the dictionary, \nthere should be a picture of Carl Lindner. May Carl and his beloved \nfamily celebrate many more birthdays together.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to make a very short comment on \ntwo measures that comprise a basic cornerstone for the efforts that I \nmade to ensure that the fundamental needs of children in my State of \nNew Mexico and throughout the country are met.\n  The basic idea here is that children have to have, if they are going \nto grow into full and honorable adulthood, access to quality, \naffordable health care. A child who is sick cannot go to school, and \ncannot be expected to learn in school, and cannot be expected to grow \nup and thrive and go on to be a productive citizen. In New Mexico, we \nhave a particularly compelling case because the Children's Defense \nFund, this last year, identified our State as having a higher number of \nuninsured children than any other State in the Union--uninsured for \nhealth care insurance. Consequently, I have two measures that try to \naddress this need.\n  The first deals with a problem that has sadly become an epidemic in \nNew Mexico; it is the Youth Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment \nAct. This is designed to increase access to drug prevention and \ntreatment services for young people in the country.\n  Second is the Children's Dental Health Improvement Act, which is \ndesigned to increase access to dental services for young people, \nparticularly young people who are eligible to participate in Medicaid.\n  Mr. President, I will be introducing both of those bills and I \ncommend them to my colleagues. I hope they will also get a full hearing \nthis Congress and that we can enact them into law and send them to the \nPresident as well.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I commend Senator Daschle also for his thoughtful \nstatement. I know other Senators from both sides of the aisle have \nspoken to this tragedy, as well.\n  This morning, my wife and I watched on television one of the most \npainful and difficult interviews I have ever watched. The father of a \nyoung African American boy killed in Colorado spoke of his hopes and \ndreams for his son. Sitting next to him was another student, who is \nwhite and who recounted how his classmate and friend, an African \nAmerican, had died, how he had been selected because he was black and \nbecause he was an athlete. To compound the tragedy, the young man who \nhad spoken also recounted the fact that his own sister died in the \nshooting. It ended with the African American father holding the hand of \nthe\n\n[[Page S4103]]\n\nyoung student, each trying to comfort the other, each seeking solace in \ntheir faith, but each at a loss, as we are, to what might have caused \nthis terrible, terrible event.\n  How could students be picked out to be murdered because they were \nathletes, or because of the color of their skin, or because they \nhappened to be wearing a certain kind of clothes? What kind of \nnihilistic aberration causes something like this to happen? What causes \na person to do that? What causes the kind of behavior around the world \nwhere people die because of their faith, because of their color, \nbecause of who they are, their ethnic background?\n  I suggest the Senate pause for a moment in the wake of this tragedy \nand rededicate ourselves to the work ahead and turn our attention to \nthese matters.\n  I serve on the Judiciary Committee and we spent a lot of time this \nweek and this past year on a proposed flag amendment to the \nConstitution. We spent a lot more time on that than we have on school \nviolence. We held three hearings on a proposed constitutional amendment \nwithin the last year. We have held none on the tragic school incidents \nthat have occurred throughout the country. We ought to reconsider the \nagenda of that committee, maybe even of the Senate.\n  We have become so polarized and so politicized in this Senate--more \nthan I have seen at any time in my 25 years here. We do no good to the \ncountry, Republican or Democrat, if we allow that to continue. We \nignore the real problems of this Nation when we allow that.\n  We are going to devote our time in the Senate to an artificially \ntruncated debate of proposals to limit corporate liability for Y2K \nproblems because the business lobby wants us to do that. Yet we cannot \nhave a full debate on the needs for a real Patients' Bill of Rights, \nsomething that would affect not a special interest group, but every \nsingle American.\n  The Senate will turn to a bankruptcy bill to help financial \ninstitutions extract additional payments from consumers forced into \nbankruptcy instead of considering a much needed increase in the minimum \nwage.\n  The majority leader has indicated that we will be debated on the \nproposed constitutional amendment to cut back on the first amendment \nfor the first time in our history to make a symbolic statement against \nflag burning, because that will be popular. Mr. President, no flags \nwere burned at Columbine High School earlier this week, but children \nand a teacher died at Columbine High School. That is the reality.\n  We should start applying ourselves to substance and not symbols in \nthe Senate. Let the reality get past the rhetoric. We all need to \nredouble our efforts to find ways to help parents and State and local \nauthorities on matters of school safety. We need to redouble our \nefforts to help local law enforcement keep our streets safe. After 3 \nyears in which we have missed opportunity after opportunity to \ncooperate in a bipartisan way on these matters, it is long past time to \nput partisanship aside and work together with the administration to \nmake progress in prevention and security that remains so desperately \nneeded.\n\n  We are all Americans in this--not Republicans and Democrats. Let's \nset partisanship aside for a change. How many Senators, as parents, \nworry when our children go to school? How many of the staff and the \nvisitors in our galleries have children who go to school and now are \nterrified and worried and are almost afraid to hear the phone ring?\n  We all know the Federal Government and Federal law cannot solve the \nproblem of school violence or local crime, but we should at least help \nor make help available. I know the Federal Government has been \nproviding assistance in Littleton; victims services and counselors are \nbeing provided. I am proud of the efforts that have been made by the \nOffice for Victims of Crime in coordination with States and local \nassistance providers. A special reserve fund from my 1996 amendment to \nthe Victims of Crime Act is available to help. These are concrete \ninitiatives, not symbolic things.\n  I want to praise President Clinton for having convened the October \n1998 White House Conference on School Safety, and those people, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, who joined with him. We are working \nwith him to provide additional community police and school resource \nofficers across the country. In addition, the Attorney General, the \nSecretary of Education, and the Surgeon General are all working on \nadditional initiatives.\n  Over the last several years, I have sponsored legislation in this \narea with Senator Biden, Senator Kennedy, Senator Daschle, Senator \nBingaman and a number of others. A lot of that legislation has never \neven been considered in our committee, although we were able to \nincorporate pieces of it in measures that have been enacted. We \nreintroduced, again, on the first legislative day of the session one of \nthe Democratic priorities, S. 9, the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and \nSecure Borders Act of 1999, which builds on the successful programs we \nimplemented in the 1994 crime law, but also addresses emerging crime \nproblems.\n  It is a comprehensive and realistic bill. We tried to avoid the easy \nrhetoric about crime that some have to offer in this crucial area. \nInstead, we put in legislation that might make a difference. The Safe \nSchools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act targets violent crime in \nour schools, it reforms the juvenile justice system, combats gang \nviolence, cracks down on the sale and use of illegal drugs, enhances \nthe rights of crime victims, and provides meaningful assistance to law \nenforcement officers.\n  Title I deals with proposals for combating violence in the schools \nand punishing juvenile crime. It gives technical assistance to the \nschools, reforms the juvenile justice system, and assists States for \nprosecuting juvenile offenders, but it also protects children from \nviolence, including violence from the misuse of guns.\n  It includes Senator Bingaman's proposal for a School Security \nTechnology Center, an inventive proposal building upon expertise from \nthe Sandia National Labs. There are a lot of very real things in it.\n  It is short on rhetoric. It is strong on reality. This is a law that \ncould work. It could be done without federalizing juvenile offenses. It \nfollows what many from the Chief Justice on through have said is \nimportant.\n  Our bill contains important initiatives to protect children from \nviolence, including violence resulting from the misuse of guns. \nAmericans want concrete proposals to reduce the risk of such incidents \nrecurring. At the same time, we must preserve adults' rights to use \nguns for legitimate purposes, such as home protection, hunting and for \nsport. The bill imposes a prospective gun ban for juveniles convicted \nor adjudicated delinquent for violent crimes. It also require \nrevocation of a firearms dealer's license for failing to have secure \ngun storage or safety devices available for sale with firearms. The \nbill enhances the penalty for the violation of certain firearm laws \ninvolving juveniles. In addition, the bill authorizes competitive grant \nprograms for the establishment of juvenile gun courts and youth \nviolence courts.\n  The bill would also make important reforms to the federal juvenile \nsystem, without federalizing run-of-the-mill juvenile offenses or \nignoring the traditional prerogative of the States to handle the bulk \nof juvenile crime. One of the significant flaws in the Republican \njuvenile crime bills last year was that it would have--in the words of \nChief Justice Rehnquist--``eviscerate[d] this traditional deference to \nstate prosecutions, thereby increasing substantially the potential \nworkload of the federal judiciary.'' The Chief Justice has repeatedly \nraised concerns about ``federalizing'' more crimes. The Democratic \nproposals for reform of the Federal juvenile justice system heed this \nsound advice and respect our Federal system.\n  Our bill authorizes grants to the States for incarcerating violent \nand chronic juvenile offenders (with each qualifying State getting at \nleast one percent of available funds), and provides graduated \nsanctions, reimburses States for the cost of incarcerating juvenile \nalien offenders, and establishes a pilot program to replicate \nsuccessful juvenile crime reduction strategies.\n  Also directly relevant is Title IV of the bill, which includes a \nnumber of prevention programs that are critical to further reducing \njuvenile crime. These programs include grants to\n\n[[Page S4104]]\n\nyouth organizations and ``Say No to Drugs'' Community Centers, as well \nas reauthorization of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, Anti-Drug \nAbuse Programs and Local Delinquency Prevention Programs. Additional \nsections include a program to establish a competitive grant program to \nreduce truancy, with priority given to efforts to replicate successful \nprograms.\n  The bill would also reauthorize the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention Act (JJDPA) in a similar fashion to H.R. 1818, a bill passed \nby the House with strong bipartisan support in the last Congress. This \nsection creates a new juvenile justice block grant program and retains \nthe four core protections for youth in the juvenile justice system, \nwhile adopting greater flexibility for rural areas.\n  Last year, the Senate Republicans tried to gut these core protections \nin their juvenile crime bill, S. 10. This Democratic crime bill puts \nideology aside, and follows the advice of numerous child advocacy \nexperts--including the Children's Defense Fund, National Collaboration \nfor Youth, Youth Law Center and National Network for Youth--who believe \nthese key protections must be preserved in order to protect juveniles \nwho have been arrested or detained. These core protections ensure that \njuveniles are not housed with adults, do not have verbal or physical \ncontact with adult inmates, and any disproportionate confinement of \nminority youth is addressed by the States. If these protections are \nabolished, many more youth may end up committing suicide or being \nreleased with serious physical or emotional scars.\n  I previously described the other titles, programs and initiatives of \nthe Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act when we \nintroduced it. It is a comprehensive and realistic set of proposals for \nkeeping our schools safe, our streets safe, our citizens safe when they \ngo abroad, and our borders secure. I look forward to working on a \nbipartisan basis for passage of as much of this bill as possible during \nthe 106th Congress and to working with the Administration, with the \nDepartment of Justice and with the Department of Education to do what \nwe can to be helpful in the continuing school safety crisis.\n  Why I am here today is to join with the Democratic leader in his call \nfor a ``thoughtful discussion about how to shape a comprehensive \nnational response to the problem of violence in our schools and in our \ncommunities.'' I commend him for including the Safe Schools, Safe \nStreets, and Secure Borders Act on the priority list that he sent to \nthe majority leader on Monday.\n  From a personal observation, I recall one time when my children were \nyoung, they were in grade school, and I was a prosecutor. Without going \ninto all of the details, a very credible threat was made against me and \nmy family. In fact, one that, had the person been able to carry it out \nbefore being apprehended, all of us would have died. I recall during \nthat time, when the police were coming to me and saying, we will set up \nthis cordon of armed police officers around you, my only concern, and \nthe natural concern of any parent, was for my children; I recall even \ntoday the terror I felt in my heart and soul.\n  I remember today, almost 30 years later, how I felt until I knew they \nwere safe. They were young children. They saw the police officers \ncoming to school to pick them up and for them it was a lark, they were \ngetting out of school early. For their mother and me, it was a matter \nof some great concern.\n  Think how parents around this country feel today when they kiss their \nchildren goodbye in the morning, and virtually all of them will come \nback safely, but every parent has to have in his or her soul the \nthought, what if they don't come back? How does a parent live through \nthis? How do the other students ever go back to a school where this has \nhappened? What about our young people themselves, when they read about \nthis or see this and wonder are they next?\n  There are two areas of great violence in the world today. One we see \nunfolding in the former Yugoslavia, where the United States and our \nNATO allies are trying to stop a person who is exercising war crimes \nthat we have not seen in that part of the world since the time of \nHitler. We see the people who are suffering there. Yet some respond by \nseeing who can get out the best sound.\n  Then we see this in Mississippi, Kentucky, Arkansas, Pennsylvania, \nTennessee, Oregon and Colorado--enough variety of States to tell every \none of us that our own State and our own community is not immune.\n  We are still tempted to dwell on symbols. Symbols do not stop this; \nsubstance does. It is not symbolic to set up programs that we know will \nwork, that will allow teachers and parents and police and others to \nwork with students to stop something from happening. That is the key. \nIt is not to respond afterward--and we will respond. We are sending out \ncounselors and investigators and everybody else to Colorado now. How \nmuch better, though, if we could respond before it happens.\n  So I ask Senators when they go home this weekend, pause and think: Do \nwe help solve the problems of Littleton, CO, or the problems of Kosovo, \nor the problems that face our great Nation, by continuing heavy, \ndestructive, unnecessarily partisan actions in the Senate and in the \nother body? Or do we come back together, as we have so many times in \nthe past, Republicans and Democrats alike, admit the United States \nfaces many crises and that we solve them only by working together, not \nin seeking short-term political gain?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first let me commend the Senator from \nVermont for his remarks. As always, they are considered and thoughtful \nand right to the point. His career and legislation has been just the \nsame way. I consider myself, as always, privileged to be here to listen \nto his remarks. I thank the Senator. I also thank the Senator from \nMaine for her courtesy, allowing me to make these brief remarks before \nshe makes hers.\n  Mr. President, as we remain transfixed and horrified by the images of \nLittleton, as we listen to the stories of the survivors and hear the \nsobs of the families of the victims, we can feel that America is \nlooking to Congress to do something to keep lethal weapons out of the \nhands of kids. This morning I watched television as did millions of \nAmericans. My eyes filled with tears, listening to the families of the \nstudents talk about their ideal, and to hear them ask what can be done. \nSince time began, there have been troubled teenagers. We have always \nsought to help them through their families, through spiritual \nleadership, through schools. That is nothing new. But what is new today \nis that it is far too easy for a disturbed young person to get his \nhands on a gun or a bomb and channel his anger into carnage.\n  Mr. President, 25 years ago all an angry, troubled teenager had was \nhis fists. Scores of students were not killed when that troubled boy \nvented his rage. Today we live in a different world. It is no \ncoincidence that the tragedies that we have heard and read about \nthroughout the last year did not occur 10, 15, and 20 years ago with \nthis kind of horror, with this kind of frequency.\n  In Littleton, we do not know how these two teenagers managed to get \ntheir guns. We don't know if they took the guns from their parents or \nstole them from a neighbor. We don't know if they bought them at a gun \nshow or if they bought their guns off the Internet, although certainly \nthey were immersed in a computer fantasy world, and there are dozens of \nweb sites that offer guns to anyone, anywhere, no questions asked.\n  We know that gun control alone is not the only solution. We need \nbetter counseling in the schools. We have to be more vigilant at \nidentifying and condemning hate groups in schools. But, my colleagues, \nlet us not kid ourselves. It is not possible to confront the epidemic \nof violence in our schools without dealing with guns.\n  Yesterday there was a shift in the gun debate that I have never seen \nbefore in my career in Congress, and it gives me a glimmer of hope that \nmaybe we can do something to make schools safer. Yesterday, pro-gun \nlawmakers of Colorado, Florida, and Illinois each withdrew their \nlegislation which would have made it easier for people in those States \nto buy and/or carry firearms.\n  They did it because of Littleton. They did it because they know that \nthe\n\n[[Page S4105]]\n\neasy availability of guns is part of the problem. They put a stop to \ntheir own legislation.\n  Yesterday, the National Rifle Association scaled back its annual \nconvention, which is to be held in 2 weeks. It will not admit it, but \nthe NRA did it because of Littleton. It will not admit that it is \nsimple common sense that rational gun control equals fewer Littletons, \nbut in its collective heart, the NRA knows that that is true.\n  So in a small but significant way, the NRA has changed. Now we have \nto change. Congress has to wake up. America's mothers and fathers are \nlooking to us. To my Democratic and Republican colleagues, many of whom \nhave traditionally opposed gun restrictions, we can pass reasonable, \ntargeted, measured laws that make guns safer and keep them away from \nkids but still respect people's right to bear arms.\n  I would like to mention several of these modest measures, measures \nthat will make a great deal of difference and have little or no impact \non the people in your State who hunt, who target shoot, who own guns \nfor sport, collection, or protection.\n  We should pass the parts of either the Kennedy or the Durbin \nlegislation which require adults to safely store their handguns and \nrifles in their homes. Nearly every day, some kid takes their parent's \ngun and does something horrible with it. Why? Because half the families \nwho own guns do not lock them away or leave the gun unloaded. We can \nchange that, and we should change that. No one will be harmed, and no \none will be inconvenienced.\n  We have to ban the unlicensed sale of guns on the Internet. It is \nnumbing what a kid can buy simply by going on line and searching gun \nweb sites--handguns, semiautomatic weapons, ammunition feeders; \neverything is available with no questions asked. This morning, a parent \ncame up to me and said he asked his son how kids get guns. His son \nanswered, without a blink of the eye: ``On the Internet.''\n  I have a bill which will stop that. It will have no effect on law-\nabiding gun owners or licensed gun dealers. Ask yourself: Who needs to \nbuy a gun with no questions asked? The answer is only two groups--kids \nand criminals. Let's pass this bill.\n  We should also bring public and private dollars together to develop \nsmart guns. These are guns which contain a device that permits only the \nowner to fire the weapon. Imagine a gun that is useless when it is \nstolen, taken without authorization, or sold on the black market. It \ncan be done. The technology is available. I will talk more in the next \nweek about ways we can bring gun makers and the military together to \ndevelop a gun that is safe. This could transform the gun industry and \nmake us all rest easier.\n  Finally, and in the meantime, let's make a strong, secure trigger-\nlock requirement on all guns. Every car has a seat belt; every gun \nshould have a lock.\n  Mr. President, each of these measures will make schools, homes, and \nneighborhoods safer without denying a single law-abiding citizen the \nright to buy the gun of their choice. How can anyone oppose that?\n  In conclusion, every time we tune in and see another group of \ninnocent children fleeing from school, we pray that it will be the last \ntime. We can help make our prayers come true. America is waiting for us \nto do what is right and necessary to keep guns out of the hands of \nkids. Let's not let them down.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, we are approaching the tenth anniversary \nof the birth of the reformulated gasoline (RFG) program. This \ninitiative, enacted in 1990 as part of the Clean Air Act Amendments, \nestablished strict fuel quality standards for the nation's most \npolluted cities in order to reduce air pollution. It includes a minimum \noxygen content requirement, which was intended to provide an \nopportunity for America to reduce its dependence on foreign oil through \nthe use of domestically produced ethanol and MTBE.\n  Reformulated gasoline was introduced in the American marketplace in \n1995. Today it accounts for approximately one-third of all gasoline \nsold in this country.\n  Congress had several objectives in establishing the RFG program: (1) \nto substantially reduce harmful air pollutants caused by fuel-related \nemissions, especially ground level ozone and air toxics; (2) to reduce \nimports of crude oil and petroleum products, especially those from \nunstable regions like the Middle East; and (3) to stimulate investment \nin domestic ethanol and ether plants, thus creating jobs and adding \nvalue to grains and other domestic raw materials.\n  The first objective has been not only met, it has been exceeded. In \nfact, EPA Administrator Carol Browner has called the RFG program ``the \nmost successful air pollution reduction program since the phase-out of \nlead in gasoline.'' The other two objectives also have been met, though \nnot to the extent that many of us had hoped.\n  A major impediment to full realization of the potential of the RFG \nprogram has been the importation of massive volumes of MTBE, much of it \nsubsidized by the Saudi Arabian government, into the United States. \nDomestic ethanol and MTBE producers have been harmed, and American \nplants have not been built, largely due to the influx of subsidized \nproduct from offshore that makes potential investors unwilling to \ncommit capital to U.S. ethanol and ether plants.\n  The winners in this situation are the Saudi government and a few \nmulti-national corporations. The losers are U.S. corn farmers, butane \nsuppliers and plant workers as well as American consumers who remain \npotential hostages to foreign energy suppliers.\n  Mr. President, the benefits of the RFG program have been substantial. \nHowever, as we prepare to enter Phase II of the program, it is \nincumbent upon policymakers to reflect upon whether it is achieving its \npotential in terms of air quality improvements and oil import \nreductions.\n  It seems clear that the answer to the first question is ``yes.'' RFG \nis generating substantial air quality benefits and even exceeding the \npredictions that many had made when the original rules were written.\n  The answer to the second question, however, is a resounding ``no.'' \nImports of Saudi Arabian MTBE are growing, and the exclusionary effect \nof unfairly traded MTBE imports on ethanol usage in key markets such as \nCalifornia has become increasingly problematic.\n  On April 1, 1999, the International Trade Commission (ITC) held a \npublic hearing on its Investigation No. 332-404, concerning MTBE \nimports and their impact on the domestic oxygenate industry. This \ninquiry is timely and important. It will cut through the rhetoric, \nprovide policymakers with a clear picture of the nature and effect of \nMTBE imports on domestic production and U.S. energy security, and set a \nfactual foundation for discussion of what, if anything, should be done \nabout this situation.\n  With those objectives in mind, I commend to my colleagues attention \nthe testimony presented before the ITC by Bob Dinneen, Legislative \nDirector of the Renewable Fuels Association, and Todd Sneller, \nExecutive Director of the Nebraska Ethanol Board, that underscores the \ndamage that has been done by unfairly traded MTBE imports. Mr. Dinneen \nand Mr. Sneller present cogent analyses of the impact that increasing \nvolumes of heavily subsidized MTBE are having on the domestic \noxygenates industry. Their testimony should be a warning to us all.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the testimony of Mr. Dinneen and Mr. \nSneller be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Testimony of Bob Dinneen, Legislative Director, Renewable Fuels \n                              Association\n\n       Mr. Chairman and members of the Commission, on behalf of \n     the members of the Renewable Fuels Association, the national \n     trade association for the domestic ethanol industry, I want \n     to thank you for the opportunity to provide comments today on \n     the Commission's investigation of MTBE. Ethanol and MTBE are \n     competitive additives to gasoline that increase octane and \n     oxygen to\n\n[[Page S4106]]\n\n     fuels, resulting in dramatically reduced emissions. As such, \n     the domestic ethanol industry is directly and negatively \n     impacted by the importation of subsidized MTBE, and we \n     commend the Commission's decision to investigate this issue.\n       Ethanol is a renewable fuel produced from corn and other \n     agricultural feedstocks. Today, ethanol is the third largest \n     user of corn, behind only feed and export markets. Virtually \n     all ethanol consumed in the U.S. is produced domestically. \n     Last year, the U.S. ethanol industry processed approximately \n     560 million bushels of grain into 1.4 billion gallons of fuel \n     ethanol at 53 plants located in 20 states. A report completed \n     for the Midwestern Governors' Conference, The Economic Impact \n     of the Demand for Ethanol, concludes that the ethanol \n     industry: increases net farm income more than $4.5 billion; \n     boosts total employment by 195,000 jobs; improves the balance \n     of trade over $2 billion; adds over $450 million to state tax \n     receipts; and results in a net savings to the Federal budget \n     of more than $3.5 billion.\n       Background: Since the twin oil supply shortages and price \n     shocks of the 1970's, promoting increased energy security has \n     been a national priority. Toward that end, beginning with the \n     National Energy Security Act of 1979, the Congress has worked \n     to stimulate the production and use of domestically-produced \n     alternative fuels. As noted by the U.S. Senate Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources:\n       ``Increased dependence on oil imports means, inevitably, \n     increased dependence on the nations of the Persian Gulf. The \n     potential for economic disruption and war in the event of \n     interruptions in Persian Gulf supplies will increase...\n       ``If the projected United States dependence on Persian Gulf \n     oil materializes, not only will the probability of economic \n     disruption and war increase, but policies available to the \n     United States to deal with political turmoil in the world, \n     including the Mideast, will be affected.''--S. Rep. No. 72, \n     102nd Cong., 1st Sess. at p. 204.\n       In 1990, the Congress extended its commitment to the \n     development of domestic energy resources by passing the \n     Daschle/Dole amendment to the Clean Air Act requiring \n     refiners to add certain levels of oxygen to new reformulated \n     gasolines. A critical rationale for the oxygen requirement \n     was the energy security benefits attributable to the \n     increased use of ethanol and other domestically-produced \n     oxygenates. At the time, more than 400,000 troops were \n     stationed in the Persian Gulf, in large part to protect the \n     free flow of oil from the Mideast. The U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency estimated the oxygen requirements of the \n     Clean Air Act would reduce energy imports by 500,000 to \n     800,000 barrels per day. Consider these statements by \n     proponents of the RFG program:\n       ``I support this amendment because it will reduce the toxic \n     aromatics currently used to boost octane in gasoline; it will \n     reduce ozone-forming automobile emissions; it will begin to \n     reduce our dependence on imported oil; and it will enhance \n     rural and farm economies. [136 Cong. Rec. S3522 (Statement of \n     Senator Kent Conrad)(daily ed. March 29, 1990)]\n       ``The second thing we ought to recognize is this is the \n     only part of the bill that helps our extraordinary dependence \n     on imported oil.'' [136 Cong. Rec. S3519 (Statement of \n     Senator Tim Wirth)(daily ed. March 29, 1990)]\n       But the promise of increased market opportunities for \n     ethanol in the RFG program has been undermined by the \n     unanticipated and rising levels, of MTBE imports. EPA data \n     shows that despite the intention that ethanol market \n     opportunities be significantly expanded in RFG, ethanol has \n     actually garnered just 12% of the RFG market, primarily in \n     Chicago and Milwaukee. In coastal RFG markets where MTBE is \n     readily imported, ethanol has virtually no market \n     penetration.\n       At the same time, the RFG program has proven a boon to \n     imported MTBE. MTBE imports have risen from just 30 million \n     gallons in 1990 to more than 1.4 billion gallons in 1998. \n     Moreover, the majority of MTBE imports are from Saudi Arabia \n     and other OPEC countries. In 1997, 70% of U.S. imports of \n     MTBE came from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries. Imports \n     now represent a third of U.S. MTBE consumption, and is \n     roughly equal to U.S. merchant production.\n       To respond to these alarming levels of MTBE imports, \n     particularly from Saudi Arabia Senate Democratic Leader Tom \n     Daschle (SD) has introduced legislation that would require \n     the Commerce Department to investigate, under Section 702 of \n     the Tariff Act of 1930, whether Saudi Arabia has provided \n     unfair subsidies to its exporters of MTBE, giving them an \n     unfair market advantage in the U.S. oxygenate market. If it \n     is determined to be so, S. 2391 would impose an import fee \n     large enough to offset the subsidiaries. The RFA supporters \n     S. 2391, as MTBE imports have increased U.S. dependence on \n     foreign supplies at the expense of domestic oxygenate \n     producers.\n       The following is a break-down of 1998 MTBE production and \n     imports:\n\n                          1998 MTBE PRODUCTION\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           Annual gals\n               Source                 Production  b/d       (billion)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMerchant Plants....................  103,000 b/d......  1.5\nCaptive Plants \\1\\.................  102,000 b/d......  1.5\nImports............................  90,000 b/d         1.4\n      Total........................  295,000 b/d......  4.4\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ A captive plant refers to MTBE produced at refineries, used by those\n  refineries for octane trimming and is not available for merchant\n  oxygenate or octane markets.\n \nSource: Energy Information Administration.\n\n       In the absence of such precipitous MTBE import level, the \n     domestic ethanol industry would have been able to double in \n     size--creating more domestic jobs, providing increased rural \n     economic development and further enhancing our balance of \n     trade.\n\n\n                            MTBE Duty Rates\n\n       An important issue for the Commission to consider is the \n     variable duty rates paid on MTBE. There are currently three \n     classifications of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) under \n     which MTBE may be imported: as a motor fuel (2710.00.15); as \n     MTBE (2909.19.14); or as a gasoline additive (3811.90.00). \n     Each classification has a different duty rate. Current HTS \n     duty rates for each classification are as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                       HTS\n            Product               classification    General rate of duty\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMotor Fuel (RFG)..............         2710.00.15  52.5 cents/bb1 (1,25\n                                                    cents/gal).\nMTBE..........................         2909.19.14  5.5% ad valorem\n                                                    (approx. 5 cents/\n                                                    gal).\nGasoline Additives............         3811.90.00  2.2 cents/kg & 10.8%\n                                                    ad valorem (approx.\n                                                    11.6 cents/gal) \\1\\.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Assumes $0.90 cost and .74 kg. weight of MTBE.\n\n       It is becoming clear the MTBE is increasingly being \n     imported under the HTS classification for motor fuel. \n     According to the Energy Information Administration, 66,000 b/\n     d of MTBE was imported last year. But an additional 24,000 b/\n     d of MTBE was imported in finished RFG. (Assumes MTBE at 11% \n     by volume to meet federal 2.0 wt.% oxygen requirement in \n     RFG.) This compares to 74,000 b/d as MTBE and 18,000 b/d as \n     RFG in 1997. Thus, the trend is to import more MTBE as \n     finished RFG, and pay the reduced duty. Moreover, according \n     to DeWitt & Company, an MTBE industry trade publication and \n     research group, the actual amount of MTBE imported in \n     finished gasoline could be much higher. That is possible \n     because importers could overblend MTBE for shipment and blend \n     down to meet U.S. RFG oxygen specifications at the gasoline \n     terminal. It is, in effect, a means of circumventing the duty \n     on MTBE. It should be stopped.\n\n                              MTBE IMPORTS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               MTBE in RFG\n             Year                   MTBE      (assumes 11%      Total\n                                               by volume)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1997..........................  74,000 b/d..  18,000 b/d +  92,000 b/d +\n1998..........................  66,000 b/d +  24,000 b/d +  90,000 b/d +\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Thus, under current law refiners importing MTBE in RFG are \n     short-changing the Treasury at least $16.5 million annually \n     (24,000 x $0.90 x .05 x 42 [42 gallons/barrel] x 365) by \n     importing MTBE under the motor fuel classification.\n\n              OXYGENATE TYPE ANALYSIS 1997 RFG SURVEY DATA\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              Percent of samples with majority of oxygen\n                                               from \\1\\\n            Area             -------------------------------------------\n                                                                 Combo/\n                                MTBE     Ethanol   ETBE   TAME    other\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\2\\--\nAtlantic City, NJ...........     97.47      1.27   0.00   1.27      0.00\nBaltimore, MD...............     98.94      0.00   0.00   1.06      0.00\nBoston-Worcester, MA........     95.93      1.74   0.00   2.33      0.00\nChicago-Lake Co., IL, Gary,       5.84     94.16   0.00   0.00      0.00\n IN.........................\nDallas-Fort Worth, TX.......    100.00      0.00   0.00   0.00      0.00\nHartford, CT................     98.44      1.56   0.00   0.00      0.00\nHouston-Galveston, TX.......     92.73      0.00   0.00   6.57      0.69\nLos Angeles, CA.............    100.00      0.00   0.00   0.00      0.00\nLouisville, KY..............     74.75     25.25   0.00   0.00      0.00\nManchester, NH..............    100.00      0.00   0.00   0.00      0.00\nMilwaukee-Racine, WI........      4.60     95.40   0.00   0.00      0.00\nNY-NJ-Long Is.-CT...........     98.93      1.07   0.00   0.00      0.00\nNorfolk-Virginia Beach, VA..    100.00      0.00   0.00   0.00      0.00\nPhila.-Wilm, DE-Trenton, NJ.     98.69      0.65   0.00   0.98      0.00\nPhoenix, AZ.................     49.18     50.82   0.00   0.00      0.00\nPortland, ME................    100.00      0.00   0.00   0.00      0.00\nPoughkeepsie, NY............     97.76      2.24   0.00   0.00      0.00\nRhode Island................     98.82      1.18   0.00   0.00      0.00\nRichmond, VA................    100.00      0.00   0.00   0.00      0.00\nSacramento, CA..............    100.00      0.00   0.00   0.00      0.00\nSan Diego, CA...............    100.00      0.00   0.00   0.00      0.00\nSpringfield-MA..............     98.20      1.80   0.00   0.00      0.00\nWashington, D.C. area.......     98.07      0.00   0.00   1.54      0.39\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ RFG Survey samples taken at retail gasoline stations.

Sneller, Administrator, Nebraska Ethanol \n                                 Board\n\n\n                               background\n\n       The Nebraska Ethanol Board is a state agency established in \n     1971 by Nebraska statute. The board is directed to assist the \n     private sector in establishing ethanol production facilities; \n     promote air quality improvement programs; establish marketing \n     procedures for ethanol based fuels; and sponsor research \n     related to the use of ethanol fuels.\n       In 1988 the board entered into an agreement for research \n     and development of ethanol based ethers and fuels containing \n     combinations of alcohol/ether mixtures. Partnership in this \n     effort was with American Eagle Fuels (AEF), a private \n     corporation. The board and AEF expended more than $2 million \n     to develop a small commercial scale facility capable of \n     producing ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE). ETBE was \n     produced at the facility near Lincoln, Nebraska and small \n     quantities of the product were sold in Japan, Europe and the \n     United States for experimental purposes. At the same time, \n     the board engaged in an extensive cooperative testing program \n     with Sun Refining Company and other parties to examine the \n     properties of ethanol/ether combinations. This work was \n     intended to form the basis for an application to the U.S. EPA \n     that would seek approval for higher concentrations of \n     ethanol/ether mixtures to be blended in gasoline for \n     commercial sale.\n       The board's investment in research and development of ETBE \n     was based on the expectation that ethanol and ETBE would play \n     a significant role in oxygenated and reformulated fuel \n     programs required under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. \n     Discussions during debate on CAA amendments, and recorded \n     floor debate in the Senate, clearly reflect the expectation \n     that ethanol and ETBE use would increase significantly as a \n     result of the oxygenate requirements included among the 1990 \n     amendments to the Act.\n\n\n                             impact of mtbe\n\n       Despite expectations that ethanol and ETBE would capture a \n     significant share of the oxygenated fuel market, experience \n     in the marketplace differed significantly from early \n     expectations. In one of the first oxygenated fuel markets, \n     the Colorado Front Range, the oxygenate most often used at \n     the outset of the Colorado program was MTBE. In the initial \n     years of the program, MTBE use constituted as much as 95% of \n     the oxygenated fuel sold during the carbon monoxide abatement \n     program. This occurred despite the fact that ethanol could \n     easily be transported by rail and truck from Nebraska and \n     other locations at rates competitive with gasoline. In other \n     oxygenated fuel program areas in the Midwest, such as \n     Milwaukee, MTBE quickly captured the market for oxygenated \n     gasoline despite the proximity of such areas to large ethanol \n     production facilities. In oxygenated fuel program areas \n     outside the Midwest, the aggressive marketing of low priced \n     MTBE allowed virtual market control. Price was clearly a key \n     and MTBE was available at rates equal to or below the cost of \n     gasoline.\n       The experience in reformulated gasoline market areas was \n     similar to the carbon monoxide abatement program. A review of \n     U.S. EPA market surveys of RFG areas for 1995-97 clearly \n     illustrates the trend toward MTBE. Early surveys show modest \n     use of ethanol in a few metropolitan areas and nominal use of \n     ETBE in fewer areas. However, the data show a clear trend \n     toward MTBE use following he first year of the federal RFG \n     program. The trend generally continues, with few exceptions, \n     in 1999.\n       The technical attributes of ETBE are well documented. \n     Compared to MTBE, ETBE is superior in virtually all areas \n     except price. ETBE, in the opinion of many refiners and auto \n     makers, is the perfect oxygenate because ``it acts like \n     gasoline''. Octane and distillation properties, low vapor \n     pressure characteristics, and ability to reduce aromatic and \n     sulfur levels while maintaining other performance qualities \n     of gasoline make ETBE an excellent component for cleaner \n     burning gasoline. However, economics in the highly \n     competitive world of petroleum refining and marketing is the \n     key criteria in most oxygenate purchasing transactions. MTBE \n     has a distinct advantage in pricing due, in large part, to \n     the low cost of methanol.\n       Methanol and MTBE are global commodities and as such \n     respond to pricing strategies of the largest producers of \n     these products. The public announcement of King Fahd's 1992 \n     royal decree was clearly a confirmation that a significant \n     incentive was being instituted in the pricing of methanol and \n     related components of MTBE. This incentive has been \n     calculated to provide raw material price discounts at levels \n     thirty per cent below world prices. The impact of this decree \n     has been apparent over the past seven years. MTBE production \n     from Saudi Arabian plants has increased rapidly and steadily, \n     to nearly 100,000 barrels per day according to published \n     reports. That volume constitutes nearly half of total U.S. \n     MTBE demand. Due to this low cost, made possible by the Saudi \n     Arabian subsidy, a significant volume of the MTBE used in the \n     U.S. today is imported directly or indirectly from plants in \n     Saudi Arabia. As a result, ETBE cannot possibly be \n     competitive with this product on a cost basis, despite the \n     obvious technical advantages of ETBE. In addition, domestic \n     MTBE producers are keenly aware of this pricing differential \n     and the adverse impact it has on domestic supply and price.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       The result of the Saudi Arabian subsidy is clear. Domestic \n     ethanol and MTBE producers are disadvantaged and oxygenates \n     from domestic production facilities are often displaced by \n     low cost MTBE imports from Saudi Arabia. The intent of \n     Congress has been thwarted by imported MTBE use in the \n     oxygenate programs which were intended to stimulate a \n     domestic industry. U.S. grain producers who were told of the \n     predictions for increased corn and grain sorghum use via \n     ethanol and ETBE plants have not seen that domestic market \n     materialize in the substantial way predicted in 1990. The \n     U.S. balance of trade, already reeling from a high level of \n     imported petroleum products, is further exacerbated by \n     increased imports of MTBE from off shore plants. Oxygenate \n     pricing, pegged to the lower cost MTBE imports from Saudi \n     Arabia, reduces revenue and return on investment of domestic \n     oxygenate producers, thereby discouraging investment in new \n     or expanded plants in the United States. As a result, the \n     oxygenated fuel provisions of the Clean Air Act are not \n     generating domestic economic benefits to the extent possible. \n     The mechanism generating these adverse impacts, instituted \n     following the 1992 royal decree, must be removed or offset to \n     protect domestic economic interests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/22/senate-section/article/S4107-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 84th anniversary \nof the Armenian Genocide.\n  This weekend, members of Armenian communities around the world will \ngather together to remember the spring morning of April 24, 1915, when \nthe Ottoman Empire and the successor Turkish nationalist regime began a \nbrutal policy of deportation and murder. Over the next eight years, 1.5 \nmillion Armenians would be massacred at the hands of the Turks and \nanother 500,000 would have their property confiscated and be driven \nfrom their homeland.\n  Despite having already undergone such terrible persecution and \nhardship, the people of the Armenian Republic still suffer today. The \npeace talks have regrettably made little progress toward the resolution \nof the Karabagh conflict. Turkey continues to blockade humanitarian aid \nto Armenia.\n  However, the Armenian people look hopefully to the future. Their \nquest for peace and democracy continues to inspire people around the \nworld. On May 30th, Armenia will again hold democratic elections. \nArmenians who have emigrated to other countries, especially those in my \nhome state of Rhode Island, bring their traditions with them. They \nenrich the culture and contribute much to the society of their new \nhomelands.\n  Although each year's commemoration of the Armenian genocide is \nimportant, I believe this year's observance is particularly \nsignificant--because of the crisis in Kosovo. Each night the television \nshows images of hundreds of thousands of refugees forced from their \nhomes and each morning the paper is filled with stories of innocent \ncivilians robbed and killed. These stories and images are \nheartwrenching--but the people of Kosovo have not been abandoned. The \nnineteen nations of NATO are united in their resolve that another \ngenocide will not be tolerated.\n\n[[Page S4108]]\n\n  One of the reasons the world could not stand idly by watching events \nunfold in the Balkans is because of commemorations like the observance \nof the Armenian Genocide. We must stand as witnesses to protect those \nwho are persecuted because they are different. We must remain vigilant \nas long as hate and intolerance exist in our world.\n  Menk panav chenk mornar.

Mr. President, each year on April 24 many of us in \nCongress pause to remember the tragedy of the Armenian Genocide. On \nthat date in 1915, more than 200 Armenian religious, political and \nintellectual leaders were arrested in Constantinople--now Istanbul--and \nkilled, marking the beginning of an organized campaign to eliminate the \nArmenian presence from the Ottoman Empire. This brutal campaign would \nresult in the massacre of a million and a half Armenian men, women and \nchildren.\n  Thousands of Armenians were subjected to torture, deportation, \nslavery and murder. More than 500,000 were removed from their homes and \nsent on forced death marches through the deserts of Syria. This dark \ntime is among the saddest chapters in the history of man.\n  But Armenians are strong people and their dream of freedom did not \ndie. More than seventy years after the genocide, the new Republic of \nArmenia was born as the Soviet Union crumbled. Today, we pay tribute to \nthe courage and strength of a people who would not know defeat.\n  Yet, independence has not meant an end to their struggle. There are \nstill those who question the reality of the Armenian slaughter. There \nare those who have failed to recognize its very existence. We must not \nallow the horror of the Armenian genocide to be either diminished or \ndenied.\n  Genocide is the worst of all crimes against humanity. As indications \nof genocide arise in Kosovo, it is especially important to remember \nthose who lost their lives in the first genocide of this century. We \nmust never forget the victims of the Armenian Genocide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/22/senate-section/article/S4108-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING CARL LINDNER\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

He came from a modest background. He started out delivering \nmilk--and ended up owning an ice cream company. And many other \ncompanies besides!\n  He was born in Dayton, Ohio, on April 22, 1919. He grew up in the \nsmall town of Norwood, in Hamilton County. And he brought the values he \nlearned there to the creation of a huge business empire--United Dairy \nFarmers, American Financial Corporation, Chiquita Brands, Penn Central \nCorporation, Great American Communications Company.\n  And throughout all of this, Carl Lindner remains today a kind, \nunassuming family man--with the values of a businessman beloved by his \nfriends in a small town. A man who cares about others--and about the \nwelfare of his whole community.\n  It has been said that just about everybody who grows up in southwest \nOhio spends at least some time working for one of Carl Lindner's \ncompanies. He is certainly one of the key employers in the entire \nTristate area, if not the country.\n  But he doesn't just help people by employing them. He is also one of \nthe most generous philanthropists in America. He is a quiet man with a \nheart of gold--and he works tirelessly to improve the health and \neducation of the people of Ohio, our nation, and the whole world.\n  Mr. President, America gave Carl Lindner the opportunity to work hard \nand achieve a great deal. And he has given a lot back to this country. \nHis most important contribution--is his example. He proves that the \nmost important thing in a man's life is not how much money he makes, \nbut what he does for people.\n  He is not a man who clamors for attention; this week, he is in the \nheadlines because of his purchase of the Cincinnati Reds. But the real \nCarl Lindner--the one I know--is a man whose most important priority is \nhelping people.\n  To Carl Lindner, on his eightieth birthday, the people of Ohio say \ncongratulations, and a deep and heartfelt thank you from all of us \nwhose lives you have touched!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/22/senate-section/article/S4108-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/22/senate-section/article/S4108-4", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  At 12:10 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 531.

A bill to amend the Emergency Planning and Community Right-\nTo-Know Act of 1986 to cover Federal facilities; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n         federal facilities community right to know act of 1999\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation--\nthe Federal Facilities Community Right-To-Know Act of 1999--which \nprovides that the federal government is held to the same reporting \nrequirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know \nAct (EPCRA) of 1986 as private entities. In 1986, Congress directed the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a national inventory \nto inform the public about chemicals used and released in their \ncommunities. Since enactment of the Emergency Planning and Community \nRight-To-Know Act, manufactures have been required to keep extensive \nrecords on how they use and store hazardous chemicals and report \nreleases of\n\n[[Page S4110]]\n\nhundreds of hazardous chemicals annually. EPA compiles the reported \ninformation into the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI).\n  The Toxic Release Inventory is a publicly available data base \ncontaining specific chemical release and transfer information from \nmanufacturing facilities throughout the United States. The TRI is \nintended to promote planning for chemical emergencies and to provide \ninformation to the public regarding the presence and release of toxic \nand hazardous chemicals in their communities.\n  In August 1993, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12856, which \nrequired Federal facilities to begin submitting TRI reports beginning \nin calendar year 1994 activities. I commend President Clinton for \ntaking this action. However, this executive order does not have the \nforce of law and could be changed by a future Administration. The \nNational Governors Association's policy on federal facilities states \nthat ``Congress should ensure that federal and state `right to know' \nrequirements apply to federal facilities.'' My legislation simply \namends the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act to cover \nfederal facilities. It is important for the Federal government to \nprotect the environment and its citizens from hazardous substances. \nPeople living near federal facilities have the right to know what \nhazardous substances are being released into the environment by these \nfacilities so they can better protect themselves and their children \nfrom these potential threats. It is my strong belief that federal \nfacilities should be treated the same as private entities. My \nlegislation attempts to move us closer towards that goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 859. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require a \nrefund value for certain beverage containers, to provide resources for \nState pollution prevention and recycling programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n      national beverage container reuse and recycling act of 1999\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of Earth Day \nto introduce the National Beverage Container Reuse and Recycling Act of \n1999. I introduce this bill again today because I firmly believe that \ndeposit laws are a common sense, proven method to increase recycling, \nsave energy, create jobs, and decrease the generation of waste and \nproliferation of landfills. Unfortunately, recycling rates for beverage \ncontainers have recently dropped, making this legislation even more \nimportant.\n  The experience of ten states, including Vermont, attest to the \nsuccess of a deposit law or bottle bill as it is commonly called. The \nrecycling rates in these states for aluminum cans is 80 percent, while \nthe overall national average in 1998 was only 55 percent. Cans recycled \nin deposit states accounted for half of all cans recycled in the \ncountry during this period. Although a national recycling rate of 55 \npercent may seem significant, every three seconds, 14,000 aluminum cans \nare discarded as waste.\n  Such waste is rapidly overflowing landfills, washing up on our \nbeaches, and piling up on our roadways. Our country's solid waste \nproblems are very real, and they will continue to haunt us until we \ntake action. The throw-away ethic that has emerged in this country is \nnot insurmountable, and recycling is part of the solution.\n  The concept of a national bottle bill is simple: to provide the \nconsumer with an incentive to return the container for reuse of \nrecycling. Consumers pay a nominal cost per bottle or can when \npurchasing a beverage and are refunded their money when they bring the \ncontainer back either to a retailer or redemption center. Retailers are \npaid a fee for their participation in the program, and any unclaimed \ndeposits are used to finance state environmental programs.\n  Under my proposal, a 10-cent deposit on certain beverage containers \nwould take effect in states which have beverage container recovery \nrates of less than 70 percent, the minimum recovery rate achieved by \nexisting bottle bill states. Labels showing the deposit value would be \naffixed to containers, and retailers would receive a 2-cent fee per \ncontainer for their participation in the program.\n  This legislation I introduce today is consistent with our nation's \nsolid waste management objectives. A national bottle bill would reduce \nsolid waste and litter, save natural resources and energy, and create a \nmuch needed partnership between consumers, industry, and local \ngovernments. I urge my colleagues to join these ten states, including \nVermont, and support a nation-wide bottle deposit law. Because for our \nchildren, the health of the planet may be our most enduring legacy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Mack, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. \n        Levin):\n  S. 860. A bill to require country of origin labeling of perishable \nagricultural commodities imported into the United States and to \nestablish penalties for violations of the labeling requirements; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                 imported produce labeling act of 1999\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould require country of origin labeling of perishable agricultural \ncommodities imported into the United States. I offer the ``Imported \nProduce Labeling Act'' to ensure that Americans know the origin of \nevery orange, banana, tomato, cucumber, and green pepper on display in \nthe grocery store.\n  For two decades, Floridians shopping at their local grocery stores \nhave been able to make educated choices about the food products they \npurchase for their families. In 1979, in my first year as Governor, I \nproudly signed legislation to make country of origin labels commonplace \nin produce sections all over Florida. This labeling requirement has \nproven to be neither complicated nor burdensome for Florida's farmers \nor retailers.\n  Country of origin labeling is not new to the American marketplace. \nFor decades, ``Made In'' labels have been as visible as price tags on \nclothes, toys, television sets, watches, and many other products. It \nmakes little sense that such labels are nowhere to be found in the \nproduce section of grocery stores in the vast majority of states.\n  The current lack of identifying information on produce means that \nAmericans who wish to heed government health warnings about foreign \nproducts or who have justifiable concerns about other nations' labor, \nenvironmental, and agricultural standards are powerless to choose other \nperishables. In fact, according to nationwide surveys, between 74 and \n83 percent of consumers favor mandatory country of origin labeling for \nfresh produce.\n  This is a low-cost, common sense method of informing consumers, as \nretailers will simply be asked to provide this information by means of \na label, stamp, or placard. Implementation of this practice in Florida \nresulted in an estimated cost of only $10 monthly per grocery store, a \nremarkably small price to pay to provide American consumers with the \ninformation they need to make informed produce purchases.\n  In addition, a study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that \ntwenty-six of our key trading partners require country of origin \nlabeling for fresh fruits and vegetables. By adopting this amendment, \nour law will become more consistent with the laws of our global trading \npartners.\n  Consumers have the right to know basic information about the fruits \nand vegetables that they bring home to their families. Congress can \ntake a major step toward achieving this simple goal by passing the \n``Imported Produce Labeling Act,'' thereby restoring American shoppers' \nability to make an informed decision.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Reed, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 861. A bill to designate certain Federal land in the State of Utah \nas wilderness, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n                   AMERICA'S RED ROCK WILDERNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing America's Red Rock \nWilderness Act to protect an important part of our nation's natural \nheritage. America's Red Rock Wilderness Act\n\n[[Page S4111]]\n\ndesignates 9.1 million acres of public land in Utah as wilderness.\n  Passage of America's Red Rock Wilderness Act is essential to protect \na national treasure for future generations of Americans. It provides \nwilderness protection for magnificent canyons, red rock cliffs and rock \nformations unlike any on earth. The lands included in this legislation \ncontain steep slick rock canyons, high cliffs offering spectacular \nvistas of rare rock formations, desert lands, important archeological \nsites, and habitat for rare plant and animal species.\n  The areas designated for wilderness protection in America's Red Rock \nWilderness Act are based on a detailed inventory of lands managed by \nthe Bureau of Land Management conducted by volunteers from the Utah \nWilderness Coalition. Between 1996 and 1998, UWC volunteers and staff \nsurveyed thousands of square miles of BLM land, taking over 50,000 \nphotos and compiling documentation to ensure that these areas meet \nfederal wilderness criteria.\n  As a result of this inventory, an additional 3.4 million acres not \nincluded in earlier Utah wilderness bills have been added to the \nwilderness designations in America's Red Rock Wilderness Act. Most of \nthe areas added to the bill are in the remote Great Basin deserts in \nthe western portion of the state and the red rock canyons in Southern \nUtah, which had not been included in earlier inventories.\n  Recently, BLM completed a re-inventory of approximately 6 million \nacres of federal land which had been proposed for wilderness \ndesignation in previous wilderness bills. The results provide a \nconvincing confirmation of the inventory conducted by UWC volunteers. \nOf the 6 million acres it re-inventoried, BLM found that 5.8 million \nacres qualified for wilderness consideration. Almost all of these lands \nare included in America's Red Rock Wilderness Act.\n  Theodore Roosevelt once stated, ``The Nation behaves well if it \ntreats the natural resources as assets which it must turn over to the \nnext generation increased and not impaired in value.'' Unfortunately, \nthese fragile, scenic lands in Utah are threatened by oil, gas and \nmining interests, destructive use by off-road vehicles, increased \ncommercial development, and proposals to construct roads, communication \ntowers, transmission lines, and dams. We must act now to protect these \nlands for future generations.\n  America's Red Rock Wilderness Act is supported by a broad coalition \nof over 150 environmental, conservation, and recreational organizations \nand citizen groups. In independent television and newspaper surveys and \npublic hearings on this issue, the citizens of Utah also have expressed \noverwhelming support for a strong wilderness bill.\n  Yesterday was John Muir's birthday. He observed that ``Thousands of \ntired, nerve-shaken, over-civilized people are beginning to find out \nthat going to the mountains is going home; that wilderness is a \nnecessity; that mountain parks and reservations are useful not only as \nfountains of timber and irrigating rivers, but as fountains of life.'' \nAmerica's Red Rock Wilderness Act honors his vision.\n  The preservation of our nation's vital natural resources will be one \nof our most important legacies. I urge my colleagues to join me as a \ncosponsor of this important bill to protect the America's Red Rock \nWilderness area in Utah for future generations.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join the Senator \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Durbin) as an original co-sponsor of legislation to \ndesignate 9.1 million acres of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands in \nUtah as wilderness.\n  Though this is the second time this particular measure has been \nintroduced in this body, this year's legislation has been substantially \nrevised. As the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin) has already \ndescribed, these revisions have been made on the basis of a citizen-led \nre-inventory of the wilderness quality lands that remain on BLM lands \nin Utah.\n  During the April recess I had an opportunity to travel to Utah. I \nviewed firsthand some of the lands that would be designated for \nwilderness under Senator Durbin's bill. I was able to view most of the \nproposed wilderness areas from the air, and was able to enhance my \nunderstanding through hikes outside of the Zion National Park on the \nDry Creek Bench wilderness unit contained in this proposal, and inside \nthe Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument to Upper Calf Creek \nFalls.\n  I support this legislation, for a few reasons, Mr. President, but \nmost of all because I have personally seen what is at stake, and I know \nthe marvelous resources that Wisconsinites and all Americans own in the \nBLM lands of Southern Utah.\n  Second, Mr. President, I support this legislation because I believe \nit sets the broadest and boldest mark for the lands that should be \nprotected in Southern Utah. I believe that when the Senate considers \nwilderness legislation it ought to know, as a benchmark, the full \nmeasure of those lands which are deserving of wilderness protection. \nThis bill encompases all the BLM lands of wilderness quality in Utah. \nUnfortunately, Mr. President, the Senate has not, as we do today, \nalways had the benefit of considering wilderness designations for all \nof the deserving lands in Southern Utah. During the 104th Congress, I \njoined with the former Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Bradley) in \nopposing that Congress' Omnibus Parks legislation. It contained \nprovisions, which were eventually removed, that many in my home state \nof Wisconsin believed not only designated as wilderness too little of \nthe Bureau of Land Management's holding in Utah deserving of such \nprotection, but also substantively changed the protections afforded \ndesignated lands under the Wilderness Act of 1964.\n  The lands of Southern Utah are very special to the people of \nWisconsin. In writing to me last Congress, my constituents described \nthese lands as places of solitude, special family moments, and \nincredible beauty. In December 1997, Ron Raunikar of the Capital Times, \na paper in Madison, WI, wrote:\n\n       Other remaining wilderness in the U.S. is at first \n     daunting, but then endearing and always a treasure for all \n     Americans.\n       The sensually sculpted slickrock of the Colorado Plateau \n     and windswept crag lines of the Great Basin include some of \n     the last of our country's wilderness which is not fully \n     protected.\n       We must ask our elected officials to redress this \n     circumstance, by enacting legislation which would protect \n     those national lands within the boundaries of Utah.\n       This wilderness is a treasure we can lose only once or a \n     legacy we can be forever proud to bestow to our children.\n\n  Some may say, Mr. President, that this legislation is unnecessary and \nUtah already has the ``monument'' that Wallace Stegner wrote about, \ndesignated by President Clinton on September 18, 1997. However, it is \nimportant to note, the land of the Grand Staircase Escalante National \nMonument comprises only about one tenth of the lands that will be \ngranted wilderness protection under this bill.\n  I supported the President's actions to designate the Grand Staircase \nEscalante National Monument. On September 17, 1997, amid reports of the \npending designation, I wrote a letter to President Clinton to support \nthat action which was co-signed by six other members of the Senate. \nThat letter concluded with the following statement ``We remain \ninterested in working with the Administration on appropriate \nlegislation to evaluate and protect the full extent of public lands in \nUtah that meet the criteria of the 1964 Wilderness Act.''\n  I believe that the measure being introduced today will accomplish \nthat goal. Identical in its designations to legislation sponsored in \nthe other body by Rep. Maurice Hinchey of New York, it is the \nculmination of more than 15 years and four Congresses of effort in the \nother body beginning with the legislative work of the former \nCongressman from Utah (Mr. Owens).\n  The measure protects wild lands that really are not done justice by \nany description in words. In my trip I found widely varied and distinct \nterrain, remarkable American resources of red rock cliff walls, desert, \ncanyons and gorges which encompass the canyon country of the Colorado \nPlateau, the Mojave Desert and portions of the Great Basin. The lands \nalso include mountain ranges in western Utah, and stark areas like the \nnew National Monument. These regions appeal to all types of American \noutdoor interests from hikers and sightseers to hunters.\n  Phil Haslanger of the Capital Times, answered an important question I \nam often asked when people want to know why a Senator from Wisconsin \nwould\n\n[[Page S4112]]\n\nco-sponsor legislation to protect lands in Utah. He wrote on September \n13, 1995 simply that ``These are not scenes that you could see in \nWisconsin. That's part of what makes them special.'' He continues, and \nadds what I think is an even more important reason to act to protect \nthese lands than the landscape's uniqueness, ``the fight over \nwilderness lands in Utah is a test case of sorts. The anti-\nenvironmental factions in Congress are trying hard to remove \nrestrictions on development in some of the nation's most splendid \nareas.''\n  Wisconsinites are watching this test case closely. I believe, Mr. \nPresident, that Wisconsinites view the outcome of this fight to save \nUtah's lands as a sign of where the nation is headed with respect to \nits stewardship of natural resources. For example, some in my home \nstate believe that among federal lands that comprise the Apostle \nIslands National Lakeshore and the Nicolet and Chequamegon National \nForests there are lands that are deserving of wilderness protection. \nThese federal properties are incredibly important, and they mean a \ngreat deal to the people of Wisconsin. Wisconsinites want to know that, \nshould additional lands in Wisconsin be brought forward for wilderness \ndesignation, the type of protection they expect from federal law is \nstill available to be extended because it had been properly extended to \nother places of national significance.\n\n  What Haslanger's Capital Times comments make clear is that while some \nin Congress may express concern about creating new wilderness in Utah, \nwilderness, as Wisconsinites know, is not created by legislation. \nLegislation to protect existing wilderness insures that future \ngenerations may have an experience on public lands equal to that which \nis available today. The action of Congress to preserve wild lands by \nextending the protections of the Wilderness Act of 1964 will publicly \ncodify that expectation and promise.\n  Third, this legislation has earned my support, and deserves the \nsupport of others in this body, because all of the acres that will be \nprotected under this bill are already public lands held in trust by the \nfederal government for the people of the United States. Thus, while \nthey are physically located in Utah, their preservation is important to \nthe citizens of Wisconsin as it is for other Americans.\n  Finally, I support this bill because I believe that there will likely \nbe action during this Congress to develop consensus legislation to \nprotect the lands contained in this proposal. We all need to be \ninvolved in helping to forge that consensus in order to ensure the best \nstewardship of that land. As many in this body know, the BLM has \ncompleted a review of the lands designated in the bill sponsored in the \nlast Congress by the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin) and adjacent \nareas. BLM has found that 5.8 million acres of lands, slightly more \nthan the acreage of the old bill, meet the criteria for wilderness \nprotection under the Wilderness Act. While the re-inventory is not a \nformal recommendation to Congress for wilderness designation, it \nsuggests that there are and should be more lands in play as the debate \nover wilderness protection in Utah moves forward.\n  I am also watching closely the on-going dialogue between Governor \nLeavitt and Secretary Babbitt regarding possible wilderness protection \nfor some of the West Desert lands that are contained in this \nlegislation, and the formal Section 202 process in which the BLM will \nbe engaged in Utah. I hope that the leaders of those efforts will look \nto this legislation as a guide in identifying the areas that need to be \nprotected as wilderness.\n  I am eager to work with my colleague from Illinois (Mr. Durbin) to \nprotect these lands. I commend him for introducing this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 862. A bill to protect Social Security surpluses and reserve a \nportion of non-Social Security surpluses to strengthen and protect \nMedicare; to the Committee on the Budget and the Committee on \nGovernment Affairs, jointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, 1977, \nwith instructions that if one Committee reports, the other Committee \nhave thirty days to report or be discharged.\n\n\n               social security and medicare lock box act\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Conrad, I am \nintroducing legislation, the Social Security and Medicare Lock Box Act, \nto reserve budget surpluses for both Social Security and Medicare.\n  Mr. President, this bill is an alternative to the Abraham-Domenici-\nAshcroft lock box legislation now before the Senate. There are several \ndifferences between the two versions. But I want to highlight this, \nmost importantly: the Republican proposal claims to protect Social \nSecurity, but it doesn't even pretend to protect Medicare. This bill \nwould reserve surpluses for both Social Security and Medicare. And the \nmain question for the Senate is whether we care enough about Medicare \nto provide it with a real lock box.\n  Mr. President, as I explained earlier, the Republican lock box has \nthree major flaws.\n  First, it fails to protect Social Security, and actually threatens \nbenefits.\n  Second, it reserves nothing for Medicare.\n  And, third, it could result in a government default, which could \ntrigger a world-wide economic catastrophe.\n  Our plan corrects each of these problems in a responsible way that \nwill work. It provides an ironclad guarantee that 100 percent of the \nSocial Security surplus will be saved for Social Security. It reserves \n40 percent of the non-Social Security, on-budget surplus for Medicare. \nAnd, the lock box is enforced not by a risky new limit on public debt, \nbut though the same budget procedures that produced the first budget \nsurplus in 30 years.\n  With respect to Social Security, Mr. President, our lock box would \ncreate a new point of order against a budget resolution that spends the \nSocial Security surplus. This provision is also in the Republican \namendment. But our point of order requires a supermajority to waive \nwhile theirs can be waived by a simple majority vote.\n  The Republican amendment also contains a trap door that would allow \nSocial Security contributions to be diverted for purposes other than \nSocial Security benefits, such as risky new privatization schemes. Our \nproposal includes no such trap door. To the contrary, its enforcement \nprocedures would remain in effect until legislation is enacted \ncertifying that Social Security's life has been extended for the long-\nterm.\n  In addition to protecting Social Security, Mr. President, our lock \nbox extends similar protections to the Medicare program. The proposal \ncreates supermajority points of order against a budget resolution or \nany subsequent legislation that fails to reserve roughly 40 percent of \nthe on-budget surplus for Medicare over the next 15 years.\n  Mr. President, the Medicare Trust Fund is now expected to be bankrupt \nby 2015. We should move quickly to reform and modernize the program. \nBut it's also clear that we'll need additional resources when the baby \nboom generation starts to retire. Even with reforms that substantially \nreduce costs, the revenues coming to the Medicare Trust Fund will not \nsupport this larger number of beneficiaries. Nor will they provide the \nresources needed to modernize the program or provide a prescription \ndrug benefit.\n  In case anyone has any doubt about that, consider the so-called \nBreaux-Thomas plan that was considered by the bipartisan Medicare \nCommission.\n  By their own calculation, that plan would save $100 billion over ten \nyears and extends the Trust Fund for only 3 additional years. In the \nscheme of things, that's not very long. But even this meager extension \nof the Trust Fund relies on several controversial proposals, including \nraising the age of eligibility for Medicare, establishing unlimited \nhome health copayments, and completely eliminating the Direct Medicare \nEducation program from Medicare.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that we need more resources for \nMedicare. And our amendment would give us an opportunity to provide \nthem.\n  Under our proposal, in the short term, the Medicare reserve would be \nused to reduce the debt. Over the next ten years, our proposal would \nreduce debt held by the public by $30 billion more than the Republican \nplan. By reducing debt held by the public, our lockbox would \ndramatically reduce the government's interest costs. And that would \nfree up resources to allow the government to meet its existing \ncommitments to Medicare. By contrast,\n\n[[Page S4113]]\n\nunder the Republican plan, every penny of the non-Social Security \nsurplus is consumed. That would increase interest costs and almost \nguarantee further cuts in benefits in the future.\n  Mr. President, not only does our lockbox do more to protect Medicare \nand reduce debt, it also has a stronger lock and more responsible \nenforcement procedure for both Social Security and Medicare.\n  As I've explained, Mr. President, the Republican amendment includes a \nreckless new scheme that relies on the threat of a default to enforce \nits provisions. That not only could permanently damage our credit \nstanding, it could force the government to stop issuing Social Security \nchecks.\n  We have a better idea, Mr. President. As I said earlier, we have a \n60-vote point of order against including Social Security in the budget \ntotals, as well as a 60-vote point of order against using any of the \nMedicare reserve. Then, even if Congress tries to spend that money, our \nlockbox blocks it through automatic across-the-board cuts, rather than \ncreating a crisis.\n  Mr. President, this is the best way to ensure fiscal restraint. Not \nby causing a crisis after money has already been committed. But by \nusing the tools of the budget process to block those commitments in the \nfirst place. That's why our legislation would enforce the lock box \nthrough the tried and true mechanisms of the pay-go rules and across-\nthe-board cuts.\n  If Congress attempts to spend part of the Social Security surplus or \nMedicare reserve, the sequester rules of the Balanced Budget Act would \nmake automatic spending cuts in order to keep the reserve intact. This \nis far better than triggering a debt crisis, and threatening a \ngovernment default, as the Republican amendment proposes.\n  To sum up, Mr. President, the Republican amendment claims to protect \nSocial Security, but it really threatens Social Security benefits. Ours \nis a real lockbox that protects both Social Security and Medicare. It's \na more responsible alternative that avoids the risk of default. And it \nwould reduce debt by more than the underlying amendment.\n  I hope my colleagues will support it and I ask unanimous consent that \na copy of the bill, along with certain related materials, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 862\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The proposal creates a new super majority point of \n     order against legislation that would increase the limits on \n     public debt. The limits are set at levels that would allow \n     all non-Social Security surpluses to be used for tax cuts or \n     spending.\n       The GOP lock box has three major problems:\n       (1) It does nothing to protect Medicare. Instead, it allows \n     Congress to use funds needed for Medicare to provide tax \n     cuts.\n       (2) It threatens Social Security. If the economy slows, the \n     government could be unable to issue Social Security or other \n     benefit checks. Also, the GOP amendment includes a provision \n     that would allow Social Security surpluses to be used for \n     purposes other than Social Security benefits, if labeled as \n     ``Social Security reform.''\n       (3) It threatens default. Secretary Rubin is concerned that \n     the proposal could permanently damage our credit standing. \n     The risk of default would increase interest costs for \n     American taxpayers.\n       In November 1995, a debt crisis was precipitated when \n     Government borrowing reached the debt limit and in January \n     Moody's credit rating service placed Treasury securities on \n     review for possible downgrade.\n       The proposal could trigger an actual default based on \n     factors beyond Congress's control. Although the GOP proposal \n     adjusts the debt ceiling for discrepancies between the actual \n     and projected Social Security surpluses, it does not make \n     similar corrections for unanticipated developments on the \n     non-Social Security side of the budget. This means that an\n\n[[Page S4114]]\n\n     economic slowdown, a reduction in anticipated revenues, or an \n     unexpected increase in mandatory spending could cause \n     publicly held debt to exceed the new limits and create a debt \n     crisis.\n\n\n                          democratic lock box\n\n       The Democratic Lock Box creates a supermajority point of \n     order against a budget resolution or any legislation that \n     does not save at least 40 percent of the on-budget surplus \n     for Medicare over the next 15 years and adds a new \n     supermajority point of order against a budget resolution that \n     violates the off-budget treatment of Social Security. (The \n     budget act already contains supermajority points of order \n     against a budget resolution or any legislation that reduces \n     the Social Security surplus.)\n       The Democratic Lock Box has several advantages over the \n     Republican approach.\n       (1) It protects Social Security. The language reserves all \n     Social Security surpluses for Social Security, and does not \n     allow these surpluses to be used for anything that does not \n     increase the Solvency of the Social Security program.\n       (2) It protects Medicare. The Democratic bill reserves 40 \n     percent of the on-budget surplus for Medicare; allows \n     sufficient funding to extend the life of the Medicare HI \n     Trust Fund through at least 2027.\n       (3) It relies on responsible enforcement mechanisms. The \n     Democratic approach does not establish binding limits on \n     publicly held debt and does not create a risk of default. \n     Enforcement is through current budget procedures and across-\n     the-board cuts. The Lock Box also restores the current pay-\n     as-you-go point of order, which makes certain that no on-\n     budget surplus can be used. Without a change in law, the \n     Republican tax cuts will result in a pay-as-you-go sequester, \n     which will come largely from Medicare.\n       (4) It reduces more debt. The Democratic Lock Box reduces \n     more debt than the Republican proposal, which will lower \n     future interest costs and free up government resources to \n     meet its existing Social Security and Medicare obligations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       COMPARISON OF DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN LOCK BOX PROPOSALS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                Democratic                           Republican\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nReserves 77 percent of unified surplus for  Claims to reserve 62 percent\n Social Security and Medicare.               of unified surplus for\n                                             Social Security but\n                                             includes ``trap door''\n                                             loophole.\nPrevents Social Security surplus from       Allows Social Security\n being used for other purposes.              surplus to be used for\n                                             anything labeled ``Social\n                                             Security reform'' including\n                                             tax cuts.\nReserves 40 percent of on-budget surplus    Reserves nothing for\n for Medicare; allows solvency through       Medicare.\n 2027.\nEnforcement through existing budget rules   Enforcement through debt\n and across-the-board cuts; procedures       crisis; putting United\n that created the first budget surplus       States credit worthiness at\n since 1969.                                 risk and jeopardizing\n                                             Social Security benefits.\nRequires 60 votes to violate off-budget     Requires 60 votes to violate\n treatment of Social Security or for using   off-budget treatment of\n Medicare reserve.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for Medicaid coverage of all certified nurse practitioners and \nclinical nurse specialists; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     medicaid nursing incentive act\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Medicaid \nNursing Incentive Act, a bill to provide direct Medicaid reimbursement \nfor nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists.\n  This legislation eliminates a counterproductive Medicaid payment \npolicy. Under current law, State Medicaid programs may exclude \ncertified nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists from \nMedicaid reimbursement, even though these practitioners are fully \ntrained to provide many of the same services as those provided by \nprimary care physicians. This policy is both discriminatory and \nshortsighted; it severs a critical access link for Medicaid \nbeneficiaries.\n  The ultimate goal of this proposal is to enhance the availability of \ncost-effective primary care to our nation's most vulnerable citizens.\n  Studies have documented the fact that millions of Americans each year \ngo without the health care services they need, because physicians \nsimply are not available to care for them. This problem plagues rural \nand urban areas alike, in parts of the country as diverse as south \ncentral Los Angeles and Lemmon, South Dakota.\n  Medicaid beneficiaries are particularly vulnerable, since in recent \nyears an increasing number of health professionals have chosen not to \ncare for them or have been unwilling to locate in the inner-city and \nrural communities where many beneficiaries live. Fortunately, there is \nan exception to the trend: nurse practitioners and clinical nurse \nspecialists frequently accept patients whom others will not treat and \nserve in areas where others refuse to work.\n  Studies have shown that nurse practitioners and clinical nurse \nspecialists provide quality, cost-effective care. Their advanced \nclinical training enables them to assume responsibility for up to 80 \npercent of the primary care services usually performed by physicians, \noften at a lower cost and with a high level of patient satisfaction.\n  Congress has already recognized the expanding contributions of nurse \npractitioners and clinical nurse specialists. For more than a decade, \nCHAMPUS has provided direct payment to nurse practitioners. In 1990, \nCongress mandated direct payment for nurse practitioner services under \nthe Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan. The Medicare program, which \nalready covered nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialist \nservices in rural areas, was modified under the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997 to provide coverage for these services in all geographic areas. \nThe bill I am introducing today establishes the same payment policy \nunder Medicaid.\n\n[[Page S4115]]\n\n  Mr. President, the ramifications of this issue extend beyond the \nMedicaid program and its beneficiaries. There is a broader lesson here \nthat applies to our effort to make cost-effective, high-quality health \ncare services available and accessible to all Americans.\n  One of the cornerstones of this kind of care is the expansion of \nprimary and preventive care, delivered to individuals in convenient, \nfamiliar places where they live, work, and go to school. More than 2 \nmillion of our nation's nurses currently provide care in these sites--\nin home health agencies, nursing homes, ambulatory care clinics, and \nschools. In places like South Dakota, nurses are often the only health \ncare professionals available in the small towns and rural counties \nacross the state.\n  These nurses and other nonphysician health professionals play an \nimportant role in the delivery of care. And this role will only \nincrease as we move from a system that focuses on the costly treatment \nof illness to one that emphasizes primary preventive care and health \npromotion.\n  But, first, we must reevaluate outdated attitudes and break down \nbarriers that prevent nurses from using the full range of their \ntraining and skills in caring for patients. In 1994, the Pew Health \nProfessions Commission concluded that nurse practitioners are not being \nfully utilized to deliver primary care services. The commission \nrecommended eliminating fiscal discrimination by paying nurse \npractitioners directly for the services they provide. This step will \nhelp nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists expand access \nto the primary care that so many communities currently lack.\n  As I have worked on access and reimbursement issues related to nurse \npractitioners and clinical nurse specialists, I have encountered two \nrelated issues I would also like to highlight.\n  Later this month, I plan to introduce legislation to increase the \nreimbursement rate for nurse practitioners and clinical nurse \nspecialists who practice in rural and underserved areas. Currently, \nphysicians who serve in a health professional shortage area receive a \n10 percent boost in their Medicare payment as an incentive to provide \nservices in the regions that need them the most. As we know, nurses are \nalready providing critical primary and preventive care in these areas \nand deserve the bonus payments that physicians are already receiving.\n  I would also encourage my colleagues to closely monitor the impact of \nMedicaid managed care on access to care provided by nurse practitioners \nand clinical nurse specialists. In some areas of the country, \nimplementation of managed care has prevented patients from continuing \nto receive health care services from nurse practitioners and clinical \nnurse specialists because they are not listed as primary care providers \nor preferred providers. Advanced practice nurses provide cost-\neffective, local, quality care, and I am concerned about early reports \nthat access to these professionals is being limited by new health \ndelivery arrangements. We should certainly keep an eye on this issue as \nMedicaid managed care systems develop.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will carefully consider the \nissues I have raised and support the measure I am introducing today, \nrecognizing the critical role nurse practitioners and other \nnonphysician health professionals play in our health care delivery \nsystem, as well as the increasingly significant contribution they can \nmake in the future. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 863\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate April 22 as Earth Day; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n                             EARTH DAY ACT\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this bill that I have sent to the desk \nis being introduced on behalf of myself and Senator Chafee. It is \nentitled ``The Earth Day Act.'' Its purpose is to designate April 22 as \nEarth Day.\n  Today, of course, is April 22. Let me provide a little history for my \ncolleagues or anyone listening.\n  The first Earth Day was 29 years ago, in 1970, and I think we are all \naware that Earth Day was first conceived by our former colleague, \nSenator Gaylord Nelson, who is universally considered the founder of \nEarth Day.\n  He has written a short summary of what brought Earth Day about, how \nit came about. In it he points out that in a speech that he gave in \nSeattle in September of 1969, he announced that there would be a \nnational environmental teach-in in the spring of 1970. And the wire \nservices picked up that story. And the next thing he knew, there was a \nmovement afoot to actually have that happen.\n  That first Earth Day involved some 20 million Americans. Since then, \nthe concept and the idea of Earth Day has focused the attention of the \ncountry, focused the attention of the world, in fact, on the importance \nof our environment and the importance of preserving and maintaining our \nenvironment. We have a great debt of gratitude we owe to former Senator \nNelson for his leadership on this.\n  We also owe a great debt of gratitude to the person that did the nuts \nand bolts work of organizing that first Earth Day, and that, of course \nis Denis Hayes. He is now president of the Seattle-based Bullitt \nFoundation, but he has been recognized recently by Time magazine as one \nof their heroes of the planet. I think his instrumental role, his \nessential role in bringing about that first Earth Day, making such a \nsuccess of it, has been recognized by all.\n  He is now, of course, trying to get in place the organization to make \nEarth Day 2000, which will occur exactly a year from today, an even \ngreater celebration than we have known before.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe that it is appropriate that we \nofficially designate April 22 as Earth Day and that we permanently \ndesignate it as Earth Day. It has come to be known as Earth Day--April \n22--for all of us. There are celebrations and teach-ins, and \nrecognitions going on throughout our country today. As we hear the news \nabout Kosovo, which is bad, and the news about Littleton, Colorado, and \nthe terrible tragedy there, which is bad, and many of the other news \nstories that bombard us, it is good to know that there is one news \nstory that we can all celebrate and rally around, and that is that \ntoday, again, we will be able to celebrate Earth Day.\n  Mr. President, it is my sincere hope that Senator Chafee and I can \nwork in the next year to gain additional cosponsors and to obtain \nenactment of this, so that by the time Earth Day 2000 arrives, we will \nbe able to have this in law, have it signed by the President. I am sure \nit will be supported by all of our colleagues. I think we all recognize \nthe importance of this to many of the people we represent. I hope very \nmuch that the bill can be enacted.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 865. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthe same tax treatment for danger pay allowance as for combat pay; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S4116]]\n\n                         DIPLOMATIC DANGER PAY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I want to right a wrong--a small \nwrong, but a wrong nevertheless. It affects a handful of our diplomats \nwho serve in the world's most dangerous places: Beirut, Bosnia, Kosovo, \nthe unsettled nations of Africa and the former Soviet Union and \nelsewhere. And unfortunately, as the events of recent weeks prove, the \nneed for Americans--soldiers and diplomats alike--to go in harm's way, \nis unlikely to abate.\n  Our diplomats, colleagues of those killed last summer in the tragic \nembassy bombings in Africa, receive an allowance for their service in \nthe most frightening places in the world--a danger allowance.\n  This allowance is not unlike that paid to our military when they are \nin combat. In fact, in some places, such as Bosnia, where our military \nand diplomatic personnel serve side by side, both receive a special \nallowance for their sacrifices.\n  The military justifiably receives this benefit tax-free. But our \ndiplomatic personnel do not. Through an oversight in the Internal \nRevenue Code, diplomats are taxed on their danger pay, even though they \noften face similar hardships and dangers. I think that's wrong.\n  I have a bill which would amend the Internal Revenue Code to right \nthis wrong. It affects just a handful of people. But to them it will \nserve as recognition of the sacrifice they make when they represent the \nAmerican people in dangerous settings overseas. I urge its quick \npassage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill appear in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 865\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, among the worst situations facing \nspouses, children, and families of members of the United States Armed \nForces, is to be greeted by an official party, wearing their dress blue \nuniforms, announcing the grim news that their loved one has been killed \nor declared missing.\n  On Sunday, September 14, 1997 nine families endured such an \nexperience as the United States Air Force declared one of its C-141 \nStarlifter cargo planes, en route from Namibia to Ascension Island, was \noverdue and presumed to have gone down in the Atlantic Ocean. At the \nsame time, a German military plane was also declared missing in the \nsame area, amid indications that the two planes had collided and \ncrashed into the Atlantic.\n  An extensive search was begun, during which only a few airplane \nseats, a few papers, some debris from the U.S. cargo plane, remnants of \nthe German aircraft, and the body of one victim were recovered. No \nother remains were recovered, and no survivors were located. On \nSaturday, September 27, 1997 the search for the crewmen of the Air \nForce jet ended and all were declared dead.\n  Mr. President, an investigation confirmed everyone's worst fears. In \nfact, on that fateful day--September 13, 1997--a German Luftwaffe \nTupelov TU-154M collided with a U.S. Air Force C-141 Starlifter off the \ncoast of Namibia, Africa. As a result of that mid-air collision nine \nUnited States Air Force Service members were killed. These are the \nrank, name, age, assignment, and hometowns of those killed: Staff \nSergeant Stacy D. Bryant, 32, loadmaster, Providence, Rhode Island; \nStaff Sergeant Gary A. Bucknam, 25, flight engineer, Oakland, Maine; \nCaptain Gregory M. Cindrich, 28, pilot, Byrans Road, Maryland; Airman \n1st Class Justin R. Drager, 19, loadmaster, Colorado Springs, Colorado; \nStaff Sergeant Robert K. Evans, 31, flight engineer, Garrison, \nKentucky; Captain Jason S. Ramsey, 27, pilot, South Boston, Virginia; \nStaff Sergeant Scott N. Roberts, 27, flight engineer, Library, \nPennsylvania; Captain Peter C. Vallejo, 34, aircraft commander, \nCrestwood, New York; and Senior Airman Frankie L. Walker, 23, crew \nchief, Windber, Pennsylvania;\n  At McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, families and members of the \ncrewmen's squadron from the 305th Operation Group were trying to make \nsense of what happened. Monica Cindrich, wife of the pilot, had to \nexplain to her 3 year-old son why his father would not be returning. On \nthe day following the crash, Sharla Bucknam went alone to her son \nAndrew's third birthday party. Any Smart held out hope that her fiance, \nCaptain Ramsey, would return for their wedding, planned for the \nfollowing May. And Justin Drager's father, Larry, a retired Air Force \nMaster Sergeant prayed for a miracle. It was his son's very first \nmission since the Air Force certified him as a loadmaster on the giant \ncargo plane that would take the 19-year-old from Colorado Springs to \nthe faraway places he joined the military to see.\n  At a memorial service at McGuire Air Force Base, the nine crew \nmembers were honored as heroes who gave their lives for a humanitarian \nmission. The plane was returning home to McGuire after delivering \ntroops and 32,000 pounds of mine-clearing equipment to Namibia. As the \nchaplain called the names of each crew member in a final roll call, a \nsquadron member answered ``Absent, sir.'' The crowd of more than 3,000 \nstood solemnly as a lone bugler played taps and three C-141s flew over \nin formation.\n  Formal investigations by both the government of Germany and the \nUnited States Air Force found that the German military plane was flying \nat the wrong altitude. The two planes, occupying the same air space, at \nthe same altitude, closed on each other at a combined speed of over \n1,000 miles per hour. The two planes hit almost nose to nose.\n  The German crew saw the U.S. plane about a second before impact and \nstruggled for two-and-a-half minutes to regain control of the TU-154 as \nit crashed into the Atlantic.\n  The German military transport was carrying 12 German marines, two of \ntheir spouses and 10 crew members. Unfortunately, there were no \nsurvivors. The German Air Force plane was en route from Germany to Cape \nTown, South Africa, where the marines were to have participated in a \nboat race marking the 75th anniversary of the South African Navy.\n  The details concerning the crash are unsettling and I doubt anyone \nwould want to die in the manner that the crew of ``MISSION REACH 4201'' \ndid. While the German crew had about a one-and-one-half second warning \nthat they were going to collide with another aircraft, the crew aboard \nthe C-141 literally did not know what hit them.\n  The cockpit voice recorder aboard the American aircraft chillingly \ncaptures the conversations of the ``MISSION REACH 4201'' crew as fate \ncruelly\n\n[[Page S4117]]\n\nsteers the two military transports toward a deadly collision. Reviewing \nthe transcript shows that Captains Greg Cindrich and Peter Vallejo--the \ntwo pilots of the Starlifter--had no inclination that a collision was \nimminent until it was too late. The two officers were discussing topics \nsuch as Social Security and the exploration of Mars.\n  The tape indicates that the crew survived for at least 13 seconds \nfollowing the impact with the German transport. In those 13 seconds, \nthe C-141 and crew of ``MISSION REACH 4201'' began hurtling toward the \nAtlantic Ocean. They spent the last 13 seconds of the flight, of their \nlives, strapping on oxygen masks and looking for flashlights to cope \nwith a failed electrical system. Aviation experts have determined that \nit is possible that the nine doomed men may have actually survived for \nas long as 30-seconds before the C-141 exploded. For thirteen to 30 \nseconds, these men fought to survive, fought to right their plane, \nfought for their very lives. If thirteen to 30 seconds sounds like a \nshort amount of time, I challenge anyone to try holding their hand over \na burning match for that amount of time, let alone spend that amount of \ntime aboard a multi-ton aircraft as it plummets toward the ocean. These \nmen were able to contemplate for thirteen to 30 seconds that their \naircraft was damaged and diving toward the ocean from an altitude of \n35,000 feet. That was thirteen to 30 seconds that these men could have \nbeen thinking that no C-141 had successfully survived a crash landing \nin water. It was thirteen to 30 seconds for these men to realize that \nthey were about to die.\n  Somewhere between thirteen and thirty seconds after the collision, \nthe C-141 of ``Mission Reach 4201'' exploded and what did not vaporize \nbecame debris that was spread on the surface of the ocean, or sunk to \nits cold and murky depths. Needless to say, rescuers and salvage \noperators never recovered much of the American aircraft or crew. The \nAir Force ultimately found a few parts of the airplanes and 15 pounds \nof human remains of such minute quantities that DNA testing had to be \nconducted to determine who was who. As a point of comparison, a bag of \ncement is approximately 20 pounds. You could have put the entire \nremains of nine adult men in a bag that is used to hold cement and have \nroom left over. There were not enough remains left of any one of the \ncrew members to afford their families the comfort of laying their sons, \nfathers, brothers, and husbands to rest. Instead, only mementos were \nplaced in caskets and buried.\n  Accident investigations conducted by the United States Air Force and \nthe German Ministry of Defense both concluded that fault for the \ncollision and deaths lay with the German crew, who not only filed an \ninaccurate flight plan, but were flying at the wrong altitude. The crew \nof the C-141 were operating appropriately, and were exactly where they \nwere supposed to be when they met their untimely deaths. These nine men \ndied through no fault or negligence of their own, the United States Air \nForce, or the government of the United States.\n  The families of each of the nine victims have endured not only \ntremendous mental anguish and suffering, but significant financial \nlosses, and understandably, they are seeking compensation from the \nGerman government. Sadly, despite the fact that this crash took place \nalmost two-years-ago, the German government has still to make the first \npfenning of compensation to any of the victims' families.\n  I rise today to offer a Sense of the Senate resolution that calls \nupon the German government to make quick and generous compensation to \nthese families. Just as this Body agreed by unanimous consent on March \n23, to authorize the Secretary of Defense to make humanitarian relief \npayments of up to $2 million to each of the families killed in \nCavalese, Italy when a Marine Corps jet struck a ski gondola, we should \ngo on the record as expecting equitably fair and expeditious relief for \nthe families of our servicemen killed through the negligence of the \nGerman government.\n  It gives me no pleasure to offer this resolution. The German \ngovernment and people are unquestionably among the closest of allies \nand the best of friends. We stood side-by-side during the Cold War, \nfacing down the Eastern threat; we are working side-by-side in the \nBalkans now; our economies are linked; and we value the strong \nrelationship between our two nations. Nevertheless, the Federal \nRepublic of Germany has an undeniable responsibility to make quick and \ngenerous compensation to the nine families who lost loved ones aboard \n``MISSION REACH 4201'' and I have pledged to Monica Cindrich, the widow \nof Captain Gregory Cindrich and the mother of their four-year-old son, \nthat I will do all within my power to bring not only compensation to \nher, but closure to this tragedy. Passing this sense of the Senate \nresolution will help do just that.\n\n  Each of us gets into public service because we desire to help people, \nto do what is right, and to fight for fairness. This Sense of the \nSenate resolution allows us to achieve each of those goals. By securing \ncompensation for the deaths of the nine men killed, we will \nunquestionably be helping their families; we will be making a stand for \nwhat is right by making a stand for our military families; and finally, \nwe will be fighting for fairness. Just as our government has recognized \nour responsibility in the case of the Italian ski gondola incident, it \nis only fair that the German government recognize their responsibility \nand obligation in this matter.\n  It is my hope that this resolution will pass with the support of an \noverwhelming majority of Senators. By voting for this provision, each \nof you will not only be sending an unmistakable message to the German \ngovernment, but perhaps even more importantly, you will be signaling to \nour men and women in uniform that their elected officials will always \nstand by them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 866. A bill to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto revise existing regulations concerning the conditions of \nparticipation for hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers under the \nMedicare program relating to certified registered nurse anesthetists' \nservices to make the regulations consistent with State supervision \nrequirements; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  Anesthesia Service Preservation Act\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich would help clarify an issue that relates to Medicare coverage for \nanesthesia services and its impact on rural health care.\n  As a senator representing a predominantly rural state, I know only \ntoo well the difficulties facing rural health care needs. Access to \ncare in rural areas is slowly worsening as more and more rural \nhospitals close their doors in the face of overwhelming cost pressures. \nClearly, one aspect of access to care is access to surgical procedures. \nAnd without anesthesia services, general surgery becomes impossible.\n  Certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) tend to be the \npredominant anesthesia provider in rural and undeserved urban areas. In \nfact, CRNAs are the sole anesthesia provider in 65% of rural hospitals \nand in addition, provide at least 65% of the nation's anesthesia needs. \nThe simple fact is that anesthesiologists have not been moving into \nrural areas in any significant numbers, and are not expected to do so \nin the foreseeable future. Given this trend, if rural hospitals are \ngoing to stay open, they desperately need CRNAs for their anesthesia \nand ultimately their surgical needs. That means we have to maintain a \nhealthy supply of CRNAs to maintain access to care for rural Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  Unfortunately, current Medicare rules with respect to supervision \nprovide a disincentive for hospitals to use nurse anesthetists. \nMedicare's regulations require physician supervision of CRNAs as a \ncondition for hospitals or ambulatory surgical centers to receive \nMedicare reimbursement, despite many state laws that allow nurse \nanesthetists to practice without such supervision. Although HCFA has \nissued a proposed rule that would drop this requirement and defer to \nstates on the issue of supervision, this rule has never been finalized.\n  The federal supervision requirement creates several problems for \nCRNAs. First, some surgeons and hospitals have been dissuaded from \nworking with\n\n[[Page S4118]]\n\nCRNAs, in the face of arguments that the physicians may be subjecting \nthemselves to liability for engaging in supervision. But the truth is, \nthe attending physician--or the hospital--is no more legally liable for \nthe CRNAs actions than he or she is for the acts of an \nanesthesiologist. Second, the federal restriction is anti-competitive, \nacting as a disincentive for CRNAs to be used. Finally, the restriction \ncreates an inaccurate perception among some surgeons that they have an \nobligation to direct or control the substantive course of the \nanesthetic process, even though there is no such obligation.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would eliminate the Federal \nsupervision requirement and instead direct Medicare to defer to state \nlaw requirements on supervision. By eliminating this prescriptive \nfederal regulation, we can better maximize the use of nurse \nanesthetists and eliminate the confusion surrounding CRNA supervision. \nAt a time when the Congress is seeking ways to reduce costs for the \nMedicare program without sacrificing quality or access to care, \nincreasing the use of nurse anesthetists seems particularly \nappropriate.\n  In terms of quality of care, there are no significant differences \nbetween anesthesia provided by CRNAs or that provided by \nanesthesiologists. Notwithstanding the claims of anesthesiologists, it \nis clear from a careful reading of the studies that there are no \nquantifiable differences in outcomes when CRNAs work with \nanesthesiologists, or when anesthesiologists provide anesthesia alone. \nCRNAs have been providing anesthesia services for more than a century. \nThey have been the principal anesthesia providers in combat areas in \nevery war the United States has been engaged in since World War I. \nCRNAs have received medals and accolades for their dedication, \ncommitment and competence. And CRNAs perform the same anesthesia \ndelivery function as anesthesiologists and work in every setting in \nwhich anesthesia is delivered: traditional hospital suites, obstetrical \ndelivery rooms, dentist's offices, HMO's ambulatory surgical centers, \nVeterans Administration facilities and others.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government is deferring to state judgment \non a whole host of issues, so it seems completely consistent to let \nstates decide how best to use nurse anesthetists, particularly in light \nof CRNA's long track record of success. States, which have the primary \nresponsibility for regulating nurse practice, have generally not seen \nany need for a physician supervision requirement in non-Medicare \nsettings. Twenty-nine states do not require supervision of CRNAs in \nnurse practice acts or board of nursing rules. This clearly indicates \nthat many states, as a matter of public policy, do not believe it is \nnecessary to require physician supervision of CRNAs. It is easy to \nunderstand why. Anesthesia is provided only when necessary to permit \nsome medical procedure or intervention. Thus, as a practical matter \neven when supervision is not required as a matter of law, a surgeon, \npodiatrist, or dentist will be in the room when anesthesia is provided, \nand would be capable of handling any emergency that might arise.\n  Finally, I would note that when CRNAs were given direct Medicare \nreimbursement in 1986, there was no statutory requirement that CRNAs be \nsupervised by physicians in order to receive reimbursement. This was \nnot a requirement imposed by Congress then, nor has there been one \nsince. Had Congress believed that such a requirement was appropriate, \nit would have been imposed as a condition of reimbursement at that \ntime. Moreover, HCFA routinely defers to the states on scope of \npractice issues as its relates to other health care professionals.\n  This proposed change is supported by the American Hospital \nAssociation and the National Rural Health Association. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation and let the states make their \nown decisions about how to regulate a health care professional's scope \nof practice. Rural and undeserved urban areas need CRNAs and it's time \nthe federal government removed impediments in regulations so that \nconsumers' access to anesthesia care, particularly in rural areas, will \nnot be jeopardized.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Jeffords, \n        Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Biden, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Torricelli, \n        Mr. Harkin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \n        Kohl, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 867. A bill to designate a portion of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge as wilderness; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n             arctic national refuge wilderness act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, in 1960 President Dwight Eisenhower had the \nwisdom to set aside a portion of America's Arctic for the benefit and \nenjoyment of future generations. His Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \nprotected the highest peaks and glaciers of the Brooks Range, North \nAmerica's two largest and most northerly alpine lakes, and nearly 200 \ndifferent wildlife species, including polar bears, grizzlies, wolves, \ncaribou, and millions of migratory birds.\n  Eisenhower's Secretary of Interior Fred Seaton called the new Arctic \nRange, ``one of the most magnificent wildlife and wilderness areas in \nNorth America . . . a wilderness experience not duplicated elsewhere.\n  With this in mind, I reintroduce legislation today, Earth Day 1999, \nthat designates the coastal plain of Alaska as wilderness area. At the \nmoment this area is a national wildlife refuge--one of our most \nbeautiful and last frontiers. This legislation, the Arctic National \nRefuge Wilderness Act of 1999, would forever safeguard this great \nnational treasure from oil exploration and development.\n  And I can't stress how important this is.\n  The Alaskan wilderness area is not only a critical part of our \nEarth's ecosystem--the last remaining region where the complete \nspectrum of arctic and subarctic ecosystems comes together--but it is a \nvital part of our national consciousness. It is a place we can cherish \nand visit for our soul's good.\n  The Alaskan wilderness is a place of outstanding wildlife, wilderness \nand recreation, a land dotted by beautiful forests, dramatic peaks and \nglaciers, gentle foothills and undulating tundra. It is untamed--rich \nwith caribou, polar bear, grizzly, wolves, musk oxen, Dall sheep, \nmoose, and hundreds of thousands of birds--snow geese, tundra swans, \nblack brant, and more. Birds from the Arctic Refuge fly to or through \nevery state in the continental U.S. In all, Mr. President, about 165 \nspecies use the coastal plain.\n  It is an area of intense wildlife activity. Animals give birth, nurse \nand feed their young, and set about the critical business of fueling up \nfor winters of unspeakable severity.\n  The fact is Mr. President, there are parts of this Earth where it is \ngood that man can come only as a visitor. These are the pristine lands \nthat belong to all of us. And perhaps most importantly, these are the \nlands that belong to our future.\n  Considering the many reasons why this bill is so important, I came \nacross the words of the great Western writer, Wallace Stegner. \nReferring to the land we are trying to protect with this legislation, \nhe wrote that it is `the most splendid part of the American habitat; it \nis also the most fragile.' And we cannot enter `it carrying habits that \n[are] inappropriate and expectations that [are] surely excessive.'\n  What this bill offers--and what we need--is a brand of pragmatic \nenvironmentalism, an environmental stewardship that protects our \nimportant wilderness areas and precious resources, while carefully and \njudiciously weighing the short-term desires or our country against its \nlong-term needs.\n  Together, we need to embrace environmental policies that are workable \nand pragmatic, policies based on the desire to make the world a better \nplace for us and for future generations. I believe a strong economy, \nliberty, and progress are possible only when we have a healthy planet--\nonly when resources are managed through wise stewardship--only when an \nenvironmental ethic thrives among nations--and only when people have \nfrontiers that are untrammeled and able to host their fondest dreams.\n\n[[Page S4119]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 867\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF PORTION OF ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE \n                   REFUGE AS WILDERNESS.\n\n       Section 4 of the National Wildlife Refuge System \n     Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(p) Designation of Certain Land as Wilderness.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, a portion of \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska comprising \n     approximately 1,559,538 acres, as generally depicted on a map \n     entitled `Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--1002 Area. \n     Alternative E--Wilderness Designation, October 28, 1991' and \n     available for inspection in the offices of the Secretary of \n     the Interior, is designated as a component of the National \n     Wilderness Preservation System under the Wilderness Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 1131 et seq.).''.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to again join with Senator \nRoth in the very important bipartisan effort to designate the coastal \nplain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness--forever.\n  Today is Earth Day 1999. The introduction of the Arctic Wilderness \nAct is particularly appropriate on Earth Day because it will provide \npermanent protection for the unique and irreplaceable natural resources \nof an area that is the ``biological heart'' of the North Slope of \nAlaska. The coastal plain is a vital part of the tundra ecosystem that \nsome have referred to as ``America's Serengetti.''\n  On Earth Day, we should take extra measure of special, rare, and \nthreatened places. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge coastal plain is \none of these places. It is one natural treasure that we must protect as \nwilderness for current and future generations.\n  The coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife refuge represents \nthe wildest and most pristine arctic coastal ecosystem in the United \nStates. The coastal plain is where the calves of the awe-inspiring \nPorcupine caribou herd are born every year. It is also where snow geese \nfeed in the fall and many female polar bears choose to den.\n  During the summer, migratory birds such as the red-throated loon, \nAmerican golden-plover, and semipalmated sandpiper and others flock to \nthe coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in great \nnumbers. In the fall, they return southward to and through the state of \nConnecticut among other places. By dedicating the coastal plain of the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness, we can help ensure that \nthis ancient natural rite continues into the 21st Century.\n  For more than a decade, Congress has repeatedly debated the \nadvisability of opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge coastal \nplain to oil and gas exploration and development. Time and again, \nCongress and the American people have rejected the notion that we \nshould sacrifice our last vestige of arctic coastal plain to petroleum \ndevelopment. The decision to prohibit coastal plain petroleum \ndevelopment reflects the tremendous value Americans place in the \npreservation of our great wilderness areas.\n  The degradation caused by developing oil and gas in places worthy of \nwilderness designation is irreversible. Once developed, the wilderness \nvalue of a place is lost.\n  The Alaska Wilderness Act designates the coastal plain of the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge as wilderness--an area to remain wild and \nundeveloped in perpetuity--and thereby preserves one of the last great \nnatural treasures on the North American continent for generations to \ncome.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, Earth Day is a celebration of the value \nand importance of our natural environment and a reminder of our duty to \nprotect, rather than carelessly exploit and deplete, our natural \nheritage. Our commitment to future generations is something we in \nMinnesota take very seriously. It is a commitment to ensure that the \nenvironmental legacy we pass on to our children and grandchildren is \nnot marred by failures such as the poisoning of our oceans, rivers, \nlakes and streams, the destruction of the natural habitat, and the \nirreversible extinction of species.\n  Environmental concerns have always been very important to me and to \nMinnesotans, and I am proud of the progress that we are making in \nprotecting the environment. However, while recognizing the progress we \nhave made, we Minnesotans also realize how much more needs to be done.\n  That is why I feel it is very appropriate that Senator Roth, myself, \nand several of our colleagues, are introducing legislation on this day \nto designate a portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska \nas wilderness. My good friend Congressman Bruce Vento from Minnesota, \nalong with over 150 of his colleagues, have introduced similar \nlegislation in the House, called the Morris K. Udall Wilderness Act. \nThis legislation is a tremendous step forward, crucial to preserving \nthe biodiversity of one of our nation's last remaining frontiers.\n  This bill will designate the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge as \nwilderness, protecting 1.5 million acres of some of the most unspoiled \nwilderness remaining in the United States. The Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge is a one-of-a-kind national treasure, home to many unique \nspecies of plant and animal life, several of which are considered \nendangered or threatened. This magnificent wilderness contains a \ncomplete spectrum of arctic and sub-arctic ecosystems, which can be \nfound nowhere else on the continent.\n  Moreover, the fragile balance of life in this wilderness is critical \nto the survival of the native Gwich'in Athabascan Indians of northeast \nAlaska, who depend on the land to maintain their centuries-old nomadic \nway of life. The Gwich'in rely on the 150,000-strong Porcupine River \ncaribou herd, whose calving grounds are on the coastal plain.\n  Unfortunately, a few multinational oil companies have set their \nsights on this crown jewel of America's wilderness to extract their \nshort-term profits. Oil drilling on the coastal plain would mean \ndespoliation of this pristine land with hundreds of oil rigs, \npipelines, air strips, and other industrial facilities. It would \ndestroy one of the most magnificent wilderness areas in North America.\n  And it would do so much harm for so little gain. Allowing these \nmultinationals to boost their profits by drilling oil would do nothing \nto solve our energy problems. The amount of oil that could potentially \nbe recovered from the Refuge is relatively small, and most of it would \nlikely be exported to Asia.\n  Instead of promoting oil drilling that destroys our natural \nenvironment, we should be promoting renewable sources of energy. In so \ndoing, we could save more energy than would ever be extracted from the \ncoastal plain of the Arctic Refuge.\n  Polls show that Americans strongly support protection of the Arctic \nRefuge. Yet the oil lobby in Washington has never suffered from a lack \nof representation. The oil multinationals pressure Congress every year \nto open up this coastal plain to drilling. It's time Congress stood up \nfor the public interest, rather than the economic interests of the \nlargest oil companies.\n  We have a responsibility to protect the environment for future \ngenerations. We must voice our protest and prevent those reckless \npolicies which ignore the real costs of exhausting our natural \nresources and permanently distort our ecosystem's fragile balance.\n  We must continue to be a world leader in deterring the destruction of \nour natural heritage. We must continue to facilitate and promote \nsuccessful programs that help us conserve and use our lands and \nresources wisely.\n  As we celebrate the last official Earth Day of the twentieth century, \nwe must ensure that we will have cause to celebrate Earth Day in the \ntwenty-first century. This legislation represents a significant step in \nthe right direction, and I urge my colleagues to join us in \ncosponsoring this legislation on this very special day.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Mack):\n  S. 868. A bill to make forestry insurance plans available to owners \nand operators of private forest land, to encourage the use of \nprescribed burning and fuel treatment methods on private forest land, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n[[Page S4120]]\n\n       FORESTRY INITIATIVE TO RESTORE THE ENVIRONMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I have asked recognition this afternoon to \ncommend the firefighters providing relief to the State of Florida and \nits citizens, which is once again besieged by fire due to excessive \ndrought conditions. This, unfortunately, is not the first occasion on \nwhich I have risen to speak about forest fires in Florida.\n  The natural conditions in the State have been altered to the point \nwhere fires, normally a natural and essential part of the pine forests \nof this region, have burned uncontrollably, causing damage to local \ncommunities, private homes, and to the Florida forestry industry.\n  Last year, Florida sustained almost $300 million in private fire-\nrelated damage, and State and local governments spent over $100 million \nin responding to wild fires. Approximately 500,000 acres of forest were \ncompletely destroyed in 1998. And in 1999, fires in Florida have again \ncommenced a process with severe consequences. As of today, 2,542 fires \nhave burned more than 58,000 acres; 18 divisional forestry firefighters \nhave been injured; 59 structures have been destroyed, and another 81 \nwere damaged by fire.\n  Florida is not alone. Similar fires are occurring in Georgia, North \nCarolina, Arizona and New Mexico. My heart goes out to the unfortunate \nvictims of these fires, as well as to the firefighters and volunteers \nwho are working bravely to save families, homes and communities. As we \nspeak, Americans from Alabama, Delaware, and Georgia, are fighting side \nby side with Floridians to prevent these fires in my State from \nendangering more lives, homes, and property. National Guardsmen, \nmeteorologists, insurance specialist, and volunteers have converged in \nFlorida to assist in response and recovery. These individuals' bravery \nand willingness to support people who they never met reaffirms our \nbelief in the selflessness and vitality of the human spirit.\n  Mr. President, they say that a picture speaks a thousand words. I \nwould like to draw your attention to the front page of the St. \nPetersburg Times of Tuesday, April 20, which has this dramatic picture \nof the Everglades afire. The Everglades, home to many endangered \nspecies, and the water source for millions of Floridians, has for the \nlast several days been besieged by fire.\n  Now, fire is a natural phenomenon in the Everglades. It serves an \nimportant part in maintaining the ecosystem. However, human \nmanipulation of this system has decreased water levels, making the \nEverglades more susceptible to fire and more ravaging consequences of \nthat fire. This condition mirrors circumstances throughout Florida and \nmany other States where efforts to prevent fires have allowed a large \nquantity of undergrowth to accumulate in our forestry lands.\n  As many of you know, the long-leaf pine ecosystem, which is prevalent \nin Florida and other southeastern States, depends heavily on the role \nof natural fire to rejuvenate the ecosystem. Prescribed burning mimics \nnaturally occurring lightening fires, clears excess underbrush, which \ncan rob lower plants of sunlight. This frequent, low-intensity fire \nretains the rich flora of the healthy long-leaf pine ecosystem. Without \nthese frequent fires, underbrush robs lower plants, which in drought \ncondition creates a ready fuel source for a fire. It is this situation \nthat has led to severe wildfires in Florida.\n  Mr. President, today, I will be introducing legislation that is aimed \nat the prevention of the recurrence in the future and to assure that \nthis tragedy does not bring a second tragedy--a permanent loss of our \nforest lands in Florida and in the southeast. I am introducing the \nForestry Initiative to Restore the Environment Act of 1999 to mitigate \nthe damages and prevent fire disasters in the future.\n  What exactly does mitigation of losses mean for us today? Let me \nfocus on my State of Florida. There are currently 16 million acres of \nforested lands, making up 47 percent of the State's total land area. \nThe majority of this land--over 7 million acres--is owned by private \nfarmers and individual corporate landowners. The State of Florida is \ncontinuing to grow at an explosive pace. It already has over 15 million \npeople, and in 25 years it is projected to have over 20 million people. \nThis rapid growth is creating pressure on land values throughout \nFlorida and creating a circumstance in which there could be a massive \nconversion of this 7 million acres of privately owned timberland for \ndevelopment purposes.\n  These 7 million acres not only provide a substantial amount of forest \nproducts for the Nation but also provide critical habitats for a unique \ngroup of plants and animals.\n  These 7 million acres help to contain a human population explosion \nthat would create additional demands on the already scarce water supply \nin Florida and lead to degradation of water quality.\n  It is therefore in our Nation's interest to maintain Florida's \nexisting timber lands for community use.\n  This legislation provides a long-term plan to restore and protect \nprivate forestry lands damaged by wildfires and other natural \ndisasters. It directs the U.S. Department of Agriculture to act on its \nexisting authority to develop a crop insurance program for small \nforestry landowners.\n  This type of program--which allows producers to invest in their own \nfuture to protect themselves from natural disasters such as fires, \nhurricanes, or tornadoes--will provide the same protection for forestry \nproducers as is provided through USDA insurance plans for crops such as \nwheat or corn.\n  The availability of this support in times of disaster will provide \nincentives for private landowners to retain lands in forestry after \ndisasters such as the current wildfires that we are experiencing in \n1999.\n  The second part of our legislation will help to reduce the severity \nof future fire disasters by increasing the incentives for prescribed \nburning.\n  The State of Florida has an active prescribed burning program and \nburns an average of two million acres per year, including forestry, \ngrasslands, and agricultural lands.\n  However, as evidenced by this week's events, existing levels of \nprescribed burning are not enough.\n  Large quantities of brush fuel accompanied by drought have created \ndangerous wildfire conditions.\n  One solution is to increase the frequency of prescribed burning to \nreduce fuel levels and the severity of fires when they occur.\n  In a study conducted by the Florida Division of Forestry, Orlando \nDistrict, for the period 1981 to 1990, it was shown that an increase in \nprescribed burning leads to a decrease in the frequency of wildfires.\n  The study compared two counties--Osceola County and Brevard County \nwhich differ in the amount of prescribed burning they conduct.\n  Approximately five-hundred thousand acres are burned in Osceola \nCounty every 2 or 4 years. This compares with just over two-hundred and \nfifty thousand acres of lands in Brevard County on which prescribed \nburning is conducted.\n  The study found that the number of wildfires, the acres burned, and \nthe average wildfires per acre were lower in Osceola County than \nBrevard County.\n  Our legislation attempts to encourage the use of prescribed burning \nas a forest management tool on private lands.\n  First, it authorizes the U.S. Forest Service to provide both \ntechnical and financial assistance for prescribed burning to states.\n  Grants to pay up to 75 percent of the cost of carrying out prescribed \nburns would be made to private landowners.\n  Second, our legislation seeks to enhance public support for the use \nof prescribed fire by addressing one of the most challenging issues--\nthe misunderstanding of urban and suburban residents of the purpose of \nprescribed burning.\n  In the urban interface zone where much of Florida's forested lands \nare located, the opposition of local residents to smoke plumes can stop \nany efforts to conduct prescribed burning.\n  Our bill requires that the U.S. Forest Service and the Environmental \nProtection Agency develop education and outreach programs on this topic \nand make them available to state environmental and forest management \nagencies.\n  With these actions, this legislation will create a system to mitigate \ndamages from wildfires. It will help to reduce the severity of future \nfires by removing obstacles for private landowners to conduct \nprescribed burns.\n\n[[Page S4121]]\n\n  I hope you will join me in our long-term efforts to create a system \nfor mitigating damages from natural disasters and reducing the severity \nof future wildfires by encouraging prescribed burning.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two items be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The first is an April 18 article from the Miami Herald describing \nsome of the wildfire damage which occurred in that city last week.\n  The second is an Associated Press story summarizing remarks made by \nthe Secretary of the Interior supporting the use of prescribed burning \nat a wildlife conference in Gainesville, Florida this week.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, Apr. 18, 1999]\n\n               ``Huge Wave'' of Fire Stuns Port St. Lucie\n\n                           (By Curtis Morgan)\n\n       Port St. Lucie.--When Don Tagner pulled into his driveway \n     at 4 p.m., the faint smoke curling in the pine scrub looked \n     as harmless as late morning fog.\n       The fire seemed at a safe distance, a dozen blocks away. \n     But as a precaution he sent his daughters off with a \n     neighbor. Then he called around to cancel that evening's \n     soccer practice.\n       When a neighbor pounded on his door 30 minutes later, \n     Tagner opened it to a world he described as ``hell on a \n     rampage.''\n       Black smoke blotted out the sun. He ran to his backyard \n     just in time to recoil from a towering wall of fire rolling \n     in like ``a huge wave. It sounded like a subway coming \n     through. Whoosh.''\n       Like that, it engulfed Frank Schultz's home next door. \n     Tagner rushed back in his home, grabbed his car keys and as \n     he turned up a street toward safety, houses two blocks up San \n     Sebastian Avenue turned into roaring red balls.\n       For the hundreds who fled it and the hundreds who fought \n     it, Thursday's blaze truly was hellish, the wickedest, most \n     destructive one-day wildfire in Florida in almost 15 years.\n       In a bit more than four hours, it raced three miles north-\n     northeast from its starting point in southernmost Port St. \n     Lucie--destroying 43 homes, damaging 33 others and scorching \n     545 acres in the heavily wooded neighborhoods east of \n     Interstate 95.\n       ``I've seen them travel fast before but I've never seen \n     anything of this magnitude in the 16 years I've been fighting \n     fires,'' said a weary, soot-stained Lt. Mike Gablemann of the \n     St. Lucie County Fire District, who led a crew dousing \n     hundreds of hot spots Friday--including a smoldering file \n     cabinet in the Schultz home.\n\n\n                          drought index peaked\n\n       An unlucky combination of factors turned the small brush \n     fire into a full-blown inferno.\n       Like most of Florida, a record drought has left much of \n     rural St. Lucie County bone-dry and crisp as kindling.\n       ``Just look at the grass,'' said Gene Madden, safety \n     director for the state Division of Forestry. ``It's not \n     green, it's brown. It crunches when you walk on it.''\n       At 1 p.m. Thursday, forecasters warned Treasure Coast \n     counties that conditions for wildfires would peak that \n     afternoon.\n       When the blaze flared up, so did the winds. It was like \n     blowing on a hot coal.\n\n\n                              a fire storm\n\n       Fire crews rushing to contain the blaze battled to keep up, \n     but couldn't, Gabelmann said. They were outmanned and \n     outmaneuvered by the relentless winds. As quickly as trucks \n     pulled up to one house, flames would appear in treetops a \n     quarter of a mile away.\n       ``No fire department, no fire personnel are going to get \n     out in front of it and stop a fire like this,'' Madden said.\n       Fires leapt from point to point and house to house in a \n     path a mile wide, with destruction as unpredictable as wind \n     currents.\n       ``What we saw was the definition of a fire storm,'' said \n     Lt. Ron Parish of the St. Lucie County Fire District.\n       Firefighters were frustrated by their inability to do what \n     they normally do: Put out fires. This was more like triage. \n     Sometimes, they had to drive past one burning house to get to \n     another where they believed people were trapped.\n       ``Having to leave a house unprotected . . . gives you a \n     sick feeling,'' Parrish said.\n\n\n                         unpredictable pattern\n\n       The random patterns of damage showed just how difficult it \n     was to predict where the fires would turn next.\n       On one block, two homes back-to-back burned but a wooden \n     swing set between them wasn't even singed. Hundreds of brush-\n     choked undeveloped lots and wood-framed homes provided \n     plentiful fuel--enough for the fire to jump the 100-foot-wide \n     C-24 Canal.\n       Franklin Navas, a former firefighter from Costa Rica and \n     now an equipment manager, credited the survival of his home \n     to clearing brush a few feet behind his property line. Flames \n     left the vinyl siding on one side of his home drooping like \n     limp spaghetti--but the home stood.\n       Ironically, a large group of Port St. Lucie residents had \n     opposed bringing city water to their neighborhoods--and even \n     sued the town to block the process. Hydrants had been \n     scheduled for the area within two years.\n\n\n                         no time to get dressed\n\n       Navas and his wife, Mayra, and two sisters visiting from \n     New Jersey left at 4 p.m. as police began rolling through the \n     neighborhood ordering evacuations by loud-speakers.\n       ``Just in time,'' he said. As they pulled away, the flames \n     had hit the lot next door.\n       For many, there was little time to pack family papers or \n     heirlooms or even to get dressed.\n       Mike Azbell said his wife, Shelby, pulled children Marissa, \n     4, and Tyler, 2, into the car in a panic once she got word. \n     ``Tyler was running around the house naked and he left \n     naked.''\n       At 5 p.m., Florida Power & Light shut off power to about \n     5,000 customers--a move to protect firefighters from live, \n     fallen wires. it also left remaining homeowners defenseless. \n     Without power, their pumps couldn't pull water from their \n     wells for the garden hoses that some tried to use in mostly \n     fruitless efforts to halt flames.\n       Outside the roadblocks, homeowners worried about what they \n     would find when they returned or pitched in to help others \n     protect their homes.\n       About 50 evacuees gathered at Mike Schachter's house a \n     block outside the cordoned-off area. Some helped hose down \n     his house, while Schachter's mother, Barbara, fed others and \n     baby-sat panicky children--including Mike's son, who \n     celebrated his first birthday that night.\n       ``Everyone just tried to help everyone else,'' Mike \n     Schachter said.\n\n\n                          surveying the damage\n\n       By 7:30 that night, man and nature combined to tame the \n     wildfire.\n       `'Mother Nature started it and Mother Nature pinched it \n     off,'' Madden said.\n       Local firefighters managed with the help of crews that came \n     from as far south as Hollywood and vital reinforcements from \n     water-bearing helicopters and a tanker plane.\n       Several hundred residents spent the night in a Red Cross \n     shelter at the Port St. Lucie Community Center. At daylight \n     on Friday residents returned to neighborhoods that, while \n     devastated in spots, could have been hit much worse. No one \n     was killed or hurt and the number of homes that escaped \n     damage far outnumbered those lost.\n       Martha Brann began crying when she thought about all she \n     lost: photos of her children, her mother's gold wedding band \n     and the diamond ring from her former husband--mementos \n     representing the special people in her life.\n       ``I couldn't get nothing,'' said Brann, 59.\n       But Tagner found all: His wood-framed home remained almost \n     as he had left it. Grass had burned to within a foot of his \n     patio and he lost two plastic garbage cans and a recycling \n     bin, which, as it burned, slightly charred a small section of \n     his garage.\n       ``Everybody keeps asking me what my secret was,'' he said. \n     ``It was just luck.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  Babbitt Advocates Prescribed Burning\n\n       Gainesville, Fla. (AP)--State and local governments need to \n     get more aggressive in preventing wildfires by using \n     prescribed burns, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said \n     Tuesday.\n       ``By taking fire off the land, we've actually increased the \n     fire hazard,'' Babbitt said. ``We must abandon a warfare \n     suppression model and find a thoughtful, scientific, \n     cooperative way to acknowledge this force of nature and \n     harness it to provide a better balance on the landscape.''\n       In addition to the controlled burns, which are \n     intentionally set fires ignited to reduce fuel for wildfires, \n     Babbitt also advocated requiring stringent building \n     requirements that help fireproof communities.\n       Babbitt, whose office oversees national parkland, spoke to \n     about 300 foresters at the University of Florida's John Gray \n     Distinguished Lecture Series.\n       Babbitt said most legislators haven't done enough to plan \n     for prescribed burns and push private property owners to act.\n       ``In Oakland, Calif., after the fire in the early '90s \n     which just about wiped out the city, Alameda County actually \n     passed an ordinance requiring brush control,'' Babbitt said.\n       ``For landowners who didn't do it, the county would do it \n     and add the costs to their property taxes. I don't know if \n     that's the right answer, but it's a way to do it,'' he said.\n       In Florida, the state's Division of Forestry said it has \n     authorized prescribed burns for 700,000 acres of land this \n     year.\n       There is no statewide plan for specific prescribed burns, \n     though private and public landowners have their own plans. A \n     state forestry official said landowners are encouraged to \n     perform prescribed burns, but they can't be forced.\n       ``We can designate areas as high fire hazards and by \n     designating that we can burn it for them, but we can't tell \n     them that they're going to burn one-third of their acreage,'' \n     said Jim Brenner, fire management administrator for the \n     forestry division.\n       As for fireproofing communities, Babbitt said local \n     governments need to ensure that homes get built with fire \n     resistant roofing. He also said the homes should be far \n     enough away from thick woods and hanging trees, such as \n     pines, to prevent damage from an approaching fire.\n       Babbitt also said if Florida's fires tap the state's \n     firefighting resources, federal authorities will help provide \n     the needed manpower and equipment.\n\n[[Page S4122]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Roth, and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 870. A bill to amend the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. \nApp.) to increase the efficiency and accountability of Offices of the \nInspector General within Federal departments, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                         INSPECTOR GENERAL ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Inspector \nGeneral Act Amendments of 1999. I am very pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues, Senators Roth, Grassley, and Bond, who have demonstrated \nunparalleled leadership on IG issues in the Senate. Indeed, Senator \nRoth is one of the architects of the inspector general law, having \nadvocated its creation in 1978 and, in 1982, having introduced \nlegislation that created IGs in the Departments of Defense, Justice, \nand the Treasury. In such distinguished company, I am confident that my \nlegislation hits the mark of improving an already invaluable program.\n  As chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, one of \nmy top priorities since coming to the Senate has been the seemingly \nnever-ending fight against waste, fraud, and abuse. We have all heard \nthe horror stories of $500 hammers and roads built to nowhere. The \nwaste of scarce Federal resources not only picks the pockets of \ntaxpayers, but also places severe financial pressures on already \noverburdened programs, in some cases forcing cutbacks in the delivery \nof vital Government services.\n  Over the past 2 years in my capacity as the subcommittee's chairman, \nI have seen disturbing fraud and waste firsthand in a wide variety of \nprograms. Last year, for example, the subcommittee held several \nhearings to shine a spotlight on the massive fraud in the Medicare \nProgram. To cite just one example of the subcommittee's findings, our \ninvestigation revealed that the Federal Government had been sending \nMedicare checks to 14 fraudulent health care companies. These companies \nprovided absolutely no services to our senior citizens at all. Indeed, \nthe address listed by one such company did not even exist, and if it \nhad existed, it would have been located in the middle of the runway of \nthe Miami International Airport.\n  The fraud we uncovered was stunning. It costs taxpayers millions of \ndollars each year, diverting scarce resources from the elderly and \nlegitimate health care providers in a program already under enormous \nfinancial strain.\n  The Medicare fraud investigation and others like it were undertaken \nby my subcommittee working hand in hand with the inspectors general for \na variety of Federal agencies. The inspectors general are charged with \nidentifying and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in Federal programs \nadministered by the agencies they monitor.\n  Last year marked the 20th anniversary of the IG Act, the law that \nCongress passed to create these guardians of the public purse. As we \nrecognize this important milestone, it is important for Congress to \ntake a close look at the IG system. We must build on its strengths and \nremedy its weaknesses.\n  Over the past 21 years, the inspector general community has grown \nfrom 12 in 1978 to 58 inspectors general today. Offices of Inspectors \nGeneral receive more than a billion dollars in annual funding and \nemploy over 12,000 auditors, criminal investigators, and support \npersonnel. Each Office of Inspector General shoulders tremendous \nresponsibilities and is given considerable power to uncover waste, \nfraud, and abuse within Federal programs.\n  By and large, the IG community has performed in an outstanding \nmanner. IGs have made thousands of recommendations to Congress, \nultimately saving taxpayers billions of dollars. Inspectors general \nhave conducted investigations that have resulted in the recovery of \nhundreds of millions of dollars from companies and individuals who have \ndefrauded the Federal Government.\n  The inspectors general have a demonstrated record of success over the \npast 20 years. But as with all Government entities, we must ensure that \nthe IG community is as well-managed, accountable, and effective as \npossible. IGs are public watchdogs, but they, too, must be watched. \nWith these principles in mind and drawing on my extensive work with the \ninspectors general over the past 2 years, I am today introducing \nlegislation to improve the accountability, independence, and efficiency \nof the inspectors general program.\n\n  The legislation I am introducing is designed to increase the \naccountability of inspectors general while retaining and, in some \naspects, strengthening the provisions in law that guarantee their \nindependence from the agencies they oversee.\n  My bill establishes a renewable 9-year term of office for each of the \ninspectors general who are appointed by the President and confirmed by \nthe Senate. Currently, Presidential IGs serve for an indeterminate \nterm.\n  The IG community has testified that having a fixed term of office \nwould provide them with the assurances they need to be able to perform \ntheir vital but, in some cases, unpopular oversight responsibilities in \na more independent environment.\n  The 9-year term also would enhance IG autonomy because it would \nextend beyond two Presidential administrations.\n  There has been considerable turnover in some of the IG positions, and \nthe establishment of a fixed term would also encourage inspectors \ngeneral to serve for longer periods of time, thus, adding experience to \nthe IG community. Finally, by providing a defined term of service, an \nappropriate framework is provided for the evaluation of the performance \nof each IG to determine if re-appointment is warranted. Thus, Mr. \nPresident, the 9-year term I am proposing would both enhance the \nindependence of the IGs while improving their accountability.\n  My legislation also takes steps to streamline the IG offices \nthemselves, making them more efficient and flexible, by consolidating \nexisting offices and by reducing the frequency with which IGs must \nprepare and file resource-intensive reports.\n  Some of the IGs' offices that exist today are very small, with just a \nhandful of employees. They could be made more efficient and effective \nby transferring their functions to larger IG offices that oversee \nsimilar programs.\n  For example, my legislation consolidates the current stand-alone \noffice of the Federal Labor Relations Authority IG, which has just one \nemployee, into the Office of Personnel Management, thus eliminating \nunnecessary overhead and bureaucracy but continuing the vital audit and \noversight capacity of both agencies. In total, three existing small \nIGs' offices would be consolidated into the IG offices of major \ndepartments and two smaller IG offices would be consolidated into one \noffice.\n  Currently, Mr. President, the Offices of Inspectors General are \nrequired by law to provide semiannual reports to Congress. To increase \nthe value of these reports, I am reducing this requirement to a single \nannual report and streamlining the information presented. In this way, \nCongress can focus on high-risk areas before they get worse and before \nthe problems become more difficult to solve.\n  Mr. President, the inspectors general have made very valuable \ncontributions to the efficient operation of the Federal Government. \nTheir record, however, is not without blemish. For example, the \ncommunity's record was tarnished by the activities of the inspector \ngeneral at the Department of Treasury. After an extensive \ninvestigation, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found this \nparticular IG violated Federal contract laws in her award of two \nnoncompetitive, sole source contracts.\n  These actions not only wasted thousands of dollars but also shook the \nconfidence of Congress, the agency, and the public in the IG's ability \nto operate with the highest degree of integrity. It was extremely \ndisturbing to find that this inspector general was herself guilty of \nwasting resources and abusing the public trust. At the conclusion of \nour investigation, one could not help but wonder, who is watching the \nwatchdogs?\n  Let me emphasize, Mr. President, that in my view, problems like the \nones we uncovered in the Treasury Department are very unusual. They are \nnot characteristic of the IG community. They are not widespread. \nHowever, because the inspectors general are the very officials in the \nGovernment responsible for combating waste, fraud, and abuse, they \nshould be held\n\n[[Page S4123]]\n\nto the very highest ethical standards. Even one example of impropriety \nis cause for concern.\n  To increase accountability, my legislation requires independent \nexternal reviews of each IG office every 3 years. It gives each office \nthe flexibility to choose the most efficient method of review, but it \ndoes require that the watchdogs themselves submit to oversight by a \nqualified third party. This provision is intended to help ensure public \nconfidence in the management and the efficiency of the IG offices and \nwill provide valuable guidance to Congress in fulfilling our oversight \nresponsibilities.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that the National Commission \non the Separation of Powers has endorsed my recommendation that such an \nindependent, external review be conducted of each IG office. The \nCommission is a bipartisan committee sponsored by the Miller Center for \nPublic Affairs at the University of Virginia, and includes among its \nmembers former Senator Howard Baker, former White House Counsel Lloyd \nCutler, former U.S. Attorney William Barr, former Secretary of State \nLawrence Eagleburger, and former Director of Central Intelligence \nWilliam Webster. I am very proud that my proposal has been endorsed by \nsuch an esteemed organization.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today represents a major \nstep toward improving the effectiveness, the independence, and the \naccountability of the inspectors general program. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in this effort to strengthen and improve the inspectors \ngeneral program as we approach the next century.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 871. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to ensure \nthat veterans of the United States Armed Forces are eligible for \ndiscretionary relief from detention, deportation, exclusion, and \nremoval, and for other reasons; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               fairness to immigrant veterans act of 1999\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould ensure that veterans of the United States Armed Forces are not \nsummarily deported from this country. This bill would correct a grave \ninjustice wrought by the recent changes in immigration policy, which \nhas resulted in decorated war veterans being deported without any \nadministrative or judicial consideration of the equities.\n  Under the immigration ``reform'' legislation enacted in 1996, \nCongress passed and the President endorsed a broad expansion of the \ndefinition of what makes a legal resident deportable. In the rush to be \nthe toughest on illegal immigration, the bill also vastly limited \nrelief from deportation and imposed mandatory detention for thousands \nof permanent residents in deportation proceedings.\n  The zealousness of Congress and the White House to be tough on aliens \nhas successfully snared permanent residents who have spilled their \nblood for our country. As the INS prepares to deport these American \nveterans, we have not even been kind enough to thank them for their \nservice with a hearing to listen to their story and consider whether, \njust possibly, their military service or other life circumstances \noutweighs the government's interest in deporting them.\n  Here is the cold and ugly side of our ``tough'' immigration policies. \nHere are the human consequences of legislating by 30-second political \nad. Unfortunately the checks and balances of our government have failed \nthese veterans because Congress and this Administration are determined \nnot to be outdone by each other. ``Tough'' in this case means blinding \nourselves to the personal consequences of these people. It means \nsubstituting discretion with a cold rubber stamp that can only say \n``no.''\n  Our national policy on deportation of veterans is particularly \noutrageous at a time when we are sending tens of thousands of U.S. \nservicemen and women, including untold numbers of permanent residents, \ninto harms way. Why has Congress asked the INS to devote its limited \nresources to hunting down non-citizens who previously answered this \ncountry's call to duty, some of whom were permanently disabled in the \ncourse of their service?\n  Interestingly, it appears that even the INS agrees that military \nservice or other life circumstances may, on occasion, outweigh the \ngovernment's interest in deportation. In one recent case, which I \nbrought to the attention of INS Commissioner Meissner, the INS \neventually reached this conclusion. I am honored if my intervention \nplayed a part in obtaining some semblance of justice for Sergeant \nRafael Ramirez and his family. However, Sergeant Ramirez's example \nconfirms the need to ensure that every veteran's case is carefully \nreviewed by an immigration judge empowered to do justice.\n  The legislation that I introduce today restores for veterans the \nopportunity to go before an immigration judge to present the equities \nof their case and to have a Federal court review any deportation \ndecision. It also provides veterans with an opportunity to be released \nfrom detention while their case is under consideration.\n  The injustice addressed by this bill is just one egregious example of \nhow recent immigration ``reform'' has resulted in the break-up of \nAmerican families and the deportation of people who have contributed to \nour country. This Congress needs to address the broader injustices that \nour prior one-upmanship caused. In the meantime, this bill is an \nimportant step in the right direction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Abraham, \n        Mr. Levin, and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 872. A bill to impose certain limits on the receipt of out-of-\nState municipal solid waste, to authorize State and local controls over \nthe flow of municipal solid waste, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\nmunicipal solid waste interstate transportation and local authority act \n                                of 1999\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nalong with my colleague, Senator Bayh, that will allow states to \nfinally obtain relief from the seemingly endless stream of solid waste \nthat is flowing into states like Ohio and Indiana and many others.\n  Our bill, ``the Municipal Solid Waste Interstate Transportation and \nLocal Authority Act,'' gives state and local governments the tools they \nneed to limit garbage imports from other states and manage their own \nwaste within their own states.\n  Ohio receives about 1.4 million tons of municipal solid waste \nannually from other states. While I am pleased that these shipments \nhave been reduced since our record high of 3.7 million tons in 1989, I \nbelieve it is still entirely too high.\n  Because it is cheap and because it is expedient, other states have \nsimply put their garbage on trains or on trucks and shipped it to \nstates like Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia. This is \nwrong and it has to stop.\n  Many state and local governments have worked hard to develop \nstrategies to reduce waste and plan for future disposal needs. As \nGovernor of Ohio, I worked aggressively to limit shipments of out-of-\nstate waste into Ohio through voluntary cooperation of Ohio landfill \noperators and agreements with other states. We saw limited relief. But \nhonestly Mr. President, Ohio has no assurance that our out-of-state \nwaste numbers won't rise significantly with the upcoming closure of the \nFresh Kills landfill on Staten Island in 2001.\n  However, the federal courts have prevented states from enacting laws \nto protect our natural resources. What has emerged is an unnatural \npattern where Ohio and other states--both importing and exporting--have \ntried to take reasonable steps to encourage conservation and local \ndisposal, only to be undermined by a barrage of court decisions at \nevery turn.\n  Quite frankly, state and local governments' hands are tied. Lacking a \nspecific delegation of authority from Congress, states that have acted \nresponsibly to implement environmentally sound waste disposal plans and \nrecycling programs are still being subjected to a flood of out-of-state \nwaste. In Ohio, this has undermined our recycling efforts because \nOhioans continue to ask why they should recycle to conserve landfill \nspace when it is being used for other states' trash. Our citizens \nalready have to live with the consequences of large amounts of out-of-\n\n[[Page S4124]]\n\nstate waste--increased noise, traffic, wear and tear on our roads and \nlitter that is blown onto private homes, schools and businesses.\n  Ohio and many other states have taken comprehensive steps to protect \nour resources and address a significant environmental threat. However, \nexcessive, uncontrolled waste disposal in other states has limited the \nability of Ohioans to protect their environment, health and safety. I \ndo not believe the commerce clause requires us to service other states \nat the expense of our own citizens' efforts.\n  A national solution is long overdue. When I became Governor of Ohio \nin 1991, I joined a coalition with other Midwest Governors--Governor \nBayh (now Senator Bayh), Governor Engler and Governor Casey, and later \nGovernors Ridge and O'Bannon--to try to pass effective interstate waste \nand flow control legislation.\n  In 1996, Midwest Governors were asked to reach an agreement with \nGovernors Whitman and Pataki on interstate waste provisions. Our states \nquickly came to an agreement with New Jersey--the second largest \nexporting state--on interstate waste provisions. We began discussions \nwith New York, but these were put on hold indefinitely in the wake of \ntheir May, 1996 announcement to close the Fresh Kills landfill.\n  The bill that Senator Bayh and I are introducing today reflects the \nagreement that our two states, along with Michigan and Pennsylvania, \nreached with Governor Whitman.\n  For Ohio, the most important aspect of this bill is the ability for \nstates to limit future waste flows. For instance, they would have the \noption to set a ``permit cap,'' which would allow a state to impose a \npercentage limit on the amount of out-of-state waste that a new \nfacility or expansion of an existing facility could receive annually. \nOr, a state could choose a provision giving them the authority to deny \na permit for a new facility if it is determined that there is not a \nlocal or in-state regional need for that facility.\n  These provisions provide assurances to Ohio and other states that new \nfacilities will not be built primarily for the purpose of receiving \nout-of-state waste. For instance, Ohio EPA had to issue a permit for a \nlandfill that was bidding to take 5,000 tons of garbage a day--\napproximately 1.5 million tons a year--from Canada alone, which would \nhave doubled the amount of out-of-state waste entering Ohio. Thankfully \nthis landfill lost the Canadian bid. Ironically though, the waste \ncompany put their plans on hold to build the facility because there is \nnot enough need for the facility in the state and they need to ensure a \nsteady out-of-state waste flow to make the plan feasible.\n  With the announcement to close the Fresh Kills landfill, it is even \nmore critical to Ohio that states should receive the authority to place \nlimits on new facilities and expansions of existing facilities. The \nCongressional Research Service estimates that when Fresh Kills closes, \nthere will be an additional 13,200 tons of garbage each day diverted to \nother facilities. However, CRS also points out that there is only about \n1,200 tons per day of capacity available in the entire state of New \nYork. Even if New York handles some of that 13,200 tons a day in-state, \nit is estimated that about 4 million tons per year will still need to \nbe managed outside the state from that landfill alone.\n\n  In addition, this bill would ensure that landfills and incinerators \ncould not receive trash from other states until local governments \napprove its receipt. States also could freeze their out-of-state waste \nat 1993 levels, while some states would be able to reduce these levels \nto 65 percent by the year 2006. This bill also allows states to reduce \nthe amount of construction and demolition debris they receive by 50 \npercent in 2007 at the earliest.\n  States also could impose up to a $3-per-ton cost recovery surcharge \non out-of-state waste. This fee would help provide states with the \nfunding necessary to implement solid waste management programs.\n  And finally, the bill grants limited flow control authority in order \nfor municipalities to pay off existing bonds and guarantee a dedicated \nwaste stream for landfills or incinerators.\n  Flow control is important to states like New Jersey, which has taken \naggressive steps to try to manage all of its trash within its borders \nby the year 2000. New Jersey communities have acted responsibly to \nbuild disposal facilities to help meet that goal. However, if Congress \nfails to protect existing flow control authorities, repayment of the \noutstanding $1.9 billion investment in New Jersey alone will be \njeopardized.\n  I am deeply concerned that responsible decisions made by Ohio, New \nJersey and other states have been undermined and have put potentially \nlarge financial burdens on communities and have encouraged exporting \nstates to pass their trash problems onto the backs of others.\n  Twenty-four Governors, including Governor Whitman, and the Western \nGovernors' Association have sent letters to Congress strongly \nsupporting the provisions that are in our bill.\n  Unfortunately, efforts to place reasonable restrictions on out-of-\nstate waste shipments have been perceived by some as an attempt to ban \nall out-of-state trash. On the contrary, Senator Bayh and I are not \nasking for outright authority for states to prohibit all out-of-state \nwaste, nor are we seeking to prohibit waste from any one state.\n  We are asking for reasonable tools that will enable state and local \ngovernments to act responsibly to manage their own waste and limit \nunreasonable waste imports from other states. Such measures would give \nsubstantial authority to limit imports and plan facilities around our \nown states' needs.\n  I believe the time is right to move an effective interstate waste \nbill. The bill we are introducing today is a consensus of importing and \nexporting states--states that have willingly come forward to offer a \nreasonable solution.\n  Congress must act this year to give citizens in Ohio and other \naffected states the relief they need from the truckloads of waste \npassing through their communities. We have waited too long for a \nsolution. Congress must act now to prevent this problem from spreading \nfurther to our neighbors out West and to help our neighbors in the East \nbetter manage the trash they generate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill and a letter \nfrom Governors O'Bannon, Taft, Engler and Whitman and one from Governor \nRidge be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 872\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This legislation would \n     at long last give state and local governments federal \n     authority to establish reasonable limitations on the flow of \n     interstate waste and protect public investments in waste \n     disposal facilities needed to address in-state disposal \n     needs.\n       Both of you know firsthand the problems states face in \n     managing solid waste, as required by federal law.

The need for such \n     legislation arose from various U.S. Supreme Court rulings \n     applying the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution to \n     state laws restricting out-of-state waste and directing the \n     flow of solid waste shipments.\n       We are committed to working with all states and building \n     upon the broad state support which exists to pass legislation \n     in the 106th Congress that will provide a balanced set of \n     controls for state and local governments to use in limiting \n     out-of-state waste shipments and directing intrastate \n     shipments. The need for congressional action on interstate \n     waste/flow control legislation is becoming more urgent. Last \n     year, the Congressional Research Service reported that its \n     most recent data showed interstate waste shipments increasing \n     to a total of over 25 million tons. The closing of the Fresh \n     Kills landfill in New York City is likely to dramatically \n     increase that figure.\n       Your bill includes provisions which we believe are \n     important for state and local governments such as the general \n     requirement that local officials formally approve the receipt \n     of out-of-state municipal solid waste\n\n[[Page S4131]]\n\n     prior to disposal in landfills and incinerators. The \n     legislation does include a number of important exemptions for \n     current flows of waste. It also provides authority for states \n     to establish a statewide freeze of waste shipments or, in \n     some cases, implement reductions. In addition, the \n     legislation explicitly authorizes states to implement laws \n     requiring an assessment of regional and local needs before \n     issuing facility permits or establishing statewide out-of-\n     state percentage limitations for new or expanded facilities.\n       The legislation would also allow states to impose a $3-per-\n     ton cost recovery surcharge on out-of-state waste and would \n     provide additional authority for states to reduce the flow of \n     noncontaminated construction and demolition debris. Under a \n     separate set of provisions, states would also be authorized \n     to exercise limited flow control authority necessary to \n     protect public investments.\n       We recognize that the Municipal Solid Waste Interstate \n     Transportation and Local Authority Act of 1999 would not \n     establish an outright ban on out-of-state waste shipments; \n     instead, it would gives states and localities the tools they \n     need to better manage their in-state waste disposal needs and \n     protect important natural resources.

Mr. President, states have been struggling for years to \nensure safe, responsible management of out-of-state municipal solid \nwaste. As Governor of Indiana, I tried to ensure that Indiana's \ndisposal capacity would meet Indiana's municipal solid waste needs. \nEfforts to institute effective waste management policies were--and \ncontinue to be--thwarted by two obstacles. The first is the massive and \nunpredictable amounts of out-of-state waste flowing into state disposal \nfacilities. States' attempts to address that problem run into the \nsecond obstacle. The Supreme Court has established, in a series of \nopinions, that Congress must first provide the states the authority to \nregulate interstate waste.\n  I rise with my colleague today to introduce legislation to do just \nthat.\n  Senator Voinovich and I, as Governors, participated in a cooperative \neffort to develop a set of principles for federal action on interstate \nwaste. The Voinovich/Bayh interstate waste control bill is based on \nthose principles. Mr. President, the need for controls in interstate \nwaste is even more acute today than when I was a Governor. Current \ngovernors supporting our bill know this better than anyone.\n  In Indiana, waste imports are again on the rise. After decreasing \nfrom 1992 to 1994, waste imports increased significantly in 1995 and \ndoubled in 1996. Between 1996 and 1998, out-of state waste received by \nIndiana facilities increased by 32 percent to their highest level in \nthe last seven years. In fact, in 1998, 2.8 million tons of out-of-\nstate waste were disposed of in Indiana--that's 19 percent of all the \nwaste disposed of in Indiana's landfills. Our Department of \nEnvironmental Management has predicted that the state will run out of \nlandfill space in 2011--or earlier, so the time for action is now.\n  Senator Voinovich and I believe we have crafted a comprehensive, \nequitable approach to interstate waste management. Our bill will give \nstates the power to ensure manageable and predictable waste flows by \nfreezing waste imports at 1993 levels. States bearing the greatest \nburden of interstate waste--those that disposed of more than 650,000 \ntons in 1993--could reduce imported waste to 65 percent of the 1993 \nlevel by 2006. Our bill will give states the power to set a percentage \nlimitation on the amount of out-of-state waste that new or expanding \nfacilities could receive and give states the option to deny a permit to \na new or expanding facility if there is no regional or in-state need \nfor the facility. Local governments would have more power to determine \nwhether they want to accept out-of-state waste. They would be able to \nprohibit local disposal facilities that didn't receive out-of-state \nwaste in 1993 from starting to take it until the local government \napproved. This presumptive ban on interstate waste would not interfere \nwith facilities operating under existing host community agreements or \npermits.\n  This bill is the culmination of the work we did as Governors and the \ncoalition we are building as Senators. It attempts to forge a new and \nworkable compromise between the needs and rights of importing and \nexporting states and gives the people who must live with waste planning \ndecisions the power to make them. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to move this important legislation forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Landrieu, \n        Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 873.

A bill to amend the Emergency Planning and Community Right-\nTo-Know Act of 1986 to cover Federal facilities; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n         federal facilities community right to know act of 1999\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation--\nthe Federal Facilities Community Right-To-Know Act of 1999--which \nprovides that the federal government is held to the same reporting \nrequirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know \nAct (EPCRA) of 1986 as private entities. In 1986, Congress directed the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a national inventory \nto inform the public about chemicals used and released in their \ncommunities. Since enactment of the Emergency Planning and Community \nRight-To-Know Act, manufactures have been required to keep extensive \nrecords on how they use and store hazardous chemicals and report \nreleases of\n\n[[Page S4110]]\n\nhundreds of hazardous chemicals annually. EPA compiles the reported \ninformation into the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI).\n  The Toxic Release Inventory is a publicly available data base \ncontaining specific chemical release and transfer information from \nmanufacturing facilities throughout the United States. The TRI is \nintended to promote planning for chemical emergencies and to provide \ninformation to the public regarding the presence and release of toxic \nand hazardous chemicals in their communities.\n  In August 1993, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12856, which \nrequired Federal facilities to begin submitting TRI reports beginning \nin calendar year 1994 activities. I commend President Clinton for \ntaking this action. However, this executive order does not have the \nforce of law and could be changed by a future Administration. The \nNational Governors Association's policy on federal facilities states \nthat ``Congress should ensure that federal and state `right to know' \nrequirements apply to federal facilities.'' My legislation simply \namends the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act to cover \nfederal facilities. It is important for the Federal government to \nprotect the environment and its citizens from hazardous substances. \nPeople living near federal facilities have the right to know what \nhazardous substances are being released into the environment by these \nfacilities so they can better protect themselves and their children \nfrom these potential threats. It is my strong belief that federal \nfacilities should be treated the same as private entities. My \nlegislation attempts to move us closer towards that goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 859. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require a \nrefund value for certain beverage containers, to provide resources for \nState pollution prevention and recycling programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n      national beverage container reuse and recycling act of 1999\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of Earth Day \nto introduce the National Beverage Container Reuse and Recycling Act of \n1999. I introduce this bill again today because I firmly believe that \ndeposit laws are a common sense, proven method to increase recycling, \nsave energy, create jobs, and decrease the generation of waste and \nproliferation of landfills. Unfortunately, recycling rates for beverage \ncontainers have recently dropped, making this legislation even more \nimportant.\n  The experience of ten states, including Vermont, attest to the \nsuccess of a deposit law or bottle bill as it is commonly called. The \nrecycling rates in these states for aluminum cans is 80 percent, while \nthe overall national average in 1998 was only 55 percent. Cans recycled \nin deposit states accounted for half of all cans recycled in the \ncountry during this period. Although a national recycling rate of 55 \npercent may seem significant, every three seconds, 14,000 aluminum cans \nare discarded as waste.\n  Such waste is rapidly overflowing landfills, washing up on our \nbeaches, and piling up on our roadways. Our country's solid waste \nproblems are very real, and they will continue to haunt us until we \ntake action. The throw-away ethic that has emerged in this country is \nnot insurmountable, and recycling is part of the solution.\n  The concept of a national bottle bill is simple: to provide the \nconsumer with an incentive to return the container for reuse of \nrecycling. Consumers pay a nominal cost per bottle or can when \npurchasing a beverage and are refunded their money when they bring the \ncontainer back either to a retailer or redemption center. Retailers are \npaid a fee for their participation in the program, and any unclaimed \ndeposits are used to finance state environmental programs.\n  Under my proposal, a 10-cent deposit on certain beverage containers \nwould take effect in states which have beverage container recovery \nrates of less than 70 percent, the minimum recovery rate achieved by \nexisting bottle bill states. Labels showing the deposit value would be \naffixed to containers, and retailers would receive a 2-cent fee per \ncontainer for their participation in the program.\n  This legislation I introduce today is consistent with our nation's \nsolid waste management objectives. A national bottle bill would reduce \nsolid waste and litter, save natural resources and energy, and create a \nmuch needed partnership between consumers, industry, and local \ngovernments. I urge my colleagues to join these ten states, including \nVermont, and support a nation-wide bottle deposit law. Because for our \nchildren, the health of the planet may be our most enduring legacy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Mack, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. \n        Levin):\n  S. 860. A bill to require country of origin labeling of perishable \nagricultural commodities imported into the United States and to \nestablish penalties for violations of the labeling requirements; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                 imported produce labeling act of 1999\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould require country of origin labeling of perishable agricultural \ncommodities imported into the United States. I offer the ``Imported \nProduce Labeling Act'' to ensure that Americans know the origin of \nevery orange, banana, tomato, cucumber, and green pepper on display in \nthe grocery store.\n  For two decades, Floridians shopping at their local grocery stores \nhave been able to make educated choices about the food products they \npurchase for their families. In 1979, in my first year as Governor, I \nproudly signed legislation to make country of origin labels commonplace \nin produce sections all over Florida. This labeling requirement has \nproven to be neither complicated nor burdensome for Florida's farmers \nor retailers.\n  Country of origin labeling is not new to the American marketplace. \nFor decades, ``Made In'' labels have been as visible as price tags on \nclothes, toys, television sets, watches, and many other products. It \nmakes little sense that such labels are nowhere to be found in the \nproduce section of grocery stores in the vast majority of states.\n  The current lack of identifying information on produce means that \nAmericans who wish to heed government health warnings about foreign \nproducts or who have justifiable concerns about other nations' labor, \nenvironmental, and agricultural standards are powerless to choose other \nperishables. In fact, according to nationwide surveys, between 74 and \n83 percent of consumers favor mandatory country of origin labeling for \nfresh produce.\n  This is a low-cost, common sense method of informing consumers, as \nretailers will simply be asked to provide this information by means of \na label, stamp, or placard. Implementation of this practice in Florida \nresulted in an estimated cost of only $10 monthly per grocery store, a \nremarkably small price to pay to provide American consumers with the \ninformation they need to make informed produce purchases.\n  In addition, a study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that \ntwenty-six of our key trading partners require country of origin \nlabeling for fresh fruits and vegetables. By adopting this amendment, \nour law will become more consistent with the laws of our global trading \npartners.\n  Consumers have the right to know basic information about the fruits \nand vegetables that they bring home to their families. Congress can \ntake a major step toward achieving this simple goal by passing the \n``Imported Produce Labeling Act,'' thereby restoring American shoppers' \nability to make an informed decision.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Reed, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 861. A bill to designate certain Federal land in the State of Utah \nas wilderness, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n                   AMERICA'S RED ROCK WILDERNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing America's Red Rock \nWilderness Act to protect an important part of our nation's natural \nheritage. America's Red Rock Wilderness Act\n\n[[Page S4111]]\n\ndesignates 9.1 million acres of public land in Utah as wilderness.\n  Passage of America's Red Rock Wilderness Act is essential to protect \na national treasure for future generations of Americans. It provides \nwilderness protection for magnificent canyons, red rock cliffs and rock \nformations unlike any on earth. The lands included in this legislation \ncontain steep slick rock canyons, high cliffs offering spectacular \nvistas of rare rock formations, desert lands, important archeological \nsites, and habitat for rare plant and animal species.\n  The areas designated for wilderness protection in America's Red Rock \nWilderness Act are based on a detailed inventory of lands managed by \nthe Bureau of Land Management conducted by volunteers from the Utah \nWilderness Coalition. Between 1996 and 1998, UWC volunteers and staff \nsurveyed thousands of square miles of BLM land, taking over 50,000 \nphotos and compiling documentation to ensure that these areas meet \nfederal wilderness criteria.\n  As a result of this inventory, an additional 3.4 million acres not \nincluded in earlier Utah wilderness bills have been added to the \nwilderness designations in America's Red Rock Wilderness Act. Most of \nthe areas added to the bill are in the remote Great Basin deserts in \nthe western portion of the state and the red rock canyons in Southern \nUtah, which had not been included in earlier inventories.\n  Recently, BLM completed a re-inventory of approximately 6 million \nacres of federal land which had been proposed for wilderness \ndesignation in previous wilderness bills. The results provide a \nconvincing confirmation of the inventory conducted by UWC volunteers. \nOf the 6 million acres it re-inventoried, BLM found that 5.8 million \nacres qualified for wilderness consideration. Almost all of these lands \nare included in America's Red Rock Wilderness Act.\n  Theodore Roosevelt once stated, ``The Nation behaves well if it \ntreats the natural resources as assets which it must turn over to the \nnext generation increased and not impaired in value.'' Unfortunately, \nthese fragile, scenic lands in Utah are threatened by oil, gas and \nmining interests, destructive use by off-road vehicles, increased \ncommercial development, and proposals to construct roads, communication \ntowers, transmission lines, and dams. We must act now to protect these \nlands for future generations.\n  America's Red Rock Wilderness Act is supported by a broad coalition \nof over 150 environmental, conservation, and recreational organizations \nand citizen groups. In independent television and newspaper surveys and \npublic hearings on this issue, the citizens of Utah also have expressed \noverwhelming support for a strong wilderness bill.\n  Yesterday was John Muir's birthday. He observed that ``Thousands of \ntired, nerve-shaken, over-civilized people are beginning to find out \nthat going to the mountains is going home; that wilderness is a \nnecessity; that mountain parks and reservations are useful not only as \nfountains of timber and irrigating rivers, but as fountains of life.'' \nAmerica's Red Rock Wilderness Act honors his vision.\n  The preservation of our nation's vital natural resources will be one \nof our most important legacies. I urge my colleagues to join me as a \ncosponsor of this important bill to protect the America's Red Rock \nWilderness area in Utah for future generations.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join the Senator \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Durbin) as an original co-sponsor of legislation to \ndesignate 9.1 million acres of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands in \nUtah as wilderness.\n  Though this is the second time this particular measure has been \nintroduced in this body, this year's legislation has been substantially \nrevised. As the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin) has already \ndescribed, these revisions have been made on the basis of a citizen-led \nre-inventory of the wilderness quality lands that remain on BLM lands \nin Utah.\n  During the April recess I had an opportunity to travel to Utah. I \nviewed firsthand some of the lands that would be designated for \nwilderness under Senator Durbin's bill. I was able to view most of the \nproposed wilderness areas from the air, and was able to enhance my \nunderstanding through hikes outside of the Zion National Park on the \nDry Creek Bench wilderness unit contained in this proposal, and inside \nthe Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument to Upper Calf Creek \nFalls.\n  I support this legislation, for a few reasons, Mr. President, but \nmost of all because I have personally seen what is at stake, and I know \nthe marvelous resources that Wisconsinites and all Americans own in the \nBLM lands of Southern Utah.\n  Second, Mr. President, I support this legislation because I believe \nit sets the broadest and boldest mark for the lands that should be \nprotected in Southern Utah. I believe that when the Senate considers \nwilderness legislation it ought to know, as a benchmark, the full \nmeasure of those lands which are deserving of wilderness protection. \nThis bill encompases all the BLM lands of wilderness quality in Utah. \nUnfortunately, Mr. President, the Senate has not, as we do today, \nalways had the benefit of considering wilderness designations for all \nof the deserving lands in Southern Utah. During the 104th Congress, I \njoined with the former Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Bradley) in \nopposing that Congress' Omnibus Parks legislation. It contained \nprovisions, which were eventually removed, that many in my home state \nof Wisconsin believed not only designated as wilderness too little of \nthe Bureau of Land Management's holding in Utah deserving of such \nprotection, but also substantively changed the protections afforded \ndesignated lands under the Wilderness Act of 1964.\n  The lands of Southern Utah are very special to the people of \nWisconsin. In writing to me last Congress, my constituents described \nthese lands as places of solitude, special family moments, and \nincredible beauty. In December 1997, Ron Raunikar of the Capital Times, \na paper in Madison, WI, wrote:\n\n       Other remaining wilderness in the U.S. is at first \n     daunting, but then endearing and always a treasure for all \n     Americans.\n       The sensually sculpted slickrock of the Colorado Plateau \n     and windswept crag lines of the Great Basin include some of \n     the last of our country's wilderness which is not fully \n     protected.\n       We must ask our elected officials to redress this \n     circumstance, by enacting legislation which would protect \n     those national lands within the boundaries of Utah.\n       This wilderness is a treasure we can lose only once or a \n     legacy we can be forever proud to bestow to our children.\n\n  Some may say, Mr. President, that this legislation is unnecessary and \nUtah already has the ``monument'' that Wallace Stegner wrote about, \ndesignated by President Clinton on September 18, 1997. However, it is \nimportant to note, the land of the Grand Staircase Escalante National \nMonument comprises only about one tenth of the lands that will be \ngranted wilderness protection under this bill.\n  I supported the President's actions to designate the Grand Staircase \nEscalante National Monument. On September 17, 1997, amid reports of the \npending designation, I wrote a letter to President Clinton to support \nthat action which was co-signed by six other members of the Senate. \nThat letter concluded with the following statement ``We remain \ninterested in working with the Administration on appropriate \nlegislation to evaluate and protect the full extent of public lands in \nUtah that meet the criteria of the 1964 Wilderness Act.''\n  I believe that the measure being introduced today will accomplish \nthat goal. Identical in its designations to legislation sponsored in \nthe other body by Rep. Maurice Hinchey of New York, it is the \nculmination of more than 15 years and four Congresses of effort in the \nother body beginning with the legislative work of the former \nCongressman from Utah (Mr. Owens).\n  The measure protects wild lands that really are not done justice by \nany description in words. In my trip I found widely varied and distinct \nterrain, remarkable American resources of red rock cliff walls, desert, \ncanyons and gorges which encompass the canyon country of the Colorado \nPlateau, the Mojave Desert and portions of the Great Basin. The lands \nalso include mountain ranges in western Utah, and stark areas like the \nnew National Monument. These regions appeal to all types of American \noutdoor interests from hikers and sightseers to hunters.\n  Phil Haslanger of the Capital Times, answered an important question I \nam often asked when people want to know why a Senator from Wisconsin \nwould\n\n[[Page S4112]]\n\nco-sponsor legislation to protect lands in Utah. He wrote on September \n13, 1995 simply that ``These are not scenes that you could see in \nWisconsin. That's part of what makes them special.'' He continues, and \nadds what I think is an even more important reason to act to protect \nthese lands than the landscape's uniqueness, ``the fight over \nwilderness lands in Utah is a test case of sorts. The anti-\nenvironmental factions in Congress are trying hard to remove \nrestrictions on development in some of the nation's most splendid \nareas.''\n  Wisconsinites are watching this test case closely. I believe, Mr. \nPresident, that Wisconsinites view the outcome of this fight to save \nUtah's lands as a sign of where the nation is headed with respect to \nits stewardship of natural resources. For example, some in my home \nstate believe that among federal lands that comprise the Apostle \nIslands National Lakeshore and the Nicolet and Chequamegon National \nForests there are lands that are deserving of wilderness protection. \nThese federal properties are incredibly important, and they mean a \ngreat deal to the people of Wisconsin. Wisconsinites want to know that, \nshould additional lands in Wisconsin be brought forward for wilderness \ndesignation, the type of protection they expect from federal law is \nstill available to be extended because it had been properly extended to \nother places of national significance.\n\n  What Haslanger's Capital Times comments make clear is that while some \nin Congress may express concern about creating new wilderness in Utah, \nwilderness, as Wisconsinites know, is not created by legislation. \nLegislation to protect existing wilderness insures that future \ngenerations may have an experience on public lands equal to that which \nis available today. The action of Congress to preserve wild lands by \nextending the protections of the Wilderness Act of 1964 will publicly \ncodify that expectation and promise.\n  Third, this legislation has earned my support, and deserves the \nsupport of others in this body, because all of the acres that will be \nprotected under this bill are already public lands held in trust by the \nfederal government for the people of the United States. Thus, while \nthey are physically located in Utah, their preservation is important to \nthe citizens of Wisconsin as it is for other Americans.\n  Finally, I support this bill because I believe that there will likely \nbe action during this Congress to develop consensus legislation to \nprotect the lands contained in this proposal. We all need to be \ninvolved in helping to forge that consensus in order to ensure the best \nstewardship of that land. As many in this body know, the BLM has \ncompleted a review of the lands designated in the bill sponsored in the \nlast Congress by the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin) and adjacent \nareas. BLM has found that 5.8 million acres of lands, slightly more \nthan the acreage of the old bill, meet the criteria for wilderness \nprotection under the Wilderness Act. While the re-inventory is not a \nformal recommendation to Congress for wilderness designation, it \nsuggests that there are and should be more lands in play as the debate \nover wilderness protection in Utah moves forward.\n  I am also watching closely the on-going dialogue between Governor \nLeavitt and Secretary Babbitt regarding possible wilderness protection \nfor some of the West Desert lands that are contained in this \nlegislation, and the formal Section 202 process in which the BLM will \nbe engaged in Utah. I hope that the leaders of those efforts will look \nto this legislation as a guide in identifying the areas that need to be \nprotected as wilderness.\n  I am eager to work with my colleague from Illinois (Mr. Durbin) to \nprotect these lands. I commend him for introducing this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 862. A bill to protect Social Security surpluses and reserve a \nportion of non-Social Security surpluses to strengthen and protect \nMedicare; to the Committee on the Budget and the Committee on \nGovernment Affairs, jointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, 1977, \nwith instructions that if one Committee reports, the other Committee \nhave thirty days to report or be discharged.\n\n\n               social security and medicare lock box act\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Conrad, I am \nintroducing legislation, the Social Security and Medicare Lock Box Act, \nto reserve budget surpluses for both Social Security and Medicare.\n  Mr. President, this bill is an alternative to the Abraham-Domenici-\nAshcroft lock box legislation now before the Senate. There are several \ndifferences between the two versions. But I want to highlight this, \nmost importantly: the Republican proposal claims to protect Social \nSecurity, but it doesn't even pretend to protect Medicare. This bill \nwould reserve surpluses for both Social Security and Medicare. And the \nmain question for the Senate is whether we care enough about Medicare \nto provide it with a real lock box.\n  Mr. President, as I explained earlier, the Republican lock box has \nthree major flaws.\n  First, it fails to protect Social Security, and actually threatens \nbenefits.\n  Second, it reserves nothing for Medicare.\n  And, third, it could result in a government default, which could \ntrigger a world-wide economic catastrophe.\n  Our plan corrects each of these problems in a responsible way that \nwill work. It provides an ironclad guarantee that 100 percent of the \nSocial Security surplus will be saved for Social Security. It reserves \n40 percent of the non-Social Security, on-budget surplus for Medicare. \nAnd, the lock box is enforced not by a risky new limit on public debt, \nbut though the same budget procedures that produced the first budget \nsurplus in 30 years.\n  With respect to Social Security, Mr. President, our lock box would \ncreate a new point of order against a budget resolution that spends the \nSocial Security surplus. This provision is also in the Republican \namendment. But our point of order requires a supermajority to waive \nwhile theirs can be waived by a simple majority vote.\n  The Republican amendment also contains a trap door that would allow \nSocial Security contributions to be diverted for purposes other than \nSocial Security benefits, such as risky new privatization schemes. Our \nproposal includes no such trap door. To the contrary, its enforcement \nprocedures would remain in effect until legislation is enacted \ncertifying that Social Security's life has been extended for the long-\nterm.\n  In addition to protecting Social Security, Mr. President, our lock \nbox extends similar protections to the Medicare program. The proposal \ncreates supermajority points of order against a budget resolution or \nany subsequent legislation that fails to reserve roughly 40 percent of \nthe on-budget surplus for Medicare over the next 15 years.\n  Mr. President, the Medicare Trust Fund is now expected to be bankrupt \nby 2015. We should move quickly to reform and modernize the program. \nBut it's also clear that we'll need additional resources when the baby \nboom generation starts to retire. Even with reforms that substantially \nreduce costs, the revenues coming to the Medicare Trust Fund will not \nsupport this larger number of beneficiaries. Nor will they provide the \nresources needed to modernize the program or provide a prescription \ndrug benefit.\n  In case anyone has any doubt about that, consider the so-called \nBreaux-Thomas plan that was considered by the bipartisan Medicare \nCommission.\n  By their own calculation, that plan would save $100 billion over ten \nyears and extends the Trust Fund for only 3 additional years. In the \nscheme of things, that's not very long. But even this meager extension \nof the Trust Fund relies on several controversial proposals, including \nraising the age of eligibility for Medicare, establishing unlimited \nhome health copayments, and completely eliminating the Direct Medicare \nEducation program from Medicare.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that we need more resources for \nMedicare. And our amendment would give us an opportunity to provide \nthem.\n  Under our proposal, in the short term, the Medicare reserve would be \nused to reduce the debt. Over the next ten years, our proposal would \nreduce debt held by the public by $30 billion more than the Republican \nplan. By reducing debt held by the public, our lockbox would \ndramatically reduce the government's interest costs. And that would \nfree up resources to allow the government to meet its existing \ncommitments to Medicare. By contrast,\n\n[[Page S4113]]\n\nunder the Republican plan, every penny of the non-Social Security \nsurplus is consumed. That would increase interest costs and almost \nguarantee further cuts in benefits in the future.\n  Mr. President, not only does our lockbox do more to protect Medicare \nand reduce debt, it also has a stronger lock and more responsible \nenforcement procedure for both Social Security and Medicare.\n  As I've explained, Mr. President, the Republican amendment includes a \nreckless new scheme that relies on the threat of a default to enforce \nits provisions. That not only could permanently damage our credit \nstanding, it could force the government to stop issuing Social Security \nchecks.\n  We have a better idea, Mr. President. As I said earlier, we have a \n60-vote point of order against including Social Security in the budget \ntotals, as well as a 60-vote point of order against using any of the \nMedicare reserve. Then, even if Congress tries to spend that money, our \nlockbox blocks it through automatic across-the-board cuts, rather than \ncreating a crisis.\n  Mr. President, this is the best way to ensure fiscal restraint. Not \nby causing a crisis after money has already been committed. But by \nusing the tools of the budget process to block those commitments in the \nfirst place. That's why our legislation would enforce the lock box \nthrough the tried and true mechanisms of the pay-go rules and across-\nthe-board cuts.\n  If Congress attempts to spend part of the Social Security surplus or \nMedicare reserve, the sequester rules of the Balanced Budget Act would \nmake automatic spending cuts in order to keep the reserve intact. This \nis far better than triggering a debt crisis, and threatening a \ngovernment default, as the Republican amendment proposes.\n  To sum up, Mr. President, the Republican amendment claims to protect \nSocial Security, but it really threatens Social Security benefits. Ours \nis a real lockbox that protects both Social Security and Medicare. It's \na more responsible alternative that avoids the risk of default. And it \nwould reduce debt by more than the underlying amendment.\n  I hope my colleagues will support it and I ask unanimous consent that \na copy of the bill, along with certain related materials, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 862\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Con. Res. 68 (106th \n     Congress) is repealed.\n\n                         Two Lock Box Proposals\n\n\n                          republican lock box\n\n       The Republican lock box purports to protect Social Security \n     surpluses by establishing new limits on debt held by the \n     public. The proposal creates a new super majority point of \n     order against legislation that would increase the limits on \n     public debt. The limits are set at levels that would allow \n     all non-Social Security surpluses to be used for tax cuts or \n     spending.\n       The GOP lock box has three major problems:\n       (1) It does nothing to protect Medicare. Instead, it allows \n     Congress to use funds needed for Medicare to provide tax \n     cuts.\n       (2) It threatens Social Security. If the economy slows, the \n     government could be unable to issue Social Security or other \n     benefit checks. Also, the GOP amendment includes a provision \n     that would allow Social Security surpluses to be used for \n     purposes other than Social Security benefits, if labeled as \n     ``Social Security reform.''\n       (3) It threatens default. Secretary Rubin is concerned that \n     the proposal could permanently damage our credit standing. \n     The risk of default would increase interest costs for \n     American taxpayers.\n       In November 1995, a debt crisis was precipitated when \n     Government borrowing reached the debt limit and in January \n     Moody's credit rating service placed Treasury securities on \n     review for possible downgrade.\n       The proposal could trigger an actual default based on \n     factors beyond Congress's control. Although the GOP proposal \n     adjusts the debt ceiling for discrepancies between the actual \n     and projected Social Security surpluses, it does not make \n     similar corrections for unanticipated developments on the \n     non-Social Security side of the budget. This means that an\n\n[[Page S4114]]\n\n     economic slowdown, a reduction in anticipated revenues, or an \n     unexpected increase in mandatory spending could cause \n     publicly held debt to exceed the new limits and create a debt \n     crisis.\n\n\n                          democratic lock box\n\n       The Democratic Lock Box creates a supermajority point of \n     order against a budget resolution or any legislation that \n     does not save at least 40 percent of the on-budget surplus \n     for Medicare over the next 15 years and adds a new \n     supermajority point of order against a budget resolution that \n     violates the off-budget treatment of Social Security. (The \n     budget act already contains supermajority points of order \n     against a budget resolution or any legislation that reduces \n     the Social Security surplus.)\n       The Democratic Lock Box has several advantages over the \n     Republican approach.\n       (1) It protects Social Security. The language reserves all \n     Social Security surpluses for Social Security, and does not \n     allow these surpluses to be used for anything that does not \n     increase the Solvency of the Social Security program.\n       (2) It protects Medicare. The Democratic bill reserves 40 \n     percent of the on-budget surplus for Medicare; allows \n     sufficient funding to extend the life of the Medicare HI \n     Trust Fund through at least 2027.\n       (3) It relies on responsible enforcement mechanisms. The \n     Democratic approach does not establish binding limits on \n     publicly held debt and does not create a risk of default. \n     Enforcement is through current budget procedures and across-\n     the-board cuts. The Lock Box also restores the current pay-\n     as-you-go point of order, which makes certain that no on-\n     budget surplus can be used. Without a change in law, the \n     Republican tax cuts will result in a pay-as-you-go sequester, \n     which will come largely from Medicare.\n       (4) It reduces more debt. The Democratic Lock Box reduces \n     more debt than the Republican proposal, which will lower \n     future interest costs and free up government resources to \n     meet its existing Social Security and Medicare obligations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       COMPARISON OF DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN LOCK BOX PROPOSALS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                Democratic                           Republican\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nReserves 77 percent of unified surplus for  Claims to reserve 62 percent\n Social Security and Medicare.               of unified surplus for\n                                             Social Security but\n                                             includes ``trap door''\n                                             loophole.\nPrevents Social Security surplus from       Allows Social Security\n being used for other purposes.              surplus to be used for\n                                             anything labeled ``Social\n                                             Security reform'' including\n                                             tax cuts.\nReserves 40 percent of on-budget surplus    Reserves nothing for\n for Medicare; allows solvency through       Medicare.\n 2027.\nEnforcement through existing budget rules   Enforcement through debt\n and across-the-board cuts; procedures       crisis; putting United\n that created the first budget surplus       States credit worthiness at\n since 1969.                                 risk and jeopardizing\n                                             Social Security benefits.\nRequires 60 votes to violate off-budget     Requires 60 votes to violate\n treatment of Social Security or for using   off-budget treatment of\n Medicare reserve.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for Medicaid coverage of all certified nurse practitioners and \nclinical nurse specialists; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     medicaid nursing incentive act\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Medicaid \nNursing Incentive Act, a bill to provide direct Medicaid reimbursement \nfor nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists.\n  This legislation eliminates a counterproductive Medicaid payment \npolicy. Under current law, State Medicaid programs may exclude \ncertified nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists from \nMedicaid reimbursement, even though these practitioners are fully \ntrained to provide many of the same services as those provided by \nprimary care physicians. This policy is both discriminatory and \nshortsighted; it severs a critical access link for Medicaid \nbeneficiaries.\n  The ultimate goal of this proposal is to enhance the availability of \ncost-effective primary care to our nation's most vulnerable citizens.\n  Studies have documented the fact that millions of Americans each year \ngo without the health care services they need, because physicians \nsimply are not available to care for them. This problem plagues rural \nand urban areas alike, in parts of the country as diverse as south \ncentral Los Angeles and Lemmon, South Dakota.\n  Medicaid beneficiaries are particularly vulnerable, since in recent \nyears an increasing number of health professionals have chosen not to \ncare for them or have been unwilling to locate in the inner-city and \nrural communities where many beneficiaries live. Fortunately, there is \nan exception to the trend: nurse practitioners and clinical nurse \nspecialists frequently accept patients whom others will not treat and \nserve in areas where others refuse to work.\n  Studies have shown that nurse practitioners and clinical nurse \nspecialists provide quality, cost-effective care. Their advanced \nclinical training enables them to assume responsibility for up to 80 \npercent of the primary care services usually performed by physicians, \noften at a lower cost and with a high level of patient satisfaction.\n  Congress has already recognized the expanding contributions of nurse \npractitioners and clinical nurse specialists. For more than a decade, \nCHAMPUS has provided direct payment to nurse practitioners. In 1990, \nCongress mandated direct payment for nurse practitioner services under \nthe Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan. The Medicare program, which \nalready covered nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialist \nservices in rural areas, was modified under the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997 to provide coverage for these services in all geographic areas. \nThe bill I am introducing today establishes the same payment policy \nunder Medicaid.\n\n[[Page S4115]]\n\n  Mr. President, the ramifications of this issue extend beyond the \nMedicaid program and its beneficiaries. There is a broader lesson here \nthat applies to our effort to make cost-effective, high-quality health \ncare services available and accessible to all Americans.\n  One of the cornerstones of this kind of care is the expansion of \nprimary and preventive care, delivered to individuals in convenient, \nfamiliar places where they live, work, and go to school. More than 2 \nmillion of our nation's nurses currently provide care in these sites--\nin home health agencies, nursing homes, ambulatory care clinics, and \nschools. In places like South Dakota, nurses are often the only health \ncare professionals available in the small towns and rural counties \nacross the state.\n  These nurses and other nonphysician health professionals play an \nimportant role in the delivery of care. And this role will only \nincrease as we move from a system that focuses on the costly treatment \nof illness to one that emphasizes primary preventive care and health \npromotion.\n  But, first, we must reevaluate outdated attitudes and break down \nbarriers that prevent nurses from using the full range of their \ntraining and skills in caring for patients. In 1994, the Pew Health \nProfessions Commission concluded that nurse practitioners are not being \nfully utilized to deliver primary care services. The commission \nrecommended eliminating fiscal discrimination by paying nurse \npractitioners directly for the services they provide. This step will \nhelp nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists expand access \nto the primary care that so many communities currently lack.\n  As I have worked on access and reimbursement issues related to nurse \npractitioners and clinical nurse specialists, I have encountered two \nrelated issues I would also like to highlight.\n  Later this month, I plan to introduce legislation to increase the \nreimbursement rate for nurse practitioners and clinical nurse \nspecialists who practice in rural and underserved areas. Currently, \nphysicians who serve in a health professional shortage area receive a \n10 percent boost in their Medicare payment as an incentive to provide \nservices in the regions that need them the most. As we know, nurses are \nalready providing critical primary and preventive care in these areas \nand deserve the bonus payments that physicians are already receiving.\n  I would also encourage my colleagues to closely monitor the impact of \nMedicaid managed care on access to care provided by nurse practitioners \nand clinical nurse specialists. In some areas of the country, \nimplementation of managed care has prevented patients from continuing \nto receive health care services from nurse practitioners and clinical \nnurse specialists because they are not listed as primary care providers \nor preferred providers. Advanced practice nurses provide cost-\neffective, local, quality care, and I am concerned about early reports \nthat access to these professionals is being limited by new health \ndelivery arrangements. We should certainly keep an eye on this issue as \nMedicaid managed care systems develop.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will carefully consider the \nissues I have raised and support the measure I am introducing today, \nrecognizing the critical role nurse practitioners and other \nnonphysician health professionals play in our health care delivery \nsystem, as well as the increasingly significant contribution they can \nmake in the future. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 863\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate April 22 as Earth Day; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n                             EARTH DAY ACT\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this bill that I have sent to the desk \nis being introduced on behalf of myself and Senator Chafee. It is \nentitled ``The Earth Day Act.'' Its purpose is to designate April 22 as \nEarth Day.\n  Today, of course, is April 22. Let me provide a little history for my \ncolleagues or anyone listening.\n  The first Earth Day was 29 years ago, in 1970, and I think we are all \naware that Earth Day was first conceived by our former colleague, \nSenator Gaylord Nelson, who is universally considered the founder of \nEarth Day.\n  He has written a short summary of what brought Earth Day about, how \nit came about. In it he points out that in a speech that he gave in \nSeattle in September of 1969, he announced that there would be a \nnational environmental teach-in in the spring of 1970. And the wire \nservices picked up that story. And the next thing he knew, there was a \nmovement afoot to actually have that happen.\n  That first Earth Day involved some 20 million Americans. Since then, \nthe concept and the idea of Earth Day has focused the attention of the \ncountry, focused the attention of the world, in fact, on the importance \nof our environment and the importance of preserving and maintaining our \nenvironment. We have a great debt of gratitude we owe to former Senator \nNelson for his leadership on this.\n  We also owe a great debt of gratitude to the person that did the nuts \nand bolts work of organizing that first Earth Day, and that, of course \nis Denis Hayes. He is now president of the Seattle-based Bullitt \nFoundation, but he has been recognized recently by Time magazine as one \nof their heroes of the planet. I think his instrumental role, his \nessential role in bringing about that first Earth Day, making such a \nsuccess of it, has been recognized by all.\n  He is now, of course, trying to get in place the organization to make \nEarth Day 2000, which will occur exactly a year from today, an even \ngreater celebration than we have known before.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe that it is appropriate that we \nofficially designate April 22 as Earth Day and that we permanently \ndesignate it as Earth Day. It has come to be known as Earth Day--April \n22--for all of us. There are celebrations and teach-ins, and \nrecognitions going on throughout our country today. As we hear the news \nabout Kosovo, which is bad, and the news about Littleton, Colorado, and \nthe terrible tragedy there, which is bad, and many of the other news \nstories that bombard us, it is good to know that there is one news \nstory that we can all celebrate and rally around, and that is that \ntoday, again, we will be able to celebrate Earth Day.\n  Mr. President, it is my sincere hope that Senator Chafee and I can \nwork in the next year to gain additional cosponsors and to obtain \nenactment of this, so that by the time Earth Day 2000 arrives, we will \nbe able to have this in law, have it signed by the President. I am sure \nit will be supported by all of our colleagues. I think we all recognize \nthe importance of this to many of the people we represent. I hope very \nmuch that the bill can be enacted.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 865. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthe same tax treatment for danger pay allowance as for combat pay; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S4116]]\n\n                         DIPLOMATIC DANGER PAY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I want to right a wrong--a small \nwrong, but a wrong nevertheless. It affects a handful of our diplomats \nwho serve in the world's most dangerous places: Beirut, Bosnia, Kosovo, \nthe unsettled nations of Africa and the former Soviet Union and \nelsewhere. And unfortunately, as the events of recent weeks prove, the \nneed for Americans--soldiers and diplomats alike--to go in harm's way, \nis unlikely to abate.\n  Our diplomats, colleagues of those killed last summer in the tragic \nembassy bombings in Africa, receive an allowance for their service in \nthe most frightening places in the world--a danger allowance.\n  This allowance is not unlike that paid to our military when they are \nin combat. In fact, in some places, such as Bosnia, where our military \nand diplomatic personnel serve side by side, both receive a special \nallowance for their sacrifices.\n  The military justifiably receives this benefit tax-free. But our \ndiplomatic personnel do not. Through an oversight in the Internal \nRevenue Code, diplomats are taxed on their danger pay, even though they \noften face similar hardships and dangers. I think that's wrong.\n  I have a bill which would amend the Internal Revenue Code to right \nthis wrong. It affects just a handful of people. But to them it will \nserve as recognition of the sacrifice they make when they represent the \nAmerican people in dangerous settings overseas.

Mr. President, among the worst situations facing \nspouses, children, and families of members of the United States Armed \nForces, is to be greeted by an official party, wearing their dress blue \nuniforms, announcing the grim news that their loved one has been killed \nor declared missing.\n  On Sunday, September 14, 1997 nine families endured such an \nexperience as the United States Air Force declared one of its C-141 \nStarlifter cargo planes, en route from Namibia to Ascension Island, was \noverdue and presumed to have gone down in the Atlantic Ocean. At the \nsame time, a German military plane was also declared missing in the \nsame area, amid indications that the two planes had collided and \ncrashed into the Atlantic.\n  An extensive search was begun, during which only a few airplane \nseats, a few papers, some debris from the U.S. cargo plane, remnants of \nthe German aircraft, and the body of one victim were recovered. No \nother remains were recovered, and no survivors were located. On \nSaturday, September 27, 1997 the search for the crewmen of the Air \nForce jet ended and all were declared dead.\n  Mr. President, an investigation confirmed everyone's worst fears. In \nfact, on that fateful day--September 13, 1997--a German Luftwaffe \nTupelov TU-154M collided with a U.S. Air Force C-141 Starlifter off the \ncoast of Namibia, Africa. As a result of that mid-air collision nine \nUnited States Air Force Service members were killed. These are the \nrank, name, age, assignment, and hometowns of those killed: Staff \nSergeant Stacy D. Bryant, 32, loadmaster, Providence, Rhode Island; \nStaff Sergeant Gary A. Bucknam, 25, flight engineer, Oakland, Maine; \nCaptain Gregory M. Cindrich, 28, pilot, Byrans Road, Maryland; Airman \n1st Class Justin R. Drager, 19, loadmaster, Colorado Springs, Colorado; \nStaff Sergeant Robert K. Evans, 31, flight engineer, Garrison, \nKentucky; Captain Jason S. Ramsey, 27, pilot, South Boston, Virginia; \nStaff Sergeant Scott N. Roberts, 27, flight engineer, Library, \nPennsylvania; Captain Peter C. Vallejo, 34, aircraft commander, \nCrestwood, New York; and Senior Airman Frankie L. Walker, 23, crew \nchief, Windber, Pennsylvania;\n  At McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, families and members of the \ncrewmen's squadron from the 305th Operation Group were trying to make \nsense of what happened. Monica Cindrich, wife of the pilot, had to \nexplain to her 3 year-old son why his father would not be returning. On \nthe day following the crash, Sharla Bucknam went alone to her son \nAndrew's third birthday party. Any Smart held out hope that her fiance, \nCaptain Ramsey, would return for their wedding, planned for the \nfollowing May. And Justin Drager's father, Larry, a retired Air Force \nMaster Sergeant prayed for a miracle. It was his son's very first \nmission since the Air Force certified him as a loadmaster on the giant \ncargo plane that would take the 19-year-old from Colorado Springs to \nthe faraway places he joined the military to see.\n  At a memorial service at McGuire Air Force Base, the nine crew \nmembers were honored as heroes who gave their lives for a humanitarian \nmission. The plane was returning home to McGuire after delivering \ntroops and 32,000 pounds of mine-clearing equipment to Namibia. As the \nchaplain called the names of each crew member in a final roll call, a \nsquadron member answered ``Absent, sir.'' The crowd of more than 3,000 \nstood solemnly as a lone bugler played taps and three C-141s flew over \nin formation.\n  Formal investigations by both the government of Germany and the \nUnited States Air Force found that the German military plane was flying \nat the wrong altitude. The two planes, occupying the same air space, at \nthe same altitude, closed on each other at a combined speed of over \n1,000 miles per hour. The two planes hit almost nose to nose.\n  The German crew saw the U.S. plane about a second before impact and \nstruggled for two-and-a-half minutes to regain control of the TU-154 as \nit crashed into the Atlantic.\n  The German military transport was carrying 12 German marines, two of \ntheir spouses and 10 crew members. Unfortunately, there were no \nsurvivors. The German Air Force plane was en route from Germany to Cape \nTown, South Africa, where the marines were to have participated in a \nboat race marking the 75th anniversary of the South African Navy.\n  The details concerning the crash are unsettling and I doubt anyone \nwould want to die in the manner that the crew of ``MISSION REACH 4201'' \ndid. While the German crew had about a one-and-one-half second warning \nthat they were going to collide with another aircraft, the crew aboard \nthe C-141 literally did not know what hit them.\n  The cockpit voice recorder aboard the American aircraft chillingly \ncaptures the conversations of the ``MISSION REACH 4201'' crew as fate \ncruelly\n\n[[Page S4117]]\n\nsteers the two military transports toward a deadly collision. Reviewing \nthe transcript shows that Captains Greg Cindrich and Peter Vallejo--the \ntwo pilots of the Starlifter--had no inclination that a collision was \nimminent until it was too late. The two officers were discussing topics \nsuch as Social Security and the exploration of Mars.\n  The tape indicates that the crew survived for at least 13 seconds \nfollowing the impact with the German transport. In those 13 seconds, \nthe C-141 and crew of ``MISSION REACH 4201'' began hurtling toward the \nAtlantic Ocean. They spent the last 13 seconds of the flight, of their \nlives, strapping on oxygen masks and looking for flashlights to cope \nwith a failed electrical system. Aviation experts have determined that \nit is possible that the nine doomed men may have actually survived for \nas long as 30-seconds before the C-141 exploded. For thirteen to 30 \nseconds, these men fought to survive, fought to right their plane, \nfought for their very lives. If thirteen to 30 seconds sounds like a \nshort amount of time, I challenge anyone to try holding their hand over \na burning match for that amount of time, let alone spend that amount of \ntime aboard a multi-ton aircraft as it plummets toward the ocean. These \nmen were able to contemplate for thirteen to 30 seconds that their \naircraft was damaged and diving toward the ocean from an altitude of \n35,000 feet. That was thirteen to 30 seconds that these men could have \nbeen thinking that no C-141 had successfully survived a crash landing \nin water. It was thirteen to 30 seconds for these men to realize that \nthey were about to die.\n  Somewhere between thirteen and thirty seconds after the collision, \nthe C-141 of ``Mission Reach 4201'' exploded and what did not vaporize \nbecame debris that was spread on the surface of the ocean, or sunk to \nits cold and murky depths. Needless to say, rescuers and salvage \noperators never recovered much of the American aircraft or crew. The \nAir Force ultimately found a few parts of the airplanes and 15 pounds \nof human remains of such minute quantities that DNA testing had to be \nconducted to determine who was who. As a point of comparison, a bag of \ncement is approximately 20 pounds. You could have put the entire \nremains of nine adult men in a bag that is used to hold cement and have \nroom left over. There were not enough remains left of any one of the \ncrew members to afford their families the comfort of laying their sons, \nfathers, brothers, and husbands to rest. Instead, only mementos were \nplaced in caskets and buried.\n  Accident investigations conducted by the United States Air Force and \nthe German Ministry of Defense both concluded that fault for the \ncollision and deaths lay with the German crew, who not only filed an \ninaccurate flight plan, but were flying at the wrong altitude. The crew \nof the C-141 were operating appropriately, and were exactly where they \nwere supposed to be when they met their untimely deaths. These nine men \ndied through no fault or negligence of their own, the United States Air \nForce, or the government of the United States.\n  The families of each of the nine victims have endured not only \ntremendous mental anguish and suffering, but significant financial \nlosses, and understandably, they are seeking compensation from the \nGerman government. Sadly, despite the fact that this crash took place \nalmost two-years-ago, the German government has still to make the first \npfenning of compensation to any of the victims' families.\n  I rise today to offer a Sense of the Senate resolution that calls \nupon the German government to make quick and generous compensation to \nthese families. Just as this Body agreed by unanimous consent on March \n23, to authorize the Secretary of Defense to make humanitarian relief \npayments of up to $2 million to each of the families killed in \nCavalese, Italy when a Marine Corps jet struck a ski gondola, we should \ngo on the record as expecting equitably fair and expeditious relief for \nthe families of our servicemen killed through the negligence of the \nGerman government.\n  It gives me no pleasure to offer this resolution. The German \ngovernment and people are unquestionably among the closest of allies \nand the best of friends. We stood side-by-side during the Cold War, \nfacing down the Eastern threat; we are working side-by-side in the \nBalkans now; our economies are linked; and we value the strong \nrelationship between our two nations. Nevertheless, the Federal \nRepublic of Germany has an undeniable responsibility to make quick and \ngenerous compensation to the nine families who lost loved ones aboard \n``MISSION REACH 4201'' and I have pledged to Monica Cindrich, the widow \nof Captain Gregory Cindrich and the mother of their four-year-old son, \nthat I will do all within my power to bring not only compensation to \nher, but closure to this tragedy. Passing this sense of the Senate \nresolution will help do just that.\n\n  Each of us gets into public service because we desire to help people, \nto do what is right, and to fight for fairness. This Sense of the \nSenate resolution allows us to achieve each of those goals. By securing \ncompensation for the deaths of the nine men killed, we will \nunquestionably be helping their families; we will be making a stand for \nwhat is right by making a stand for our military families; and finally, \nwe will be fighting for fairness. Just as our government has recognized \nour responsibility in the case of the Italian ski gondola incident, it \nis only fair that the German government recognize their responsibility \nand obligation in this matter.\n  It is my hope that this resolution will pass with the support of an \noverwhelming majority of Senators. By voting for this provision, each \nof you will not only be sending an unmistakable message to the German \ngovernment, but perhaps even more importantly, you will be signaling to \nour men and women in uniform that their elected officials will always \nstand by them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 866. A bill to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto revise existing regulations concerning the conditions of \nparticipation for hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers under the \nMedicare program relating to certified registered nurse anesthetists' \nservices to make the regulations consistent with State supervision \nrequirements; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  Anesthesia Service Preservation Act\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich would help clarify an issue that relates to Medicare coverage for \nanesthesia services and its impact on rural health care.\n  As a senator representing a predominantly rural state, I know only \ntoo well the difficulties facing rural health care needs. Access to \ncare in rural areas is slowly worsening as more and more rural \nhospitals close their doors in the face of overwhelming cost pressures. \nClearly, one aspect of access to care is access to surgical procedures. \nAnd without anesthesia services, general surgery becomes impossible.\n  Certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) tend to be the \npredominant anesthesia provider in rural and undeserved urban areas. In \nfact, CRNAs are the sole anesthesia provider in 65% of rural hospitals \nand in addition, provide at least 65% of the nation's anesthesia needs. \nThe simple fact is that anesthesiologists have not been moving into \nrural areas in any significant numbers, and are not expected to do so \nin the foreseeable future. Given this trend, if rural hospitals are \ngoing to stay open, they desperately need CRNAs for their anesthesia \nand ultimately their surgical needs. That means we have to maintain a \nhealthy supply of CRNAs to maintain access to care for rural Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  Unfortunately, current Medicare rules with respect to supervision \nprovide a disincentive for hospitals to use nurse anesthetists. \nMedicare's regulations require physician supervision of CRNAs as a \ncondition for hospitals or ambulatory surgical centers to receive \nMedicare reimbursement, despite many state laws that allow nurse \nanesthetists to practice without such supervision. Although HCFA has \nissued a proposed rule that would drop this requirement and defer to \nstates on the issue of supervision, this rule has never been finalized.\n  The federal supervision requirement creates several problems for \nCRNAs. First, some surgeons and hospitals have been dissuaded from \nworking with\n\n[[Page S4118]]\n\nCRNAs, in the face of arguments that the physicians may be subjecting \nthemselves to liability for engaging in supervision. But the truth is, \nthe attending physician--or the hospital--is no more legally liable for \nthe CRNAs actions than he or she is for the acts of an \nanesthesiologist. Second, the federal restriction is anti-competitive, \nacting as a disincentive for CRNAs to be used. Finally, the restriction \ncreates an inaccurate perception among some surgeons that they have an \nobligation to direct or control the substantive course of the \nanesthetic process, even though there is no such obligation.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would eliminate the Federal \nsupervision requirement and instead direct Medicare to defer to state \nlaw requirements on supervision. By eliminating this prescriptive \nfederal regulation, we can better maximize the use of nurse \nanesthetists and eliminate the confusion surrounding CRNA supervision. \nAt a time when the Congress is seeking ways to reduce costs for the \nMedicare program without sacrificing quality or access to care, \nincreasing the use of nurse anesthetists seems particularly \nappropriate.\n  In terms of quality of care, there are no significant differences \nbetween anesthesia provided by CRNAs or that provided by \nanesthesiologists. Notwithstanding the claims of anesthesiologists, it \nis clear from a careful reading of the studies that there are no \nquantifiable differences in outcomes when CRNAs work with \nanesthesiologists, or when anesthesiologists provide anesthesia alone. \nCRNAs have been providing anesthesia services for more than a century. \nThey have been the principal anesthesia providers in combat areas in \nevery war the United States has been engaged in since World War I. \nCRNAs have received medals and accolades for their dedication, \ncommitment and competence. And CRNAs perform the same anesthesia \ndelivery function as anesthesiologists and work in every setting in \nwhich anesthesia is delivered: traditional hospital suites, obstetrical \ndelivery rooms, dentist's offices, HMO's ambulatory surgical centers, \nVeterans Administration facilities and others.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government is deferring to state judgment \non a whole host of issues, so it seems completely consistent to let \nstates decide how best to use nurse anesthetists, particularly in light \nof CRNA's long track record of success. States, which have the primary \nresponsibility for regulating nurse practice, have generally not seen \nany need for a physician supervision requirement in non-Medicare \nsettings. Twenty-nine states do not require supervision of CRNAs in \nnurse practice acts or board of nursing rules. This clearly indicates \nthat many states, as a matter of public policy, do not believe it is \nnecessary to require physician supervision of CRNAs. It is easy to \nunderstand why. Anesthesia is provided only when necessary to permit \nsome medical procedure or intervention. Thus, as a practical matter \neven when supervision is not required as a matter of law, a surgeon, \npodiatrist, or dentist will be in the room when anesthesia is provided, \nand would be capable of handling any emergency that might arise.\n  Finally, I would note that when CRNAs were given direct Medicare \nreimbursement in 1986, there was no statutory requirement that CRNAs be \nsupervised by physicians in order to receive reimbursement. This was \nnot a requirement imposed by Congress then, nor has there been one \nsince. Had Congress believed that such a requirement was appropriate, \nit would have been imposed as a condition of reimbursement at that \ntime. Moreover, HCFA routinely defers to the states on scope of \npractice issues as its relates to other health care professionals.\n  This proposed change is supported by the American Hospital \nAssociation and the National Rural Health Association. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation and let the states make their \nown decisions about how to regulate a health care professional's scope \nof practice. Rural and undeserved urban areas need CRNAs and it's time \nthe federal government removed impediments in regulations so that \nconsumers' access to anesthesia care, particularly in rural areas, will \nnot be jeopardized.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Jeffords, \n        Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Biden, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Torricelli, \n        Mr. Harkin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \n        Kohl, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 867. A bill to designate a portion of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge as wilderness; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n             arctic national refuge wilderness act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, in 1960 President Dwight Eisenhower had the \nwisdom to set aside a portion of America's Arctic for the benefit and \nenjoyment of future generations. His Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \nprotected the highest peaks and glaciers of the Brooks Range, North \nAmerica's two largest and most northerly alpine lakes, and nearly 200 \ndifferent wildlife species, including polar bears, grizzlies, wolves, \ncaribou, and millions of migratory birds.\n  Eisenhower's Secretary of Interior Fred Seaton called the new Arctic \nRange, ``one of the most magnificent wildlife and wilderness areas in \nNorth America . . . a wilderness experience not duplicated elsewhere.\n  With this in mind, I reintroduce legislation today, Earth Day 1999, \nthat designates the coastal plain of Alaska as wilderness area. At the \nmoment this area is a national wildlife refuge--one of our most \nbeautiful and last frontiers. This legislation, the Arctic National \nRefuge Wilderness Act of 1999, would forever safeguard this great \nnational treasure from oil exploration and development.\n  And I can't stress how important this is.\n  The Alaskan wilderness area is not only a critical part of our \nEarth's ecosystem--the last remaining region where the complete \nspectrum of arctic and subarctic ecosystems comes together--but it is a \nvital part of our national consciousness. It is a place we can cherish \nand visit for our soul's good.\n  The Alaskan wilderness is a place of outstanding wildlife, wilderness \nand recreation, a land dotted by beautiful forests, dramatic peaks and \nglaciers, gentle foothills and undulating tundra. It is untamed--rich \nwith caribou, polar bear, grizzly, wolves, musk oxen, Dall sheep, \nmoose, and hundreds of thousands of birds--snow geese, tundra swans, \nblack brant, and more. Birds from the Arctic Refuge fly to or through \nevery state in the continental U.S. In all, Mr. President, about 165 \nspecies use the coastal plain.\n  It is an area of intense wildlife activity. Animals give birth, nurse \nand feed their young, and set about the critical business of fueling up \nfor winters of unspeakable severity.\n  The fact is Mr. President, there are parts of this Earth where it is \ngood that man can come only as a visitor. These are the pristine lands \nthat belong to all of us. And perhaps most importantly, these are the \nlands that belong to our future.\n  Considering the many reasons why this bill is so important, I came \nacross the words of the great Western writer, Wallace Stegner. \nReferring to the land we are trying to protect with this legislation, \nhe wrote that it is `the most splendid part of the American habitat; it \nis also the most fragile.' And we cannot enter `it carrying habits that \n[are] inappropriate and expectations that [are] surely excessive.'\n  What this bill offers--and what we need--is a brand of pragmatic \nenvironmentalism, an environmental stewardship that protects our \nimportant wilderness areas and precious resources, while carefully and \njudiciously weighing the short-term desires or our country against its \nlong-term needs.\n  Together, we need to embrace environmental policies that are workable \nand pragmatic, policies based on the desire to make the world a better \nplace for us and for future generations. I believe a strong economy, \nliberty, and progress are possible only when we have a healthy planet--\nonly when resources are managed through wise stewardship--only when an \nenvironmental ethic thrives among nations--and only when people have \nfrontiers that are untrammeled and able to host their fondest dreams.\n\n[[Page S4119]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 867\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF PORTION OF ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE \n                   REFUGE AS WILDERNESS.\n\n       Section 4 of the National Wildlife Refuge System \n     Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(p) Designation of Certain Land as Wilderness.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, a portion of \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska comprising \n     approximately 1,559,538 acres, as generally depicted on a map \n     entitled `Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--1002 Area. \n     Alternative E--Wilderness Designation, October 28, 1991' and \n     available for inspection in the offices of the Secretary of \n     the Interior, is designated as a component of the National \n     Wilderness Preservation System under the Wilderness Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 1131 et seq.).''.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to again join with Senator \nRoth in the very important bipartisan effort to designate the coastal \nplain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness--forever.\n  Today is Earth Day 1999. The introduction of the Arctic Wilderness \nAct is particularly appropriate on Earth Day because it will provide \npermanent protection for the unique and irreplaceable natural resources \nof an area that is the ``biological heart'' of the North Slope of \nAlaska. The coastal plain is a vital part of the tundra ecosystem that \nsome have referred to as ``America's Serengetti.''\n  On Earth Day, we should take extra measure of special, rare, and \nthreatened places. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge coastal plain is \none of these places. It is one natural treasure that we must protect as \nwilderness for current and future generations.\n  The coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife refuge represents \nthe wildest and most pristine arctic coastal ecosystem in the United \nStates. The coastal plain is where the calves of the awe-inspiring \nPorcupine caribou herd are born every year. It is also where snow geese \nfeed in the fall and many female polar bears choose to den.\n  During the summer, migratory birds such as the red-throated loon, \nAmerican golden-plover, and semipalmated sandpiper and others flock to \nthe coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in great \nnumbers. In the fall, they return southward to and through the state of \nConnecticut among other places. By dedicating the coastal plain of the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness, we can help ensure that \nthis ancient natural rite continues into the 21st Century.\n  For more than a decade, Congress has repeatedly debated the \nadvisability of opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge coastal \nplain to oil and gas exploration and development. Time and again, \nCongress and the American people have rejected the notion that we \nshould sacrifice our last vestige of arctic coastal plain to petroleum \ndevelopment. The decision to prohibit coastal plain petroleum \ndevelopment reflects the tremendous value Americans place in the \npreservation of our great wilderness areas.\n  The degradation caused by developing oil and gas in places worthy of \nwilderness designation is irreversible. Once developed, the wilderness \nvalue of a place is lost.\n  The Alaska Wilderness Act designates the coastal plain of the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge as wilderness--an area to remain wild and \nundeveloped in perpetuity--and thereby preserves one of the last great \nnatural treasures on the North American continent for generations to \ncome.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, Earth Day is a celebration of the value \nand importance of our natural environment and a reminder of our duty to \nprotect, rather than carelessly exploit and deplete, our natural \nheritage. Our commitment to future generations is something we in \nMinnesota take very seriously. It is a commitment to ensure that the \nenvironmental legacy we pass on to our children and grandchildren is \nnot marred by failures such as the poisoning of our oceans, rivers, \nlakes and streams, the destruction of the natural habitat, and the \nirreversible extinction of species.\n  Environmental concerns have always been very important to me and to \nMinnesotans, and I am proud of the progress that we are making in \nprotecting the environment. However, while recognizing the progress we \nhave made, we Minnesotans also realize how much more needs to be done.\n  That is why I feel it is very appropriate that Senator Roth, myself, \nand several of our colleagues, are introducing legislation on this day \nto designate a portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska \nas wilderness. My good friend Congressman Bruce Vento from Minnesota, \nalong with over 150 of his colleagues, have introduced similar \nlegislation in the House, called the Morris K. Udall Wilderness Act. \nThis legislation is a tremendous step forward, crucial to preserving \nthe biodiversity of one of our nation's last remaining frontiers.\n  This bill will designate the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge as \nwilderness, protecting 1.5 million acres of some of the most unspoiled \nwilderness remaining in the United States. The Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge is a one-of-a-kind national treasure, home to many unique \nspecies of plant and animal life, several of which are considered \nendangered or threatened. This magnificent wilderness contains a \ncomplete spectrum of arctic and sub-arctic ecosystems, which can be \nfound nowhere else on the continent.\n  Moreover, the fragile balance of life in this wilderness is critical \nto the survival of the native Gwich'in Athabascan Indians of northeast \nAlaska, who depend on the land to maintain their centuries-old nomadic \nway of life. The Gwich'in rely on the 150,000-strong Porcupine River \ncaribou herd, whose calving grounds are on the coastal plain.\n  Unfortunately, a few multinational oil companies have set their \nsights on this crown jewel of America's wilderness to extract their \nshort-term profits. Oil drilling on the coastal plain would mean \ndespoliation of this pristine land with hundreds of oil rigs, \npipelines, air strips, and other industrial facilities. It would \ndestroy one of the most magnificent wilderness areas in North America.\n  And it would do so much harm for so little gain. Allowing these \nmultinationals to boost their profits by drilling oil would do nothing \nto solve our energy problems. The amount of oil that could potentially \nbe recovered from the Refuge is relatively small, and most of it would \nlikely be exported to Asia.\n  Instead of promoting oil drilling that destroys our natural \nenvironment, we should be promoting renewable sources of energy. In so \ndoing, we could save more energy than would ever be extracted from the \ncoastal plain of the Arctic Refuge.\n  Polls show that Americans strongly support protection of the Arctic \nRefuge. Yet the oil lobby in Washington has never suffered from a lack \nof representation. The oil multinationals pressure Congress every year \nto open up this coastal plain to drilling. It's time Congress stood up \nfor the public interest, rather than the economic interests of the \nlargest oil companies.\n  We have a responsibility to protect the environment for future \ngenerations. We must voice our protest and prevent those reckless \npolicies which ignore the real costs of exhausting our natural \nresources and permanently distort our ecosystem's fragile balance.\n  We must continue to be a world leader in deterring the destruction of \nour natural heritage. We must continue to facilitate and promote \nsuccessful programs that help us conserve and use our lands and \nresources wisely.\n  As we celebrate the last official Earth Day of the twentieth century, \nwe must ensure that we will have cause to celebrate Earth Day in the \ntwenty-first century. This legislation represents a significant step in \nthe right direction, and I urge my colleagues to join us in \ncosponsoring this legislation on this very special day.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Mack):\n  S. 868. A bill to make forestry insurance plans available to owners \nand operators of private forest land, to encourage the use of \nprescribed burning and fuel treatment methods on private forest land, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n[[Page S4120]]\n\n       FORESTRY INITIATIVE TO RESTORE THE ENVIRONMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I have asked recognition this afternoon to \ncommend the firefighters providing relief to the State of Florida and \nits citizens, which is once again besieged by fire due to excessive \ndrought conditions. This, unfortunately, is not the first occasion on \nwhich I have risen to speak about forest fires in Florida.\n  The natural conditions in the State have been altered to the point \nwhere fires, normally a natural and essential part of the pine forests \nof this region, have burned uncontrollably, causing damage to local \ncommunities, private homes, and to the Florida forestry industry.\n  Last year, Florida sustained almost $300 million in private fire-\nrelated damage, and State and local governments spent over $100 million \nin responding to wild fires. Approximately 500,000 acres of forest were \ncompletely destroyed in 1998. And in 1999, fires in Florida have again \ncommenced a process with severe consequences. As of today, 2,542 fires \nhave burned more than 58,000 acres; 18 divisional forestry firefighters \nhave been injured; 59 structures have been destroyed, and another 81 \nwere damaged by fire.\n  Florida is not alone. Similar fires are occurring in Georgia, North \nCarolina, Arizona and New Mexico. My heart goes out to the unfortunate \nvictims of these fires, as well as to the firefighters and volunteers \nwho are working bravely to save families, homes and communities. As we \nspeak, Americans from Alabama, Delaware, and Georgia, are fighting side \nby side with Floridians to prevent these fires in my State from \nendangering more lives, homes, and property. National Guardsmen, \nmeteorologists, insurance specialist, and volunteers have converged in \nFlorida to assist in response and recovery. These individuals' bravery \nand willingness to support people who they never met reaffirms our \nbelief in the selflessness and vitality of the human spirit.\n  Mr. President, they say that a picture speaks a thousand words. I \nwould like to draw your attention to the front page of the St. \nPetersburg Times of Tuesday, April 20, which has this dramatic picture \nof the Everglades afire. The Everglades, home to many endangered \nspecies, and the water source for millions of Floridians, has for the \nlast several days been besieged by fire.\n  Now, fire is a natural phenomenon in the Everglades. It serves an \nimportant part in maintaining the ecosystem. However, human \nmanipulation of this system has decreased water levels, making the \nEverglades more susceptible to fire and more ravaging consequences of \nthat fire. This condition mirrors circumstances throughout Florida and \nmany other States where efforts to prevent fires have allowed a large \nquantity of undergrowth to accumulate in our forestry lands.\n  As many of you know, the long-leaf pine ecosystem, which is prevalent \nin Florida and other southeastern States, depends heavily on the role \nof natural fire to rejuvenate the ecosystem. Prescribed burning mimics \nnaturally occurring lightening fires, clears excess underbrush, which \ncan rob lower plants of sunlight. This frequent, low-intensity fire \nretains the rich flora of the healthy long-leaf pine ecosystem. Without \nthese frequent fires, underbrush robs lower plants, which in drought \ncondition creates a ready fuel source for a fire. It is this situation \nthat has led to severe wildfires in Florida.\n  Mr. President, today, I will be introducing legislation that is aimed \nat the prevention of the recurrence in the future and to assure that \nthis tragedy does not bring a second tragedy--a permanent loss of our \nforest lands in Florida and in the southeast. I am introducing the \nForestry Initiative to Restore the Environment Act of 1999 to mitigate \nthe damages and prevent fire disasters in the future.\n  What exactly does mitigation of losses mean for us today? Let me \nfocus on my State of Florida. There are currently 16 million acres of \nforested lands, making up 47 percent of the State's total land area. \nThe majority of this land--over 7 million acres--is owned by private \nfarmers and individual corporate landowners. The State of Florida is \ncontinuing to grow at an explosive pace. It already has over 15 million \npeople, and in 25 years it is projected to have over 20 million people. \nThis rapid growth is creating pressure on land values throughout \nFlorida and creating a circumstance in which there could be a massive \nconversion of this 7 million acres of privately owned timberland for \ndevelopment purposes.\n  These 7 million acres not only provide a substantial amount of forest \nproducts for the Nation but also provide critical habitats for a unique \ngroup of plants and animals.\n  These 7 million acres help to contain a human population explosion \nthat would create additional demands on the already scarce water supply \nin Florida and lead to degradation of water quality.\n  It is therefore in our Nation's interest to maintain Florida's \nexisting timber lands for community use.\n  This legislation provides a long-term plan to restore and protect \nprivate forestry lands damaged by wildfires and other natural \ndisasters. It directs the U.S. Department of Agriculture to act on its \nexisting authority to develop a crop insurance program for small \nforestry landowners.\n  This type of program--which allows producers to invest in their own \nfuture to protect themselves from natural disasters such as fires, \nhurricanes, or tornadoes--will provide the same protection for forestry \nproducers as is provided through USDA insurance plans for crops such as \nwheat or corn.\n  The availability of this support in times of disaster will provide \nincentives for private landowners to retain lands in forestry after \ndisasters such as the current wildfires that we are experiencing in \n1999.\n  The second part of our legislation will help to reduce the severity \nof future fire disasters by increasing the incentives for prescribed \nburning.\n  The State of Florida has an active prescribed burning program and \nburns an average of two million acres per year, including forestry, \ngrasslands, and agricultural lands.\n  However, as evidenced by this week's events, existing levels of \nprescribed burning are not enough.\n  Large quantities of brush fuel accompanied by drought have created \ndangerous wildfire conditions.\n  One solution is to increase the frequency of prescribed burning to \nreduce fuel levels and the severity of fires when they occur.\n  In a study conducted by the Florida Division of Forestry, Orlando \nDistrict, for the period 1981 to 1990, it was shown that an increase in \nprescribed burning leads to a decrease in the frequency of wildfires.\n  The study compared two counties--Osceola County and Brevard County \nwhich differ in the amount of prescribed burning they conduct.\n  Approximately five-hundred thousand acres are burned in Osceola \nCounty every 2 or 4 years. This compares with just over two-hundred and \nfifty thousand acres of lands in Brevard County on which prescribed \nburning is conducted.\n  The study found that the number of wildfires, the acres burned, and \nthe average wildfires per acre were lower in Osceola County than \nBrevard County.\n  Our legislation attempts to encourage the use of prescribed burning \nas a forest management tool on private lands.\n  First, it authorizes the U.S. Forest Service to provide both \ntechnical and financial assistance for prescribed burning to states.\n  Grants to pay up to 75 percent of the cost of carrying out prescribed \nburns would be made to private landowners.\n  Second, our legislation seeks to enhance public support for the use \nof prescribed fire by addressing one of the most challenging issues--\nthe misunderstanding of urban and suburban residents of the purpose of \nprescribed burning.\n  In the urban interface zone where much of Florida's forested lands \nare located, the opposition of local residents to smoke plumes can stop \nany efforts to conduct prescribed burning.\n  Our bill requires that the U.S. Forest Service and the Environmental \nProtection Agency develop education and outreach programs on this topic \nand make them available to state environmental and forest management \nagencies.\n  With these actions, this legislation will create a system to mitigate \ndamages from wildfires. It will help to reduce the severity of future \nfires by removing obstacles for private landowners to conduct \nprescribed burns.\n\n[[Page S4121]]\n\n  I hope you will join me in our long-term efforts to create a system \nfor mitigating damages from natural disasters and reducing the severity \nof future wildfires by encouraging prescribed burning.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two items be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The first is an April 18 article from the Miami Herald describing \nsome of the wildfire damage which occurred in that city last week.\n  The second is an Associated Press story summarizing remarks made by \nthe Secretary of the Interior supporting the use of prescribed burning \nat a wildlife conference in Gainesville, Florida this week.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, Apr. 18, 1999]\n\n               ``Huge Wave'' of Fire Stuns Port St. Lucie\n\n                           (By Curtis Morgan)\n\n       Port St. Lucie.--When Don Tagner pulled into his driveway \n     at 4 p.m., the faint smoke curling in the pine scrub looked \n     as harmless as late morning fog.\n       The fire seemed at a safe distance, a dozen blocks away. \n     But as a precaution he sent his daughters off with a \n     neighbor. Then he called around to cancel that evening's \n     soccer practice.\n       When a neighbor pounded on his door 30 minutes later, \n     Tagner opened it to a world he described as ``hell on a \n     rampage.''\n       Black smoke blotted out the sun. He ran to his backyard \n     just in time to recoil from a towering wall of fire rolling \n     in like ``a huge wave. It sounded like a subway coming \n     through. Whoosh.''\n       Like that, it engulfed Frank Schultz's home next door. \n     Tagner rushed back in his home, grabbed his car keys and as \n     he turned up a street toward safety, houses two blocks up San \n     Sebastian Avenue turned into roaring red balls.\n       For the hundreds who fled it and the hundreds who fought \n     it, Thursday's blaze truly was hellish, the wickedest, most \n     destructive one-day wildfire in Florida in almost 15 years.\n       In a bit more than four hours, it raced three miles north-\n     northeast from its starting point in southernmost Port St. \n     Lucie--destroying 43 homes, damaging 33 others and scorching \n     545 acres in the heavily wooded neighborhoods east of \n     Interstate 95.\n       ``I've seen them travel fast before but I've never seen \n     anything of this magnitude in the 16 years I've been fighting \n     fires,'' said a weary, soot-stained Lt. Mike Gablemann of the \n     St. Lucie County Fire District, who led a crew dousing \n     hundreds of hot spots Friday--including a smoldering file \n     cabinet in the Schultz home.\n\n\n                          drought index peaked\n\n       An unlucky combination of factors turned the small brush \n     fire into a full-blown inferno.\n       Like most of Florida, a record drought has left much of \n     rural St. Lucie County bone-dry and crisp as kindling.\n       ``Just look at the grass,'' said Gene Madden, safety \n     director for the state Division of Forestry. ``It's not \n     green, it's brown. It crunches when you walk on it.''\n       At 1 p.m. Thursday, forecasters warned Treasure Coast \n     counties that conditions for wildfires would peak that \n     afternoon.\n       When the blaze flared up, so did the winds. It was like \n     blowing on a hot coal.\n\n\n                              a fire storm\n\n       Fire crews rushing to contain the blaze battled to keep up, \n     but couldn't, Gabelmann said. They were outmanned and \n     outmaneuvered by the relentless winds. As quickly as trucks \n     pulled up to one house, flames would appear in treetops a \n     quarter of a mile away.\n       ``No fire department, no fire personnel are going to get \n     out in front of it and stop a fire like this,'' Madden said.\n       Fires leapt from point to point and house to house in a \n     path a mile wide, with destruction as unpredictable as wind \n     currents.\n       ``What we saw was the definition of a fire storm,'' said \n     Lt. Ron Parish of the St. Lucie County Fire District.\n       Firefighters were frustrated by their inability to do what \n     they normally do: Put out fires. This was more like triage. \n     Sometimes, they had to drive past one burning house to get to \n     another where they believed people were trapped.\n       ``Having to leave a house unprotected . . . gives you a \n     sick feeling,'' Parrish said.\n\n\n                         unpredictable pattern\n\n       The random patterns of damage showed just how difficult it \n     was to predict where the fires would turn next.\n       On one block, two homes back-to-back burned but a wooden \n     swing set between them wasn't even singed. Hundreds of brush-\n     choked undeveloped lots and wood-framed homes provided \n     plentiful fuel--enough for the fire to jump the 100-foot-wide \n     C-24 Canal.\n       Franklin Navas, a former firefighter from Costa Rica and \n     now an equipment manager, credited the survival of his home \n     to clearing brush a few feet behind his property line. Flames \n     left the vinyl siding on one side of his home drooping like \n     limp spaghetti--but the home stood.\n       Ironically, a large group of Port St. Lucie residents had \n     opposed bringing city water to their neighborhoods--and even \n     sued the town to block the process. Hydrants had been \n     scheduled for the area within two years.\n\n\n                         no time to get dressed\n\n       Navas and his wife, Mayra, and two sisters visiting from \n     New Jersey left at 4 p.m. as police began rolling through the \n     neighborhood ordering evacuations by loud-speakers.\n       ``Just in time,'' he said. As they pulled away, the flames \n     had hit the lot next door.\n       For many, there was little time to pack family papers or \n     heirlooms or even to get dressed.\n       Mike Azbell said his wife, Shelby, pulled children Marissa, \n     4, and Tyler, 2, into the car in a panic once she got word. \n     ``Tyler was running around the house naked and he left \n     naked.''\n       At 5 p.m., Florida Power & Light shut off power to about \n     5,000 customers--a move to protect firefighters from live, \n     fallen wires. it also left remaining homeowners defenseless. \n     Without power, their pumps couldn't pull water from their \n     wells for the garden hoses that some tried to use in mostly \n     fruitless efforts to halt flames.\n       Outside the roadblocks, homeowners worried about what they \n     would find when they returned or pitched in to help others \n     protect their homes.\n       About 50 evacuees gathered at Mike Schachter's house a \n     block outside the cordoned-off area. Some helped hose down \n     his house, while Schachter's mother, Barbara, fed others and \n     baby-sat panicky children--including Mike's son, who \n     celebrated his first birthday that night.\n       ``Everyone just tried to help everyone else,'' Mike \n     Schachter said.\n\n\n                          surveying the damage\n\n       By 7:30 that night, man and nature combined to tame the \n     wildfire.\n       `'Mother Nature started it and Mother Nature pinched it \n     off,'' Madden said.\n       Local firefighters managed with the help of crews that came \n     from as far south as Hollywood and vital reinforcements from \n     water-bearing helicopters and a tanker plane.\n       Several hundred residents spent the night in a Red Cross \n     shelter at the Port St. Lucie Community Center. At daylight \n     on Friday residents returned to neighborhoods that, while \n     devastated in spots, could have been hit much worse. No one \n     was killed or hurt and the number of homes that escaped \n     damage far outnumbered those lost.\n       Martha Brann began crying when she thought about all she \n     lost: photos of her children, her mother's gold wedding band \n     and the diamond ring from her former husband--mementos \n     representing the special people in her life.\n       ``I couldn't get nothing,'' said Brann, 59.\n       But Tagner found all: His wood-framed home remained almost \n     as he had left it. Grass had burned to within a foot of his \n     patio and he lost two plastic garbage cans and a recycling \n     bin, which, as it burned, slightly charred a small section of \n     his garage.\n       ``Everybody keeps asking me what my secret was,'' he said. \n     ``It was just luck.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  Babbitt Advocates Prescribed Burning\n\n       Gainesville, Fla. (AP)--State and local governments need to \n     get more aggressive in preventing wildfires by using \n     prescribed burns, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said \n     Tuesday.\n       ``By taking fire off the land, we've actually increased the \n     fire hazard,'' Babbitt said. ``We must abandon a warfare \n     suppression model and find a thoughtful, scientific, \n     cooperative way to acknowledge this force of nature and \n     harness it to provide a better balance on the landscape.''\n       In addition to the controlled burns, which are \n     intentionally set fires ignited to reduce fuel for wildfires, \n     Babbitt also advocated requiring stringent building \n     requirements that help fireproof communities.\n       Babbitt, whose office oversees national parkland, spoke to \n     about 300 foresters at the University of Florida's John Gray \n     Distinguished Lecture Series.\n       Babbitt said most legislators haven't done enough to plan \n     for prescribed burns and push private property owners to act.\n       ``In Oakland, Calif., after the fire in the early '90s \n     which just about wiped out the city, Alameda County actually \n     passed an ordinance requiring brush control,'' Babbitt said.\n       ``For landowners who didn't do it, the county would do it \n     and add the costs to their property taxes. I don't know if \n     that's the right answer, but it's a way to do it,'' he said.\n       In Florida, the state's Division of Forestry said it has \n     authorized prescribed burns for 700,000 acres of land this \n     year.\n       There is no statewide plan for specific prescribed burns, \n     though private and public landowners have their own plans. A \n     state forestry official said landowners are encouraged to \n     perform prescribed burns, but they can't be forced.\n       ``We can designate areas as high fire hazards and by \n     designating that we can burn it for them, but we can't tell \n     them that they're going to burn one-third of their acreage,'' \n     said Jim Brenner, fire management administrator for the \n     forestry division.\n       As for fireproofing communities, Babbitt said local \n     governments need to ensure that homes get built with fire \n     resistant roofing. He also said the homes should be far \n     enough away from thick woods and hanging trees, such as \n     pines, to prevent damage from an approaching fire.\n       Babbitt also said if Florida's fires tap the state's \n     firefighting resources, federal authorities will help provide \n     the needed manpower and equipment.\n\n[[Page S4122]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Roth, and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 870. A bill to amend the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. \nApp.) to increase the efficiency and accountability of Offices of the \nInspector General within Federal departments, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                         INSPECTOR GENERAL ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Inspector \nGeneral Act Amendments of 1999. I am very pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues, Senators Roth, Grassley, and Bond, who have demonstrated \nunparalleled leadership on IG issues in the Senate. Indeed, Senator \nRoth is one of the architects of the inspector general law, having \nadvocated its creation in 1978 and, in 1982, having introduced \nlegislation that created IGs in the Departments of Defense, Justice, \nand the Treasury. In such distinguished company, I am confident that my \nlegislation hits the mark of improving an already invaluable program.\n  As chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, one of \nmy top priorities since coming to the Senate has been the seemingly \nnever-ending fight against waste, fraud, and abuse. We have all heard \nthe horror stories of $500 hammers and roads built to nowhere. The \nwaste of scarce Federal resources not only picks the pockets of \ntaxpayers, but also places severe financial pressures on already \noverburdened programs, in some cases forcing cutbacks in the delivery \nof vital Government services.\n  Over the past 2 years in my capacity as the subcommittee's chairman, \nI have seen disturbing fraud and waste firsthand in a wide variety of \nprograms. Last year, for example, the subcommittee held several \nhearings to shine a spotlight on the massive fraud in the Medicare \nProgram. To cite just one example of the subcommittee's findings, our \ninvestigation revealed that the Federal Government had been sending \nMedicare checks to 14 fraudulent health care companies. These companies \nprovided absolutely no services to our senior citizens at all. Indeed, \nthe address listed by one such company did not even exist, and if it \nhad existed, it would have been located in the middle of the runway of \nthe Miami International Airport.\n  The fraud we uncovered was stunning. It costs taxpayers millions of \ndollars each year, diverting scarce resources from the elderly and \nlegitimate health care providers in a program already under enormous \nfinancial strain.\n  The Medicare fraud investigation and others like it were undertaken \nby my subcommittee working hand in hand with the inspectors general for \na variety of Federal agencies. The inspectors general are charged with \nidentifying and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in Federal programs \nadministered by the agencies they monitor.\n  Last year marked the 20th anniversary of the IG Act, the law that \nCongress passed to create these guardians of the public purse. As we \nrecognize this important milestone, it is important for Congress to \ntake a close look at the IG system. We must build on its strengths and \nremedy its weaknesses.\n  Over the past 21 years, the inspector general community has grown \nfrom 12 in 1978 to 58 inspectors general today. Offices of Inspectors \nGeneral receive more than a billion dollars in annual funding and \nemploy over 12,000 auditors, criminal investigators, and support \npersonnel. Each Office of Inspector General shoulders tremendous \nresponsibilities and is given considerable power to uncover waste, \nfraud, and abuse within Federal programs.\n  By and large, the IG community has performed in an outstanding \nmanner. IGs have made thousands of recommendations to Congress, \nultimately saving taxpayers billions of dollars. Inspectors general \nhave conducted investigations that have resulted in the recovery of \nhundreds of millions of dollars from companies and individuals who have \ndefrauded the Federal Government.\n  The inspectors general have a demonstrated record of success over the \npast 20 years. But as with all Government entities, we must ensure that \nthe IG community is as well-managed, accountable, and effective as \npossible. IGs are public watchdogs, but they, too, must be watched. \nWith these principles in mind and drawing on my extensive work with the \ninspectors general over the past 2 years, I am today introducing \nlegislation to improve the accountability, independence, and efficiency \nof the inspectors general program.\n\n  The legislation I am introducing is designed to increase the \naccountability of inspectors general while retaining and, in some \naspects, strengthening the provisions in law that guarantee their \nindependence from the agencies they oversee.\n  My bill establishes a renewable 9-year term of office for each of the \ninspectors general who are appointed by the President and confirmed by \nthe Senate. Currently, Presidential IGs serve for an indeterminate \nterm.\n  The IG community has testified that having a fixed term of office \nwould provide them with the assurances they need to be able to perform \ntheir vital but, in some cases, unpopular oversight responsibilities in \na more independent environment.\n  The 9-year term also would enhance IG autonomy because it would \nextend beyond two Presidential administrations.\n  There has been considerable turnover in some of the IG positions, and \nthe establishment of a fixed term would also encourage inspectors \ngeneral to serve for longer periods of time, thus, adding experience to \nthe IG community. Finally, by providing a defined term of service, an \nappropriate framework is provided for the evaluation of the performance \nof each IG to determine if re-appointment is warranted. Thus, Mr. \nPresident, the 9-year term I am proposing would both enhance the \nindependence of the IGs while improving their accountability.\n  My legislation also takes steps to streamline the IG offices \nthemselves, making them more efficient and flexible, by consolidating \nexisting offices and by reducing the frequency with which IGs must \nprepare and file resource-intensive reports.\n  Some of the IGs' offices that exist today are very small, with just a \nhandful of employees. They could be made more efficient and effective \nby transferring their functions to larger IG offices that oversee \nsimilar programs.\n  For example, my legislation consolidates the current stand-alone \noffice of the Federal Labor Relations Authority IG, which has just one \nemployee, into the Office of Personnel Management, thus eliminating \nunnecessary overhead and bureaucracy but continuing the vital audit and \noversight capacity of both agencies. In total, three existing small \nIGs' offices would be consolidated into the IG offices of major \ndepartments and two smaller IG offices would be consolidated into one \noffice.\n  Currently, Mr. President, the Offices of Inspectors General are \nrequired by law to provide semiannual reports to Congress. To increase \nthe value of these reports, I am reducing this requirement to a single \nannual report and streamlining the information presented. In this way, \nCongress can focus on high-risk areas before they get worse and before \nthe problems become more difficult to solve.\n  Mr. President, the inspectors general have made very valuable \ncontributions to the efficient operation of the Federal Government. \nTheir record, however, is not without blemish. For example, the \ncommunity's record was tarnished by the activities of the inspector \ngeneral at the Department of Treasury. After an extensive \ninvestigation, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found this \nparticular IG violated Federal contract laws in her award of two \nnoncompetitive, sole source contracts.\n  These actions not only wasted thousands of dollars but also shook the \nconfidence of Congress, the agency, and the public in the IG's ability \nto operate with the highest degree of integrity. It was extremely \ndisturbing to find that this inspector general was herself guilty of \nwasting resources and abusing the public trust. At the conclusion of \nour investigation, one could not help but wonder, who is watching the \nwatchdogs?\n  Let me emphasize, Mr. President, that in my view, problems like the \nones we uncovered in the Treasury Department are very unusual. They are \nnot characteristic of the IG community. They are not widespread. \nHowever, because the inspectors general are the very officials in the \nGovernment responsible for combating waste, fraud, and abuse, they \nshould be held\n\n[[Page S4123]]\n\nto the very highest ethical standards. Even one example of impropriety \nis cause for concern.\n  To increase accountability, my legislation requires independent \nexternal reviews of each IG office every 3 years. It gives each office \nthe flexibility to choose the most efficient method of review, but it \ndoes require that the watchdogs themselves submit to oversight by a \nqualified third party. This provision is intended to help ensure public \nconfidence in the management and the efficiency of the IG offices and \nwill provide valuable guidance to Congress in fulfilling our oversight \nresponsibilities.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that the National Commission \non the Separation of Powers has endorsed my recommendation that such an \nindependent, external review be conducted of each IG office. The \nCommission is a bipartisan committee sponsored by the Miller Center for \nPublic Affairs at the University of Virginia, and includes among its \nmembers former Senator Howard Baker, former White House Counsel Lloyd \nCutler, former U.S. Attorney William Barr, former Secretary of State \nLawrence Eagleburger, and former Director of Central Intelligence \nWilliam Webster. I am very proud that my proposal has been endorsed by \nsuch an esteemed organization.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today represents a major \nstep toward improving the effectiveness, the independence, and the \naccountability of the inspectors general program. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in this effort to strengthen and improve the inspectors \ngeneral program as we approach the next century.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 871. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to ensure \nthat veterans of the United States Armed Forces are eligible for \ndiscretionary relief from detention, deportation, exclusion, and \nremoval, and for other reasons; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               fairness to immigrant veterans act of 1999\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould ensure that veterans of the United States Armed Forces are not \nsummarily deported from this country. This bill would correct a grave \ninjustice wrought by the recent changes in immigration policy, which \nhas resulted in decorated war veterans being deported without any \nadministrative or judicial consideration of the equities.\n  Under the immigration ``reform'' legislation enacted in 1996, \nCongress passed and the President endorsed a broad expansion of the \ndefinition of what makes a legal resident deportable. In the rush to be \nthe toughest on illegal immigration, the bill also vastly limited \nrelief from deportation and imposed mandatory detention for thousands \nof permanent residents in deportation proceedings.\n  The zealousness of Congress and the White House to be tough on aliens \nhas successfully snared permanent residents who have spilled their \nblood for our country. As the INS prepares to deport these American \nveterans, we have not even been kind enough to thank them for their \nservice with a hearing to listen to their story and consider whether, \njust possibly, their military service or other life circumstances \noutweighs the government's interest in deporting them.\n  Here is the cold and ugly side of our ``tough'' immigration policies. \nHere are the human consequences of legislating by 30-second political \nad. Unfortunately the checks and balances of our government have failed \nthese veterans because Congress and this Administration are determined \nnot to be outdone by each other. ``Tough'' in this case means blinding \nourselves to the personal consequences of these people. It means \nsubstituting discretion with a cold rubber stamp that can only say \n``no.''\n  Our national policy on deportation of veterans is particularly \noutrageous at a time when we are sending tens of thousands of U.S. \nservicemen and women, including untold numbers of permanent residents, \ninto harms way. Why has Congress asked the INS to devote its limited \nresources to hunting down non-citizens who previously answered this \ncountry's call to duty, some of whom were permanently disabled in the \ncourse of their service?\n  Interestingly, it appears that even the INS agrees that military \nservice or other life circumstances may, on occasion, outweigh the \ngovernment's interest in deportation. In one recent case, which I \nbrought to the attention of INS Commissioner Meissner, the INS \neventually reached this conclusion. I am honored if my intervention \nplayed a part in obtaining some semblance of justice for Sergeant \nRafael Ramirez and his family. However, Sergeant Ramirez's example \nconfirms the need to ensure that every veteran's case is carefully \nreviewed by an immigration judge empowered to do justice.\n  The legislation that I introduce today restores for veterans the \nopportunity to go before an immigration judge to present the equities \nof their case and to have a Federal court review any deportation \ndecision. It also provides veterans with an opportunity to be released \nfrom detention while their case is under consideration.\n  The injustice addressed by this bill is just one egregious example of \nhow recent immigration ``reform'' has resulted in the break-up of \nAmerican families and the deportation of people who have contributed to \nour country. This Congress needs to address the broader injustices that \nour prior one-upmanship caused. In the meantime, this bill is an \nimportant step in the right direction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Abraham, \n        Mr. Levin, and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 872. A bill to impose certain limits on the receipt of out-of-\nState municipal solid waste, to authorize State and local controls over \nthe flow of municipal solid waste, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\nmunicipal solid waste interstate transportation and local authority act \n                                of 1999\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nalong with my colleague, Senator Bayh, that will allow states to \nfinally obtain relief from the seemingly endless stream of solid waste \nthat is flowing into states like Ohio and Indiana and many others.\n  Our bill, ``the Municipal Solid Waste Interstate Transportation and \nLocal Authority Act,'' gives state and local governments the tools they \nneed to limit garbage imports from other states and manage their own \nwaste within their own states.\n  Ohio receives about 1.4 million tons of municipal solid waste \nannually from other states. While I am pleased that these shipments \nhave been reduced since our record high of 3.7 million tons in 1989, I \nbelieve it is still entirely too high.\n  Because it is cheap and because it is expedient, other states have \nsimply put their garbage on trains or on trucks and shipped it to \nstates like Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia. This is \nwrong and it has to stop.\n  Many state and local governments have worked hard to develop \nstrategies to reduce waste and plan for future disposal needs. As \nGovernor of Ohio, I worked aggressively to limit shipments of out-of-\nstate waste into Ohio through voluntary cooperation of Ohio landfill \noperators and agreements with other states. We saw limited relief. But \nhonestly Mr. President, Ohio has no assurance that our out-of-state \nwaste numbers won't rise significantly with the upcoming closure of the \nFresh Kills landfill on Staten Island in 2001.\n  However, the federal courts have prevented states from enacting laws \nto protect our natural resources. What has emerged is an unnatural \npattern where Ohio and other states--both importing and exporting--have \ntried to take reasonable steps to encourage conservation and local \ndisposal, only to be undermined by a barrage of court decisions at \nevery turn.\n  Quite frankly, state and local governments' hands are tied. Lacking a \nspecific delegation of authority from Congress, states that have acted \nresponsibly to implement environmentally sound waste disposal plans and \nrecycling programs are still being subjected to a flood of out-of-state \nwaste. In Ohio, this has undermined our recycling efforts because \nOhioans continue to ask why they should recycle to conserve landfill \nspace when it is being used for other states' trash. Our citizens \nalready have to live with the consequences of large amounts of out-of-\n\n[[Page S4124]]\n\nstate waste--increased noise, traffic, wear and tear on our roads and \nlitter that is blown onto private homes, schools and businesses.\n  Ohio and many other states have taken comprehensive steps to protect \nour resources and address a significant environmental threat. However, \nexcessive, uncontrolled waste disposal in other states has limited the \nability of Ohioans to protect their environment, health and safety. I \ndo not believe the commerce clause requires us to service other states \nat the expense of our own citizens' efforts.\n  A national solution is long overdue. When I became Governor of Ohio \nin 1991, I joined a coalition with other Midwest Governors--Governor \nBayh (now Senator Bayh), Governor Engler and Governor Casey, and later \nGovernors Ridge and O'Bannon--to try to pass effective interstate waste \nand flow control legislation.\n  In 1996, Midwest Governors were asked to reach an agreement with \nGovernors Whitman and Pataki on interstate waste provisions. Our states \nquickly came to an agreement with New Jersey--the second largest \nexporting state--on interstate waste provisions. We began discussions \nwith New York, but these were put on hold indefinitely in the wake of \ntheir May, 1996 announcement to close the Fresh Kills landfill.\n  The bill that Senator Bayh and I are introducing today reflects the \nagreement that our two states, along with Michigan and Pennsylvania, \nreached with Governor Whitman.\n  For Ohio, the most important aspect of this bill is the ability for \nstates to limit future waste flows. For instance, they would have the \noption to set a ``permit cap,'' which would allow a state to impose a \npercentage limit on the amount of out-of-state waste that a new \nfacility or expansion of an existing facility could receive annually. \nOr, a state could choose a provision giving them the authority to deny \na permit for a new facility if it is determined that there is not a \nlocal or in-state regional need for that facility.\n  These provisions provide assurances to Ohio and other states that new \nfacilities will not be built primarily for the purpose of receiving \nout-of-state waste. For instance, Ohio EPA had to issue a permit for a \nlandfill that was bidding to take 5,000 tons of garbage a day--\napproximately 1.5 million tons a year--from Canada alone, which would \nhave doubled the amount of out-of-state waste entering Ohio. Thankfully \nthis landfill lost the Canadian bid. Ironically though, the waste \ncompany put their plans on hold to build the facility because there is \nnot enough need for the facility in the state and they need to ensure a \nsteady out-of-state waste flow to make the plan feasible.\n  With the announcement to close the Fresh Kills landfill, it is even \nmore critical to Ohio that states should receive the authority to place \nlimits on new facilities and expansions of existing facilities. The \nCongressional Research Service estimates that when Fresh Kills closes, \nthere will be an additional 13,200 tons of garbage each day diverted to \nother facilities. However, CRS also points out that there is only about \n1,200 tons per day of capacity available in the entire state of New \nYork. Even if New York handles some of that 13,200 tons a day in-state, \nit is estimated that about 4 million tons per year will still need to \nbe managed outside the state from that landfill alone.\n\n  In addition, this bill would ensure that landfills and incinerators \ncould not receive trash from other states until local governments \napprove its receipt. States also could freeze their out-of-state waste \nat 1993 levels, while some states would be able to reduce these levels \nto 65 percent by the year 2006. This bill also allows states to reduce \nthe amount of construction and demolition debris they receive by 50 \npercent in 2007 at the earliest.\n  States also could impose up to a $3-per-ton cost recovery surcharge \non out-of-state waste. This fee would help provide states with the \nfunding necessary to implement solid waste management programs.\n  And finally, the bill grants limited flow control authority in order \nfor municipalities to pay off existing bonds and guarantee a dedicated \nwaste stream for landfills or incinerators.\n  Flow control is important to states like New Jersey, which has taken \naggressive steps to try to manage all of its trash within its borders \nby the year 2000. New Jersey communities have acted responsibly to \nbuild disposal facilities to help meet that goal. However, if Congress \nfails to protect existing flow control authorities, repayment of the \noutstanding $1.9 billion investment in New Jersey alone will be \njeopardized.\n  I am deeply concerned that responsible decisions made by Ohio, New \nJersey and other states have been undermined and have put potentially \nlarge financial burdens on communities and have encouraged exporting \nstates to pass their trash problems onto the backs of others.\n  Twenty-four Governors, including Governor Whitman, and the Western \nGovernors' Association have sent letters to Congress strongly \nsupporting the provisions that are in our bill.\n  Unfortunately, efforts to place reasonable restrictions on out-of-\nstate waste shipments have been perceived by some as an attempt to ban \nall out-of-state trash. On the contrary, Senator Bayh and I are not \nasking for outright authority for states to prohibit all out-of-state \nwaste, nor are we seeking to prohibit waste from any one state.\n  We are asking for reasonable tools that will enable state and local \ngovernments to act responsibly to manage their own waste and limit \nunreasonable waste imports from other states. Such measures would give \nsubstantial authority to limit imports and plan facilities around our \nown states' needs.\n  I believe the time is right to move an effective interstate waste \nbill. The bill we are introducing today is a consensus of importing and \nexporting states--states that have willingly come forward to offer a \nreasonable solution.\n  Congress must act this year to give citizens in Ohio and other \naffected states the relief they need from the truckloads of waste \npassing through their communities. We have waited too long for a \nsolution. Congress must act now to prevent this problem from spreading \nfurther to our neighbors out West and to help our neighbors in the East \nbetter manage the trash they generate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill and a letter \nfrom Governors O'Bannon, Taft, Engler and Whitman and one from Governor \nRidge be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 872\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The need for such \n     legislation arose from various U.S. Supreme Court rulings \n     applying the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution to \n     state laws restricting out-of-state waste and directing the \n     flow of solid waste shipments.\n       We are committed to working with all states and building \n     upon the broad state support which exists to pass legislation \n     in the 106th Congress that will provide a balanced set of \n     controls for state and local governments to use in limiting \n     out-of-state waste shipments and directing intrastate \n     shipments. The need for congressional action on interstate \n     waste/flow control legislation is becoming more urgent. Last \n     year, the Congressional Research Service reported that its \n     most recent data showed interstate waste shipments increasing \n     to a total of over 25 million tons. The closing of the Fresh \n     Kills landfill in New York City is likely to dramatically \n     increase that figure.\n       Your bill includes provisions which we believe are \n     important for state and local governments such as the general \n     requirement that local officials formally approve the receipt \n     of out-of-state municipal solid waste\n\n[[Page S4131]]\n\n     prior to disposal in landfills and incinerators. The \n     legislation does include a number of important exemptions for \n     current flows of waste. It also provides authority for states \n     to establish a statewide freeze of waste shipments or, in \n     some cases, implement reductions. In addition, the \n     legislation explicitly authorizes states to implement laws \n     requiring an assessment of regional and local needs before \n     issuing facility permits or establishing statewide out-of-\n     state percentage limitations for new or expanded facilities.\n       The legislation would also allow states to impose a $3-per-\n     ton cost recovery surcharge on out-of-state waste and would \n     provide additional authority for states to reduce the flow of \n     noncontaminated construction and demolition debris. Under a \n     separate set of provisions, states would also be authorized \n     to exercise limited flow control authority necessary to \n     protect public investments.\n       We recognize that the Municipal Solid Waste Interstate \n     Transportation and Local Authority Act of 1999 would not \n     establish an outright ban on out-of-state waste shipments; \n     instead, it would gives states and localities the tools they \n     need to better manage their in-state waste disposal needs and \n     protect important natural resources.

Mr. President, states have been struggling for years to \nensure safe, responsible management of out-of-state municipal solid \nwaste. As Governor of Indiana, I tried to ensure that Indiana's \ndisposal capacity would meet Indiana's municipal solid waste needs. \nEfforts to institute effective waste management policies were--and \ncontinue to be--thwarted by two obstacles. The first is the massive and \nunpredictable amounts of out-of-state waste flowing into state disposal \nfacilities. States' attempts to address that problem run into the \nsecond obstacle. The Supreme Court has established, in a series of \nopinions, that Congress must first provide the states the authority to \nregulate interstate waste.\n  I rise with my colleague today to introduce legislation to do just \nthat.\n  Senator Voinovich and I, as Governors, participated in a cooperative \neffort to develop a set of principles for federal action on interstate \nwaste. The Voinovich/Bayh interstate waste control bill is based on \nthose principles. Mr. President, the need for controls in interstate \nwaste is even more acute today than when I was a Governor. Current \ngovernors supporting our bill know this better than anyone.\n  In Indiana, waste imports are again on the rise. After decreasing \nfrom 1992 to 1994, waste imports increased significantly in 1995 and \ndoubled in 1996. Between 1996 and 1998, out-of state waste received by \nIndiana facilities increased by 32 percent to their highest level in \nthe last seven years. In fact, in 1998, 2.8 million tons of out-of-\nstate waste were disposed of in Indiana--that's 19 percent of all the \nwaste disposed of in Indiana's landfills. Our Department of \nEnvironmental Management has predicted that the state will run out of \nlandfill space in 2011--or earlier, so the time for action is now.\n  Senator Voinovich and I believe we have crafted a comprehensive, \nequitable approach to interstate waste management. Our bill will give \nstates the power to ensure manageable and predictable waste flows by \nfreezing waste imports at 1993 levels. States bearing the greatest \nburden of interstate waste--those that disposed of more than 650,000 \ntons in 1993--could reduce imported waste to 65 percent of the 1993 \nlevel by 2006. Our bill will give states the power to set a percentage \nlimitation on the amount of out-of-state waste that new or expanding \nfacilities could receive and give states the option to deny a permit to \na new or expanding facility if there is no regional or in-state need \nfor the facility. Local governments would have more power to determine \nwhether they want to accept out-of-state waste. They would be able to \nprohibit local disposal facilities that didn't receive out-of-state \nwaste in 1993 from starting to take it until the local government \napproved. This presumptive ban on interstate waste would not interfere \nwith facilities operating under existing host community agreements or \npermits.\n  This bill is the culmination of the work we did as Governors and the \ncoalition we are building as Senators. It attempts to forge a new and \nworkable compromise between the needs and rights of importing and \nexporting states and gives the people who must live with waste planning \ndecisions the power to make them. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to move this important legislation forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Landrieu, \n        Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 873.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nclose the U.S. Army School of the Americas. The school is the Army's \nSpanish language training facility for Latin American personnel. It is \nlocated in Fort Benning, GA. The school is a relic of the cold war with \na terrible legacy of teaching torture and assassination. It deserves to \nbe closed for what it has taught in the past, what it stands for in \nLatin American democracies today, and what its counterinsurgency \ntraining at such a tainted institution may create in the future.\n  This school was formed after World War II. Its mission, starting in \nthe 1960s, was to fight Communist insurgencies in Latin America. To do \nthis, instruction manuals used at the school from 1982 to 1991 \nrecommended execution, torture, and blackmail of insurgents. These \nmanuals at the U.S. Army School of the Americas advocated that Latin \nAmerican militaries spy on and infiltrate civic organizations such as \nopposition political parties, community organizations, and unions. They \nfundamentally confused what constitutes armed insurgency with genuine \ncivic opposition. To the Latin American dictators of the time, \ninsurgents were anybody who did not agree with them, leading to a \nvirtual war against civilians, religious leaders, and Native Americans.\n  The Chicago Tribune recently wrote an editorial noting the fact that \nthere would likely be very few reunions of the graduates of the Army \nSchool of the Americas. It is not surprising when you take a look at \nthe list of the graduates of this U.S. Army School of the Americas and \nconsider that it contains a list of some of the worst human rights \nabusers in recent Latin American history.\n  Let me be specific: 19 Salvadoran soldiers linked to the murder of 6 \nJesuit priests, their housekeeper, and her daughter in El Salvador in \n1989. Among the other graduates of the School of the Americas: 48 of 69 \nSalvadoran military members cited at the United Nations Truth \nCommission report on El Salvador for involvement in human rights \nviolations. The list goes on: Former Panamanian dictator and convicted \ndrug dealer Manuel Noriega and nine other Latin American military \ndictators; El Salvador death squad leader Roberto D'Aubuisson; two of \nthe three killers of Catholic Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador.\n  I continue reading the list of graduates from the U.S. Army School of \nthe Americas at Fort Benning, GA: Mexican General Juan Lopez Ortiz, \nwhose troops committed the Ocosingo massacre in Chiapas in 1994; \nGuatamalan Colonel Julio Alpirez, linked to the murder of U.S. citizen \nMichael Devine in 1990, and Efrain Bamaca, husband of Jennifer Harbury \nin 1992; 124 of the 247--more than half--Colombian military officials \naccused of human rights violations in the 1992 work ``State Terrorism \nin Colombia,'' compiled by a large coalition of European and Colombian \nnongovernmental organizations; 2 of the 3 officers prosecuted by \nGuatemala for masterminding the killing of anthropologist Myrna Mack in \n1992, as well as several leaders of the notorious Guatamalan military \nunit D-2.\n  I continue to read the list of graduates of the U.S. Army School of \nthe Americas at Fort Benning, GA: Argentinian dictator Leopoldo \nGaltieri, a leader of the so-called ``dirty war,'' during which some \n30,000 civilians were killed or ``disappeared;'' Haitian Colonel \nGambetta Hyppolite, who ordered his soldiers to fire on a provincial \nelectoral bureau in 1987; several Peruvian military officers linked to \nthe July 1992 killings of 9 students and a professor from La Cantuta \nUniversity.\n  I read on from the list of graduates of the U.S. Army School of the \nAmericas, Fort Benning, GA: Several Honduran officers linked to a \nclandestine military force known as Battalion 316 responsible for \ndisappearances in the 1980s; 10 of the 12 officers responsible for the \nmurder of 900 civilians in the El Salvadoran village of El Mozote; and, \nfinally, 3 of the 5 officers involved in the 1980 rape and murder of 4 \nU.S. churchwomen in El Salvador. These are all graduates of the U.S. \nArmy School of the Americas, Fort Benning, GA.\n  This school is not a victim of a few isolated incidents of wrongdoing \nby its graduates. This list shows that human rights violations are \nendemic among its graduates, with far in excess of 200 murders and \nother human rights violators by its past roll of honor graduates.\n  Can the School of the Americas claim innocence in the actions of its \ngraduates? Many do not think it is possible. For example, just a few \nmonths ago the Guatemalan Truth Commission Report faulted the school's \ncounterinsurgency training as having ``had a significant impact on the \nhuman rights violations during the armed conflict,'' a conflict that \nkilled 200,000 people.\n  How, in the name of humanity or democracy, can the people of America \nallow this school to remain open? How can we sanction the legacy \nperpetuated by its name today? The Latin American dictatorships of the \n1970s and 1980s have given way to democracy, some fragile, some strong. \nBut to the people of these countries, the continued existence of the \nArmy School of the Americas perpetuates the unfortunate link between \nthe United States and the perpetrators of the heinous crimes I have \njust listed. The school should be closed to send a powerful signal to \ndemocratic countries of Latin America that America repudiates the \nterror, the torture, and the murder carried out against civilian \npopulations by Central and South American military forces run amok.\n\n  I am not proposing that we hold this U.S. foreign military program \naccountable for the actions attributed to the graduates. We know from \nexperience that people can be brutal with or without training. But \nneither can we deny the links of those human rights abusers to the \nSchool of the Americas. Just a few of those examples should have been \nenough for us to quickly close that school in shame.\n  In the post-cold-war era, it is more important than ever for the \nUnited States to promote democratic values and human rights in \ndeveloping countries and to reject militaries that view their own \ncountries' citizens as the enemy.\n  The Pentagon will tell you that the Army has tried to make changes at \nthe school by updating the curriculum to include discussions of human \nrights and by approving the selection process for students and the \nquality of the teaching staff. I do not doubt that some changes have \nbeen made, but I am not confident that these changes are enough or \ncould ever be enough at a facility with such a sorry history.\n  To be sure the continuing counterinsurgency training will not lead to \nfuture abuses against legitimate civic opposition, we must close this \nschool. The U.S. Army School of the Americas is trying to sell itself \nwith a new mission--certainly a topical mission--counternarcotics \ntraining. But the Chicago Tribune in an April 16 editorial addressed \nthis assertion of a new mission directly:\n\n       Attempts to recast the school as an anti-narcotics center \n     are so much hokum. Little in the curriculum is related to \n     drug interdiction, and it is not at all clear that the U.S. \n     Army is qualified to impart such instruction or that training \n     the notoriously meddlesome Latin militaries to get involved \n     in civilian law enforcement is advisable.\n\n  Most importantly, cosmetic changes in the curriculum cannot salvage \nthe savage reputation of this school's graduates or erase the U.S. Army \nSchool of the Americas' bloody and embarrassing legacy. We offer plenty \nof other training opportunities for Latin American military personnel. \nWe do not need this school, Latin America's fragile democracies do not \nneed it, and it should be closed.\n  Last weekend it was my privilege to be part of a delegation sent by \nthe leadership in Congress to go to Germany, Italy, Albania, Macedonia, \nand Belgium. During that visit, we met many of America's finest men and \nwomen in uniform who are literally doing their duty for this country, \nfighting to protect democracy and to accomplish the mission that has \nbeen assigned to them. I was so proud to be there and greet those from \nIllinois and from around the country and to thank them for the job they \nare doing for this country.\n  What I am about today is no reflection on them. In fact, I suggest to \nthe leaders in the Pentagon, in the name of the men and women currently \nin uniform, to make certain that they don't\n\n[[Page S4133]]\n\nhave to answer the troubling questions about the existence of this \nSchool of the Americas, it should be closed forthwith.\n  If there are those who want to come forward and suggest there are \nsome missions at the school that can be transferred to another place, \nentirely peaceful, entirely constructive, entirely defensible, I will \nlisten to that and I am open to it. But, please, once and for all let \nus close this sorry, sad chapter at the U.S. Army School of the \nAmericas at Fort Benning, GA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",

Mr. President, today a number of my colleagues \nintroduced legislation to lock up America's best chance to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  This legislation is bad policy Mr. President and should be vigorously \nopposed.\n\n\n                  increasing dependence on foreign oil\n\n  Many times on the floor of the Senate my colleagues have heard me \ntalk about the United State's increasing dependence on foreign oil.\n  I have made the point that we are importing too much of our oil from \noversees while watching our domestic level of production decrease by \nthe day.\n  Consider the following:\n  In 1994, domestic oil production dropped to 6.6 million barrels a \nday--the lowest annual level since 1954;\n  North slope oil fields--which provide 25 percent of our domestic \nproduction--has been in decline since 1988.\n  At the same time, national demand has steadily increased more than \n17.7 million barrels per day--the highest level since the mid-1970's\n  Today the U.S. imports close to 56 percent of its oil.\n  Just how significant is a 56 percent dependence on foreign oil--lets \nlook at it:\n  In 1973, the year of the Arab oil embargo--the year of the 2-hour \nwait at the gas lines--the United States was 36 percent dependent on \nforeign oil\n  In 1991, the year of Desert Storm, the United States was 46 percent \ndependent on foreign oil\n  Now we are 54 percent dependent.\n  And if we don't act soon there is no way to stop our increasing \ndependence on imported oil--a dependence our own Government says could \nbe 67 percent by 2010.\n  In the meantime countries such as Algeria, Iraq, Libya, and Nigeria \nare all planning to increase their production levels.\n  Locking up ANWR in wilderness and increasing our dependence on \nforeign oil is bad policy.\n\n\n              anwr reserve estimates are the highest ever\n\n  In 1998 the Department of the Interior published the results of over \n3\n\n[[Page S4136]]\n\nyears of research on the oil and gas potential of the 1002 area of \nANWR.\n  The 1998 estimates is the highest estimate ever published regarding \nthe 1002 area estimating a mean resource for the coastal plain of 7.7 \nbillion barrels of produceable oil.\n  The new estimates are significantly higher than those produced by the \nDepartment of the Interior in 1987 which led to their recommendation to \nCongress to open the 1.5 million-acre area to responsible oil and gas \nleasing, exploration, and production.\n\n\n          technology in the arctic allows for safe development\n\n  The sponsors of the legislation do not recognize the incredible \nadvances in development technologies on the North Slope.\n  This technology has reduced the size of the impact from development \nby more than 60 percent and is literally the best in the world.\n\n\n      alaskans and native people of alaska overwhelmingly support\n\n  Virtually all of Alaska's elected officials--both Republicans and \nDemocrats support the careful development of this area.\n  The overwhelming majority of the Native people of Alaska support \ndevelopment of this area and strongly oppose wilderness designation, \nincluding the people who live in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \nCoastal Plain.\n  Recently the mayor of the North Slope Borough, Ben Nageak, who was \nborn in the heart of the coastal plain at Kaktovik, wrote a letter to \nthe President opposing wilderness designation.\n\n       The oil industry has been a good friend to the environment \n     here while providing us with money and jobs so that we could \n     be more productive members of American society. It \n     (wilderness designation) will cripple our ability to wean \n     ourselves away from the Federal Government's subsidies and \n     destroy our attempts at self reliance.\n\n                            jobs and revenue\n\n  It is estimated between 250,000 and 750,000 jobs nationwide will be \ncreated through safe exploration and development.\n  Billions of dollars of Federal revenues would be generated by safe \nexploration and development.\n  As a nation dependent on energy for our economic survival we have to \nfind and produce energy here at home.\n  We must stop driving our energy producing industries and our energy \njobs overseas.\n  According to the Department of Energy, U.S. dependence on foreign oil \nis expected to rise to 70 percent by the year 2000.\n  How much more likely are we to put our children and grand children in \nhams way on foreign oil to protect our domestic interests when we \nimport 70 percent of our oil?\n  How can elected officials of this country--Members of this body--\nthink that it is better policy to rely on oil from the likes of Saddam \nHussein for U.S. energy security that it is to develop and produce our \nown?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/22/senate-section/article/S4136-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO WALTER H.

His dynamic and expert service has contributed to both the \nBank and Corporation immeasurably. The great success achieved by the \nCorporation and by the Bank have been in large measure due to the \nexcellent leadership, generosity of spirit and untiring devotion that \nMr. Weiner has brought to his more than nineteen years of dedicated \nservice as Chief Executive Officer of these organizations.

Mr. President, first I must congratulate the \nChairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, for producing an \non-time budget for only the second time in the 24-plus-year history of \nthe Budget Act.\n  I rise today to support the fiscal year 2000 budget resolution now \nbefore the Senate. I am pleased that this budget will pay down the \nFederal debt, boost education spending, and increase veterans health \ncare spending. I am disappointed that budget conferees could only fund \n$6 billion of the $10 billion proposed by myself and Senator Dodd in \nchild care grants for low-income families and child care tax cuts. \nHowever, I appreciate the hard work Senator Domenici and others put \ninto getting these funds.\n  While I realize that our amendment would not have guaranteed an \nincrease in child care spending, Congress needs to face up to the \nreality that low-income mothers need to work, and to make work pay they \nneed child care assistance. As Chairman of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, I can assure supporters of child care \nsubsidies that this will not be the last word on this issue during the \n106th Congress.\n  On a more positive note, this budget adheres to the historic Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997, while at the same time, over the next ten years, \npays down $1.8 trillion of the $3.6 trillion in publicly held debt and \nprovides for modest tax cuts until larger on-budget surpluses emerge.\n  Additionally the Republican budget will fence off the portion of the \nsurplus generated through Social Security payroll taxes. I would like \nto reassure all Vermonters that not a dollar of these funds will be \nused to fund tax cuts. Instead, Social Security payroll taxes will go \ntowards shoring up the program and possibly go toward providing capital \nfor an overhaul plan. While this alone will not ensure the long-term \nfinancial health of the program, it will have the effect of reducing \nFederal debt and extending the solvency of the program.\n  Mr. President, the budget before the Senate also protects Medicare \nfor our nation's seniors. Funding for Medicare is increased \nsignificantly, but like Social Security, the long-term health of the \nprogram is dependent not on providing additional funds, but on enacting \nneeded structural changes. As the resolution indicates, Medicare \nbeneficiaries must have access to high-quality skilled nursing \nservices, home health care services and inpatient and outpatient \nhospital services in rural areas. The availability of these services is \nat risk, especially for rural populations, and I will do all I can to \nensure that they are addressed as a part of any Medicare legislation. I \nam particularly pleased that the resolution includes a Medicare drug \nbenefit reserve fund. The availability of a drug benefit for seniors is \none of my highest priorities, and I plan to work with other members of \nthe Finance Committee to have it included as a part of any Medicare \nreform effort.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased that section 210 of the budget \nresolution sets forth a reserve fund ``to foster the employment and \nindependence of individuals with disabilities.'' The language makes \nclear that, in the Senate, revenue and spending aggregates and other \nappropriate budgetary levels and limits may be adjusted and allocations \nmay be revised for legislation that finances disability programs to \npromote employment. This direction will facilitate the consideration of \nS. 331, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, which now has 72 \ncosponsors.\n  I am also pleased that the resolution contains Senator Collins and my \nSense of the Senate in support of increased funding for the Pell grant \nprogram, the campus based programs, LEAP and TRIO. These programs have \nhelped make the dream of college a reality for many of our nation's \nneediest students. Providing an increase in\n\n[[Page S4137]]\n\nfunding for these tested and proven programs will open the doors of \nhigher education to more academically motivated young people, \nspecifically those who have the most financial need.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, given world events and the ever increasing \ndemands we place on our military, I am pleased that this budget calls \nfor an increase in military pay. We need to do more to alleviate the \nquality of life concerns of our men and women in uniform. However, I am \nconcerned that some of the military increases in this budget are not \ngoing to the things that the military needs most, as evidenced by the \ncurrent crisis in Kosovo.\n  This budget, like all budgets passed by Congress, is an expression of \npolitical intent and a starting point for bargaining. Much work remains \nto be done to pass the 13 appropriations bills that actually fund the \ngovernment. In areas where I disagree with the budget resolution, I \nplan to work hard with appropriators to adjust spending levels and turn \nthis budget into reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/22/senate-section/article/S4137-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       2D LT.

George W.P. Walker.\n  George Walker was an outstanding soldier, scholar and leader. He \ngraduated from the U.S. Military Academy No. 1 in his class. George \nWalker received many prestigious awards for his educational and \nmilitary prowess. He was admired and respected by his classmates as a \nman of honor and a true friend. Tragically, 2d Lt. Walker died in an \nairplane accident in 1959 while he was en route to Oakland, CA, for an \noverseas assignment.\n  I wish to recognize the remarkable life of 2d Lt. George W.P. Walker \nby printing in the Record the February 2, 1959, remarks of Congressman \nFrancis Dorn who appointed 2d Lt. Walker to the U.S. Military Academy. \nI ask that Congressman Dorn's remarks be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow.\n\n                       2d Lt. George W.P. Walker\n\n       Mr. DORN of New York. Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness \n     that I inform my colleagues of the death of 2d Lt. George \n     W.P. Walker, son of Mr. and Mrs. George Walker of 1103 East \n     34th Street, Brooklyn, N.Y. Lieutenant Walker was in an \n     aircraft accident in North Carolina while he was enroute to \n     Oakland, Calif., for overseas assignment.\n       Lieutenant Walker was my appointee to the U.S. Military \n     Academy and when he was graduated from that institution in \n     June of 1958, he stood No. 1 in his class. For the entire \n     time he attended the Military Academy, he was carried on the \n     dean's list.\n       Upon graduation, he was presented with the following \n     awards:\n       For having the highest rating in mechanics of fluids, a \n     portable typewriter, presented by the National Society, \n     Daughters of the American Revolution.\n       For excellence in intercollegiate debating, a wristwatch \n     presented by the Consul General of Switzerland.\n       As the No. 1 man in military topography, a wristwatch \n     presented by the Daughters of the Union Veterans of the Civil \n     War.\n       The Francis Vinton Greene Memorial, caliber .45 pistol, \n     presented in the name of Mrs. Green, for standing No. 1 in \n     general order of merit for 4 years; a set of books presented \n     by the American Bar Association for having the highest rating \n     in law; a silver tray--called the Eisenhower Award--presented \n     by the American Bar Association for having the highest rating \n     in law; a silver tray--called the Eisenhower Award--presented \n     by Mr. Charles P. McCormick of Baltimore, Md., for excellence \n     in military psychology and leadership.\n       In addition to maintaining his very high military and \n     academic standing while at the Academy, Cadet Walker was \n     active in extracurricular activities, and during his last \n     year held the rank of lieutenant in the Corps of Cadets.\n       The Nation has lost a potential outstanding military leader \n     and the loss is indeed a great one.

Mr. President, I wish today to recognize a group \nfrom Pueblo, Colorado--the Pueblo Pachyderm Club. This is Founders Week \nof the National Federation of the Grand Order of Pachyderm Clubs, and I \nthink it is fitting that we acknowledge their civic efforts and \nattitude.\n  The Pueblo Pachyderm Club, and the National Federation of Pachyderm \nClubs, have a motto--``Free government requires active citizens.'' \nTheir goal is to develop future leaders and better citizenship through \nthe promotion of wide-spread involvement by good citizens in politics. \nThey advocate better government through club programs and open \nmeetings, by providing scholarships for political science students, by \nsponsoring campaign workshops, and by encouraging awareness of \npolitical affairs.\n  The founders who have worked tirelessly for the Pueblo Pachyderm Club \nfor years deserve special recognition. They have made the Club a \nfixture in the Pueblo community. The Club's regularly scheduled \nluncheons have become an avenue for local and state officials to meet \nwith and listen to the concerns and thoughts of the community.\n  Bringing together citizens, and hosting politicians and officials, \nleads to greater and better communication and fosters the beginning of \nnew political interests and political potential. To simplify it--the \nmore the better. The larger the percentage of our public that is \ninvolved in policy decision making, the better. With this in mind, the \nPachyderm Club continues its mission. I wish them the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/22/senate-section/article/S4137-5", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4137-S4138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  CONGRATULATIONS TO THE LOW VISION INFORMATION CENTER FOR 2O YEARS OF \nPUBLIC SERVICE\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \n20th anniversary of the Low Vision Information Center, LVIC, located in \nBethesda, Maryland. This unique center provides\n\n[[Page S4138]]\n\ncritical help to visually impaired individuals and their families.\n  Low vision is the third leading cause of disability in the United \nStates whose causes, among others, include macular degeneration and \nglaucoma. Low vision is a life altering condition which prevents \nmillions of Americans from performing ostensibly elementary tasks such \nas reading, walking without aid, dialing the telephone, and even \nrecognizing the faces of family and friends. Unlike other vision \ncomplications, low vision cannot be corrected with glasses and \ncontacts, nor are there medical or surgical solutions available. There \nare, however, research and rehabilitation centers which address low \nvision, including Maryland's own Johns Hopkins Lions Vision Research \nand Rehabilitation Center at the Wilmer Eye Institute, which research \nthe condition and help formulate ways in which the challenges posed by \nlow vision can be reduced.\n  The LVIC provides a related but unique service. Established 20 years \nago, LVIC is dedicated to helping individuals with low vision cope with \ndaily tasks in a home-like setting with the most up-to-date technology, \nLVIC has served more than 40,000 clients and their families during its \n20-year history. Currently, LVIC staff and volunteers see up to 150 \nclients a month in their downtown Bethesda office. LVIC helps people \nwith everything from successfully pouring a cup of coffee, to writing \npersonal checks, to learning how to use a talking watch. Additionally, \nLVIC often shows vision professionals what it is like to suffer from \nlow vision by providing them with goggles that simulate various eye \nafflictions. Staff and volunteers also visit senior centers and nursing \nhomes to educate this populace about low vision.\n  Mr. President, it has always been my firm belief that public service \nis one of the most honorable callings, one that demands the very best, \nmost dedicated efforts of those fortunate enough to serve their fellow \ncitizens. LVIC provides a critical public service to countless \nindividuals in our society, both by directly helping those who suffer \nfrom low vision, and by educating professionals and lay people alike on \nthe causes, symptoms and technology available relating to low vision. I \nam pleased to join with all of LVIC's clients and their families, staff \nand volunteers in celebrating 20 years of public service that has \nsignificantly improved the quality of life for low vision individuals \nin our society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/22/senate-section/article/S4138-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE CLEAN GASOLINE ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am adding my name as a \ncosponsor of S. 171 the Clean Gasoline Act of 1999. This bill sets a \nnational, year-round cap on the sulfur content of gasoline sold in the \nUnited States. The bill would bring American gasoline standards in-line \nwith the low sulfur levels required in Japan, Australia, the European \nUnion and the State of California.\n  As we all know, cars are a significant source of air pollution. This \nbill would have an effect on pollution equal to removing 54 million \nvehicles from the road. The reason for such a dramatic improvement is \nthat sulfur in gasoline coats the car's catalytic converter and spoils \nits ability to reduce emissions smog-forming pollutants. More than 30 \npercent of these pollutants are emitted by cars and trucks.\n  In the new breed of low emission vehicles, sulfur is particularly \ndamaging. Engineers have created a new generation of pollution control \ndevices for these vehicles that more effectively reduce smog-forming \nemissions. But, these cutting-edge technologies are poisoned by even \nmoderate sulfur levels in the gasoline. According to industry research \non this new class of clean cars, reducing gasoline sulfur concentration \nfrom the current national average of 330 parts per million to 40 ppm \nwill reduce hydrocarbon emissions by 34 percent, carbon monoxide \nemissions by 43 percent, and nitrogen oxides emissions by 51 percent.\n  If these devices fail to work properly because they are clogged with \nsulfur, those emissions reductions will be lost and much of our \ninvestment in cleaner automotive technology will be wasted.\n  More importantly, lower sulfur levels in gasoline will reduce \nemissions from nearly every car on the road today--not just those with \nthe latest pollution control devices. This is because reducing the \nsulfur content of gaoline instantly improves the performance of all \ncatalytic converters in all cars. Low-sulfur fuel adds value to our \nexisting investments in pollution control technology. There are more \nthan 125 million passenger cars on the road today, and this bill will \nmake almost every single one of them cleaner.\n  I'm sure my colleagues recall the phase-out of leaded gasoline in the \nlate 1970s. We undertook that phase-out because we understood that \ncatalytic converters--a new technology at the time--would not work with \nlead in the gasoline. Now is the time to phase-out sulfur because, by \nreducing sulfur levels, we can reap more rewards from existing \ntechnology and eliminate barriers to new technology.\n  Reducing sulfur levels in gasoline will require some changes to oil \nrefining and processing techniques, and there is a modest cost \nassociated with that. But, no other strategy can achieve such large \nreductions in air pollutants so quickly. We must capitalize on two \ndecades of improvements in automotive technology by making similar \nadvances in the gasoline used in those cars.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/22/senate-section/article/S4138-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4138-S4139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION CENTER DEDICATION\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to share with my \ncolleagues a very special occasion for education. I proudly want to \nshare in the celebration as Oglebay Institute announces its new and \nsophisticated 11,700-square foot Schrader Environmental Educational \nCenter in Wheeling, West Virginia. The incredible opportunities that \nwill be offered by this state-of-the-art facility characterize the \nOglebay Institute's dedication to educating students and adults about \nscience, nature, and the environment.\n  The Oglebay Institute in Wheeling, West Virginia is a non-profit \norganization with a particularly distinguished mission of promoting \nlifelong learning in a variety of creative ways and areas. The \nInstitute lends its support to the visual and creative arts, sponsoring \nregional and national artists in two museums as well as a fine arts \ncenter. By hosting numerous plays and concerts every year, the Oglebay \nperforming arts department is equally important in adding to the \ncultural richness of the surrounding community. To promote regional \nnatural history interpretation and preservation, the Institute \ncarefully maintains 4.5 miles of discovery trails and a butterfly and \nwildflower garden in the 1,650 acre Oglebay Park. Such resources are \nwell utilized in programs for regional wildlife education. The \nopportunities available range from nature walks to bird observation, \nand travel programs to celebrations of Earth Week. The environmental \neducation department, whose accomplishments we honor today, caters to a \nwealth of individual interests while promoting universal environmental \nliteracy and motivation. Particularly noteworthy in such endeavors are \nthe hands-on experiences with various aspects of nature. In the program \nofferings such options abound; participants choose from among \nastronomy, maple sugaring and interactive computer simulations.\n  For sixty-eight years, the Oglebay Institute has been a pioneer in \nthis field of nature, science and environmental education, successfully \ncoupling recreation with the promotion of environmental awareness. The \nnew Environmental Education Center, with its exceptional design and \nideal location, insures a great contribution to this vision. The \nSchrader Center's exhibition areas will offer interactive opportunities \nexploring all issues, ranging from the self-supporting nature of the \nEarth to our role as its caretakers. At the newly constructed cutting \nedge learning center, outreach technology will enable adaption of \neducational programs to extend education to local students and others \nthanks to distance learning. I have full confidence that the proximity \nof the Environmental Education Center to the expansive Oglebay Park, \nwhere many outdoor activities take place, will serve as further \nincentive to enjoy the remarkable opportunities available.\n  West Virginians and tourists from across the country visit Oglebay \nPark and learn from the Oglebay Institute. For seven decades, the \nOglebay Institute has provided education, culture, and recreational \nactivities for crowds\n\n[[Page S4139]]\n\nthroughout the region. Among the eager participants are school groups \nwho can gain hands-on experience at the new center.\n  The Oglebay Institute's efforts to educate and fully engage are \ncritical to an environmentally-conscious future, and worthy of our \nattention and praise. The Schrader Environmental Education Center will \nundoubtedly prove to be an enormous asset to West Virginians and the \nentire region as a way to improve our understanding of science and our \nnature. This is a special day for the Oglebay Institute and the entire \nWheeling area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/22/senate-section/article/S4139-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHAMPIONING THE GIFT OF LIFE\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI.

As a leader in one of New Jersey's largest \npharmaceutical companies, Dr. Douglas has been responsible for the \nresearch, development, manufacturing and marketing of Merck's vaccine \nline. In addition to his responsibilities at Merck, Dr. Douglas has \nhelped improve the lives of thousands of people throughout the world \nthrough his leadership roles in his company's and the State's blood \ndrives.\n  In 1998, Dr. Douglas encouraged over 3,400 Merck employees in New \nJersey to give the life-saving gift of blood. He took a significant \nleadership role with the New Jersey Blood Services by chairing the \nBlood Donor Campaign in 1997-1998 and encouraging colleagues in other \ncorporations to increase their blood drive efforts. Under his \nleadership, the Merck Blood Drive Program received the America's Blood \nCenters 1999 Platinum Award, the highest blood drive award given by the \nNation's largest network of independent, community blood centers.\n  Dr. Douglas has served as a physician, academician, and world-class \nleader in the fight against infectious diseases. As a graduate of \nCornell University Medical School, he has served as a clinical \ninvestigator at the National Institute of Health, a member of the \nfaculty at the Baylor College of Medicine, and the School of Medicine \nat the University of Rochester, and later returned to Cornell as \nChairman of the Department of Medicine in the Medical College before \nbeginning his career at Merck.\n  In a career marked by many valuable achievements, I am pleased today \nto highlight Dr. Douglas' contributions to New Jersey and \nsociety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/22/senate-section/article/S4139-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

The law was so successful that we expanded the \nCoastal Barrier System in 1990 with the support of the National \nTaxpayers Union, the American Red Cross, Coast Alliance, and Tax Payers \nfor Common Sense, to name just a few.\n  When we mapped the coastline some mistakes were made, and S. 574 \nwould make technical corrections. the first change modifies the upper \nnortheastern boundary to exclude land under development at the time of \nits inclusion into the system. the second change modifies the \nnorthwestern boundary to include a section of the Cape Henlopen State \nPark that was mistakenly excluded when the boundary was drawn. S. 574 \nis identical to a bill that passed the Senate by unanimous consent last \nyear.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 574) was considered read a third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                 S. 574\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CORRECTIONS TO MAP.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall \n     make such corrections to the map described in subsection (b) \n     as are necessary to move on that map the boundary of the \n     otherwise protected area (as defined in section 12 of the \n     Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 3503 note; \n     Public Law 101-591)) to the Cape Henlopen State Park boundary \n     to the extent necessary--\n       (1) to exclude from the otherwise protected area the \n     adjacent property leased, as of the date of enactment of this \n     Act, by the Barcroft Company and Cape Shores Associates \n     (which are privately held corporations under the law of the \n     State of Delaware); and\n       (2) to include in the otherwise protected area the \n     northwestern corner of Cape Henlopen State Park seaward of \n     the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal.\n       (b) Map Described.--The map described in this subsection is \n     the map that is included in a set of maps entitled ``Coastal \n     Barrier Resources System'', dated October 24, 1990, as \n     revised October 15, 1992, and that relates to the unit of the \n     Coastal Barrier Resources System entitled ``Cape Henlopen \n     Unit DE-03P''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/22/senate-section/article/S4139-6", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4139-S4140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nUSE OF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR CONCERTS TO BE CONDUCTED BY THE NATIONAL \n                           SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, on the eve of the gathering of all of \nNATO to celebrate the successful completion of our first 50 years, I \nwanted to take this opportunity to comment on the current situation in \nEurope.\n  As you know, we are blessed to live in a country which enjoys a \ndeeply rooted democracy and a deeply rooted sense of equality. However, \nthese same characteristics and qualities which make America a model for \nthe world also present very real challenges in times like these.\n  It is often said that the most difficult task for any democracy is \ndeciding to go to war. The reasons are self-evident. When you live in a \nnation that believes all people are created equal, how do you ask some \ncitizens to sacrifice so much so that others may continue to enjoy \ntheir freedom? When you live in a nation where human life is sacred, \nwhere, in fact each individual life has dignity, how do you build a \nconsensus for the sacrifices that may be necessary to achieve the \nvictory that we hope for?\n  The task is even more complex when the challenge to American freedom \nis more indirect, as it is in this case. We have confronted this \nreality since the beginning of the war in Kosovo. No one in America \nbelieves that Serbia intends to invade the United States. We will never \nlook out of the window and see Yugoslavian tanks driving down \nPennsylvania Avenue to squelch American liberties. It remains, then, \nfor those of us in the leadership of this Nation who support NATO \noperations in Kosovo to explain why we are prepared to ask American \ntroops to make the sacrifices that may be necessary, in this seemingly \nremote and distant land.\n  I believe there is one central reason that justifies our actions, and \nthat is the price, the tremendous price, we have already paid for \nfreedom in America and in Europe.\n\n[[Page S4141]]\n\n  Our parents' generation and their parents were asked to risk their \nlives to fundamentally alter the way the world operates. In World War \nI, President Wilson asked our grandparents to fight to make the world \n``safe for democracy,'' and they did. In World War II, when fascism \nthreatened to conquer the democracies of Europe, President Roosevelt \nasked America to become ``the arsenal of democracy,'' and we were. \nDuring the cold war, President Kennedy called on Americans to ``pay any \nprice, to bear any burden,'' to meet the threat of communism, and we \nhave. Finally, President Reagan said insisted that we ``tear down that \nwall,'' and it was.\n  We emerged victorious from World Wars I and II, as well as the cold \nwar, but not without a price. American blood was spilled in the \ntrenches of World War I and on the beaches of Normandy during World War \nII. Americans fought and died in Korea and Vietnam to contain communism \nduring the Cold War. So, for more than three generations, Americans \nhave been making the sacrifices necessary to change the world in which \nwe live and to maintain democracy in Europe and, yes, indeed, to help \nspread it throughout the entire world.\n  It is important to remember that this sacrifice has not been in vain. \nIt is easy today to be cynical about human nature and the prospects for \nlasting peace in Europe. After all, these feuds in Europe predated \nAmerica's existence by many centuries. But to dwell on the worst \ninstincts of Europe and Western civilization is to ignore the very real \nprogress and the tremendous victories that have been made possible by \nour allied unity and American intervention.\n  Who would have imagined that in a little over 50 years, since the end \nof World War II, bitter enemies like France and Germany, England and \nItaly, would be joined by a common currency, a common market, and a \npledge to defend one another against a common enemy? It was the \nsacrifice of many, including Americans, that made it possible for \nEurope to turn its back on a history of bloody conflict and embrace a \nvision for peace and democracy across its great continent.\n  Ironically, as NATO expands to the east and the European Union \nincorporates still more of Europe, we are faced with a war in \nYugoslavia that threatens to undo all of this good work. It is ironic \nbecause that is how this century began, with an act of violence from \nSerbia which sparked a world war.\n  The President is fond of saying that the war in Kosovo will either be \nthe last war of the 20th century or the first war of the 21st. What I \nbelieve he is trying to say is, that we can defeat Milosevic and give \nmeaning to nearly 100 years of American struggle and effort to bring \npeace to Europe and secure the gains of our parents and grandparents, \nor we can turn our backs on their sacrifice, ignore the human tragedy, \nignore the tremendous financial investment that has already been made. \nThen we will hope against our experience that the conflict in Kosovo \nwill simply fade away.\n  Many have remarked that the 20th century has been the most bloody in \nhuman history. It is hard to verify such claims. Nevertheless, it is \ntrue that we live in an era where the efficiency of industry and \ntechnology has been matched, unfortunately, by our expert ability to \nkill one another. We must, however, stay the course and join with our \nNATO allies to finish our work and eliminate military aggression and \nethnic cleansing as a legitimate tool of national policy.\n  There is a sleepy little town in Austria, near the German border \ncalled Branau am Inn. It is not one of those towns at the crossroads of \nEurope; it is not the home of kings and emperors. In fact, no one in \nBranau, if it were not for a small event, no one in the world would \nhave ever heard of Branau. But it is the birthplace of Adolf Hitler. \nThe sad legacy of this town is not marked with any great monument. \nInstead, above the home where Hitler was born, two simple words are \nwritten: Never again.\n  Those two words represent a solemn pledge that this country and all \ncivilized nations made at the close of World War II: Never again would \nwe stand idly by while innocent men, women, and children were \nmassacred. Never again would we allow a nation to invade its neighbors \nwithout consequences.\n  Some of my colleagues here in the Senate are consistently remind us \nthat Kosovo is not the Holocaust. I agree. What has occurred in the \nlast few months, does not yet compare to the crimes the Nazi's \nperpetrated. But this is a senseless justification for inaction. Should \nwe wait for another Holocaust to occur before we act decisively? What, \nthen, is the point of action? How many children must be traumatized? \nHow many homes need to be destroyed? How many women need to be victims \nof brutality before we can act? I say the words ``never again'' mean \nthat we should not wait and we will be decisive in our action. That is \nwhy I support using whatever means is necessary to accomplish the goal \nset out by NATO. The President and our NATO allies believe we can \nachieve this purpose through air attacks. I certainly hope this is \ncorrect. But I also agree with many of my colleagues, led by Senators \nMcCain and Biden, that we cannot rule out other measures that can \nassure our victory and success. I am proud to join them in cosponsoring \nan important resolution that they introduced earlier this week, which \nseeks to give the President the authority and tools necessary to win \nthis war. I urge my colleagues to consider joining with us to send this \npowerful and much-needed message of resolve during the conflict.\n  The only way that we can have peace in the Balkans is for people like \nMilosevic and the thugs underneath him to understand that there are \nreal and personal consequences for their barbaric atrocities.\n  The reports are very disturbing and it is very hard for me to repeat \nthem. I predict, unfortunately, that more and more horror stories will \nbe appear in our papers, as more survivors escape to tell their \nstories. As NATO spokesman, Jamie Shea, explained, the Serbs are \nengaging in a sort of ``human safari\" where they methodically flush out \ntheir victims from their homes using tear gas and herd them like \nanimals out of Kosovo. There have been repeated reports of the \nsystematic rape of girls and women. Very conservative NATO estimates \nindicate that over 100,000 people have simply disappeared, many of them \nmen who have been separated from their families--probably many to their \nearly deaths. When we pledged ``never again,'' these were the sorts of \natrocities that we were talking about.\n  As a result of these reports that, I intend to introduce a resolution \nin the Senate calling on the President to ask for war crimes \nindictments against the Serbian leadership before the International \nCriminal Tribunal for the former republic of Yugoslavia. The chief \nprosecutor has already announced that the jurisdiction of the tribunal \nextends to Kosovo.\n  We must ask ourselves what kind of situation will we have \nif Milosevic and his allies go unpunished. Will we have another rogue \nnation, this time in the heart of Europe, with little else motivating \nthem besides age-old desires for revenge and an interest in interfering \nwith the stability and prosperity of the United States and the entire \nEuropean continent? We simply cannot allow another Iraq in the middle \nof Europe. One of the central tenets of our policy must be that these \nindividuals will be brought to justice. Only then will these hundreds \nof thousands of refugees have any chance of returning to their homes. \nOnly then will we have peace and democracy in the Former Republic of \nYugoslavia, and only then will we have at least begun to live up to our \nsolemn promise of ``never again.'' I wish the best of success for the \ngathering here in Washington of our NATO allies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/22/senate-section/article/S4141-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4141-S4142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TAKE YOUR DAUGHTER TO WORK DAY\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, I would like to address for a moment as \nwell some reflections on the visit I made this past weekend as part of \nthis delegation. It was a delegation that flew from Washington Andrews \nAir Force base to Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany where we met with \nGeneral Wesley Clark, the Supreme Allied Commander of the NATO forces \nfor our mission in Kosovo and Serbia. We then went to a war room at \nthat base and met, as I mentioned earlier, with some of the most \namazing young men and women that America could ever hope to bring to \nthis cause. They are so filled with energy and commitment and \nenthusiasm that it really makes you proud to be an American, to be in \ntheir midst. You see the amazing technology at their disposal and \nrealize without their dedication and their talent it would mean little \nor nothing.\n  We flew the next morning from that Air Force base directly, on a \ncargo plane, to Albania, one of the poorest countries in Europe, where, \non a lengthy landing strip, we saw one of the most massive humanitarian \nefforts undertaken since World War II in Europe. Countries literally \nfrom all over the world are rallying for the Kosovo refugees. Among \nthem you could see evidence of humanitarian assistance from the French, \nthe Swedes, of course the Americans; helicopters from the United Arab \nEmirates--so many different countries coming together in this \nhumanitarian undertaking. The men and women who have to endure the most \nprimitive conditions living there to protect this humanitarian airlift, \nagain, deserve our praise, because there they sit literally on a muddy \ndelta in their tents doing their duty. I was proud to represent this \nNation and represent the State of Illinois in thanking them so much for \ntheir sacrifice.\n  We flew from Albania, after meeting with the Prime Minister, to \nMacedonia, part of the trip which I may never forget as long as I live, \nbecause we visited a refugee camp at a place outside of Skopje, \nMacedonia, the camp known as Brazda, or Stakovac. Two weeks ago, this \ncamp did not exist. Today, it has 32,000 people in it. In the 48 hours \nbefore we arrived, over 7,000 refugees came across the border out of \nKosovo, looking for safety.\n  I walked into that camp which had been built by NATO and was being \nmanaged by the Catholic Relief Services and was literally mobbed when I \noffered a piece of candy to a young child. They saw an American with a \nbag full of candy and they wanted to come up and meet me right away. I \npassed out a lot of these Hershey Kisses to the kids, and their parents \nstood around. With a translator, I asked them: Why are you here? Open-\nended question, no propaganda: Why did you leave Kosovo?\n  The story was the same over and over again. Simple people leading \nordinary lives in the villages of Kosovo would hear a knock on the door \nin the middle of the night, only to be greeted by people in black ski \nmasks, some of whom they knew right away to be their neighbors, who \nannounced they had 5 minutes to pick up anything they wanted to pick up \nwith them and leave the country because their house was about to be \nburned down or blown up. In many cases, the head of the family, if he \nwere a young adult male, was taken away from them. The rest were pushed \nout in the road and they started their walk, their walk to safety, \ntheir walk out of Kosovo.\n  You know, when you see pictures of refugee camps around the world, \nyou see some very sad scenes. Many times the people are very poor, \nstarving, very sick, some dying on the spot. That was not the case at \nthese refugee camps. These people, as I said, were ordinary people \nleading their lives, who were disrupted because of Slobodan Milosevic's \nethnic cleansing. What was their crime? They committed no crime other \nthan to have, as far as Mr. Milosevic was concerned, the wrong ethnic \nbackground, the wrong culture, the wrong religion. You see, he is \ncleansing his country, as he says, of these undesirables.\n\n  I am not sure what the word genocide means to most people, but when I \nsaw these people, the tens of thousands, shunned, rejected, persecuted \nand pushed out of their homes, now trying to make a simple life in a \nrefugee camp, I understood genocide and ``geno-suffering.''\n  Some people ask a question: Why is the United States involved in \nthis? Why do we care? What does this have to do with America? Come on, \nthese are people in Serbia and they always fight, don't they?\n  I think there is more to the story because what is at stake here is \nEurope, and Europe has always had a special meaning to the United \nStates. In this century, we fought two World Wars, we have given the \nbest of our country in defense of causes that we felt were right \nagainst Nazism, against communism, to make certain that Europe was \npeaceful, had stability, was there, and they were friends of the United \nStates. It means something to the people of Europe.\n  This morning, as part of the NATO summit, the Polish Prime Minister \ncame here on Capitol Hill. It was a wonderful celebratory gathering, \nfor breakfast: Poland, so proud and happy to be part of NATO. Think of \nthat, that this country that went through such deprivation during World \nWar II under the heel of communism for so many decades had finally \npushed it aside through their own courage and determination and said \nonce and for all: We are not neutral in our future. We are part of the \nWest. We want to be part of NATO. That is where we belong.\n  I am proud of that, proud of that as an American that Hungary, the \nCzech Republic and Poland became part of NATO and are dedicated to the \nprinciple of democracy, something we are all about in the United \nStates. What a great celebration will happen in Washington, even under \nthe shadow of the war that goes on, as these NATO allies come together, \ndetermined to make a better future in Europe. That is one of the \nreasons we are there.\n  Second, NATO itself is being tested. The NATO alliance has come \nforward and said we will not allow a dictator in Europe who pursues \nthese policies of genocide, who has initiated four wars in 10 years, \nwho tomorrow will start another war and pick some more innocent \nvictims--we cannot have a stable Europe with this in place. Slobodan \nMilosevic must be stopped. Mr. President, 18 allied nations turned to \nthe United States and said: Are you with us? Will you be with us in \nthis mission?\n\n[[Page S4143]]\n\n I am glad President Clinton said yes. I voted for the airstrikes. I \nthink it was the appropriate response for NATO against Milosevic.\n  The third issue is one of values, values as to whether or not we \nstand for anything as Americans. God knows we have throughout our \nhistory. We do not get engaged in wars to pick up territory or to come \nback with loot and booty. We get engaged in wars for values. That is \nwhat it was all about in World War II; to make sure that Hitler and his \ngenocide would come to an end once and for all, to make certain in the \ncold war that we stopped the spread of communism in Europe. Now, today, \nin this mission in Kosovo, we say we are standing again for values that \nare important, not only in the United States, but in Europe and around \nthe world.\n\n  There are some who question this, and I understand it. I am not one \nwho runs quickly to get involved in any military undertaking. I only \nwish those who have doubts about this would have been with me last \nSaturday afternoon, walking through this camp in Brazda, in Macedonia, \nor, frankly, in many other camps, where the 350,000 Kosovo refugees now \nin Albania are living in tents and under sheets of plastic--over \n120,000 in Macedonia, over 30,000 in Montenegro. Honestly, these are \nthe lucky refugees. They got out alive. They are under the protection \nof NATO.\n  The unluckiest are still left behind, those who are still hiding out \nas refugees in Kosovo, in the woods, hoping they can survive another \nday until this war comes to an end and it is safe to go home. Those who \nwere brought in, conscripted as slave labor in the Serbian Army, those \nare the ones who were unlucky. Those are the ones we have to always \nremember are part of our mission.\n  Earlier this morning, we were visited by the Prime Minister of Great \nBritain, Tony Blair. I had never met him before. He is an impressive \nindividual. I can understand why the people of that nation have decided \nto choose him as a leader. He said some things that were flattering, \nbut I think well worth sharing as I speak to you today. He said the \nUnited States has a special place in this world. It is an example to \nthe rest of the world so many times. He said, ``I can't tell you how \nmany times we say thank God for America and its leadership.'' I am \nproud of that. And I am proud of the men and women who have made it \npossible,\n  Those pilots who put their lives on the line every night in the \nbombers, soon in the helicopters, to try to bring this war to a \nconclusion and peace to Yugoslavia.\n  I am proud, too, of the families back home who wait, hoping that they \nwill return safely. I am proud of the families of the three POWs who \nhave been captured there. I want to let them know we will never forget \nthose prisoners. They are in our thoughts and our prayers every moment \nuntil they come home safely, as they will.\n  I think we have to stay this course. We have three difficult choices \nat this moment. We can leave, and if we leave, what have we left \nbehind? This penny-ante dictator with his genocide and ethnic cleansing \nwho will pick another helpless target?\n  Some say we should have a ground war. I am not for that. I do not \nthink that will work. Or we can pursue this air campaign, a campaign \nwhich has gone on about 26 days, about which 13 or 14 days we have had \ngood weather. If we pick up the intensity of this bombing, Mr. \nMilosevic will understand there is a price to pay for his horrible \npolicy of ethnic cleansing.\n  If this ends as we want it to, we will close the 20th century with \npeace in Europe. We will be able to say to Europeans wherever they live \nthat the United States, your partner, stood by your side during one of \nthe bloodiest centuries in the history of Europe. When it was all over, \nthe values we cherish, the values we fought for, prevailed. That is \nwhat is at stake here, and that is what I hope most Americans will \nrecall.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/22/senate-section/article/S4143-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4143-S4144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EARTH DAY\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today across our country, Americans are \ncommemorating Earth Day, a day vitally important to all who serve in \nthis Chamber as well.\n  As my colleagues know, Earth Day was first observed on April 22, \n1970. Its purpose was, and it remains, to make people across the \ncountry and around the world reflect on the splendor of our planet, an \nopportunity to get the people to think about the Earth's many gifts we \noften take for granted.\n  Earth Day is a day for us to renew our commitment to protect our \nenvironment and recognize the respect we must give our natural \nresources, recycling and replenishing whenever possible.\n  The New York Times, on the original Earth Day, ran a story which in \npart read:\n\n       Conservatives were for it. Liberals were for it. Democrats, \n     Republicans and Independents were for it. So were the ins, \n     the outs, the executive and the legislative branches of \n     Government.\n\n  Mr. President, the goals of Earth Day 1970 were goals upon which all \nof us agree. They are goals still shared across the country, regardless \nof age, gender, race, economic status, or religious background, and \nthey are shared by this Senator as well.\n  I consider myself a conservationist and an environmentalist, and I \nthink everyone who serves in the Senate also does. No one among us is \nwilling to accept the proposition that our children or grandchildren \nwill ever have to endure dirty water or filthy skies. Our children \ndeserve to live in a world that affords them the same environmental \nopportunities that their parents enjoy today.\n  When speaking about the Earth and our environment, however, it is \nbecoming increasingly difficult to highlight the consensus that exists \nin Congress on protecting the environment, because the environmental \ndebate is now so focused on the margins.\n  The proliferation of special interest groups has forced our debate \naway from our common concerns and left the American people with the \nidea that an individual is either for the environment or against it, \nand that determination is made not by the voters or by one's record, \nbut by the scorecard or the rhetoric of a particular organization.\n  I would like to take a moment this Earth Day to remind my \nconstituents and the American people of the tremendous progress we have \nmade on a bipartisan basis towards protecting the Earth and its \ninhabitants and, at the same time, improving and conserving our \nprecious natural resources.\n  In the 104th Congress, we passed several major pieces of legislation \nto improve the environment. They include the Safe Drinking Water Act, \nthe conservation title to the farm bill, the Coastal Zone Management \nAct, the Invasive Species Act, the Everglades Protection Amendments, \nthe Food Quality Protection Act, the Water Resources Development Act, \nthe Battery Recycling Act, and the Parks and Public Lands Management \nAct, just to name a few.\n  Those public laws are now at work helping Americans protect the \nenvironment by including billions of dollars to improve the safety of \nour Nation's drinking water and billions more on conservation efforts \non more than 37 million acres of sensitive land.\n\n  Those programs will help improve our cities' waterfronts, control \ninvasive species in our lakes, and increase visitor enjoyment and \nnatural resource protection in our Nation's parks and in our visitors' \nenjoyment.\n  Unfortunately, if a Member's constituents did not take the time to \nreview the complete record of their Member of Congress, they would not \nknow the truth.\n  While the accomplishments of the 104th Congress are impressive, the \n105th Congress did not rest on its laurels over the past 2 years. The \nenvironmental accomplishments of the 105th Congress include the \nNational Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act, the North American \nWetlands Conservation Act, the Dolphin Conservation Act, the Great \nLakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act, the National Park System \nRestoration Act, the National Wildlife Refuge System Volunteers and \nCommunity Partnership Act, the Tropical Forest Conservation Act, the \nAfrican and Asian Elephant Conservation\n\n[[Page S4144]]\n\nActs, and a host of programs contained within the provisions of the \nappropriations legislation.\n  Again, these programs will provide even more money, billions of \ndollars across the spectrum of environmental protection. These programs \nwere passed only through bipartisan cooperation and were largely \nsupported by most Members of Congress.\n  In the 106th Congress, we are off to another good start. I have \nfocused my efforts on looking at legislation which improves our \nNation's energy efficiency and security and promotes the use of \nalternative renewable sources of energy.\n  I am a cosponsor of legislation to extend the wind energy tax credit \nand to provide a tax credit for the production of energy from poultry \nlitter.\n  I have also cosponsored legislation with Senators Coverdell, Breaux, \nand DeWine which would force Federal facilities to comply with the \nprovisions of the Clean Water Act, something they are currently able to \navoid by claiming sovereign immunity.\n  I will soon be joining Senators Murkowski and Hagel as an original \ncosponsor of the Energy and Climate Policy Act which, through tax \ncredits and public-private partnerships, will promote research and \ndevelopment of technologies which reduce or sequester greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  We have had tremendous accomplishments in Congress over the past 4 \nyears, and I make this point not to illustrate a difference between \nRepublican and Democratic Congresses, but to highlight our shared \ncommitments to protecting the environment, improving our wildlife \nhabitats, making our water supply safer, increasing visitor enjoyment \nin our Nation's parks, and also strengthening our dedication to leaving \na proud legacy of natural resource protection for our children and \ngrandchildren to enjoy.\n  Mr. President, I make these points because they are often not \nproperly presented to the American public, because many \nproenvironmental initiatives are passed by unanimous consent or by \nvoice vote. They often do not appear on our voting records. Instead, \nAmericans are left with the five or six votes over an entire year that \na special interest group portrays as the complete environmental record \nof Members of Congress.\n  Anyone who closely monitors Congress knows that these issues are not \nas simple as some make them out to be, and a Member's record is not \naccurately reflected by five or six selective votes, votes which are \nmany times procedural votes and not votes on final passage. That is why \nI have long believed we can do a better job of promoting our shared \ncommitment to both environmental protection and economic growth by \nhighlighting our many common beliefs, rather than taking a microscope \nto those beliefs upon which differences arise.\n\n  Clearly, partisanship will always be present in congressional \ndebates, but no American is well served when issues as important as \nenvironmental protection are dominated by the flagrant distortion of \nthe truth.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that on this Earth Day, we pledge to come \ntogether to improve our environment and strengthen our natural \nresources. I suggest that we recognize both our failures and also our \nsuccesses of the past. We must recognize that today compliance with \nregulations is the rule and that blatant attempts to pollute and \ncircumvent regulations are the exception. With this in mind, I believe \nwe must renew our Nation's commitment to pragmatism.\n  Government on all levels must do its part as watchdog while \nempowering those being regulated to develop unique and innovative means \nof compliance. At the same time, we must promote ideas that create \npublic-private partnerships and encourage companies and individuals to \ntake voluntary steps to protect our natural resources. Through \neducation and awareness, we will be able to approach environmental \nissues in a way that fosters compromise and in a way that ensures \npublic policy is pursued in the best interest of all.\n  It is time we commit ourselves to achieving real results through \nenvironmental initiatives. We must make sure that Superfund dollars go \nto clean up the Superfund sites, not go into the pockets of lawyers. We \nmust base our decisions on clear science with stated goals and flexible \nsolutions. We must give our job creators more flexibility in meeting \nnational standards as a means of eliminating the pervasive ``command \nand control'' approach that has infected so many of our Federal \nprograms.\n  And finally, the Federal Government needs to promote a better \npartnership between all levels of Government, with job providers, \nenvironmental interest groups, and with the taxpayers. Moving forward \ntogether in eliminating the inflammatory rhetoric which sometimes \nconsumes the entire environmental debate will not be easy, but if we \nare going to work together to ensure the splendor of our natural \nresources far into the future, I believe it is a step that we are going \nto have to take.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/22/senate-section/article/S4144-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4144-S4145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE 29TH ANNUAL EARTH DAY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today marks the 29th annual Earth Day --a \nday to evaluate our environment--a day to celebrate. Along with all \nAmericans, I too want to live in a clean environment, and like most \nAmericans, I fully believe efforts are needed to ``protect the \nenvironment.'' However, I question how ``protecting the environment'' \nis defined and bureaucratically implemented, especially when it begins \nto truly hurt Americans.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will look at each environmental \npolicy--new and old--carefully, to make sure the benefits are both real \nand achievable. Congress should make sure the costs are tolerable and \nproperly allocated, and Congress needs to ensure that the standards and \ntime tables make sense. Most importantly, the Congress needs to make \nsure that the science is legitimate.\n  There are some who advance an agenda under the guise of environmental \nconcern. This is not only wrong, but harmful. There are some who do not \nprovide accurate costs and who inflate benefits. This too is wrong. \nThere are some who have no concern about those who will really be \naffected by the new policy. This is also very wrong--Congress should \nnever lose sight of the constituents.\n  Mr. President, the Senate needs to continue to ``protect the \nenvironment'' while ``protecting the people'' who live in that \nenvironment. The Senate must examine the costs inflicted upon our \nsociety, as it relates to the environmental protection, to make sure it \nis acceptable.\n  This Earth Day anniversary is a good anniversary. There are many \nthings of which to be proud, and many people and organizations which \nshould be proud. Many can rightly take credit. Yes, the federal \ngovernment stepped in. However, over the past three decades I've seen \nstates and local governments also step up to the plate and act \nresponsibly. After 30 years states should be given more responsibility, \nbecause of their effectiveness in environmental matters.\n  Mr. President, this Earth Day anniversary is a good anniversary, \nbecause the corporate world has invested billions and billions of \ndollars more than thirty years to clean the environment--the air, the \nsoil, and the water. Everyone has benefited. The initial federal rules \nworked, but over the past 30 years industry has learned how to take \nenvironmental action in a more effective way. The federal government, \nnot known for its efficiency, should do a better job of asking for \nthese environmental solutions, because the same results at lower costs \nare good for America. Industry wants to be a partner in this effort.\n  Mr. President, today the new environmental enemy is urban sprawl. \nThis is unfortunate because Congress does not need to find a new evil \nenemy to pursue to make environmental policy work. Suburbs, backyards, \nand shopping centers are not our enemy. Mr. President, the family \nliving in the suburbs is not the enemy. I hope my colleagues will take \na more balanced approach, and look for ways to legislate that avoid the \nadversarial approach. For thirty years industry was blamed for our \nenvironmental problems, now it's the family living in the suburbs. This \nis counter productive. This is a terribly destructive way to ``protect \nthe environment.''\n  Mr. President, nearly 30 years of Earth Days has heightened \neveryone's awareness--yours and mine. I truly believe everyone is now a \nbetter steward\n\n[[Page S4145]]\n\nof our planet. Lets unleash America's entrepreneurial spirit and search \nfor new approaches and new incentives to protect America's air, soil, \nand water.

GRIFFITH\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 82, submitted earlier \ntoday by Senator Thurmond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 82) expressing the gratitude of the \n     United States Senate for the service of Thomas B. Griffith, \n     Legal Counsel for the United States Senate.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Mr. Thomas B. \nGriffith, who, on April 18, 1999, resigned from the position of Senate \nLegal Counsel to return to the private practice of law. Mr. Griffith \nserved in that office for the past four years.\n  Mr. President, as President pro tempore of the Senate, it was my \npleasure to oversee the work of the Office of Legal Counsel during Mr. \nGriffith's tenure. I appreciated the great dedication and \nprofessionalism he displayed in his capacity as Legal Counsel.\n  The Office of Senate Legal Counsel plays an important role for the \nUnited States Senate. It is responsible for providing legal defense to \nthe Senate, its committees, Members, officers, and employees when \nauthorized to do so. The Legal Counsel represents Senate committees in \nproceedings to obtain evidence for Senate investigations. As directed, \nit intervenes or appears as amicus curiae in the name of the Senate and \nSenate committees. It also represents the interests of the Senate as \nintervenor or amicus curiae in various other court cases. On an ongoing \nbasis, the Senate Legal Counsel Office provides legal advice to \nMembers, committees, and officers of the Senate.\n  Among the highlights of Mr. Griffith's career in the Senate would \nundoubtably be the impeachment trial of the President of the United \nStates. During those proceedings, Mr. Griffith provided the Senate with \nprofessional and nonpartisan advice on a range of issues related to the \nimpeachment process.\n  Other significant actions in which Mr. Griffith participated or \ndirected as Senate Legal Counsel include the consideration of the \nLouisiana Contested Election Petition by the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration; the investigation of Campaign Finance Practices by the \nSenate Committee on Governmental Affairs; the Judiciary Committee's \nreview of the White House use of FBI files; and the work of the Special \nCommittee To Investigate Whitewater Development Corporation.\n  In addition, Mr. Griffith represented the interest of the Senate, its \nMembers, employees and Officers, in a number of cases filed in the \ncourts. At the top of this list would be his work on the Line Item Veto \ncases.\n  In all of these activities, Mr. Griffith has seen to it that we are \nall served well by a professional, career, and nonpartisan staff.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor this resolution and I am proud \nto have known and worked with Thomas Griffith. He has served his Nation \nwell. I wish Thomas, his wife Susan, and their children the very best \nfor the future.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of the resolution, \nI rise today to add my remarks in support of, and in gratitude to, our \nformer Senate Legal Counsel, Mr. Tom Griffith.\n  It is always with mixed emotions that I speak on occasions such as \nthis; while I am glad for Tom and wish him well in his return to \nprivate practice, I know that the Senate will miss the wise counsel and \ndedication he demonstrated during his nearly 4 years of service to this \nbody.\n  The ancient Chinese had a curse in which they wished their victim a \nlife ``in interesting times''. For better or for worse, Tom lived such \na life as Senate Legal Counsel. From my place on the Rules Committee--\nfirst as a member and now as Ranking Member--I had a unique perspective \non the Legal Counsel's efforts to deal with numerous ``interesting'' \nissues presenting novel, rare and in some cases historic issues, \nincluding implementation of the Congressional Accountability Act, \nresolution of the Louisiana election challenge, and, of course, the \nrecent impeachment trial. Speaking for myself--and, I suspect, most of \nmy colleagues--I must say that Tom handled those difficult \nresponsibilities with great confidence and skill.\n  A more contemporary observer--and one of Connecticut's most famous \nresidents--Mark Twain, once suggested: ``Always do right--this will \ngratify some and astonish the rest.'' During his tenure as Legal \nCounsel, Tom exemplified this philosophy, impressing all who knew him \nwith his knowledge of the law and never succumbing to the temptation to \nbend the law to partisan ends. All of us who serve here in the Senate \nknow the importance of the rule of law; but let us never forget that it \nis individuals like Mr. Thomas Griffith whose calling it is to put that \nideal into practice.\n  Once again, I wish to express my gratitude to Tom for his years of \nservice, and I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting this \nresolution.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 82) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 82\n\n       Whereas Thomas B. Griffith, the Legal Counsel of the United \n     States Senate, became an employee of the Senate on March 18, \n     1995, and since that date has ably and faithfully upheld the \n     high standards and traditions of the Office of Legal Counsel \n     of the United States Senate;\n       Whereas Thomas B. Griffith, from October 24, 1995, to April \n     18, 1999, served as the Legal Counsel of the United States \n     Senate and demonstrated great dedication, professionalism, \n     and integrity in faithfully discharging the duties and \n     responsibilities of his position, including providing legal \n     defense of the Senate, its committees, Members, officers, and \n     employees; representing committees in proceedings to obtain \n     evidence for Senate investigations; representing the \n     interests of the Senate as intervenor or amicus curiae in \n     various court cases; and otherwise providing legal advice to \n     Members, committees, and officers of the Senate;\n       Whereas Thomas B. Griffith, only the second person to hold \n     the position of Senate Legal Counsel since it was created in \n     1979, has met the needs of the United States Senate for legal \n     counsel with unfailing professionalism, skill, dedication, \n     and good humor during his entire tenure; and\n       Whereas Thomas B. Griffith has tendered his resignation as \n     Senate Legal Counsel, effective as of April 18, 1999, to \n     return to the private practice of law; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Senate commends Thomas B. \n     Griffith for his more than 4 years of faithful and exemplary \n     service to the United States Senate and the Nation, including \n     3\\1/2\\ years as Senate Legal Counsel, and expresses its deep \n     appreciation and gratitude for his faithful and outstanding \n     service.\n       Sec. 2.
