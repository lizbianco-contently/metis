Mr. President, I want you to listen. I am going to tell \nyou a story of espionage, conspiracy, deception, and coverup, a story \nwith life and death implications for millions of Americans, a story \nabout national security, and a President and an administration that \ndeliberately chose to put national security at risk, while telling \neveryone that everything was fine.\n  If it was written in a book, Mr. President, it wouldn't sell, because \nno one would believe it. If it was fictionalized in a novel, few could \nconceive it. But it is true.\n  For the sake of my statement today, I am stating that the President \nwithheld information and covered up the Chinese theft of our \ntechnology. But I am realistic enough to know that a person with the \nhistory of deception this President has will have provided himself with \nsome cover in case he got caught. So I am sure there is a paper trail \nthat he can allege. The way the President probably covered himself was \nto include tidbits about this theft buried in briefings of 40 or 50 \nother items so the significance of it would not be noticed. But a paper \ntrail would be established.\n  Anticipating that, I, over the weekend, talked to the chairman of the \nHouse Intelligence Committee, Congressman Porter Goss, and the chairman \nof the Senate Intelligence Committee at the time of the discovery of \nthis secret, this information, Senator Arlen Specter. Neither chairman \nwas notified of the W-88 nuclear warhead technology theft. And these \nwould have been the first to be notified, Mr. President.\n  There can be no doubt that President Clinton engaged in a coverup \nscheme.\n  Let me read three paragraphs from last week's op-ed article by \nMichael Kelly in the Washington Post, entitled ``Lies About China.'' I \nam quoting now, Mr. President:\n\n       In April 1996, Energy Department officials informed Samuel \n     Berger, then Clinton's deputy national security advisor, that \n     Notra Trulock, the department's chief of intelligence, had \n     uncovered evidence that showed China had learned how to \n     miniaturize nuclear bombs, allowing for smaller, more lethal \n     warheads . . . \n\n  Further quoting:\n\n       The Times reports that the House Intelligence Committee \n     asked Trulock for a briefing in July 1998. Trulock asked for \n     permission from Elizabeth Moler, then acting energy \n     secretary. According to Trulock, Moler\n\n[[Page S2614]]\n\n     told him not to brief the committee because the information \n     might be used against Clinton's China policy. . .\n\n  Further quoting:\n\n       The White House's secret would have remained secret had it \n     not been for a select investigative committee headed by \n     Republican [Representative] Christopher Cox. . .\n\n  But even using the President's fictitious paper trail, the earliest \neither chairman could have known about it would have been late in the \nspring of 1997, years after the Clinton administration learned of it \nand, of course, after the 1996 election.\n  I start, Mr. President, by listing a few things which we now know to \nbe true, factual, incontrovertible, and nonclassified.\n  For years, the Clinton administration covered up China's interest of \ntop secret U.S. nuclear weapons data. They never informed the Congress \nor the American people about what had happened or its significance to \nour national security.\n  Let me tell you what President Clinton did during this period of \ntime.\n  During this period of time, the President misled the American people \non numerous occasions about the threat posed by strategic nuclear \nmissiles in the post-cold-war era.\n  During this period of time, President Clinton made statements on over \n130 separate occasions, such as the following:--and I am quoting--\n\n       For the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age, there \n     is not a single solitary nuclear missile pointed at an \n     American child tonight. Not one. Not a single one.\n\n  During this period of time, he knew that China was targeting up to 18 \nintercontinental ballistic missiles at American children.\n  During this period of time, President Clinton signed export control \nwaivers which allowed his top campaign fundraisers' aerospace company \nto transfer sensitive U.S. missile guidance technology to China.\n  During this period of time, he shifted the prime satellite export \nresponsibility from the State Department, where it had always been to \nmaintain security, to the Commerce Department so that it would be \neasier to share sensitive information with the Chinese and others.\n  During this period of time, President Clinton hosted over 100 White \nHouse fundraisers as a part of a larger aggressive scheme to raise \ncampaign contributions, many from illegal foreign sources primarily, \nincluding sources in China. Among guests permitted to attend these \nWhite House fundraisers were a convicted felon and a Chinese arms \ndealer.\n  During this period of time, John Huang, Charlie Trie, Johnny Chung, \nJames Riady, and others with strong ties to China, were deeply \ninvolved, with the President's knowledge, in raising Chinese-tainted \ncampaign cash for the Clinton campaign.\n  During this period of time, John Huang, who had been given a security \nclearance without a background check, was permitted to receive numerous \nclassified CIA briefings, both during and after his stay at the \nCommerce Department.\n  And during this period of time, President Clinton was successfully \nstopping the deployment of a national missile defense system--exposing \nevery American life to a missile attack, leaving us with no defense \nwhatsoever against an intercontinental ballistic missile.\n  Mr. President, China's theft of secret data on the so-called W-88 \nnuclear warhead may be one of the most serious breaches of national \nsecurity in the history of our Nation, more serious than Aldrich Ames; \nperhaps more serious than the Rosenbergs.\n  The public needs to understand that this story is true. This is not \nabout partisanship. It is not about some ancient history of some long \ngone cold war.\n  This is about the real world here and now. It is about national \nsecurity in its most important aspects. It is about protecting our \nfreedom and our existence as a Nation. This is ultimately a matter \nwhich concerns the life and death of every American citizen.\n\n  The W-88 is the most advanced nuclear warhead in the U.S. arsenal and \nis carried on top of a Trident submarine-launched ballistic missile. \nThis is the cornerstone weapon of our Nation's nuclear deterrent. As \nmany as 8 can fit on top of a submarine-launched missile; as many as 10 \ncan fit on top of a land-based missile--either ours or China's. We are \ntalking about a miniaturized warhead much smaller in size than the \nHiroshima atomic bomb but 10 times more powerful.\n  This chart appeared in the New York Times on March 6 of this year. \nThe first atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima weighed almost 9,000 pounds, \nyielded 15 kilotons and was dropped from a plane. By contrast, the \nmodern W-88 is more powerful than this. It is 2.6 feet in length and \nweighs about 300 pounds and yields up to 150 kilotons. Several fit into \nthe head of one missile. The technology on which it is built is super \ntop secret and represents billions of dollars and years, if not \ndecades, of investment on the part of dedicated scientists and \nengineers working in the supreme American national interest.\n  Some ask, why does America have such a weapon? Because it is part of \nour responsibility as a world superpower to have the most advanced, \nefficient, and credible nuclear deterrent, not only to protect our own \nfreedom but the freedom of our allies. It is part of our policy of \npeace through strength.\n  I think about my friend from Texas, the Senator who is always talking \nabout how we want to see the day when the lion and the lamb lie down \ntogether. But when that happens, we want to make sure we are the lion \nand not the lamb. We don't intend to use any of these nuclear weapons. \nIt is a fact of life, in the most dangerous world we live in, we have \nto be prepared to deter any potential adversary.\n  The W-88 allows for multiple warheads to be placed on one missile. \nWith this technology, China will now be able to put up to 10 warheads \non a single long-range missile. Each warhead is targeted at a different \ncity, each city subject to an explosion 10 times as great as that which \ndestroyed Hiroshima at the end of World War II.\n  Mr. President, I am from Oklahoma. I can remember in 1995 when the \nbomb went off. It was a truck bomb. A 4,800-pound truck bomb destroyed \nthe Murrah Office Building, maiming and killing 168 Oklahomans. I \nremember standing out there and watching the police and the firemen \nenter the building where there was no security and pulling out parts of \nbodies and bodies. It was the most devastating thing I have ever \nexperienced. It was the worst act of terrorism ever recorded on \nAmerican soil. That bomb had a force of 1,000 pounds of TNT, half of 1 \nton. By contrast, the Hiroshima bomb had an explosive force of 15 tons, \nor 30,000 times as large as the Oklahoma City bomb. The W-88, while \nsmaller in physical size, had a force of 150 kilotons, or 300,000 times \nthe explosion power of the Oklahoma City bomb. By carrying 10 of these, \nit would be 3 million times the force of the Oklahoma City bomb.\n  The more compact W-88 warhead makes possible what is called MIRV \ntechnology, or multiple independent reentry vehicle, which allows the \nmissile to reenter and then go to various targets. This is technology \nthat we thought China was many, many years away from developing on its \nown, and they stole this technology, and President Clinton covered it \nup.\n  We also used to think North Korea was many years away from building a \nlong-range multiple stage rocket. I got a phone call and a letter from \nHenry Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on August 24. In \nthis letter he said he was confident we would have 3 years warning of \nany new long-range missile threat--that is, any new country that we \nalready didn't know about. Seven days later, on August 31, a multiple-\nstage rocket was launched in North Korea. Part of it reached the coast \nof Alaska.\n  Because of the disparity over what our nuclear threat is, in the \nwisdom of the House and the Senate, the Democrats and the Republicans \ncommissioned the Rumsfeld Committee. We were charged with the \nresponsibility of finding the nine most informed scientists and \nauthorities on missile technology, who formed a committee for assessing \nthe threat that we have in this country. This was a bipartisan \ncommittee, appointed jointly by Democrats and Republicans. Of the nine, \nfive were Republican appointments and four were Democrat appointments. \nThey concluded unanimously that when it comes to advanced missiles and \nweapons, with countries willing to buy, sell, and steal technology, \n``We live in\n\n[[Page S2615]]\n\nan environment of little or no warning.'' That means we must \nimmediately be prepared.\n  Last year, you may remember it was revealed that the Clinton \nadministration had changed the approval process for high-technology \nsatellite transfers, how waivers were granted for American companies so \nthey could launch satellites in China. This ultimately resulted in \nChina acquiring advanced United States missile guidance technology, \nmaking their missiles more accurate and more reliable. President \nClinton personally signed the waiver allowing China to acquire this \nmissile technology. Let me repeat, President Clinton personally signed \nthe waiver allowing China to achieve this missile technology.\n\n  Executives of these two corporations which benefited, Loral and \nHughes, were among the largest financial creditors to President \nClinton's campaign ever but this is not important. The motive for \naiding and abetting our adversaries could be money, or it could be some \nkind of perverted allegiance to some of these countries, or it could be \njust a callous disregard for the lives of American citizens. The motive \nis not important. The fact is, President Clinton did it and he knew \nexactly what he was doing.\n  Accompanying the transferred missile guidance technology with the \nstolen nuclear weapon technology, China can threaten United States \ncities with accurate, reliable, and horribly destructive multiple-\nwarhead nuclear missiles. This is not science fiction. Two years ago, a \nhigh-ranking Chinese official made a statement. Two years ago, when the \nChinese were trying to intimidate the elections of the Taiwanese and \nthey were launching missiles at the Taiwan Straits, it was suggested to \nthis high-ranking military official in China that it could be that \nAmerica would come to Taiwan's defense and would intervene. His \nresponse was, ``No, they are not going to do that because America would \nrather defend Los Angeles than defend Taipei.'' At the very least, that \nis an indirect threat to use missiles on the United States of America.\n  By helping China develop their long-range missiles, President Clinton \nalso helped North Korea and other rogue nations with theirs--nations \nlike Iran. Let me read three paragraphs from last week's Washington \nTimes article entitled ``China Assists North Korea Space Launches.''\n\n       China is sharing space technology with North Korea, a move \n     that could boost P'yongyang's long-range missile program, \n     White House and Pentagon officials told the Washington Times. \n     . . .\n       Another Pentagon report on the 1996 Chinese booster that \n     failed to launch a U.S. satellite concluded that ``U.S. \n     national security was harmed'' by the improper sharing of \n     technology with China by Hughes and other satellite maker \n     Loral Space & Communications Ltd. . . .\n\n  Keep in mind, it was President Clinton who signed the waiver to give \nthe Chinese this technology.\n\n       In 1994, the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency \n     reported that it believed China had helped design the Taepo \n     Dong 2 missile (this is the North Korea missile) because its \n     first stage diameter is very close in size to the Chinese \n     CSS-2 immediate range missile.\n\n  It is factual to say that President Clinton knew he was giving our \nmissile technology to North Korea as well as China.\n  I take this moment to remind my colleagues once again that America \ntoday has no defense whatever against such a threat. The Clinton \nadministration today, despite its rhetoric, opposes the deployment of \nany national missile defense system. Someone who is pretty smart, back \nin 1983 when they determined that we would have to have a defense \nagainst an incoming missile by fiscal year 1998--that is, last year--so \nduring the Reagan administration, then the Bush Administration, they \nembarked on this thing called SDI, Strategic Defense Initiative, to \nmake sure that by 1998 we would have something to defend ourselves in \nthe event an ICBM came over from China, from Russia, from Iran, from \nNorth Korea, from anywhere. So we were on schedule to have this \ndeployed by fiscal year 1998.\n  Well, in 1993, that came to a screeching halt when President Clinton \nvetoed the defense authorization bill and vetoed all further efforts, \nincluding the bills that were introduced to put us on line with the \nnational missile defense system. As an excuse for this, he said he had \nto protect the integrity of the 1972 ABM Treaty. Let me remind you that \ntreaty was not a Democrat-inspired treaty. That was Republican-\ninspired; it was President Nixon and Henry Kissinger. The idea was that \nwe had two superpowers, the U.S.S.R. and the United States of America. \nSo we made a deal with them. Under the ABM Treaty, we said we won't \ndefend ourselves, and you don't defend yourselves, and that way, if \nthey launch a missile that goes to us, we launch one that goes back to \nthem and everybody dies. I didn't like that theory back then, but it \nmade sense when there were two superpowers. That is not true today.\n  Today, virtually every country has a weapon of mass destruction. We \nhave missiles that we are finding that now even North Korea has. China \nis exchanging technology and systems with Iran and other countries like \nthat. So there is a proliferation of missiles as well as weapons of \nmass destruction. I have to say that the mutual assured destruction \nconcept which was adopted at that time has no relevance today. Even \nHenry Kissinger, who was the architect of the ABM Treaty of 1972 said, \n``It's nuts to make a virtue out of our vulnerability.'' He said we \nshould not be looking at that. Besides, somebody should remind the \nPresident that was a treaty that was made in 1972, and it was made \nbetween the United States and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union no \nlonger exists. So I have to say that President Clinton is solely \nresponsible for the fact that we are totally defenseless against an \nincoming ICBM from China or any other place in the world.\n  Now, Mr. President, from news reports, this is some of what we know \nabout China's theft of our nuclear secrets. Apparently, a spy at the \nLos Alamos weapons lab succeeded in transferring data on this highly \nclassified W-88 warhead technology to China in the mid-1980s. That was \nnot during the current administration; nobody refutes that. But our \nGovernment did not find out about it until April of 1995. That is 3 \nyears into the Clinton administration.\n  This is a critical date, Mr. President. We did not know about the \ntheft until April of 1995. Detection came when experts analyzed data \nfrom then-recent Chinese underground nuclear tests and saw remarkable \nsimilarities to the W-88 U.S. warhead to what they were experimenting \nwith. Later in 1995, secret Chinese Government documents confirmed that \nthere had been a security breach at Los Alamos. That was in 1995.\n  Deputy National Security Advisor Sandy Berger was first briefed about \nit. President Clinton did not respond then because he was obviously a \nlittle preoccupied with what he considered to be more important matters \nat that time. After all, there were White House fundraisers to host, \nforeign campaign contributions, satellite transfers to approve, high \ntechnology trade with China to promote and, of course, an election to \nbe won--at all costs. Mr. Berger was well aware of all this. We know \nthat he sat in on strategy sessions for the campaign for 1996.\n  So this was also the time when President Clinton was running around \nthe country telling audiences that ``for the first time since the dawn \nof the nuclear age, there is not a single, solitary nuclear missile \npointed at an American child tonight. Not one. Not a single one.'' Of \ncourse everybody cheered, wanting to believe he was telling the truth.\n  Of all the lies this President has told, this is the most egregious \nof all.\n  He repeated this misleading, deceptive lie over 130 times between \n1995 and 1997, right at the very time he and his national security \nadvisors knew that this horrible breach of nuclear security had \noccurred and was under investigation. It was also at that very time \nthat he knew that up to 18 American cities were being targeted by \nChinese long-range missiles, missiles that had and have the potential \nof killing millions of Americans. During this time, he said 130 times: \n``For the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age, there is not a \nsingle, solitary nuclear missile pointed at an American child tonight. \nNot one. Not a single one.''\n  So while the American people consume his misleading and dishonest \npublic statements--helping to secure his reelection --nothing was done \nfor over\n\n[[Page S2616]]\n\na year about the security breach at Los Alamos.\n  The likely suspect spy was identified in early 1997, and the FBI \nurged that he at least be transferred to a less sensitive position. But \ninexplicably, he was allowed to keep his sensitive job at Los Alamos \nfor a another year and a half. This was the spy who was responsible for \nthe theft, and President Clinton kept him in that sensitive job for \nanother year and a half. Finally, he was fired by Energy Secretary \nRichardson last Monday--a week ago today, March 8, 1999--but only after \nhe was publicly identified in news reports as having failed two \nprevious lie detector tests.\n  In all of this, was Congress ever informed? As a Member of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee, I \ncertainly was not. As I said earlier, I talked to the chairmen of both \nthe House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee \nand they weren't informed either.\n\n  Did the President ever take the appropriate aggressive and timely \nsteps that should have been taken in order to protect the national \nsecurity interest in the wake of this matter? No, he did not.\n  Why? Why the delays? Why the lack of consultation and communication? \nWhy the seeming indifference to this very, very serious breach of \nnational security? We will be asking some tough questions about this in \nthe days to come. I note that the Armed Services Committee will have a \nhearing on this, and the Intelligence Committee will have a hearing the \nday after tomorrow, Wednesday. We will have a lot of questions. The \nAmerican people need to know what is going on here.\n  The President's National Security Advisor, Mr. Berger, has a lot to \nanswer for here. He had better be prepared to answer questions from \nMembers of Congress honestly, forthrightly, and without intention to \ndeceive, mislead, or change the meaning of words. Otherwise, he should \nresign now and take the rap for President Clinton.\n  I am convinced that we have not yet scratched the surface of the \nnational security scandal exposed by these most recent revelations.\n  This administration obviously wanted nothing to interfere with \ndeveloping good relations with China. While it was soliciting and \naccepting campaign contributions from China, it was dragging its feet \non investigating the most egregious espionage operation China had ever \nsucceeded in pulling off in the U.S., a breach of security which could \npotentially put the lives of millions of Americans at great risk.\n  This is, without doubt, the worst example yet of how this \nadministration has put its own selfish motives above the national \nsecurity interests of this country and above the protection of American \nlives.\n  The American people and the Congress must demand that the President \nbe held accountable for this gross dereliction of duty. I guess the \nquestion is, What can we do? We are Members of Congress and what can we \ndo? I am not sure there is anything we can do except inform the \nAmerican people and let public outrage solve the problem. And why are \nwe in Congress so limited in what we can do?\n  Our Founding Fathers never envisioned we would have a President who \nwould do these kinds of things and act in these ways. This is why the \nConstitution gives the President great latitude of action in carrying \nout his duties and why he is protected from the other branches of \nGovernment under the separation of powers.\n  When John Adams wrote to his wife after the first night he spent in \nthe White House in 1799, he spoke of the expectations of all the \nfounders during that time: ``May only honest and wise men rule under \nthis roof.'' The White House.\n  There was an assumption that the American people would always elect \nPresidents with a basic level of morality, honesty and integrity, who \nout of patriotism would always put the welfare of the country above any \npersonal ambitions for power or glory.\n  This President knew he was covering up information vital to the \nsafety and well-being of every American--that China had stolen from us \nthe advanced technology which would give them the capability to kill \nmillions of Americans in multiple cities with just one missile, and he \nknew it.\n  In 1945, World War II was ended when the atomic bombs were dropped in \nNagasaki and Hiroshima. Each explosion destroyed an entire city, \nkilling tens of thousands. The death toll in Hiroshima was about 75,000 \nlives from that 15-ton nuclear bomb.\n  Just think, that with the technology that this President has \ntransferred to China and what China has stolen and the President has \ncovered up, China is now capable of producing a 150-kiloton bomb small \nenough to fit ten of them on top of one missile, each bomb targeted at \na different American city with accuracy and reliability.\n  Just extrapolating the numbers, that--in theory--is enough \ndestructive power to kill as many as 7,500,000 Americans--with just one \nmissile.\n  And, due to this President who stopped our national missile defense \neffort, we have no defense. We have a President who acts as if he \ndoesn't care about us.\n  So finally, Mr. President, let me repeat the six proven \nincontrovertible facts:\n  1. President Clinton hosted over 100 campaign fundraisers in the \nWhite House, many with Chinese connections.\n  2. President Clinton used John Huang, Charlie Trie, Johnny Chung, \nJames Riady, and others with strong Chinese ties to raise campaign \nmoney.\n  3. President Clinton signed waivers to allow his top campaign \nfundraiser's aerospace company to transfer United States missile \nguidance technology to China.\n  4. President Clinton covered up the theft of our most valuable \nnuclear weapons technology.\n  5. President Clinton lied to the American people over 130 times about \nour Nation's security while he knew Chinese missiles were aimed at \nAmerican children.\n  6. President Clinton single-handedly stopped the deployment of a \nnational missile defense system, exposing every American life to a \nmissile attack, leaving America with no defense whatsoever against an \nintercontinental ballistic missile.\n  Again, it doesn't matter whether President Clinton did these things \nfor Chinese campaign contributions because the motive for aiding and \nabetting our adversaries is not important. The fact is President \nClinton did it and he knew exactly what he was doing.\n  I'm not a lawyer, Mr. President, but I have to ask, could President \nClinton have been tried for impeachment for the wrong crime?\n  Why am I here telling the truth about the President?\n  I think it is because I haven't heard anyone else do it. They know \nthis President will lie with such conviction that the American people \nwill continue to believe him, and they don't want to take the risk.\n  I happened to go yesterday to the McLean Bible Church, and the sermon \nwas about taking risks--being willing to take a risk. They talked about \nthe Israelites who were in the desert, and they sent a team up to \nCanaan to look to see what the risk was up there. They came back, and \nthey said: There are giants up there. We don't have a chance. We are \nlike mosquitoes next to them, except for Caleb.'' Caleb came back, and \nhe said, ``We should take the risks. We can win. We can fight and \nwin.''\n  What happened? The rest of the story you know. You know what that is. \nGod left the Israelites out in the desert, and he sent Caleb to the \nPromised Land. With all these blessings, we just do not seem to learn. \nI think Henry Ward Beecher said it in a different way. He said, ``I \ndon't like those cold, precise, perfect people who, in order not to say \nwrong, say nothing . . . and in order not to do wrong, do nothing.''\n  We have a lot of people around here who are more concerned about \ntheir jobs that they would go ahead and do nothing. So somebody has to \ntell the truth about this President. We can't all be appeasers. An \nappeaser is a guy who throws his friends to the alligators hoping they \nwill eat him last.\n  Hiram Mann said, ``No man survives when freedom fails, the best men \nrot in filthy jails, and those who cry appease, appease are hanged by \nthose they tried to please.''\n  I believe that truth will ultimately prevail. It is just stubborn. \nWinston Churchill said, ``Truth is incontrovertible. Ignorance may \nderide it, panic may resent it, malice may destroy it, but there it \nis.''\n\n[[Page S2617]]\n\n  Mr. President, everything I have said during the course of the last \n30 minutes is absolutely proven and true.

Mr. President, today I rise to speak for a few moments on \nthe Justice Department's ongoing case against Microsoft, and to discuss \nthe Judiciary Committee's upcoming agenda in examining competition in \nthe digital markets.\n  As my colleagues know, the Department of Justice and 19 states have \nsued Microsoft for violating federal antitrust laws. In the case \nbrought by the Department of Justice, the Government has completed its \ncase in chief, and Microsoft rested its case on Friday, February 26.\n  While the trial is proceeding in the courts, I have not held hearings \non Microsoft's apparent monopolistic activities and their impact on \ncompetition within the software and related technology markets. \nHowever, as I noted last November, the Judiciary Committee will \ncontinue to examine the important role proper and timely enforcement of \nfederal antitrust laws can have on fostering both competition and \ninnovation for emerging technologies, while minimizing the need for \ngovernment regulation of the Internet.\n  I believe an important area of inquiry is evaluating the significant \npublic policy concerns posed by the question of what remedies should be \nimposed in cases where, notwithstanding the generally dynamic and \ncompetitive nature of Internet-related industries, high technology \ncompanies have been found to have violated the antitrust laws.\n  As I have maintained in the past, these dynamic high-technology \nindustries are different from other traditional industries of the past, \nand antitrust remedies must take these differences and the special \ncharacteristics of the respective high-tech industries into account.\n  Mr. President, if, at the close of the trial, Microsoft is found to \nhave violated the law, the remedies that the court would apply will \nimplicate many policy concerns with respect to how business in the \nhigh-technology industry is transacted. Any resolution of the matter--\nincluding any settlement, I believe, should aim to restore competition \nand ensure that neither Microsoft, nor any other monopolist similarly \nsituated, is allowed to continue to benefit from the market advantages \nit gained unfairly.\n  Promoting real and vigorous competition, which respects intellectual \nproperty rights, will not only ensure better prices for the consumers, \nbut will also ensure that innovation is not hampered due to the market \nstranglehold of a monopolist. Ensuring that true competition exists in \nthe market is also the best way to keep the government out of the \nbusiness of regulating the Internet.\n  Government should not exert unwarranted control over the Internet--\neven if Vice President Gore still thinks he created it. Nor should any \none company. Indeed, I share Senator Gorton's interest in knowing where \nthe Vice President stands with respect to the Microsoft case. After \nall, doesn't the father of the Internet have a view on who should be \nable to control his creation?\n  In the trial, we saw the government put forth a powerful case against \nMicrosoft. And, we saw Microsoft put forth a not so stellar defense. \nMany experts, even those who were skeptical at first, now believe that \nthe government may well prevail.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several illustrative articles related to \nthis case be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 11, 1999]\n\n               U.S. Hammers at Microsoft's Browser Deals\n\n                           (By Joel Brinkley)\n\n       A senior Microsoft official acknowledged in Federal court \n     today that the company's contracts had prohibited Internet \n     service providers from offering its browser on the same Web \n     page as its main competition because Microsoft executives \n     ``thought we would lose in a side-by-side choice.''\n       The admission clearly pleased David Boies, the Government \n     lawyer who elicited it from the witness, Cameron Myhrvold, a \n     vice president in the Microsoft Corporation's Internet \n     Customer Unit division--so much so that Mr. Boies asked the \n     same question four different ways and got the same answer \n     each time.\n       ``Was it true you were trying to prevent Internet service \n     providers from presenting Netscape and Internet Explorer side \n     by side so users could choose?'' he asked at one point. \n     Internet Explorer is the name of Microsoft's browser; the \n     Netscape Communications Corporation's Navigator is its \n     principal rival.\n       ``We thought we would lose in a side-by-side choice, ``Mr. \n     Myhrvold answered, because Netscape was already so firmly \n     established in the market.\n       In all, it was another bad day in court for Microsoft in \n     its antitrust battle with the Justice Department, which \n     charges that the software giant used a monopoly in personal \n     computer operating systems to achieve a dominant position in \n     Internet software. Hour after hour, Mr. Boies chiseled away \n     at Mr. Myhrvold's testimony, forcing him to acknowledge \n     incorrect assertions, misleading omissions and deceptive \n     statements.\n       Mr. Myhrvold repeatedly acknowledged that he made \n     misstatements in E-mail memos. He also testified that he \n     disagreed with Microsoft employees whose memos contradicted \n     his own assertions.\n       As he completed his testimony this evening it was clear the \n     Mr. Myhrvold's appearance had not helped Microsoft's case. In \n     fact, as Microsoft's defense reached its midpoint this \n     evening, none of its first five witnesses had proved \n     particularly effective advocates of the company's position.\n       Mr. Myhrvold, a brother of Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft's \n     chief technology officer, is in charge of the Microsoft \n     division that negotiates agreements with Internet service \n     providers, the companies that give computer users access to \n     the Internet. The Government charges that Microsoft's \n     restrictive contracts with these companies are \n     anticompetitive and illegal. Mr. Myhrvold tried to make the \n     case that the contracts were largely ineffective or benign.\n       Many of these companies have agreements to be listed in the \n     Internet Referral Service in Microsoft's Windows operating \n     system, which enables users to subscribe to an Internet \n     service posted there. On Tuesday, Mr. Myhrvold insisted that \n     the Government's assertion that these companies had to favor \n     Explorer over Navigator to be included in the service was \n     ``absolutely wrong.''\n       But under further cross-examination by Mr. Boies today, Mr. \n     Myhrvold admitted that in most cases the companies had been \n     required to ship Explorer to at least 75 percent of their \n     customers. Mr. Myhrvold added that they were free to stop \n     shipping the Microsoft product if they wanted, in which case \n     they could be dropped from the Windows referral service.\n       ``It's a fairly subtle point,'' Mr. Myhrvold acknowledged.\n       Similarly, in his written direct testimony, Mr. Myhrvold \n     pointedly noted that several Internet service providers in \n     the referral service were not shipping Explorer as required, \n     and yet the company had decided not to enforce the contracts.\n       For example, he wrote, ``of the copies of Web browsing \n     software shipped by Concentric,'' a reference to Concentric \n     Networks, a small Internet service provider, ``only 17 \n     percent were Internet Explorer.''\n       But those figures were for 1997, Mr. Boies entered into \n     evidence a Microsoft document showing that by the first \n     quarter of 1998, 100 percent of Concentric's browser \n     shipments were Internet Explorer.\n       Mr. Myhrvold repeatedly noted that Netcom, a Internet \n     service unit of ICG Communications Inc. that has a contract \n     with Microsoft, made no real effort to switch customers to \n     Internet Explorer, testifying that one point in 1997--when 10 \n     percent of Netcom's customers were getting the Microsoft \n     product--was ``the high-water mark.''\n       But Mr. Boies then displayed a Microsoft document showing \n     that in early 1998 the percentage had risen to 40 percent. \n     Then Mr. Boies offered another Microsoft document showing \n     that Netcom was actually able to control the browser choice \n     of only a small percentage of the people who signed up for \n     its service; most customers were handed to Netcom by computer \n     makers, or by Netscape. That same document showed that \n     Microsoft won an agreement with Netcom that 90 percent of the \n     customers Netcom did control would switch to Internet \n     Explorer.\n       To that, Mr. Myhrvold said only that the author of the \n     Microsoft document ``was a pretty good salesman.''\n       Later, the response to a question from a Microsoft lawyer, \n     Mr. Myhrvold denied a Government assertion that his staff had \n     offered a British division of Uunet, an Internet service \n     owned by MCI Worldcom, $500,000 to swtich to Internet \n     Explorer. He said he told his staff that ``it would not be \n     appropriate to\n\n[[Page S2618]]\n\n     tie payments to shipments of Internet Explorer.''\n       Moments later, Mr. Boies displayed still another E-mail \n     that Mr. Mhyrvold had written to a subordinate in Britain in \n     which he said, ``I think tying the payment to their shipping \n     of IE is a great idea, though I would not do this formally.'' \n     Mr. Myhrvold explained that the message had not meant what it \n     said, and he had called the subordinate later to tell him not \n     to tie the two. There was no record of that call, he \n     conceded.\n       On Thursday, Brad Chase, another Microsoft executive, takes \n     the stand. In his written direct testimony, which was made \n     public today, he defends Microsoft's contract requiring \n     America Online to switch its customers to Internet Explorer.\n       Mr. Chase writes that ``nothing in the license requires \n     AOL's subscribers to choose Internet Explorer.'' But a \n     Mircosoft memo introduced today suggests the cross-\n     examination Mr. Chase is likely to face.\n       In it, a Microsoft executive writes that ``the typical AOL \n     user is a novice.'' And as a result, AOL uses ``the force-\n     feed approach. They force feed the upgrade at log off,'' \n     meaning that Ameica Online automatically downloaded Internet \n     Explorer to users when they logged off the service.\n       An America Online executive testified earlier in the trial \n     that very few users bothered to swtich from Internet Explorer \n     to Navigator, even though they were allowed to, because \n     finding and installing the Netsccape browser was too \n     difficult.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 5, 1999]\n\n         Microsoft Shows New Tape, and Opens a New Can of Worms\n\n                           (By Joel Brinkley)\n\n       Washington, Feb. 4.--Trying to stop the damage from a \n     disastrous week in court, the Microsoft Corporation played a \n     new, videotaped demonstration at its antitrust trial \n     Thursday.\n       The 70-minute video showed James E. Allchin, a senior \n     company executive, performing live tests and then looking \n     into the camera and saying that he had proved his point--that \n     a prototype Government program intended to separate \n     Microsoft's Web browser from the Windows operating system had \n     really done no such thing.\n       The program just hid the browser, he showed. Further, he \n     demonstrated, running the program disabled some other \n     features in Windows and caused additional problems.\n       In Federal Court on Monday, Microsoft had played a long \n     videotape intended to demonstrate the advantages of \n     integrating a Web browser with Windows and debunk the \n     Government program, written by a Princeton University \n     professor and two of his students.\n       But in the last two days, David Boies, the Government's \n     lead lawyer in the antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft, \n     gradually pulled the tape apart, pointing out numerous \n     technical questions and errors, until finally Judge Thomas \n     Penfield Jackson declared Wednesday afternoon that he no \n     longer viewed the tape as reliable evidence.\n       ``It's very troubling,'' he said.\n       After that, Microsoft gave up and asked for an opportunity \n     to make a new tape. As soon as court adjourned Wednesday, a \n     Microsoft spokesman drove to a shopping mall in suburban \n     Landover, Md,, and bought six I.B.M. Thinkpad laptop \n     computers at CompUSA, for use in the new effort.\n       A film crew was hired on short notice, and the computers \n     were delivered to a conference room at Sullivan & Cromwell, \n     the law firm that is representing Microsoft.\n       To assure that the new tape woud be viewed as credible, a \n     Government lawyer and the Princeton professor, Dr. Edward W. \n     Felten, along with his two students, were invited to come by \n     at 8:30 p.m. to witness the taping. But they were not \n     permitted into the room for two hours, while the Microsoft \n     team unpacked the boxes and set up the computers--leading to \n     angry concerns that something nefarious was under way. The \n     taping was not completed until after midnight.\n       Asked in court Thursday why the Government representatives \n     were not let in, Allchin--normally a low-key unflappable \n     man--bristled and said: ``Sir, I was not involved with that, \n     and it would have been okay with me.''\n       Allchin sat in the witness stand and watched silently as \n     his tape was played. On the tape, Allchin, who is a senior \n     vice president for Microsoft in charge of the Windows \n     division, navigated his way into a new computer he did not \n     know and ran up against the same software problems and \n     glitches every computer user encounters.\n       ``Okay, I've got to figure this out, and I don't have my \n     glasses with me,'' he said matter of factly when his screen \n     suddenly went blank. Later, when a Microsoft promotional \n     program popped onto the screen unbidden, complete with a loud \n     gong from Big Ben followed by upbeat jazz, Allchin looked a \n     bit annoyed and said, ``Very nice music, but not tonight.''\n       As he tried to connect to the Internet while the camera \n     watched, the connections often failed, and when one did \n     succeed, it seemed to be agonizing slow--nothing like the \n     zippy Internet downloads shown in Microsoft's demonstration \n     tape that was played in court on Monday.\n       ``The performance problem you see here has nothing to do \n     with Dr. Felten's program,'' Allchin acknowledged at one \n     point.\n       Judge Jackson, who is hearing the case without a jury, \n     watched the tape silently, often with a bemused expression on \n     his face.\n       When it was over, Allchin demonstrated that, after running \n     the Government program, he was able to re-enable Internet \n     Explorer through a complex series of changes in the Windows \n     registry file that no normal user would be able to carry out \n     without precise instructions.\n       Before doing that, he demonstrated that several programs \n     did not work properly on what he called ``a Felten-ized \n     machine.''\n       All of the problems he showed related to features of the \n     programs that interacted with the Internet. And when Boies \n     got a chance to question Allchin again, he immediately asked: \n     Isn't it logical to expect, after disabling the browser, \n     ``that anything that depended on the browser wouldn't work \n     right?''\n       Allchin conceded that. And as for the other problems and \n     glitches Allchin demonstrated, Boies said: ``What Dr. Felten \n     prepared was not a commercial product. It was a concept \n     program. Wouldn't you expect it to have problems? Doesn't \n     Microsoft find bugs in its programs during the normal course \n     of software development?'' To that last question, Allchin \n     said yes.\n       Before Allchin played his tape, another Microsoft witness, \n     Michael Devlin, an independent software developer, completed \n     his testimony in about 90 minutes. In his direct, written \n     testimony, he said his company appreciated Microsoft's \n     decision to include a Web browser with Windows.\n       Boies, the lead Government attorney, barely referred to \n     that testimony in his brief, 27-minute cross-examination. \n     Instead he tried to throw Devlin's motivations for testifying \n     into question by demonstrating that his company was dependent \n     on Microsoft for more than half of its business and was at \n     risk of serious financial damage from Microsoft if the \n     company were to decide to make a competing product.\n       Devlin acknowledged that, but Boies never asked him \n     directly if those concerns had played into his decision to \n     agree to Microsoft's request to testify.\n       Microsoft also made public the written testimony of the \n     next witness, William Poole, senior director of business \n     development for Microsoft, who will take the stand on Monday.\n       In it, Poole defends the restrictive contracts Microsoft \n     won from other companies doing business on the Internet, \n     requiring them to promote Internet Explorer in exchange for \n     advertising space in Windows.\n       The Government charges that these contracts are \n     anticompetitive and illegal, but Poole calls them ``routine \n     cross-licensing agreements, common across many industries.''\n       Poole also argues that, in the end, the contracts did not \n     significantly impede the Netscape Communications Corporation, \n     the chief competitor to Internet Explorer. And he adds, the \n     ``channel bar,'' the space in Windows where the ads appeared, \n     ``turned out to be a commercial disappointment'' in any case.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Seattle Times, Feb. 23, 1999]\n\n    Microsoft Trial--Executive Admits Offering Netscape Inducements\n\n                         (By James V. Grimaldi)\n\n       Washington.--A Microsoft executive acknowledged offering \n     Netscape Communications executives ``several inducements'' in \n     mid-1995 to get the browser maker to adopt certain Microsoft \n     Internet technologies.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Today, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson \n     indicated just how far Microsoft had to go to repair the \n     damage. As Rosen resumed the stand for direct questioning by \n     Microsoft attorney Michael Lacovara, Jackson reminded Rosen \n     that he was still under oath. Then, the judge turned to the \n     attorney's podium and said, ``Mr. Lacovara, it is always \n     inspiring to watch young people embark on heroic endeavors.''\n       Testifying that archrival Netscape posed no significant \n     threat to Microsoft in 1995, Rosen yesterday attempted to \n     refute allegations that the Redmond corporation attempted to \n     divide the market for Internet browsers with Netscape during \n     a June 21, 1995, meeting.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       By saying that he didn't consider Netscape a significant \n     competitor before the meeting, Rosen was trying to build a \n     foundation for his defense: If Netscape was not perceived as \n     a competitor, then Microsoft couldn't possibly have been \n     trying to divide the market for browsers with the Silicon \n     Valley company's executives.\n       Rosen strongly denied the market-division allegation in \n     written testimony. In particular, he was called to dispute \n     the testimony of Netscape Chief Executive Jim Barksdale, the \n     government's first witness, and other Netscape officials who \n     were questioned before the trial.\n       Today he said Netscape officials first suggested the idea \n     that a ``line'' be drawn between the underlying operating-\n     system technology and what would run on top of that \n     technology, such as an Internet browser.\n       But when Boies began his second round of questioning, Rosen \n     had more difficulties. He testified that he had not received \n     a copy of the Netscape browser software before the 1995 \n     meeting. Shown a copy of an e-mail with Rosen asking another \n     Microsoft executive for it, Rosen said that it turned out to \n     be an early copy that did not install well.\n       Boies blew up: ``You don't remember that, do you, sir? \n     You're just making that up right now.''\n\n[[Page S2619]]\n\n       Rosen replied: ``No, sir. I remember it.''\n       Boies showed Rosen another e-mail. Rosen read it and \n     replied, ``I stand corrected.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       ``I remember thinking that Bill was probably wrong because \n     Jim Barksdale was telling me that Netscape didn't intend to \n     compete in this way,'' Rosen said. ``I probably had a better \n     perspective than Mr. Gates did on Netscape's true \n     intentions.''\n       Rosen testified that it was his understanding that Netscape \n     did not want leadership for its Navigator browser on the \n     Windows 95 platform, though he had written in a May 1995 memo \n     that Microsoft should try to control Netscape.\n       Rosen worked hard to repudiate his own memo, which \n     indicates he considered Netscape a threat. He said he had \n     just joined Microsoft and the memo was a draft that contained \n     errors.\n       On Page 3 of the five-page memo, Rosen wrote, ``Microsoft \n     currently controls the base and the evolution of the desktop \n     platform.

He added, ``I don't know why this \n     is surprising. I wrote this down to discuss this with others \n     to find out what my ideas looked like compared to others. \n     This was a draft document.''\n       Boies and Rosen continued to tangle over the memo, which \n     Rosen acknowledged he wrote but repeatedly said he never \n     sent.\n       ``If you want me to comment on a draft memo that was never \n     set,'' he said, ``I don't know how fair it is.''\n       Replied Boies: ``You might understand how someone reading \n     this might believe you meant what you wrote.''\n       Said Rosen: ``Yes.''\n       After a lunch break, the government showed Rosen a document \n     from Preston, Gates & Ellis showing that the memo was \n     produced from the files of Microsoft executive Ben Slivka. \n     Rosen acknowledged he must have sent it ``at the very least'' \n     to Slivka.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the New York Times, February 27, 1999]\n\n             Microsoft Rests Its Case, Ending on a Misstep\n\n                           (By Joel Brinkley)\n\n       After more than five months of testimony, the Microsoft \n     Corporation rested its case today in the Government's \n     landmark antitrust suit, but not before the presiding judge \n     had shouted angrily at the company's final witness and \n     ordered him to stop talking.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       John Warden, Microsoft's lead trial lawyer, acknowledged \n     that others believed that the Government had ``succeeded in \n     undermining our witnesses.'' But he called this a desperation \n     tactic. ``When you don't have the laws or the facts, you try \n     credibility, and that's what I think has driven them to this \n     strategy.''\n       David Boies, the Government's lead trial lawyer, who has \n     tripped up and embarrassed most of Microsoft's witnesses, \n     said he believed that casting doubt on witnesses' credibility \n     was not all that had been achieved.\n       ``They've admitted monopoly power,'' he said. ``They've \n     admitted the absence of competitive constraints. They've \n     admitted raising prices to hurt consumers. They've admitted \n     depriving consumers of choice.''\n       In the witness box today, Robert Muglia, a Microsoft senior \n     vice president, tried to put the best face on his company's \n     relationship with Sun Microsystems, the creator and owner of \n     the Java programming language. The Government charges that \n     Microsoft tried to sabotage Sun because it saw Java as a \n     competitive threat.\n       Mr. Muglia, who said Microsoft's relationship with Sun was \n     his responsibility, repeatedly asserted that Microsoft was \n     interested in cooperating with Sun. But Mr. Boies presented \n     numerous E-mail messages and memos from senior Microsoft \n     executives, saying in one manner or another that they wanted \n     to defeat Sun.\n       The combined effect of the memos was to leave the \n     impression that if Mr. Muglia was to be believed, he was \n     either out of touch or naive. And his continued defense of \n     his position, even in the face of a contradictory E-mail from \n     William H. Gates, the company's chairman, set off the judge.\n       In May 1997, Mr. Gates wrote: ``I am hard-core about NOT \n     supporting'' the latest version of Java. Messages in the same \n     string of E-mail from other senior executives made the same \n     statement, but with exclamation points and expletives.\n       Yet Mr. Muglia tried to make the case that Mr. Gates had \n     not really meant what he wrote, adding, ``I don't exactly \n     know what Bill meant by support.''\n       At that, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is hearing the \n     case without a jury, shook his head and interrupted with an \n     irritated tone, saying: ``There's no question he says he does \n     not like the idea of supporting it. Let's not argue about \n     it.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Earlier, Mr. Boies had showed him a Microsoft memo setting \n     out the company's strategy on Java. The first line was ``Kill \n     cross-platform Java by growing the polluted Java market.'' \n     Sun and the Government accuse Microsoft of creating its own \n     ``polluted'' version of Java to undermine Sun's version. \n     Microsoft argues that its version is better.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       This morning Microsoft's lawyer was questioning the \n     preceding witness, Joachim Kempin, a Microsoft vice \n     president, prompting him to list the modifications Microsoft \n     was not allowing computer manufacturers to make to its \n     Windows operating system. A year ago, the company forbade \n     most or all such changes, which contributed to Federal \n     antitrust charges.\n       Judge Jackson interrupted the questions to ask in an even \n     tone: ``Are all these rights manufacturers now possess a \n     matter of sufferance and grace on the part of Microsoft, or \n     are they expressly written into the contracts?''\n       Mr. Kempin said some were granted in personal letters to \n     the companies, others in phone conversations--not in \n     contracts.\n       ``So you have chosen to waive or give up certain rights you \n     have in your contract?'' the judge said.\n       That's right, Mr. Kempin said. The judge's questions \n     appeared to mirror the Government's assertions that \n     Microsoft's new generosity to manufacturers could be \n     temporary--lasting only as long as Microsoft's previous \n     behavior is the subject of antitrust charges.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to read them if they \nhave not already done so. These articles set forth but a few examples \nof Microsoft's unfortunate actions that have manifested in what has \nbeen several months of missteps and embarrassments for the company.\n  The trial is not over. The case is just suspended until the week of \nApril 12, when the court will reconvene for probably several weeks of \ntestimony from rebuttal witnesses. But Microsoft and its defenders have \nagain begun their public relations efforts here in the Senate.\n  Just last Friday, my friend, the distinguished senior Senator from \nWashington, Senator Gorton, took the floor to again defend Microsoft, \nand attack the Antitrust enforcers and me for questioning Microsoft's \nactions. I have said before and will say it again: Microsoft is not \nabove the law. The facts and the law should and will prevail regardless \nof Microsoft's public relations campaign, its ill-advised lobbying \nefforts, and its muddled defenses.\n  I had been surprised to read several weeks ago that Senator Gorton, \nin a February 9 press conference, ``vowed to use his influence as a \nmember of the Appropriations Committee to cut funding for the Justice \nDepartment's antitrust division.'' I and several concerned Senators \nwrote to Senators Gregg and Hollings and argued that a move to cut the \nDivision's funding without justification could be perceived by many as \ninterfering with an ongoing litigation.\n  I was pleased to hear that my colleague has apparently conceded that \ntrying to cut DOJ's funding would be unwise. However, he has now \nproperly downsized his ambition and is now advocating not increasing \nthe Antitrust Division's budget by the amount the Administration has \nrequested.\n  I am not yet convinced that the Antitrust Division has fully \njustified its request for a substantial budget increase. In fact, I \nbelieve the Congress should work with the Administration to examine \nwhether we should adjust the Hart-Scott-Rodino value thresholds in \norder to ensure that the Department's merger reviews take into account \ninflation and the true economic impact of mergers in today's economy. \nAttorney General Reno has pledged to work with me on this, and I look \nforward to working with any of my colleagues who may have an interest \nin this issue. In this age of precious resources, we will be looking \nclosely at the Antitrust Division's budget and operations, and making \nsure that any reasonable budget increase is justified.\n  A final point. My friend and Senator from Microsoft's home state has \npublicly stated that a number of companies across the nation, including \nsome in my state of Utah, work with Microsoft and would be hurt by the \ncurrent antitrust litigation against Microsoft. I don't know if they \nwill be hurt, but what I do know is that there are many high technology \ncompanies and millions of consumers in the States of Washington, Utah \nand across the nation that would be harmed by any anticompetitive act \nof Microsoft.\n  In fact, we heard testimony before the Judiciary Committee from one \nSeattle, Washington-based company, Real\n\n[[Page S2620]]\n\nNetworks, describing how Microsoft's anticompetitive conduct crippled \ntheir technology and hurt the company, although I have to say Real \nNetworks has been doing very well ever since because of their \nfascinating innovations and the tremendous abilities that they have in \nthis field. However, if violations of the antitrust laws are not \npursued against powerful companies like the Microsofts of the world, as \nthe Senator from Washington suggests, many of the technology companies, \nnot to mention the consumers, in the states of Washington, Utah and all \nacross the nation, will suffer. Mr. President, the survival of these \ncompanies means jobs, it means innovation, it means competition in the \ndigital market, and it means the availability of consumer choice.\n  I just hope that Microsoft can learn from its mistakes in court and \nits earlier mistakes here in Congress. Frankly, some of their efforts \nhere have reminded me of those who would tie themselves to railroad \ntracks and wait for a train to come just to make a point. Microsoft's \nmisguided legal and legislative advice has not helped its case to date, \nand I would hope, for Microsoft's case, that they would not initiate a \nfoolish political protest which could leave them even more damaged than \nthey are now. Frankly, I don't think this train is going to stop.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and turn the \nfloor over for my dear friend from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to make my maiden speech on \nthe floor of the Senate. It is about a subject near and dear to me, \nprotecting and strengthening Social Security for this generation and \nthe next.\n  In the other body, I served on the Social Security Subcommittee for 8 \nyears. Over the last 4 years, I had the privilege of being the \nchairman. It was the most satisfying task I have had since coming to \nthe Congress. In the subcommittee, we held numerous hearings over the \npast several years on Social Security reform and how to tackle the \nlooming problem that will be facing us in the next century.\n  I have already introduced my own personal Social Security reform \nbill. It is called The Social Security for the 21st Century Act. \nBasically, Social Security reform is a two-sided coin. The first side \nof the coin is that we must guarantee the benefits that have been \npromised our older workers, workers who have paid into the program for \nyears. We must assure them that their investment is safe and their \nbenefits will always be there when they are needed.\n  The second side of the coin is that we have to find a way to give \nyounger workers a reason to believe in the program, a reason to believe \nthat they will get a reasonable rate of return on the money they invest \nin Social Security taxes throughout their working careers.\n  My bill focuses primarily on the second side of the coin. It gives \ntaxpayers a one-time, voluntary option to set aside a small portion of \ntheir income that they have to pay into FICA taxes, and to invest this \nmoney in their own retirement security account.\n  The Social Security for the 21st Century Act enables them to begin by \ninvesting just 2.5 percent of their FICA taxes each year, and slowly \nincreasing this amount by 2.5 percent annually over 20 years until \neventually taxpayers can invest one-half of all of their FICA taxes in \ntheir own personal retirement security account. In return for choosing \nto set up a retirement security account, a taxpayer would agree to a \n50-percent reduction in Social Security benefits.\n  The most important point about my bill is that it is voluntary, not \nmandatory. It gives people a choice, and it does not force them to do \nanything they do not want to do. If they are satisfied with what they \nhave now, they can keep their benefits simply by doing nothing. But, if \ntaxpayer-investors elect to set up a retirement security account, they \nwould be able to manage their investment just like the Government \nworkers do today in the successful Federal employee Thrift Savings \nPlan. Investors would have the additional choice to stop investing, but \nthey could not do it again later on. They couldn't choose to come back.\n  They would have at least five options for investing their money. They \ncould elect to put their money into a number of investments: stocks, \nfixed income, Government securities--whatever best meets their needs. \nThere would be an annual open season so they could adjust their \nportfolios. In short, this would give Americans more control over their \nfutures, and enable them to harness the power of markets and the \nmiracle of compound interest.\n  Now, I know that many Americans, especially older taxpayers, might \nnot want to make any changes at all to Social Security. We should \nrespect that. They have been promised their benefits for years and they \nhave relied on that in good faith. That is the second side of the coin. \nTo protect these folks, and our most vulnerable citizens, my \nlegislation guarantees the Social Security safety net. It does not \nraise the retirement age, it does not cut benefits, and it does not cut \nCOLAs.\n  But I think that many workers, if given a choice, would opt to set \naside some of their money and invest it in a retirement security \naccount. Based on our experience with the Thrift Savings Plan, I think \nit would be a significant step towards stronger financial security for \nall Americans.\n  The TSP has been a great success for Federal workers. Over the past \n10 years, the three investment choices available to workers in the TSP \nhave average annual rates of return of 17.5 percent, 8.5 percent, and \n7.6 percent.\n  That means the worst performing of these three funds, the G fund, \nwhich invests strictly in Government securities, has returned over 7 \npercent annually to investors. That compares very, very well to the 2 \nto 3 percent annual return that most Americans get for\n\n[[Page S2621]]\n\ntheir money that they pay into Social Security. Compounded over \ndecades, the differences in the rates of return are staggering.\n  Under my bill, taxpayers will own their own retirement secured \naccounts, and they, not the Federal Government, can control how their \nmoney is invested. My legislation follows the scrupulous conflict of \ninterest rules that have worked well for the TSP to make sure that \nGovernment cannot vote shares of stock or manipulate markets. Best of \nall, withdrawals from this retirement secured account will be tax free, \nbecause we should not need to penalize Americans who successfully plan \nfor their retirement.\n  Congress has wisely moved in recent years to help retirees keep more \nof their own money. Social Security reform must continue that trend. I \nbelieve Social Security reform must be voluntary. It should give \ntaxpayers more, not fewer, investment choices, and it must protect the \nmost vulnerable Americans who are counting on these benefits. It is \nimportant to bring as many ideas to the table as possible as part of a \nnational dialogue about Social Security reform. These are the \nprinciples I have tried to follow in writing this bill, and I will work \nwith anyone on my legislation and on any other proposals to improve the \nSocial Security system.\n  Mr. President, we have a golden window of opportunity now to reform \nSocial Security. Our economy is the strongest it has been in decades. \nWe have a budget surplus to give us some flexibility in making \ndifficult decisions. Now we have to find the political will. It is a \nchallenge we must meet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Durbin, I yield myself \nsuch time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I didn't know Jacob Chestnut, but I did know \nDetective John Gibson, as a result of an unfortunate incident with a \nmember of my family. Officer Gibson reacted in a very valiant way on \nsomething a couple months before he was murdered last July in this \nCapitol complex.\n  Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson, about 9 months ago, were murdered. \nThey were murdered when an assailant went through a door, shot both of \nthem, killed both of them, and was after other people as well. The \nPresiding Officer, being a physician/surgeon, was on the floor and \nrendered great aid and assistance to others who were injured, for which \nwe are all grateful. After that tragedy, many of us stood on this floor \nand talked about the need to do something to stop these incidents in \nthe future.\n  Mr. President, I look at this in a number of different ways. I look \nat it as someone who knows what a valiant man John Gibson was and, of \ncourse, I am sure Officer Chestnut also; I just did not know him on a \npersonal basis. I approach this on the basis that I am a Senator and \nhave some responsibility for this Capitol complex. I approach it as a \nperson who is concerned about my staff and the visitors who come to \nthis complex being safe and secure.\n  I approach it also as a former Capitol police officer. I have great \nempathy and great understanding, I believe, for what police officers go \nthrough in this facility. What we talked about last year, after this \nincident, is that finally, after more than a decade, we were going to \ndo something to create a visitors center in the east plaza. In this \nbeautiful Capitol complex, we have a big parking lot; we have asphalt. \nWe have talked about having a nice grassy area, as well as an \nunderground area where people can come and enter the Capitol.\n  Now, if people want to come and take a tour through the Capitol, they \nstand out on the east plaza, on that asphalt. No matter the \ntemperature, it can be 5 degrees below zero, they still stand out \nthere. There is no place else for them to go. If it is 100 degrees, \nlike it gets here in August, they still stand out there. There is no \nplace else for them to go. There is no place for them to get a drink of \nwater. There is no place for them to go to the bathroom. They stand out \non the asphalt waiting to come through the Capitol.\n\n  After the unfortunate murders of these two police officers, we talked \nabout how we were going to do something. We immediately authorized a \nbill to allow construction of this facility. After that was done, we \nappropriated money to initiate the planning of this visitors center. In \nfact, we are no closer to completion of this facility today than when \nthese two officers were gunned down by this man, this terrorist.\n  We need to move forward with this effort. However, we have created a \nbureaucratic nightmare. We have four or five committees and \nsubcommittees which have jurisdiction over how it is going to be \nconstructed, when it is going to be constructed, and who is going to be \nconstructing it, in what manner it is going to be constructed. We have \nheard lately that other committees want to get involved. We do not have \nenough now. We want to add some more.\n  I say, as a member of two committees that are talking about this, out \nof the three or four that are involved, I think we should get on with \nthe business at hand. I understand the need for oversight, I understand \nvery much, but there comes a time when we have said enough and we must \nmove forward to do what we have to do.\n  This is not a waste of taxpayers' money. If we have this beautiful \nfacility, not only will it be a convenience for the public but it will \nbe a safety factor, because it will give a way to funnel people in this \nCapitol so that proper measures can be taken to find out if they are \ncarrying weapons or bombs or anything else that could be of danger to \nthe people inside this facility. In addition to that, it will be a \nplace where people can go to the bathroom and escape from the elements. \nIt will probably be set up so that there will be places for them to \neat. In effect, it will be a place where there will be revenues gained \nfrom this facility. We owe this facility to the two officers who were \ngunned down 9 months ago, we owe it to our staffs, for we, as Members, \nare responsible for their safety and security. We owe it to the \nmillions of people who come to this facility on a yearly basis. We are \nvery proud of this U.S. Capitol; all Americans are. We should be able \nto come to this Capitol without fearing for our safety.\n  For more than 10 years, well before last year's tragedy, there had \nbeen a lot of talk about building a Capitol complex visitors center, \nbut it has only been talk. It is about time we turn this talk into \naction, for the good of the country.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

ALEXANDER, STATE HOUSE REPRESENTATIVE FROM \n                               LOUISIANA\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to rise for a \nmoment of personal privilege on behalf of myself and Senator John \nBreaux to note with great sadness the passing of a leading citizen of \nmy hometown, New Orleans, LA, our State representative, Rev. Avery C. \nAlexander, a community and civil rights leader for many decades who \npassed away in New Orleans last Friday at the age of 88.\n  Reverend Alexander, or ``the Rev,'' as he was referred to by all of \nhis many, many, many friends, was the son of a sharecropper from Houma, \nLA, and rose to prominence in the 1960s civil rights struggle. From the \nstreets of New Orleans where he ``shouted out'' for the voiceless, to \nthe halls of Baton Rouge where he fought for better schools, civil \nrights, and a more inclusive economy, ``the Rev'' stood tall.\n  When I was considering running for the legislature many, many years \nago at the ripe old age of 23, my father rightfully advised me to meet \nwith a small group of leaders to ask for their input and their ideas \nand their counsel.\n  The first person to show up at our home on that day was ``the Rev.'' \nOnce I was elected to the legislature, he helped me understand the \npolitical process from the inside as well as the outside. I will always \nbe grateful for his early advice and counsel, and so will the thousands \nof others who have benefited from his encouraging words, his fighting \nspirit and determination to make this world a better place for all.\n  Reverend Alexander was a person who always managed somehow to rise \nabove the man-made limitations placed on him, and he succeeded \ntriumphantly.\n  It was Margaret Mead who said, ``Never doubt that a small group of \nthoughtful, committed citizens can change the world.'' In fact, she \nsaid, it has never been done any other way. ``The Rev'' knew that and \nlived that until the day he passed. Many times, he alone was that small \ngroup, and he did, in fact, change our world for the better.\n  He worked as a laborer and a longshoreman--before he was a member of \nthe legislature--while continuing his education at night. When he \nwitnessed the unfair treatment of dock workers, he became active in the \nlabor movement on the waterfront in New Orleans.\n  As a lifelong member of the NAACP, he championed the cause of \nantidiscrimination, voter registration, and citizen review of police \nbrutality and misconduct.\n  He participated in the now famous march from Selma to Montgomery \nalongside the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. In 1956, Reverend Alexander \nwas arrested and dragged up the steps from the basement of city hall \nwhile attempting to integrate the public cafeteria in that building.\n  In 1992, he established a nondenominational ministry founded on the \nprinciple of ``helping all people.'' Reverend Alexander was elected to \nthe House of Representatives in 1975 and remained an active and \neffective member until his recent death.\n  As dedicated as he was to advocating civil rights for African \nAmericans, he was equally dedicated to standing up for the rights of \nwomen. His words of encouragement throughout the years were in no small \npart responsible for helping me become the first elected woman Senator \nfrom Louisiana.\n  As a strong believer in higher education, he continued his own \npersonal education at Xavier University, Southern University, Tulane \nUniversity and the Union Theological Seminary and the University of New \nOrleans. Reverend Alexander also served as chaplain for many, many \nyears of the Louisiana legislative black caucus, on the National Board \nof the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and was a delegate on \nthree separate occasions to the National Democratic Convention.\n  Mr. President, the citizens of New Orleans and the State of Louisiana \nhave lost a dear friend. Many young leaders in our State and throughout \nthe country have lost a great mentor, and the American people have lost \na great civil rights leader. He will be missed. God bless his family, \nespecially his daughter Cheryl, his brother Lymon and all the \ngrandchildren and great grandchildren. We today commend him to you, \ndear Lord, in your eternal care.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back the remainder of my time and \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. COLLINS pertaining to the introduction of S. 617 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/15/senate-section/article/S2622-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2622-S2624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEast Asian and Pacific Affairs, I come to the floor today because I \nbelieve that the time has come for a thoughtful and critical re-\nexamination of United States policy towards the People's Republic of \nChina.\n  There had been encouraging developments in China in the past two \nyears. China has begun tackling the staggering job of reforming an \nantiquated command economy and opening it to private enterprise; and \nhave begun to move the military out of the private sector. They've \ntaken this difficult step even though they know it will result in the \ndisplacement and unemployment of literally millions of people. In \naddition, the government has greatly increased the number of democratic \nelections taking place at the village level throughout China. And \nBeijing has, for the most part, avoided interfering in Hong Kong \naffairs now that it is again a part of the PRC\n  But Mr. President, despite these improvements, I cannot ignore the \nfact that for every step China has taken forward, it appears to have \nalso taken one or two back. And a bilateral relationship that 10 months \nago looked as though it were showing improvement is instead, I believe, \nheaded down a rocky road.\n\n\n              For example: Nuclear and Technology Transfer\n\n  Recent press reports have indicated that over the span of the last \nseveral years there have been damaging leaks to the Chinese of \nsensitive United States nuclear technology which has enabled them to \nadvance their own nuclear program. The exact facts of the case are \nstill unclear, and I am sure will be the subject of intense \nCongressional scrutiny in the months ahead, but what is clear to me is \nthat there is a credible foundation for the accusations and that they \nare not, as the Chinese would have us believe, the figment of some \nsupposed ``anti-China'' media bias. My examination of the Cox report \nleads me to the identical conclusion with regards to the transfer and \nacquisition of satellite technology.\n  Now it would naive to deny that espionage is a fact of geopolitical \nlife, or that countries act in their own best interests; we should \nneither be shocked nor appalled that it goes on. But still, China's \nwillingness to systematically circumvent our laws and acquire over the \nlast several years--by stealth or otherwise--nuclear and computer \ntechnology is troubling to me, and demonstrates a willingness to take \nadvantage of our relationship when possible.\n\n\n                                 Taiwan\n\n  After a long-standing chill in relations across the Taiwan Straits, \nduring which the two sides failed to carry on even basic dialog, things \nhad begun looking up lately. The two sides resumed direct meetings last \nyear, and the head of the Taiwanese department that oversees cross-\nstraits affairs visited Beijing a few months ago; his PRC counterpart, \nWang Daohan, has agreed to a return visit to Taipei in the near future.\n  Recently though, there have been some signs that things might turn \nchilly again. In the last several months, the PRC has relocated a \nnumber of its missiles from the interior of the country to Fujian, \nZhejiang, and Guangdong Provinces--the three provinces directly across \nthe Straits from Taiwan. Moving so many missiles into these coastal \nprovinces is clearly meant, and understood, to send one signal to \nTaiwan. Remember, Mr. President, that it was from these provinces\n\n[[Page S2623]]\n\nthat China launched a series of ``missile tests'' just north and south \nof Taiwan during its 1996 presidential elections which effectively \nblockaded the ports of Kaoshiung and Taipei and which we felt were \nthreatening enough to require the movement of part of the 7th Fleet to \nthe Straits.\n  The movement of those missiles, and the not so veiled threat that \naccompanies them, can only prove to be another destabilizing effect in \nthe region. Accompanied by rather bellicose statements in the last two \nweeks by PRC Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan which pointedly omitted any \npromise to rule out the use of military force to achieve the \nreunification of Taiwan with the PRC, Taiwan cannot be faulted for \nfeeling that the threat against it from the mainland has increased; nor \ncan it be faulted for feeling the only way to protect themselves from \nthat threat is to explore participating in the discussions about \nestablishing a theater missile defense (TMD) system in East Asia.\n  In reaction to the TMD discussions, last week Beijing started a media \nblitz charging that any Taiwanese participation in a TMD ``would be the \nabsolute last straw'' is US-PRC relations, and have threatened a series \nof serious--albeit unspecified--retaliatory steps. Yet China completely \noverlooks the fact that their missile movements have, in great measure, \nprecipitated Taiwan's interest.\n\n\n                                 Tibet\n\n  Yesterday was the 40th anniversary of the beginning of a failed \nTibetan uprising against Chinese occupation of their country--an \nuprising that was brutally suppressed. And which resulted in the death, \narrest, or imprisonment of more that 87,000 Tibetans. It is unfortunate \nthat since that time, the core position that China has vis-a-vis Tibet \nhas changed very little.\n  Despite a sincere ongoing effort on the part of the Dalai Lama to \nengage the PRC in a dialog about the future of Tibet, the Chinese have \nrepeatedly refused to meet with the Dalai Lama or his representatives \nto discuss the issue. Each time Beijing has placed preconditions on the \ncommencement of those talks, and the Dalai Lama has acceded to those \nconditions despite their unpopularity among his people, the Chinese \nhave effectively moved the goalposts. For example, the Dalai Lama has \nagreed to negotiate within the framework enunciated by Deng Xiaoping in \n1979; namely, that he does not seek independence for Tibet but rather \nthe opportunity for Tibetans to handle their domestic affairs and \nfreely determine their social, economic, and cultural development. Once \nhe acquiesced to that position, however, Beijing apparently decided \nthat Deng's framework was no longer sufficient.\n  Most recently, during his meeting with President Clinton last year, \nJiang Zemin suggested he would meet with the Dalai Lama if the latter \nwould recognize that Tibet and Taiwan are a part of China. His Holiness \nsubsequently made a statement to that effect. But then the Chinese said \nthat ``he is not sincere\" in his statement--that the Dalai Lama is \nlying--and therefore still refuse to negotiate with him.\n  And in the meantime, China continues to do all it can to squelch the \nTibetan identity. Large numbers of ethnic Han Chinese are still being \nmoved into Tibet in an apparent effort to make Tibetans a minority in \ntheir own land. Buddhist monks and nuns are imprisoned, and monasteries \nclosed or their populations severely reduced. The government continues \nto manipulate and direct the selection of religious leaders more \nagreeable to the party line.\n  When confronted with these facts, the Chinese are fond of \nsidestepping them and noting that the life of the average Tibetan --\nfrom a health and economic standpoint--is better than it was \nbefore they took over. That may be. But that isn't the issue. The issue \nis whether the Tibetan people are free to worship as they please. \nWhether they are free to express their cultural and ethnic identity. \nWhether they are free to determine their futures for themselves. And at \npresent, the answer to those questions is a simple no.\n\n\n                              Human Rights\n\n  There has been a disturbing increase in the last six months in \ngovernment crackdowns on the freedom of expression, as evidenced by a \nsharp increase in the number of arrests and convictions of prodemocracy \nadvocates. In addition, the government has shut down fledgling \nprodemocracy organizations, and sought to curb Internet use and access.\n  I believe I understand, although I certainly in no way condone, the \nimpetus behind the crackdown. As I noted earlier, China has recently \nembarked on a program to restructure its economy along free-market \nlines and to open itself more to the world around it. These changes \ncould be viewed as potentially destabilizing for a communist regime \nwhich controls over 1.2 billion people. President Jiang admitted as \nmuch at the end of last year when he characterized government actions \nas necessary ``to nip those factors that undermine social stability in \nthe bud.''\n  As with other campaigns in China's recent past, such as the ``Let 100 \nFlowers Bloom'' campaign, when this latest openness campaign took hold \nand began to accelerate, the central authorities got overly anxious \nabout their ability to control the pace of reforms and about it getting \nout from underneath them and unleashing democracy. They have thus, true \nto form, begun slamming on the brakes and stifling any dissent, real or \nperceived.\n  But in doing so, the Chinese are blatantly flouting international \nnorms and agreements to which they had previously pledged to adhere \namong them the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the \nInternational Covenant on Economic, Cultural, and Social Rights. And in \ndoing so, the Chinese are turning their backs on us and an issue that \nis of central importance to us.\n\n\n                              North Korea\n\n  As a participant in the Four Party Talks in Geneva, China has helped \nfacilitate getting North Korea to the negotiating table in an attempt \nto stabilize the Korean peninsula. But while purporting to assist us on \nthe one hand, despite United States requests the Chinese are still not \ndoing all they could--or in their own best interests should--do to \ndefuse the potential powder keg that is North Korea.\n  Beijing's initial response is to say, as Foreign Minister Tang did \nthis week, that we are overestimating the potential threat North Korea \nposes to the region. But to anyone with even a passing familiarity with \nthe issue, North Korea is probably the number one threat to peace and \nstability in all of East Asia. The Chinese fall-back position then is \nto say that they have no influence over the North that could be used to \nhelp us effectuate change. But China continues to supply the North, a \ncountry that is literally starving its own people to death to maintain \nits military and its political elite, with food and technical goods, \nand serves as its only source of aviation fuel. In fact, it was \nreported last week that China has supplied the North with missile \ntechnology. All those seem to me to be potent incentives that could be \nused to influence the actions of the North, but which are pointedly not \nbeing taken advantage of by the Chinese.\n  Mr. President, we have had a policy of ``engagement'' with China now \nfor a number of years. I have, since I came to the Senate, generally \nsupported the concept as the best way--in my view--to effectuate change \nin China. But as a supporter of the concept, I now have to look at the \nfacts and ask what the payoff has been to us. Mr. President, this is \nwhat engagement has gotten us lately: a military buildup that seriously \nthreatens Taiwan, a Chinese veto last month in the UN of a proposed \npeacekeeping operation in the Balkans, an upswing in the harsh \nsuppression of internationally recognized human and political rights, a \ncontinuing refusal to address the question of Tibet, the undermining of \nUnited States efforts to deal with North Korea, a continuing effort to \npurchase or steal sensitive computer and nuclear technology from us, \nand a trade deficit that hit an all-time high this year.\n  At times, it has seemed to me that this Administration--one that \nironically accused its predecessor of ``coddling Beijing''--has been \nmore interested in the concept of engagement than in what results, if \nany, the application of that concept is achieving. Call it ``engagement \nfor engagement's sake.''\n  The most glaring, and disturbing, illustration of that tendency may \ninvolve the allegations of leaks of nuclear technology from our \nfacility at\n\n[[Page S2624]]\n\nLos Alamos to the Chinese which came to light this week. Regardless of \nwhen the leaks occurred, initial reports suggest to me that this \nAdministration knew of the problem but soft-peddled it so as to avoid \ncalling its China policy into question. A NSC spokesman recently \nrefuted that allegation by saying that the Administration has kept the \nrelevant committees of Congress closely informed of the problem over \nthe last 18 months, and of what was being done to address it. Mr. \nPresident, I have been Chairman of the East Asia Subcommittee for more \nthan four years now. No one from the Administration has ever mentioned \nit to me, or to my staff. Nor has anyone contacted the staff of the \nfull Foreign Relations Committee, or Chairman Helms' Asia advisors.\n  I believe it is time to take a step back--on both sides of the \naisle--and give our China policy a very long, hard, critical look. \nCongress needs to take the lead in examining whether, in the \nAdministration's eagerness to engage China, we have overlooked the fact \nthat our return--an improvement in China's domestic or international \nbehavior--has been negligible at best.\n  I am not advocating isolating China, or shutting off our contacts or \ndialog. I do not believe that we can bully or badger the Chinese into \naccepting our view of the world as the only one that is correct. \nInstead, I agree that we need to communicate with Beijing on a whole \nvariety of fronts, to engage in open and frank dialog, and that because \nof its size, its economy, and its geopolitical importance we cannot, \nand should not, ignore them. But we need to take a look at the level at \nwhich that interaction takes place, and what we are willing to give up \nin exchange for that relationship. And we also need to look at what we \nwant or expect in return.\n  Mr. President, our relationship with them should be grounded in \nreality, not in wishful thinking. And it should be a two-way street, \nnot a one-way to a dead-end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/15/senate-section/article/S2624-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, today, March 15th, is the Ides of March for \n1999. Like Caesar, Congress and the Administration are ignoring the one \nthing that has the potential to cripple our nation by crippling the \nbooming U.S. economy--I am speaking of the Federal Debt.\n  While the political debate addresses the budget surplus, the balanced \nbudget, and Social Security, it ignores the larger and lingering \nproblem of the federal debt, and the lurking interest on the federal \ndebt. Essentially, Mr. President, the forest cannot be seen for the \ntrees.\n  Well, Mr. President, I am one who far prefers to examine to see the \nwhole picture. If we continue to ignore the escalating debt and its \nenormous interest growing almost one billion dollars daily--just to pay \nthe interest, mind you--then we will continue to risk economic bedlam \ndown the road.\n  With these thoughts in mind, Mr. President, I begin where I left off \nFriday:\n  At the close of business, Friday, March 12, 1999, the federal debt \nstood at 5,653,581,734,840.04 (Five trillion, six hundred fifty-three \nbillion, five hundred eighty-one million, seven hundred thirty-four \nthousand, eight hundred forty dollars and four cents).\n  One year ago, March 12, 1998, the federal debt stood at \n$5,529,750,000,000 (Five trillion, five hundred twenty-nine billion, \nseven hundred fifty million).\n  Fifteen years ago, March 12, 1984, the federal debt stood at \n$1,464,623,000,000 (One trillion, four hundred sixty-four billion, six \nhundred twenty-three million).\n  Twenty-five years ago, March 12, 1974, the federal debt stood at \n$469,792,000,000 (Four hundred sixty-nine billion, seven hundred \nninety-two million) which reflects a debt increase of more than $5 \ntrillion--$5,183,789,734,840.04 (Five trillion, one hundred eighty-\nthree billion, seven hundred eighty-nine million, seven hundred thirty-\nfour thousand, eight hundred forty dollars and four cents) during the \npast 25 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/15/senate-section/article/S2624-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2624-S2625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I again urge prompt consideration and \npassage of Hate Crimes Prevention Act.'' I cosponsored this measure in \nthe last Congress and do so again this year. This bill would amend the \nfederal hate crimes statute to make it easier for federal law \nenforcement officials to investigate and prosecute cases of racial and \nreligious violence. It would also focus the attention and resources of \nthe federal government on the problem of hate crimes committed against \npeople because of their sexual preference, gender, or disability.\n  As the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, I look forward to \nworking on hearings next month on this important initiative. Violent \ncrime motivated by prejudice demands attention from all of us. It is \nnot a new problem, but recent incidents of hate crimes have shocked the \nAmerican conscience. The beating death of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming \nwas one of those crimes; the dragging death of James Byrd in Texas was \nanother. The recent murder of Billy Jack Gaither in Alabama appears to \nbe yet another. These are sensational crimes, the ones that focus \npublic attention. But there is a toll we are paying each year in other \nhate crimes that find less notoriety, but with no less suffering for \nthe victims and their families.\n  It remains painfully clear that we as a nation still have serious \nwork to do in protecting all Americans and ensuring equal rights for \nall our citizens. The answer to hate and bigotry must ultimately be \nfound in increased respect and tolerance. But strengthening our federal \nhate crimes legislation is a step in the right direction. Bigotry and \nhatred are corrosive elements in any society, but especially in a \ncountry as diverse and open as ours. We need to make clear that a \nbigoted attack on one or some of us diminishes each of us, and it \ndiminishes our nation. As a nation, we must say loudly and clearly that \nwe will defend ourselves against such violence.\n  All Americans have the right to live, travel and gather where they \nchoose. In the past we have responded as a nation to deter and to \npunish violent denials of civil rights. We have enacted federal laws to \nprotect the civil rights of all of our citizens for more than 100 \nyears. This continues that great and honorable tradition.\n  Several of us come to this issue with backgrounds in local law \nenforcement. We support local law enforcement and work for initiatives \nthat assist law enforcement. It is in that vein that I support the Hate \nCrimes Prevention Act, which has received strong bipartisan support \nfrom state and local law enforcement organizations across the country.\n  When the Committee takes up the issue of hate crimes next month, one \nof the questions that must be addressed is whether the bill as drafted \nis sufficiently respectful of state and local law enforcement \ninterests. I welcome such questions and believe that Congress should \nthink carefully before federalizing prohibitions that already exist at \nthe state level.\n  To my mind, there is nothing questionable about the notion that hate \ncrimes warrant federal attention. As evidenced by the national outrage \nat the Byrd, Shepard, and Gaither murders, hate crimes have a broader \nand more injurious impact on our national society than ordinary street \ncrimes. The 1991 murder in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New \nYork, of an Hasidic Jew, Yankel Rosenbaum, by a youth later tried \nfederally for violation of the hate crime law, showed that hate crimes \nmay lead to civil unrest and even riots. This heightens the federal \ninterest in such cases, warranting enhanced federal penalties, \nparticularly if the state declines the case or does not adequately \ninvestigate or prosecute it.\n  Beyond this, hate crimes may be committed by multiple offenders who \nbelong to hate groups that operate across state lines. Criminal \nactivity with substantial multi-state or international aspects raises \nfederal interests and warrants federal enforcement attention.\n  Current law already provides some measure of protection against \nexcessive federalization by requiring the Attorney General to certify \nall prosecutions under the hate crimes statute as being ``in the public \ninterest and necessary to secure substantial justice.'' We should be \nconfident that this provision is sufficient to ensure restraint at\n\n[[Page S2625]]\n\nthe federal level under the broader hate crimes legislation that we \nintroduce today. I look forward to examining that issue and considering \nways to guard against unwarranted federal intrusions under this \nlegislation. In the end, we should work on a bipartisan basis to ensure \nthat the Hate Crimes Prevention Act operates as intended, strengthening \nfederal jurisdiction over hate crimes as a back-up, but not a \nsubstitute, for state and local law enforcement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/15/senate-section/article/S2625-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 257, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 257) to state the policy of the United States \n     regarding the deployment of a missile defense system capable \n     of defending the territory of the United States against \n     limited ballistic missile attack.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, the National Missile Defense Act of \n1999 will make it the policy of the United States to deploy an \neffective missile defense system to defend against a limited ballistic \nmissile attack as soon as technologically possible. Today, American \ncitizens are completely vulnerable to ballistic missile attack.\n  Last year, when the Senate debated similar legislation, some \nsuggested that our bill was premature, that there was not yet any \nreason to suspect that we were confronted with a ballistic missile \nthreat. Now, however, there is no disagreement about the nature of the \nthreat. Consider these recent developments:\n  (1) In 1997, the Director of Central Intelligence said, ``Gaps and \nuncertainties preclude a good projection of when `rest of the world' \ncountries will deploy ICBMs.''\n  (2) Last year, both Pakistan and Iran successfully tested new medium-\nrange missiles, each based in some degree on a newly deployed North \nKorean missile, the No Dong.\n  (3) Also last year, in July, the bipartisan commission headed by the \nformer Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, reported its unanimous \nconclusions that foreign assistance to missile programs was a pervasive \nfact and that new ICBM threats to the United States might appear with \n``little or no warning.''\n  (4) A few weeks after the Rumsfeld report, North Korea launched the \nTaepo Dong 1, successfully demonstrating a multiple-staging capability, \nand using a solid-fuel third stage. According to the National \nIntelligence Officer for Strategic and Nuclear Systems, instead of \nhaving the expected 2,000-kilometer range, the Taepo Dong 1 can attack \ntargets up to 6,000 kilometers away, which puts Alaska and Hawaii \nwithin its range. The Taepo Dong 2 is expected to be able to reach the \nentire United States.\n  (5) The Secretary of Defense announced in January that the ballistic \nmissile threat to the United States was no longer in question. He said, \n``We have crossed that threshold.''\n  These recent events have answered the question about the threat. The \nquestion today is whether we intend to defend ourselves against that \nthreat. The National Missile Defense Act is the appropriate answer to \nthat question. It will send a clear message--to our adversaries, our \nallies, and our own citizens--that the United States will not leave \nitself vulnerable to weapons of mass destruction delivered by long-\nrange ballistic missiles.\n  Some may suggest instead a continuation of our old policy of mutual \nassured destruction. That was the policy of deterrence we used to deal \nwith the threat from the former Soviet Union. Former Defense Secretary \nWilliam Perry warned us about using this policy with a new class of \nrogue states that may be ``undeterrable'' in the sense that we \nunderstand that concept.\n  The fact is, we do not need to be at the mercy of a policy of mutual \nassured death or destruction. Assistant Secretary of Defense Edward \nWarner said in January,\n\n       I believe that we are unlikely to turn back to the point \n     where we will rely only on deterrence. I think over time we \n     will rely on a combination of deterrence by threat of \n     retaliation and this limited type of national missile \n     defense. . . . \n\n  The passage of this bill by the Senate will also send an important \nmessage to those who are working to develop our missile defenses. The \ndevelopment program has suffered from the lack of a commitment to \ndeploy the system. No other acquisition program has been handled by the \nDefense Department without an endpoint of deployment to aim for and \nreach.\n  The National Missile Defense Act will put an end to this uncertainty \nby telling the talented people building this system that it will be put \nin the field just as soon as they can get it ready. The NMD \ncontractor's program manager testified in the Armed Services Committee \nlast month that passage of this legislation would be a major motivation \nfor those building the system, saying, ``It would make them feel better \nabout the mission they are being asked to carry out than any one thing \nI can think of [and that] people are much more motivated by knowing \nthat the Government is truly behind this. . . .''\n  Finally, passage of this bill will tell America's citizens that its \nGovernment is meeting its first and most important constitutional \nduty--providing for the common defense. One legacy of the cold war may \nbe the absence of a defense against a massive and deliberate strategic \nattack from the former Soviet Union. But vulnerability to attack by \neveryone who desires to threaten America does not have to continue, and \nour Government would be irresponsible if it were to let it continue.\n  Madam President, there is no purpose in this bill other than to \nclearly establish, as a matter of policy, that the United States will \ndeploy, as soon as technologically possible, an effective national \nmissile defense system which is capable against limited threats. There \nare no ulterior motives, no hidden goals; there is only an intent to \ncorrect a defense policy that leaves us vulnerable to a serious and \ngrowing threat.\n  On the subject of missile defense, there are other things the Senate \ncould legislate, such as system architecture, schedule, costs, or ABM \nTreaty issues. These issues will have to be dealt with in due course. \nBut none of them has to be resolved in this bill, and we should not let \nthis legislation become an effort to answer all of the questions \nrelated to missile defense.\n  The question this bill addresses is not a simplistic one, as \nsuggested by an administration spokesman; it is more fundamental: Will \nwe, or will we not, commit in a meaningful way to defending ourselves \nagainst limited ballistic missile attack? Will we tell the world the \nUnited States will not be subject to blackmail by ballistic missile? \nWill we tell our citizens they will not be hostages to the demands of \nthose nations who seek to coerce the United States?\n  We have heard many statements made to reassure us about the \nwillingness of the United States to defend itself, but there is always \nan ``if'' attached--``if'' the threat appears, ``if'' we can afford it, \n``if'' other nations give us their permission. With all of these \n``ifs,'' these qualifiers, we should hardly be surprised that the world \ndoubts the United States is serious about defending itself from \nballistic missile attack. And no one should be surprised that, in the \nface of this doubt, the threat continues to grow.\n  The National Missile Defense Act of 1999 will put an end to those \ndoubts. It will tell the world that there is no question of ``if,'' and \nas soon as it is able, the United States will deploy a system to defend \nitself against limited ballistic missile attack. I urge all Senators to \nsupport this bill.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 69\n\n  (Purpose: To clarify that the deployment funding is subject to the \n            annual authorization and appropriation process)\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, to make it crystal clear that this \nlegislation is a statement of policy and not an effort to circumvent \nlegislative and appropriations committees of jurisdiction, I send an \namendment to the desk and ask that it be stated.\n\n[[Page S2626]]\n\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for himself, \n     Mr. Inouye, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Warner, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 69.\n       On page 2, line 11, insert before the period at the end the \n     following: ``with funding subject to the annual authorization \n     of appropriations and the annual appropriation of funds for \n     National Missile Defense''.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I will state for the Record that the \ncosponsors of the amendment are Senators Warner, Lieberman, and Inouye.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I share the goal of providing the \nAmerican people with effective protection against the emerging long-\nrange missile threat from rogue states.\n  I support developing an operationally effective, cost-effective \nlimited national missile defense, and making an effort to negotiate \nwith Russia, for a reasonable period of time, any appropriate \nmodifications to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that might be \nnecessary to permit deployment of a limited national missile defense \nsystem. That is why, Madam President, I support the Defense \nDepartment's National Missile Defense Deployment Readiness Program to \ndevelop a limited NMD system to protect the United States against such \na developing threat.\n  But that is not what this bill before us does.\n  This bill says we are going to deploy a national missile defense \nsystem ``as soon as technologically possible.'' No other factors are to \nbe considered. Don't consider if the system is operationally effective.\n  Those are important words to the military, ``operationally \neffective.'' But we are not supposed to consider that under this bill.\n  Don't consider if it is cost-effective. Don't consider whether it \nends the elimination of thousands of nuclear weapons in Russia under \nthe START process. Don't consider whether it increases the threat of \nthe proliferation of these terrible weapons to rogue states interested \nin getting them by any means possible. This bill says to heck with all \nof these considerations--we are going to deploy a national missile \ndefense system as soon as it is technologically possible, no matter \nwhether it is operationally effective, no matter if it increases the \nthreat of proliferation of nuclear weapons, no matter what it costs.\n  The fundamental question that we should ask ourselves is whether \npassing this bill will make us more secure or less secure.\n  That is truly the fundamental question that all of us must address.\n  I agree with the President's senior national security advisors that \nenacting this bill will make us less secure. It puts at risk our \ndecades-long efforts to reduce strategic offensive nuclear weapons in \nRussia and increases the likelihood that these weapons will proliferate \nto rogue states.\n\n\n                   concerns of the uniformed military\n\n  And where is the support of our uniformed military leaders for this \nbill, Madam President? The answer is, there isn't any. I have not heard \nany of our senior military leaders say they support this legislation. \nOur military leaders tell us that we are not ready yet to make a \ndecision to deploy a national missile defense system. They are worried \nthat if we make a hasty and head-long rush to deployment, we will be \nless able to deal with other very real--and unfortunately more likely--\nthreats to our security, including the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and their use by terrorists.\n\n  General Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified \nbefore the Armed Services Committee in January that the decision to \ndeploy a national missile defense system should be made only after \nconsidering a number of critical factors:\n\n       There are two aspects of the National Missile Defense \n     [issue] that we have to be concerned with. No. 1 is: is the \n     technology that allows us to deploy one that is an effective \n     system, and within the means of this country money-wise? \n     Second is the threat and whether or not the threat, when \n     measured against all the other threats that we face, \n     justifies the expenditure of that type of money for that \n     particular system at the time when the technology will allow \n     us to field it?\n       Right now it is not a matter of whether or not we should \n     field one because the technology has not reached the point \n     that we have the capability. It is a 12-year system that we \n     have been trying to do within 3 years. It is a high risk \n     program which has yet to prove that we will be able to make a \n     bullet hit the bullet. Certainly we need to continue to \n     pursue this technology, and DOD has that within their program \n     right now to pursue it. They are also putting money into the \n     program so that at the time that we have the technology, that \n     if in fact the threat justifies it, then we in fact could go \n     ahead with the fielding. If not, then we need to continue \n     with the R that will develop a system that could provide \n     missile defense.\n\n  Listen to just a few of the factors that General Shelton says that we \nought to be concerned with; that is, that the technology, one, is \neffective. Is it within the means of this country moneywise? Assess the \nthreat. Measure the threat against all the other threats that we face, \nand then see whether or not that justifies the expenditure of that type \nof money for that particular system at the time the technology will \nallow us to field it. And he points out that it is a high-risk program.\n  Lieutenant General Lester Lyles, the Director of the Ballistic \nMissile Defense Office, made similar points in January:\n\n       We've always stated within the National Missile Defense \n     program that a decision to deploy is based essentially on \n     four basic things. One, whether or not we have a valid \n     threat; two, whether or not we have the right amount of \n     dollars budgeted for deployment; three, whether the issue \n     with the treaty has been addressed; and four, are we \n     technically ready, is the technology ready in order to make \n     such a decision and to support the deployment.\n\n  That is the Director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Office who says \nfour basic things must be considered. This bill considers one. Is it \ntechnologically possible? The Director of the Missile Defense Office in \ncharge of this program, who surely is interested in securing this \nNation as much as anybody against an attack, says there are four \nfactors that need to be considered.\n  General Lyles says that these four factors are essential. At least we \nsurely should not limit General Lyles, General Shelton, and the \nSecretary of Defense to considering the sole criterion of \n``technologically possible,'' as this bill does.\n  The Joint Chiefs have expressed reservations about the commitment now \nto deploy a national missile defense system; they have raised these \nconcerns in many ways and at many times.\n  Last September, Army Chief of Staff General Dennis Reimer told the \nArmed Services Committee: ``I think we need to have something that's \npractical; has a degree of success. I think it also has to be balanced \nagainst other priorities.''\n  The question of other priorities--other threats--is a major concern \nof the Joint Chiefs. In an interview last month, General Shelton \npointed out: ``There are other serious threats out there in addition to \nthat posed by ballistic missiles. We know, for example, that there are \nadversaries with chemical and biological weapons that can attack the \nUnited States today. They could do it with a briefcase--by infiltrating \nour territory across our shores or through our airports.''\n  Does the bill we are debating today address any of these concerns \nraised by our senior military leaders? The answer is, Madam President, \nit does not. And that is one of the many reasons we do not see our \nsenior military leaders supporting this bill.\n  If this legislation would advance--even by one day--the development \nof an operationally effective and cost effective NMD system suitable \nfor deployment, then maybe our military leaders would support it. But \nthis bill doesn't do that.\n  It doesn't advance by one day the development of an operationally \neffective, cost-effective national missile defense system.\n  The bill simply says that we are going to deploy a national missile \ndefense system as soon as it is technologically possible, without \nregard to operational effectiveness, without regard to cost, without \nregard to the impact on nuclear weapons reduction in Russia, without \nregard to proliferation of nuclear weapons that could result. If this \nlegislation said that we should stop any further reductions of nuclear \nweapons on Russian soil, I do not think many Members of this Senate \nwould support it.\n\n[[Page S2627]]\n\n  That may not be what the language of this bill says, but that will be \nthe likely outcome of the policy in this bill. And here is why. At the \nHelsinki summit on March 21, 1997, President Clinton and President \nYeltsin issued a joint statement on the ABM Treaty, on the Anti-\nBallistic Missile Treaty, which began as follows:\n\n       President Clinton and President Yeltsin, expressing their \n     commitment to strengthening strategic stability and \n     international security, emphasizing the importance of further \n     reductions in strategic offensive arms, and recognizing the \n     fundamental significance of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty \n     for these objectives, as well as the necessity for effective \n     theater missile defense systems, consider it their common \n     task to preserve the ABM Treaty, prevent circumvention of it, \n     and enhance its viability.\n\n  That is a summit statement. That is not some casual comment to a \nreporter. That is a joint statement that was issued at the highest \nlevel by the two Presidents of the United States and Russia.\n  Defense Secretary Cohen has made it clear that both pursuing a \nlimited national missile defense program and maintaining the ABM Treaty \nare in our national interests and can both be accomplished. During his \npress conference in January, Secretary Cohen stated his view on the \nAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty as follows:\n\n       I believe it's in our interest to maintain that. I think we \n     need to modify it to allow for a national missile defense \n     program that I've outlined, but the ABM Treaty, I think, is \n     important to maintain the limitations on offensive missiles. \n     To the extent that there is no ABM Treaty, then certainly \n     Russia or other countries would feel free to develop as many \n     offensive weapons as they wanted, which would set in motion a \n     comparable dynamic to offset that with more missiles here.\n\n  The bill before us, S. 257, states that we will deploy a national \nmissile defense system as soon as it is technologically possible \ndespite our treaty commitment to Russia and the ABM Treaty and its \nimportance to strategic stability and future nuclear arms reductions in \nRussia. The bill before us will jeopardize our recently begun effort to \nreach a negotiated agreement with Russia on possible changes to the ABM \nTreaty that may be necessary to permit deployment of a limited national \nmissile defense system. We cannot, and we will not, give Russia or any \nother nation a veto over our national missile defense requirements or \nprograms.\n  I want to repeat that so it is not misunderstood. We cannot and we \nshould not give any nation, including Russia, a veto over our decision \nwhether or not to deploy a national missile defense. But making a \ndecision now to deploy a national missile defense system before we \nattempt to negotiate changes to the ABM Treaty, before the military and \ncivilian leadership of the Defense Department say that the Nation can \nresponsibly make such a decision, will likely reduce Russia's \nwillingness to continue reducing nuclear weapons under the START \nprocess, likely lead Russia to retain thousands of nuclear weapons that \nit would otherwise eliminate, and thereby dramatically increase the \nthreat of nuclear proliferation.\n\n  The Committee on Armed Services has previously recognized the \nimportance of a cooperative approach on missile defense and the ABM \nTreaty. Last year, the committee included a provision in the National \nDefense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1999 that encouraged the \nUnited States to work in a cooperative manner with Russia on issues of \nmissile defense. The conference report for that bill said the \nfollowing:\n\n       The conferees believe that a cooperative approach to \n     ballistic missile defense could lead to a mutually agreeable \n     evolution of the ABM Treaty, i.e., either modification or \n     replacement by a newer understanding or agreement that would \n     clear the way for the United States and Russia to deploy \n     national missile defenses each believes necessary for its \n     security. If implemented in a cooperative manner, the \n     conferees do not believe that such steps would undermine the \n     original intent of the ABM Treaty, which was to maintain \n     strategic stability and permit significant nuclear arms \n     reduction.\n\n  That was from the conference report on our 1999 defense authorization \nbill. And how different it is from the bill before us, when the \nconferees said that a cooperative approach, cooperative approach to \nballistic missile defense, could lead to a mutually agreeable evolution \nof the ABM Treaty.\n  None of that is in the bill before us. Instead, S. 257 is \ninconsistent with this understanding of the importance of a cooperative \napproach toward the ABM Treaty, to maintaining strategic stability and \npermitting large reductions in nuclear weapons because it threatens a \nunilateral breach of the ABM Treaty.\n  Passing this bill would make it much more difficult for the \nadministration to maintain the continuing benefits of the ABM Treaty \nand the cooperative approach to nuclear arms reduction under the START \nprocess. Russia's Foreign Minister Ivanov recently noted the following:\n\n       We believe further cuts in strategic offensive weapons can \n     be done only if there is a clear vision for preserving and \n     observing the ABM Treaty.\n\n  There is no such vision or attempted vision, no reference to \nmodification of the ABM Treaty here as being desired, to allow us to \ncooperatively move toward the deployment of national missile defense, \nnothing in the bill before us other than the statement, ``We're going \nto deploy this system as soon as technologically possible.''\n  And so by making the deployment decision now, S. 257, the bill before \nus, would be giving the Russians an ultimatum: We are going to deploy a \nnational missile defense system regardless of the ABM Treaty. That kind \nof ultimatum will make it more difficult to negotiate possible changes \nto the ABM Treaty before the scheduled deployment decision in June of \n2000.\n  Some are going to say that we move forward with NATO expansion in the \nface of Russian opposition. Why not move forward this legislation to \ncommit to deploy a national missile defense system in spite of Russia's \nobjection.\n  There is a critical difference. When we expanded NATO, we were not \ntaking an action that explicitly violated a bilateral treaty with \nRussia such as the ABM Treaty. In all likelihood, the unilateral \ndeployment of a national missile defense system that is truly an \neffective system to defend all 50 States would violate the ABM Treaty. \nHow different from the expansion of NATO. NATO was not a treaty with \nRussia that we were violating by expanding it.\n  The ABM Treaty is a treaty with Russia that we would almost certainly \nbe violating with deployment of a 50-State national missile defense.\n  There is another difference that has to go to the relationship \nbetween us and Russia. Russia may be economically extremely weak and \nmilitarily weak at the moment, but, nonetheless, Russia is still a \npower that has huge numbers in military capability and nuclear \ncapability and will someday surely be even more powerful than it is \nnow.\n  But what did we do before we expanded NATO? All of the NATO members, \nincluding the United States, worked with Russia to explain that NATO \nexpansion was not aimed at Russia. Indeed, the alliance entered into \nthe NATO-Russia Founding Act and, as a result of those efforts, Russia \nhas worked constructively with NATO on a number of issues. That is what \nwe are trying to do now with the ABM Treaty. We are trying to negotiate \nwith Russia right now to amend the ABM Treaty, to allow both the United \nStates and Russia to retain this important treaty and the nuclear arms \nreduction benefits that it has brought us while still moving forward \nwith the development and deployment of a limited missile defense. This \nbill will make that much more difficult.\n  The President's National Security Advisor, on February 3, 1999, wrote \nus that:\n\n       If S. 257 were presented to the President in its current \n     form, his senior national security advisors would recommend \n     that the bill be vetoed.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this \nletter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will just read a few other portions of Mr. Berger's \nletter, where he explains the basis for the position of the President's \nsenior national security advisors recommending that this bill be vetoed \nif it is passed:\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes S. 257 because it \n     suggests that our decision on deployment of this system \n     should be based solely on a determination that the system is\n\n[[Page S2628]]\n\n     ``technologically possible.'' This unacceptably narrow \n     definition would ignore other critical factors that the \n     Administration believes must be addressed when it considers \n     the deployment question in 2000, including those that must be \n     evaluated by the President as Commander-in-Chief.\n       We intend to base the deployment decision on an assessment \n     of the technology (based on an initial series of rigorous \n     flight-tests) and the proposed system's operational \n     effectiveness. In addition, the President and his senior \n     advisors will need to confirm whether the rogue state \n     ballistic missile threat to the United States has developed \n     as quickly as we now expect, as well as the cost to deploy.\n\n  Then Mr. Berger went on to say the following:\n\n       A decision regarding NMD deployment must also be addressed \n     within the context of the ABM Treaty and our objectives for \n     achieving future reductions in strategic offensive arms \n     through START II and III. The ABM Treaty remains a \n     cornerstone of strategic stability and Presidents Clinton and \n     Yeltsin agree that it is of fundamental significance to \n     achieving the elimination of thousands of strategic nuclear \n     arms under these treaties.\n\n  Madam President, senior Defense Department officials have stated \nrepeatedly that the Department of Defense is already developing a \nnational missile defense system as fast as is technically possible. \nDeputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre testified to the Armed Services \nCommittee on October 2, 1998, that the national missile defense \nprogram:\n\n       . . . is as close as we can get in the Department of \n     Defense to a Manhattan project. We are pushing this very \n     fast.\n\n  And General Joe Ralston, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, testified at the same hearing:\n\n       I know of no other program in the Department of Defense \n     that has had as many constraints removed in terms of \n     oversight and reviews just so that we can develop and deploy \n     it as quickly as possible.\n\n  As the Department of Defense has made clear on numerous occasions, \nadding more money will not accelerate the program because we are moving \nthis program, the development program, as quickly as is possible, and \nthere are no resource constraints on that development. In addition, on \nJanuary 20, Defense Secretary Cohen announced four steps, demonstrating \nthe commitment to develop an operationally effective national missile \ndefense as quickly as possible, achieving the option to deploy, not \nonly as quickly as possible, but also in a way consistent with \ncontinuing nuclear arms reductions.\n  First, Secretary Cohen announced the Defense Department would be \nbudgeting the funds--and they now have $6.6 billion--in the Future \nYears Defense Program for possible deployment of a limited national \nmissile defense system. This funding will permit deployment if the \ndecision is made to deploy. This would bring the total national missile \ndefense funding for 1999 through 2005 to $10.5 billion.\n  Second, Secretary Cohen affirmed that the administration expects that \nthe threat of ballistic missiles from rogue nations will continue to \ngrow and will pose a threat to the U.S. territory in the near future.\n  Third, Secretary Cohen announced that the administration is seeking \npossible changes to the ABM Treaty with Russia in the event that \ndeployment would require modification.\n  I was particularly glad to hear that because I had been urging the \nadministration to take this step myself for many, many months. \nSecretary Cohen also noted that if we cannot agree on changes to the \ntreaty, the United States can exercise its right to withdraw from the \ntreaty under the ``supreme national interest'' clause of the treaty, if \nnecessary for our national security.\n  Finally, Secretary Cohen announced that the earliest anticipated \ndeployment date for the national missile defense system was going to be \n2005 instead of 2003, because of concerns about the technology of the \nsystem and because certain critical tests will not occur until 2003.\n  Secretary Cohen's announcement clearly demonstrates the \nadministration's commitment to moving forward as quickly as possible \nwith the development of an operationally effective national missile \ndefense program. The Department of Defense policy, unlike the bill \nbefore us, permits consideration of a number of relevant factors, \nincluding operational effectiveness and cost, and permits us to pursue \nplanned negotiations on possible ABM Treaty modifications before making \na deployment decision next year, in the year 2000.\n  The national missile defense program is a high-risk program. It faces \nnumerous technical challenges. The integration of all the component \nparts into a system that can demonstrate its capability is still years \naway. The first integrated system test using a production interceptor \nis not scheduled to take place until the year 2003. Prior to that time, \ntests will rely on surrogate components for some of the most critical \npieces of hardware. But S. 257 will make the deployment commitment now, \nprior to any demonstration of the capability of the system, prior to \nany ability to evaluate whether it is operationally effective--key word \n``operationally''--and able to meet its system requirements. As the \nDefense Department and Joint Chiefs of Staff have pointed out, if we \nwere to commit to deployment of an NMD system ``as soon as \ntechnologically possible,'' we might be committing ourselves to \nbuilding a system that is not as effective as we would need or desire \nto counter the evolving threat.\n  In 1997, General John Shalikashvili, then-Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, testified to the committee that the earliest possible \nsystem may not provide the necessary capability:\n\n       If a decision is made to deploy an NMD system in the near \n     term, then the system fielded would provide a very limited \n     capability. If deploying a system in the near term can be \n     avoided, DOD can continue to enhance the technology base and \n     the commensurate capability of the NMD program system.\n\n  That is why General Shalikashvili stated at the same time that the \nNational Missile Defense Readiness Program of the administration is the \nprogram that ``optimizes the potential for an effective national \nmissile defense system.''\n  The normal Department of Defense acquisition process for major \nweapons systems requires a rigorous review of numerous technical \nperformance and cost considerations at each major decision point in the \ndevelopment or acquisition process. The Department of Defense has \nmandatory procedures for major defense acquisition programs that \nprovide that ``threat projections, system performance, unit production \ncost estimates, life cycle costs, cost performance tradeoffs, \nacquisition strategy, affordability constraints and risk management \nshall be major considerations at each milestone decision point.''\n  S. 257 would make a deployment decision now while ignoring all of \nthose critical requirements that have been applied, I think, with one \nexception where we paid a huge price, to the acquisition of every major \nsystem.\n  Secretary Cohen's announcement that the actual deployment date is \nexpected no sooner than 2005 is designed to reduce the risk of failure, \nbut in mandating deployment ``as soon as technologically possible,'' \nthe bill before us could undermine the Department's efforts to ensure \nthat the national missile defense system is operationally effective, \nemphasis on the ``operationally.''\n  For example, it may be ``technologically possible,'' with a 1 in 20 \nsuccess rate for a specific system to hit an incoming missile under \ncertain circumstances, but do we really want to make a deployment \ncommitment now to a national missile defense system under those \nconditions?\n  The Joint Chiefs of Staff and our warfighting commanders certainly do \nnot want a system that is not operationally effective. Gen. Howell \nEstes, the then-Commander in Chief of the North American Aerospace \nDefense Command, testified before the Armed Services Committee in March \nof 1997 that, from his perspective, ``it is vitally important that any \nballistic missile defense system we ultimately deploy must be \neffective.''\n  The bill before us also ignores the issue of cost-effectiveness. If a \nsystem does not provide us with a capability at a cost that can be \njustified in light of other high priority national security \nrequirements, then, it seems to me, we are missing an opportunity, \nindeed, a requirement, that a logical factor be considered as part of \nthe decision process, because what happens then is that we will be \nsaying, regardless of the cost, it makes no difference whether\n\n[[Page S2629]]\n\nthis is cost-effective or not, in light of whatever its capability is, \nregardless of whether it is operationally effective, if it is \ntechnologically possible, to heck with the cost, to heck with the \noperational effectiveness, and to heck with the impact on nuclear arms \nreductions.\n  This cost-effectiveness issue is one of the four crucial factors that \nSecretary Cohen and National Security Advisor Berger have said that the \nadministration will take into account in its deployment decision review \nin June of next year. We should not disregard cost-effectiveness \ncompletely, as this bill does.\n  Madam President, Secretary Cohen has testified that the \nadministration will make the decision in June of 2000 on whether to \ndeploy a limited national missile defense system, after taking into \naccount the threat, the operational effectiveness of the national \nmissile defense system, the cost-effectiveness of the system, and the \nimpact of deployment on nuclear arms reductions and arms control. This \nbill ignores these factors and reduces the issue to one--what is \ntechnologically possible and, when that is shown, then we are going to \ndeploy regardless of what those other factors indicate.\n  The bill would undermine the current effort of the administration to \nreach a negotiated agreement on any changes to the Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty that may be necessary to permit deployment of a limited \nnational missile defense system. Again, the summit statement of the two \nPresidents, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin, in March of 1997, \nunderscores the continuing importance of this treaty between us and the \nRussians for strategic stability and for further reductions in \nstrategic offensive nuclear weapons. It pledges both parties to \n``consider it their common task to preserve the ABM Treaty, prevent \ncircumvention of it, and enhance its viability.'' This bill would throw \nthat pledge into the wastepaper basket.\n  As Secretary Cohen has made clear, we will not negotiate any needed \nchanges to the ABM Treaty forever. There may come a time when we \ndetermine that we must withdraw from the treaty under the supreme \nnational interest clause. That would be a very serious step, but it is \nnot one that we need to take now or should take now before we have a \nsystem developed, before we have tried to modify the ABM Treaty to \nallow both the United States and Russia to move toward defenses against \nlimited ballistic missile threats.\n\n  Making a decision to deploy an NMD system before we even attempt to \nnegotiate changes to the ABM Treaty and before the Department of \nDefense says that the Nation can responsibly make such a decision will \nalmost surely reduce Russia's willingness to cooperate with us on \nreducing nuclear weapons on her soil under the START process, and \nlikely will lead Russia to retain thousands of nuclear warheads it \nwould otherwise eliminate, and would, thereby, dramatically increase \nthe threat of nuclear proliferation. The most likely threat that we \nface isn't an intercontinental ballistic missile strike with a return \naddress guaranteeing our massive destruction of the sender. The most \nlikely threat is a terrorist using weapons of mass destruction.\n  This bill increases that threat by significantly increasing the odds \nthat Russia will end the reduction of nuclear weapons, which the treaty \nthat this bill would violate has led to, and for no good reason, \nbecause this bill would not accelerate the national missile defense \ndevelopment by a single day. It increases the proliferation risk from \nthousands of nuclear weapons that would otherwise be eliminated through \nthe START process for no tangible benefit to this program.\n  This bill reduces our security by increasing the threat of \nproliferation of nuclear weapons to rogue states, and that is one of \nthe many reasons why this bill has no support among our military \nleaders.\n  Next week, the Prime Minister of Russia is coming to Washington for \nan important series of meetings. Senate adoption of this bill \neffectively says we are going to deploy a national missile defense \nsystem in violation of an important treaty that we have with Russia. \nThe message that we are sending to Russia with this bill is we do not \ncare about our treaty commitment. We do not care about cooperation on \nnuclear weapons reduction. I just wonder how the U.S. Senate would \nreact if, on the eve of an American President's visit to Moscow, the \nRussian Duma passed legislation that undermined one of the basic \nfoundations of U.S.-Russian relations. You can bet it would cause one \nheck of an uproar here, and I think Congress would be leading the \nchorus.\n  Those of us who say that this bill will contribute to our national \nsecurity have to answer the question: why don't our senior military and \nsenior civilian defense and security leaders in this administration \nsupport the bill? Where are the senior military leaders supporting this \nbill? Why don't General Shelton and the Joint Chiefs of Staff support \nthis bill? Why doesn't General Lyles, the Director of the Ballistic \nMissile Defense Office, support this bill? Why doesn't the Secretary of \nDefense Bill Cohen, who is a proponent of national missile defense now \nand when he served in the Senate, support this bill? They don't support \nthis bill because they know it will not contribute to our national \nsecurity.\n  Secretary Cohen's national missile defense plan has the strong \nsupport of General Shelton, has the support of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff. We should stick with it and vote against this bill.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                     Washington, February 3, 1999.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I understand the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee will consider tomorrow S. 257--The National Missile \n     Defense Act of 1999.\n       I want to underscore that the Administration shares with \n     Congress a commitment to ensuring the American people are \n     provided effective protection against the emerging long-range \n     missile threat from rogue states. That is why we have since \n     1996 diligently pursued a deployment readiness program to \n     develop a limited National Missile Defense (NMD) system \n     designed to protect against such threats. We have now \n     budgeted $10.5 billion between FY 1999-2005 for this program, \n     including the funds that would be necessary during this \n     period to deploy a limited NMD system.\n       Secretary Cohen has recently made clear that the \n     Administration will address the deployment decision in June \n     2000. The Administration strongly opposes S. 257 because it \n     suggests that our decision on deploying this system should be \n     based solely on a determination that the system is \n     ``technologically possible.'' This unacceptably narrow \n     definition would ignore other critical factors that the \n     Administration believes must be addressed when it considers \n     the deployment question in 2000, including those that must be \n     evaluated by the President as Commander-in-Chief.\n       We intend to base the deployment decision on an assessment \n     of the technology (based on an initial series of rigorous \n     flight-tests) and the proposed system's operational \n     effectiveness. In addition, the President and his senior \n     advisors will need to confirm whether the rogue states \n     ballistic missile threat to the United States has developed \n     as quickly as we now expect, as well as the cost to deploy.\n       A decision regarding NMD deployment must also be addressed \n     within the context of the ABM Treaty and our objectives for \n     achieving future reductions in strategic offensive arms \n     through START II and III. The ABM Treaty remains a \n     cornerstone of strategic stability, and Presidents Clinton \n     and Yeltsin agree that it is of fundamental significance to \n     achieving the elimination of thousands of strategic nuclear \n     arms under these treaties.\n       The Administration has made clear to Russia that deployment \n     of a limited NMD that required amendments to the ABM Treaty \n     would not be incompatible with the underlying purpose of the \n     ABM Treaty, i.e., to maintain strategic stability and enable \n     further reductions in strategic nuclear arms. The ABM Treaty \n     has been amended before, and we see no reason why we should \n     not be able to modify it again to permit deployment of an NMD \n     effective against rogue nation missile threats.\n       We could not and would not give Russia or any other nation \n     a veto over our NMD requirements. It is important to \n     recognize that our sovereign rights are fully protected by \n     the supreme national interests clause that is an integral \n     part of this Treaty. But neither should we issue ultimatums. \n     We are prepared to negotiate any necessary amendments in good \n     faith.\n       S. 257 suggests that neither the ABM Treaty nor our \n     objectives for START II and START III are factors in an NMD \n     deployment decision. This would clearly be interpreted by \n     Russia as evidence that we are not interested in working \n     towards a cooperative solution, one that is in both our \n     nations' security interests. I cannot think of a worse\n\n[[Page S2630]]\n\n     way to begin a negotiation on the ABM Treaty, nor one that \n     would put at greater risk the hard-won bipartisan gains of \n     START. Our goal would be to achieve success in negotiations \n     on the ABM Treaty while also securing the strategic arms \n     reductions available through START. That means we need to \n     recognize the address the interrelationship between these two \n     tracks.\n       The Administration hopes the Senate will work to modify S. \n     257 to reflect the priority that we believe must be attached \n     to the ABM and START objectives I have outlined above. But if \n     S. 257 were presented to the President in its current form, \n     his senior national security advisors would recommend that \n     the bill be vetoed.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Samuel R. Berger,\n\n                                        Assistant to the President\n                                    for National Security Affairs.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield to my friend.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nprivilege of the floor be granted to David Auerswald of Senator Biden's \nstaff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I, likewise, ask unanimous consent for \nthe Senator from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, that Bill Adkins, a legislative \nfellow on his staff, be granted the privilege of the floor during the \nSenate's consideration of S. 257.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, it is interesting to hear the comments \nof my good friend from Michigan. It reminds me, though, of someone who \nhas heard what this bill is about but really hasn't read the fine print \nyet. That is one reason why when the bill was reported I was hopeful \nthat we could start off by reading the bill. It is very short. Unlike \nthe legislation that was debated last year in the Senate, this bill has \nreally a very small operative section. It is so small and clear and \nconcise that I could almost recite it. I am sure I would leave out \nsomething. But the operative words are that it will be the policy upon \nthe passage of this legislation for the United States to deploy a \nmissile defense system--an effective missile defense system--that would \nbe capable of defending the United States against limited ballistic \nmissile attack as soon as technologically possible, and that that \nattack would include missiles that were launched either intentionally, \naccidentally or unauthorized. That is the bill that we are debating \nhere.\n  The suggestion that we are insisting on the passage of this bill that \nthe administration immediately deploy a system that may not be \nworkable, that may not be operationally effective, ignores the clear \nwording of the legislation. It describes the missile defense system \nthat we are directing be deployed as an effective ballistic missile \nsystem. So that is taken care of.\n  The amendment that has been submitted, which I hope will be adopted \nby the Senate on a voice vote--it certainly is not controversial or it \nshould not be controversial--says that the deployment would be subject \nto the authorization of appropriations and the appropriation of funds \nby the committees of jurisdiction of the Congress.\n  Like any other defense system or new acquisition of weapons system by \nthe Department of Defense, the deployment of a national missile defense \nsystem will be subject to the review of the committees with \njurisdiction over that subject in the Congress, and bills to authorize \nthe deployment and to fund the deployment will have to be passed and \nthey will have to be signed by the President.\n  The suggestion that the passage of this bill is the final step in the \nprocess misses the point completely. It is the first step in the \nprocess. We are trying to correct an outdated, outmoded, irrelevant \npolicy of wait and see--wait and see if a threat to the security \ninterests of the United States develops from ballistic missiles.\n\n  We have waited, and we have seen. We have seen the testing of a \nmultistage rocket by North Korea which they said was launched for the \npurpose of putting a satellite in orbit. Our analysts have been \nreported as saying that missile system used a solid fuel in its last \nstage. It would be capable of striking the territory of Hawaii and \nAlaska, and the last time I checked, they were part of the United \nStates.\n  At the present time, we have no defense against such a ballistic \nmissile attack from a rocket like that or from a missile. The design or \npossible uses are virtually the same.\n  We are also puzzled over the fact that the Senator seems to suggest \nin his statement that our relationship with Russia is going to be put \nat risk if we adopt this bill, the first step in a process to correct \nan outdated policy. This is our policy. This is our policy to defend \nthe security interests of the United States and American citizens who \nmight be at risk from a ballistic missile attack and weapons of mass \ndestruction that could be delivered by long-range, speedier missiles.\n  We have known for some time that our administration has been trying \nto negotiate a so-called demarcation agreement with Russia, \ndistinguishing between theater missile defense capability and other \nkinds of missile defense capabilities. It has been an excruciating \nprocess to watch, and we basically have watched in the Congress as the \nadministration has reached agreements or suggestions of agreements \nreduced to memoranda of understanding, not submitted to the Senate for \nratification as amendments to the ABM Treaty, but changes, nonetheless, \nin the definition of what is permissible and possible for us to do as a \nmatter of our own national security interests with respect to theater \ndefensive missiles. It limits the speed at which our interceptors can \nbe tested against targets.\n  The point of this is, this administration has gone to great lengths \nto try to manage the relationship with Russia so as not to ruffle any \nfeathers, not to upset Russia. Ask Mr. Primakov when he comes to the \nUnited States why hasn't his government, his government \nparliamentarians, ratified START II.\n  This is an effort to reach an agreement and an arrangement with \nRussia to reduce and limit strategic arms, missiles systems and nuclear \nweapons capabilities. We ratified that agreement 3 years ago in the \nSenate. Russia has not kept its part of the bargain by ratifying that \nagreement.\n  My point in saying this is that the relationship between the Russians \nand the United States is of great importance to us, to me, to this \nSenate. We cannot ignore the fact that Russia remains heavily armed \nwith nuclear weapons and missile capabilities like no other country in \nthe world, other than the United States. We do have concerns about that \nrelationship. We should take care to try to reach understandings with \nthe Russians on these matters, and I think we will continue to work \nclosely with our administration officials as they negotiate, discuss \nand try to reach understandings about what are our intentions.\n  We are not trying to upset the strategic balance between the United \nStates and Russia on missile capability or nuclear weapons or the like. \nWe are trying to change a policy about our relationship with other \nStates that are developing weapons that are capable of threatening our \nsecurity where we do not have a history of much success.\n  North Korea is an example. There are other nation states that are now \nengaged in developing missile capabilities where their missiles can go \nmuch farther and much faster than they have in the past, and we have to \ntake that into account. We would be derelict in our duty if we did not.\n  We think this administration is behind the curve on the policy \ndecisions with respect to ballistic missile defense, and it is putting \nthe security interests of the United States at risk. That is what we \nare trying to correct.\n  We are not trying to answer every question that can be raised or \nevery issue involved in ballistic missile defense in this one bill. It \njust cannot be done. But that is the test that my good friend is trying \nto measure this bill against. Does it answer every question? Does it \nanswer the question of whether or not a system will be adequately \ntested? No. But before the Congress will authorize the deployment of a \nsystem, it is bound to insist that there be some indication that it is \nworkable, that it is effective. That is why we use the phrase \n``effective ballistic missile defense system'' in this bill. We also \nwant to make sure it is ``technologically feasible or possible'' for us \nto\n\n[[Page S2631]]\n\nfield a system. And that is why we use that phrase in this bill.\n  What we are hoping to accomplish is to make this administration \nrecognize that there is a legitimate concern. The threat exists today \nto the security interests because of developments we have seen over the \nlast several years. Senators will remember that our subcommittee had 2 \nyears of hearings analyzing the problems of proliferation of missile \ntechnology, other technologies, computer technology, the proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction, the easy access that some countries \nhave to information here in the United States, over the Internet, at \nuniversities, at laboratories--we have heard a lot about that \nrecently--at laboratories here in the United States. You can get \ninformation from those sources, and you can use them then if you are a \ncountry that needs to upgrade its missile capability or nuclear weapons \ncapability. There are suggestions that that has been happening. Are we \nto just close our eyes to that? Are we to ignore that and say, ``Well, \nlet's wait and see what happens''?\n  We have been waiting, and we have seen what has happened in North \nKorea, in Iran, in China, in other countries as well. All of these \nfacts now convince us, the authors and the sponsors of this \nlegislation, that it is time to change our policy. That is what the \npassage of this bill will do. It will put an end to the outdated wait-\nand-see policy of the Clinton administration on this issue, and it will \nsay that as a matter of national policy we will deploy an effective \nballistic missile defense system as soon as technologically possible to \ndefend our country against limited ballistic missile attack--whether \nunintentional, unauthorized, or deliberate.\n  I suggest we keep in mind that we dedicated that proliferation report \nfrom our 2 years of hearings to the 28 U.S. servicemen who were killed \nin the gulf war with a Scud missile. That was several years ago. We \nhave 8 years of experience to build on from that event. But that got \nthe attention of the American people and the families of those soldiers \nwho were killed that the United States is vulnerable and its service \nmen and women and its citizens and its embassies all around the world \nare very vulnerable to missile attack and other attacks by weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  This bill does not solve all those problems but it states as a matter \nof national policy that we are not going to sit back and wait and see \nany longer. We are going to move, and as quickly as technologically \npossible, we are going to deploy a national missile defense system.\n  I am convinced that that is the right policy. We are not going to \ndisregard our obligations to work toward improving relationships with \nRussia or China or other countries. That is a part of our \nresponsibility, too. But neither are we going to sacrifice the security \nof our citizens to those relationships. We are, first of all, going to \nprotect the security interests of this country. That is the highest \npriority we have as Members of this body.\n\n  We have every reason to believe that there are clear and present \ndangers to the security of American citizens and our country. This is a \nstep, a first step, toward changing that policy and doing what has to \nbe done to fully protect our security interests.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). The Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, just a couple of additional brief points. \nFirst, there is one thing we do agree on, I hope unanimously, in this \nbody, which is that our highest priority is to defend the security \ninterests of the United States. I do not know of anybody in this body \nwho would disagree with that premise. The question is, Is our security \nadvanced or is it harmed by making a statement that we are going to \ndeploy a system that violates a treaty with Russia, without first \ntrying to at least negotiate a modification in that treaty so that we \ncan do so jointly without a unilateral breach?\n  The stakes here are huge. We should make no mistake about it. The \nstakes are that Russia has been reducing the number of nuclear weapons \non its soil. Indeed, we have been helping to dismantle those weapons so \nthat we are safer. And what they have told us is that the reason they \nhave done that is because they have a treaty with us which has \npermitted them to do that called the ABM Treaty, and that without that \ntreaty in place--indeed, without that treaty enhanced--those reductions \nare going to end.\n  We want fewer nuclear weapons on Russian soil. The fewer weapons they \nhave on their soil, the more secure we are. We have a treaty which has \npermitted a significant reduction of those weapons on Russian soil, and \nother states in the former Soviet Union. The fewer weapons they have, \nthe less the chance of proliferation.\n  I think most of us would agree that the greatest threat that we \nface--security threat that we face--is the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction. And the leakage of even one of those weapons from \nRussian soil to a rogue state or a terrorist organization would create \na greater threat to the security of this Nation than any Soviet threat \nwe face, because a rogue nation could use it against us, where the \nSoviets would have been committing suicide and would have cared about \ncommitting suicide if they started an attack.\n  The proliferation threat against us is real. We keep talking about it \nin this body. We keep saying the greatest emerging threat is the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Before we take any step \nwhich would lead Russia to stop reducing the number of nuclear weapons \non its soil, surely we ought to sit down and negotiate with Russia to \nsee if we cannot do two things: One, accomplish a national missile \ndefense here, assuming we can come up with one which is operationally \neffective; and, two, keep those reductions of nuclear weapons flowing. \nThose goals are not incompatible. We are seeking both of them right \nnow. We are negotiating with the Russians in terms of a modification of \nthe ABM Treaty, and we are developing national missile defense as \nquickly as is possible to develop.\n  There is no wait-and-see approach that has been going on here. The \nuniformed military have told us this is a high-risk development \nprogram. We are trying to do in a few years what usually takes us over \n10 to develop. So we are engaged as quickly as we can in what Deputy \nSecretary Hamre called the closest thing to a Manhattan project as \nexists in the Defense Department. We are trying to develop a national \nmissile defense.\n  I think most if not all Members of this body are in favor of that \ndevelopment.\n  The issue here in this bill is whether we commit to deploy that \nsystem before it is developed, before it is shown to be operationally \neffective, with no consideration to cost and without considering the \nneed to try, if possible, to negotiate a modification in a treaty with \nthe Russians which has allowed us and them to significantly reduce the \nnumber of nuclear weapons on their soil.\n  We can accomplish all those things, hopefully, but not if we perceive \nto tell the Russians, in advance of these negotiations being completed \nor at least proceeding, that we are pulling out of this treaty in order \nto deploy a system. There is not the slightest awareness in this \nresolution of the desirability of modifying the ABM Treaty with Russia \nso that we can continue to see reductions in nuclear weapons on their \nsoil.\n  For heaven's sake, aren't we more secure if they have fewer nuclear \nweapons on their soil and if the ones that are being reduced are \ndismantled, ``defanged,'' so they no longer threaten us? Shouldn't we \nask ourselves, Why is it the senior military leadership of this country \ndoes not support this bill, people who spend their lives and have \ndedicated their lives to the security of this Nation--our top military \nofficials--do not support this bill. Shouldn't we ask ourselves why?\n  There is no use invoking the question of Scud missiles. The defense \nagainst Scud missiles does not violate a treaty between us and Russia. \nThe Patriot antimissile system, which we continue to support I think \nunanimously in this body and continue to seek to improve it, is a \ndefense against theater ballistic missiles, the missiles such as the \nScud missile. There is no issue about that. I think everybody in this \nbody has for decades supported a theater missile defense system. That \nis not a violation of the ABM Treaty. A limited national missile \ndefense system probably will violate that treaty.\n\n[[Page S2632]]\n\n  Before we commit to do as this bill does, we should seek to modify a \ntreaty between us and Russia so that we can do two things at once: \nDeploy a system, assuming we can get one that is operationally \neffective against the rogue states, at the same time that we continue \nto obtain and achieve the reduction of nuclear missiles on Russian \nsoil. Those goals are compatible, they are both desirable, they are \nboth achievable. At least we hope they are both achievable. Surely we \nought to explore whether they are both achievable without committing \nourselves to a course of action which tells the Russians, on the eve of \nthe visit of Prime Minister Primakov we are going to do something, like \nit or not, whether it violates a treaty between us or not. I must again \nask this question: If the Russian Duma had taken an action 1 week \nbefore our President went to Moscow, which tore at the basic \nfundamental security relationship between us and Russia, what would our \nreaction be in this Senate?\n  What troubles me the most is it is so needless. We are not advancing \nby 1 day the development of a national missile defense system in this \nbill; not by a day. I think everybody in this body wants to develop a \nnational missile defense system as quickly as can be done. The money is \nin the budget to do so and has been there. The Congress has added some \nhundreds of millions dollars, by the way, over the years for broad \nsupport in order to make sure we do develop a national missile defense \nas quickly as we possibly can. The President's budget has the money in \nthere to deploy such a system--assuming we can develop it. We are not \nadvancing by 1 day the development of a national missile defense with \nthis bill.\n\n  What we are doing is jeopardizing the reductions of nuclear weapons \non Russian soil for no gain in terms of the development of national \nmissile defense. That commitment to deploy, which this bill represents, \ngains us nothing in terms of developing more speedily the system which \nwe all want to be developed, but jeopardizes the reduction of nuclear \nweapons on Russian soil which is so important to the security of this \nNation.\n  My good friend from Mississippi surely speaks for all of us when he \nsays that is our top priority as a Senate. I couldn't agree with the \nSenator more. There are very strong differences, however, as to whether \nor not that priority is achieved with this bill, which ignores one-half \nof a very important issue, which is the relationship between the \ndeployment of a national missile defense and the reduction of nuclear \nweapons on Russian soil and the proliferation problem that is increased \nwhen we act in a way that reduces the prospects of those continuing \nreductions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the National Missile Defense Act of 1999, in addition \nto being sort of a jawbreaker of a title, is exceedingly significant \nlegislation which takes the first step toward protecting the American \npeople from the growing threat of attack from ballistic missiles \ncarrying nuclear, chemical, or biological warheads.\n  Now, I am gladly a cosponsor because this establishes the \nunmistakable policy of the U.S. Government emphasizing the need to \ndefend the American people from missile attack. This policy is clear, \nit is unequivocal.\n  However, it is only the first step. Ultimately, the President must \nagree or be compelled to agree by an overwhelming congressional \noverride of his veto to begin immediately the building and deploying of \na national missile defense.\n  The construction of a meaningful defense will take time, obviously--\ntime that, given North Korea's recent missile test--we may not have. I \nam among those who have become increasingly frustrated as the Clinton \nadministration has squandered month after month, year after year, \ndithering and delaying, and otherwise reacting in ostrich-like fashion \nto the fast-approaching threat of missile attack by a rogue regime.\n  I have long regarded as beyond belief that the Clinton administration \nstill refuses to commit to the immediate deployment of a national \nmissile defense. I wonder, given the fact that North Korea now has a \nthree-stage intercontinental ballistic missile capable of dropping \nanthrax on U.S. cities in Alaska and perhaps Hawaii, how much \nindifference could so dictate such a perilous do-nothing attitude by \nthe President and his advisors. Nero fiddled as Rome burned--and the \ncrowd in charge on Pennsylvania Avenue may wake up one morning and \nrealize that they have been playing with the safety of the American \npeople and playing fast and loose.\n  I trust I am very clear on this point: it is an absolute, irrefutable \nfact that a hostile tyrant today possesses missiles capable of \nexterminating American cities.\n  Mr. President, North Korea is not our only concern. The Islamic \nfundamentalists in Iran continue their crash missile program. The \nRumsfeld Commission has warned that Iran has everything it needs to put \ntogether an ICBM within a few years. And because the Clinton \nadministration has fooled around in its do-nothing mode for so long, \nIran may very well be able to deploy an ICBM before America has a \nmissile defense to counter it, even if the United States breaks ground \non construction tomorrow morning.\n  Perhaps most troubling, however, is Communist China's nuclear missile \nprogram. China fields dozens of submarine-launched ballistic missiles, \nhundreds of warheads on heavy bombers, roughly 24 medium and long-range \nballistic missiles, and has several crash modernization initiatives in \nprogress this very moment.\n  Further, Red China has begun deploying several new types of ballistic \nmissiles. And most troubling, it is now clear that China has stolen \nAmerica's most sensitive nuclear secret--technical data for the W-88 \nwarhead. Theft of that warhead design, coupled with the multiple-\nsatellite dispenser that China developed working with United States \nsatellite companies, will enable the PRC to deploy MIRVed weapons far \nsooner than expected.\n  In other words, China is on the verge of tripling or quadrupling, the \nnumber of warheads pointed at our cities, and this, Mr. President, is \nthe same country that flexed its military might by firing missiles in \nthe Strait of Taiwan in an effort to intimidate a longstanding and \npeaceful ally of the United States. The People's Republic of China--\nthat is to say, Communist China--also is the same nation that engaged \nin a bit of nuclear blackmail by threatening a missile strike against \nLos Angeles.\n  Obviously, Mr. President, with these hostile threats emerging, it \nwould be assumed that the United States would already have deployed a \nsystem to protect the American people against this danger; and it would \nbe assumed that the Clinton administration surely is working, in \ncooperation with a bi-partisan majority in Congress, to make certain \nthat the United States will never be exposed to a missile attack by a \nterrorist regime.\n  Well, such assumptions have been woefully wrong. The do-nothing \nClinton administration has aggressively blocked every effort by \nCongress to implement a national missile defense system to protect the \nAmerican people. More than 3 years have already been lost in deploying \na missile defense system because of the President's veto, in December, \n1995, of critical legislation designed to protect the American people. \nThe President's people, in fact, are out there right now lobbying \nagainst the pending business of the Senate today, the National Missile \nDefense Act of 1999, of which I am a cosponsor.\n  Indeed, China, North Korea, and Iran can today hold the American \npeople hostage to missile attack because of the do-nothing attitude of \nthe President of the United States who, here in Washington, has \nconsistently refused to build, or even consider building, the strategic \nmissile defenses necessary to protect the American people from such an \nattack.\n  For years, liberals have tut-tutted that no long-range missile threat \nexisted to necessitate a missile defense. But now, in the wake of the \nRumsfeld Commission's report and North Korea's missile launch, even the \nmost zealous arms control advocates have been forced to admit that \ntheir critical lapse of judgment and foresight has put our nation at \nheightened risk.\n  Though these people now admit the existence of a serious threat, just \nthe\n\n[[Page S2633]]\n\nsame, they cannot bring themselves to agree to the deployment of a \nshield against missile attack. Why, Mr. President?\n  I'll tell you why. It is because of an incredible and dumb devotion \nto an antiquated arms control theory. Critics of the National Missile \nDefense Act of 1999 claim that Henny Penny's sky will fall because even \nthe most limited effort to defend the American people will scuttle \nstrategic nuclear reductions. One Senator, for example, declared in a \nrecent press release that, if S. 257 is passed, ``Russia would likely \nretain thousands of nuclear warheads it would otherwise eliminate under \nexisting and planned arms reduction treaties.''\n  Mr. President, if this is the last, best argument that can be \nmustered against deploying a national missile defense, opponents of the \npending National Missile Defense Act of 1999 had better go back to the \ndrawing board in search of logic. While they are at it, they \nshould ponder the fact that Russia has been threatening to block \nratification of START II since almost the day it was signed. For more \nthan 6 years, the United States has been waiting for the Russian \nGovernment to put this treaty into force; in the meantime the American \npeople have been subjected to a barrage of Russian threats and demands \nfor concessions on a bewildering array of issues, largely unrelated to \nthe treaty.\n\n  For the benefit of Senators, and the American people, I ask unanimous \nconsent that a document, cataloging just a few of these Russian demands \nregarding START II, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  An Ever-Growing Number of Russian Excuses For Not Ratifying Start II\n\n       The United States and Russia signed the START II Treaty on \n     January 3, 1993. The Senate provided its advice and consent \n     to ratification on January 26, 1996. Since then, Russia has \n     used START II ratification as a pretext to hold hostage an \n     ever-changing number of issues. As the Chairman of the Duma's \n     International Affairs Committee said on March 14, 1998, the \n     Duma contains people ``who are ready to use any pretext in \n     order to delay consideration of this issue.''\n       Threat Number 1: No START II unless the U.S. Gives in to \n     Russian demands on the CFE Treaty.\n       In 1994, Defense Minister Grachev declared that CFE treaty-\n     limits on Russia's conventional armed forces were \n     unacceptable and demanded their revision. No action on START \n     II would be possible, according to Grachev, until this issue \n     was resolved. So what did the Clinton Administration do? The \n     U.S. dutifully changed the treaty to meet the Russian \n     demands. We are, by the way, now changing it yet again to \n     meet more Russian demands.\n       Threat Number 2: No START II unless the U.S. ratifies the \n     treaty first.\n       In 1995, the Russian foreign minister, Mr. Primakov--now \n     the Prime Minister--demanded that the U.S. must first ratify \n     START II as a sign of good faith. We did that in January, \n     1996, and we are still waiting.\n       Threat Number 3: No START II if the U.S. Does not pay for \n     Russian implementation of START I.\n       Then the Russians complained that they could not afford to \n     meet their obligations under the START I agreement and \n     threatened not to move on START II unless the U.S. taxpayer \n     paid to dismantle all of Russia's obsolete missiles (to make \n     room for the deployment of far more modern systems). So what \n     did the Clinton Administration do/ It has shelled out \n     billions of dollars in Cooperative Threat Reduction funding \n     to meet this demand.\n       Threat Number 4: No START II unless the U.S. makes \n     concessions on the ABM Treaty.\n       As negotiations to clarify the ABM Treaty's demarcation \n     line between strategic and theater missile defenses dragged \n     on, the Russians insisted that tissue had to be resolved \n     before they could ratify START II. The United States agreed \n     to a series of concessions that resulted in a demarcation \n     agreement which did not clarify the distinction between \n     theater and strategic defenses but which did impose new \n     restrictions on theater missile defense systems.\n       Threat Number 5: No START II unless the U.S. makes more \n     foreign aid concessions.\n       In 1996 the Chairman of the Duma's Defense Committee, \n     Sergei Yushkov, tied START II ratification not just to the \n     ABM Treaty, but to ``the provision of adequate funds for the \n     maintenance of Russia's strategic nuclear arsenal.''\n       Threat Number 6: No START II unless the U.S. makes other \n     concessions.\n       In September, 1997, Ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, \n     who controls a sizeable bloc of Duma votes, declared that \n     START II should not be ratified until ``a favorable moment'' \n     and that Russia should hold out for more U.S. concessions. \n     According to Zhirinovsky, ``We have created a powerful \n     missile complex, and we must use it to get certain \n     advantages.''\n       Threat Number 7: No START II if the U.S. strikes against \n     Saddam Hussein.\n       In connection with the U.S. military build-up in the \n     Persian Gulf, the Deputy Speaker of the Duma declared that \n     START II would never be approved if the United States were to \n     use force against Iraq.\n       Threat Number 8: No START II unless the U.S. agrees to \n     allow continued Russian violation of the START Treaty.\n       Most recently, U.S. arms control negotiators were told that \n     their refusal to shelve U.S. concerns over repeated Russian \n     violations of the START Treaty would jeopardize START II \n     ratification.\n       Bottom line: The Russian threat over deployment of a U.S. \n     missile defense is just one in a long, tired litany of ever-\n     changing excuses for not ratifying START II.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. The bottom line, Mr. President, is that it is prima facie \nridiculous to still insist that the United States must forgo defending \nitself against missile attack in order to ensure that Russia ratifies \nSTART II. The United States has already paid a dozen ransom notes to \nRussia in an effort to secure START II's ratification--to no avail. \nThis latest price demanded by Russia is simply too high.\n  Now, I believe that START II may still be in the United States' \nnational security interests, but it is not of such overriding interest \nthat we must forgo the defense of the American people in order to \nsalvage START II. What will happen if START II is not ratified? \nStrategic forces are expensive to maintain, as both the United States \nand Russia have rediscovered. That is why the Clinton administration is \nseeking permission to fall below START I levels regardless of whether \nthe Russians honor their START II obligations--because it wants the \nmoney that would be spent on strategic nuclear forces to be used for \nother, neglected requirements like readiness.\n  And what of Russia, Mr. President? The truth is that Russia's \nstrategic force levels are going to plummet far past the levels \nmandated by START II regardless of whether there is any agreement in \nforce. The strategic missiles Russia (then the Soviet Union) deployed \nin the 1980s are reaching the end of their useful life, and cannot be \nreplaced. Russia has neither the money nor a reason, to replace them.\n  In fact, last year the Russian Minister of Defense told Russia's \nSecurity Council that even the new SS-27 Topol ICBM currently being \ndeployed, Russia will be unable to field more than 1,500 warheads by \nthe year 2010, which, at the rate things are going, might be about the \ntime the Duma finally gets around to ratifying START II.\n  The truth is that arms control agreements are not controlling force \nlevels. Fiscal and strategic realities are. Why is Russia allowing its \nforces to fall to historically low levels? I will tell you. For the \nsame reason as is the United States. We no longer live in a cold war \nworld in which huge nuclear arsenals are our top spending priority. The \nnotion that limited ballistic missile defenses will somehow set off a \nnew arms race--or forestall further reductions--is absurd.\n  Mr. President, the truth of the matter is that the arguments about \nSTART II are really a cover for those who continue to worship the arms \ncontrol doctrine of mutually-assured destruction. No amount of policy \nsophistry or arms control rhetoric by the Clinton administration can \nalter the fact that the United States is vulnerable to nuclear-tipped \nmissiles fielded by China, or any one else. Rectifying this dangerous \ndeficiency requires leadership and action. It is an all the more \npressing issue because the current course charted by the administration \nfails to recognize the inherent danger in China's pursuit of an \nadvanced nuclear arsenal, based--as we have learned in recent days--\naround the W-88 warhead.\n  Mr. President, any further delay in the development by the United \nStates of a flexible, cost-effective national missile defense is \nunconscionable. I am honored to cosponsor the National Missile Defense \nAct of 1999 and I urge Senators to support this legislation to make \ncertain that the United States Government will finally adopt a policy \nto protect the American people from attack by ballistic missiles.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to support S. 257, the National Missile \nDefense Act\n\n[[Page S2634]]\n\nof 1999, and, in doing so, I rise to support development and deployment \nof a limited national missile defense.\n  Colleagues have said that this debate has begun today, and I am sure \neach Member of the Senate believes, because we have no greater \nresponsibility under the Constitution than to provide for the common \ndefense of our Nation. That is one of the fundamental reasons people \nform governments, to provide for their common defense. It is a duty we \nmust fulfill with intellectual honesty and with thoughtful attention to \nthe world in which we reside.\n  Let us look honestly at the world today. The cold war is over, \nthankfully. Democracy triumphed over communism. The bipolar strategic \ntension of the world--two armed camps living in a strange balance of \nterror where each threatened to destroy the other if the first acted--\nis over, thankfully over. And in that sense we enjoy today the benefits \nof that victory. Everybody around the globe--people here in the United \nStates, those in Russia, and certainly those who lived under the \ntyranny of the Soviet Union, three peoples of which so proudly and \njoyously joined NATO just this past weekend. Though the existential \nthreats we faced are not there, the threats to our very existence are \nnot there, as the operating tempo of our military makes clear, we face \na remarkable series of threats to our security around the world. And we \nface something like threats we have faced before, but with an intensity \nand a breadth that are unparalleled; and that is the potential of \nthreats to our homeland, to the United States of America, shielded as \nwe have been by geography, by two oceans. Although we have worried in \nthe past and we have been at war and conflict about threats to our \nhomeland, we have never faced them, I fear, to the same extent we will \nin the years ahead. And this is a reflection not only of the dispersion \nof power, the breakup of the two armed camps that dominated and defined \nthe cold war, it is a reflection of what history tells us, which is \nthat whenever there are developments in the nonmilitary world, in the \nindustrial, or, in our time, the technological world, they work their \nway into the military.\n  Today, even as nationalism rears its head with a new intensity in \nplaces like the Balkans, national boundaries in the conventional sense \nare seamless and less dominant. We communicate with each other through \ntelevision and now, dramatically, in two-way communication over the \nInternet, jumping over traditional national boundaries. We have a \ngrowing number of assets, defense and civilian related, which exist in \nspace that affect our lives, civilian and military, in very, very \nfundamental ways. We have increasing capacity through technology to \ndeliver weapons of mass destruction against other peoples and to fear \nand face the potential of their delivery against us.\n  So it is not surprising that, within the community of those who worry \nabout our national security, and particularly, of course, within the \nDepartment of Defense, there is new concern, new thinking, talk of new \norganization, to deal with homeland defense, the defense of the United \nStates of America; that the very technology that has enabled us to \nreach across national boundaries, to have international commerce at \nenormous volume and worth with remarkable speed, also begins to subject \nus in our homes, businesses, neighborhoods, communities, and States to \nattack.\n\n  I don't mean to suggest a panic, but, to be intellectually honest and \nthoughtful about it, the fact is that we have in our time already seen \nourselves subject to terrorist attack here in our homeland, some of \nwhich has been inspired from outside, that we know we face a risk of \nattack to our information systems, which dominate and on which we \ndepend for so much in the lives that we lead so well today.\n  Another element of that new vulnerability that our homeland faces is \nfrom missile attack. We faced it during the cold war when the Soviet \nUnion and the United States were two armed camps with intercontinental \nballistic missiles aimed at each other, in which we reached a kind of \nbizarre agreement, ``rationality'' in the midst of irrationality, that \nneither would push the button for fear of what damage that would do to \nthe one who pushed the button. Today, we are facing a threat of a \ndifferent order. Though it is limited, it is coming from people who \nwill not, we fear, bind to the same rationale of a system of mutual \nassured destruction.\n  That is what motivates this bill. I see it as a response not just to \nthe proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass \ndestruction, but as part of a broader, growing concern that we in the \nSenate and the American people will have to face to raise our defenses \nonce again here at home.\n  In the very near future--perhaps within a few months--erratic \nleaders, tyrants of rogue regimes, will control ballistic missiles \npossibly armed with weapons of mass destruction that can reach our \nnational territory. One or more rogue states may have the technology to \ndo so today. Equally unsettling is the fact that criminal or insurgent \nelements from countries in turmoil could also have access to those \nweapons.\n\n  So the threat is real and it is current, and everything we know about \nthe rapid dissemination of technological information and the commercial \nproliferation of ballistic missile technology and weapons of mass \ndestruction tells us that the threat will get worse faster than we had \npreviously thought.\n  Until this past year, most observers, intelligent observers, \nthoughtful observers, believed that the emergence of such a threat was \nway over the horizon, a problem for the future. A national intelligence \nestimate written in 1993 and revised in 1995 concluded that no country \nother than the declared nuclear powers would develop or otherwise \nacquire ballistic missiles that could reach the 48 contiguous United \nStates within the next 10 to 15 years. But in July of 1998, a \ncommission of distinguished experts, chaired by former Secretary of \nDefense Rumsfeld, concluded that this earlier estimate was far too \noptimistic.\n  The Rumsfeld Commission report found that North Korea, Iran, and Iraq \nwere engaged in concerted efforts to build or acquire ballistic \nmissiles. The panel also found that North Korea and Iran could use \nthese missiles to inflict major damage on the United States within 5 \nyears of a decision to do so. Iraq, a rogue state that has constantly \nchallenged its neighbors, the United States, and the international \ncommunity militarily for two decades now, so the Rumsfeld Commission \nsaid, could inflict major damage on the United States within 10 years. \nThe Commission warned that the ability of our intelligence community to \nprovide timely and accurate warning of attempts to produce ballistic \nmissiles was eroding.\n  So a problem is growing, with the capacity of the intelligence \ncommunity to warn us of its forward movement eroded. And then the \nRumsfeld Commission predicted prophetically, as it turned out, that \nIran would soon deploy a Shahab-3 missile on the way to developing \nintercontinental ballistic missile capability and that North Korea \nwould soon have a missile capable of hitting Alaska or Hawaii.\n  Well, unfortunately, the Rumsfeld Commission was right on target. \nWithin a month of its report, Iran did flight test the Shahab-3 \nmissile, and 1 month later North Korea launched its Taepo Dong \nmissiles. We had long known North Korea had strong missile technology. \nAnalysts were broadly surprised that the Taepo Dong was a three-stage \nmissile with enough range to hit parts of the United States of America.\n  The Iranian and North Korean missile tests validated two of the \nRumsfeld Commission's findings. First, that rogue states are in \npossession of missiles that threaten American territory; and, second, \nthat these states have developed this capability far more rapidly than \nwe had assumed possible and with very little warning.\n  Recent events in places such as North Korea and Iran have contributed \nto a revision and updated a speeding up of the administration's \napproach to missile defense, and I appreciate that acceleration very \nmuch. Just a few months ago, in January of this year, Secretary of \nDefense Cohen announced that the administration would seek $6.6 billion \nover 5 years to field a limited national missile defense.\n  Secretary Cohen explained:\n\n       We are affirming that there is a threat and the threat is \n     growing, and that it will pose a danger not only to our \n     troops overseas but also to Americans here at home.\n\n[[Page S2635]]\n\n       The Taepo Dong I test was another strong indicator that the \n     United States will, in fact, face a rogue nation missile \n     threat to our homeland against which we will have to defend \n     the American people.\n\n  The bill before us today, S. 257, is designed to respond to that very \nreal threat that rogue states and organizations with missile technology \npose to our Nation. S. 257 states what I think we all believe, which is \nthat we should take action to protect ourselves against this threat. We \nwould be derelict in our duty if we did not. I view S. 257 as a \nstatement of policy, a statement of policy that it is the intention of \nthe United States of America, the administration, executive branch, \nMembers of Congress, shoulder to shoulder together, to develop a \ndefense to this threat which could be a cataclysmic threat that we all \nseem to agree we are now facing.\n  So I must admit that I am disappointed by the disagreement that still \nexists over this measure. The statement of policy that came from the \nClinton administration in January of this year seems to me to be \nreflected in and consistent with the simple statement embodied in S. \n257. And yet, there is opposition. I hope that the debate and \ndiscussion that we are having today and the days ahead will lead us to \nfind a way to express what I believe we all feel: The threat is real \nand we have to do something about it as quickly as possible.\n  As I understand the concerns of the administration and my colleagues \nin the Senate who oppose S. 257, they are as follows: They argue that \nthis bill considers only technological feasibility in making a \ncommitment now to deploy a national missile defense without taking into \naccount the actual threat, the operation, the effectiveness of the \nsystem against a threat, the affordability of the system, including the \nbalance of other critical defense needs, and the impact of the policy \nstated in this bill on nuclear weapons reductions and arms control \nefforts particularly with Russia.\n  I know that some are also concerned that S. 257 contradicts the \nadministration's policy of not deciding on deployment until June of \n2000 after a series of tests. Some also fear that this bill will make \nit less likely that the Russians would continue arms control \nnegotiations. Some still feel that since the administration has \nbudgeted $6.6 billion for national missile defense development and \ndeployment, S. 257 is not necessary and will not advance the deployment \ndeadline, as the effort is technology constrained, not policy or \nresource constrained. And there are others who say that this response \ndoes not help defend against the most likely methods of delivery such \nas maritime vessels.\n  Of course, the most likely methods of delivery, if they are in fact \nthe most likely methods of delivery such as maritime vessels, if I may \nstart with the last argument, should only lead us to want to accelerate \nthe development of a limited defense because delivery from the water, \nfrom the oceans may speed up the date by which the United States will \nbe vulnerable to this attack.\n  Let me try to respond to some of the arguments that have been made. \nFirst, while it is true that S. 257 does state that the United States \nshould deploy a limited national missile defense when technologically \nfeasible, that is a broad statement of policy which does not preclude \nconsideration of other important factors. It simply says--and I hope \nwhen I join with Senator Cochran, Senator Inouye and others, that it \nwould be a broad enough statement of policy--that it would lead a broad \nbipartisan majority to feel comfortable coming to its support.\n  The fact is that we will consider questions of affordability and \nother questions each year, as we in Congress carry out our \nresponsibility to authorize and appropriate with regard to a limited \nnational missile defense and other defense programs, to decide how to \nproceed and how much money to devote to the program. To me, that is \nimplicit in the bill, because it is inherent in the legislative \nprocess. A policy statement saying that it is our intent to deploy a \nnational missile defense when technologically feasible doesn't mean it \nwill happen automatically or overnight, it doesn't mean that Congress \nwill be precluded from participation in the program and that the \nBallistic Missile Defense Office will essentially be given a blank \ncheck. Quite the contrary. Each year we will authorize--which this bill \ndoes not do; it is a policy statement--and we will appropriate, which \nthis bill most certainly does not do.\n  Though I think that is clear from the wording in S. 257, I am very \npleased to be a cosponsor of the amendment which has been laid down by \nthe Senator from Mississippi which makes clear that this policy that we \nwould declare in S. 257 is subject to the annual authorization and \nappropriations process.\n  As to the question of the administration's policy or plan to make a \njudgment about deployment in June of 2000 based on some tests that will \nbe done by then--four tests, I believe, that would be done by then--to \nme the bill before us neither negates nor endorses that policy. In \nfact, under the bill before us, it is possible that the decision to \ndeploy would not be made until well after June of 2000, because the \nthreshold of technological feasibility, technological possibility, \nwould not have been reached. But the fact that we are not ready now to \ndeploy a system surely cannot mean that we should not now declare our \npolicy to deploy such a system, to get ready to defend our territory \nand our people as soon as possible. In fact, we should declare that \npolicy unequivocally, and I think this bill, S. 257, gives us the \nopportunity to do that.\n  Let me now talk of the concerns about the impact that passage of this \nbill will have on our relations with Russia and particularly on arms \ncontrol negotiations that are going on with Russia. I have long \nsupported those negotiations, they are so clearly and palpably in our \nnational security interests. They have run into obstacles along the \nway--START agreements ran into political difficulties in the Russian \nDuma. But of course we are part of a process in which we are trying to \nmove those forward in our national security interests.\n  But I must say, I fail to see how passage of this measure, in which \nwe in the U.S. Senate would be declaring our intention to develop a \nlimited national missile defense, should be stopped by our concern \nabout what I believe is a misunderstanding or misapprehension, if in \nfact it exists, in Russia, about our intentions here. In all the debate \nand discussion I have heard about the development of a national missile \ndefense, a limited national missile defense, I have not heard anybody--\ncertainly I have not, Senator Cochran has not, Senator Inouye has not--\nsuggest that the country we are developing this defense against is \nRussia.\n  The countries we are developing this defense against are rogue \nnations, subnational groups that may attempt to inflict harm, \nintimidate us, leverage us to extract compromises on our national \nsecurity from our leadership--not Russia. In fact, I believe the \nadministration has spoken these words to the Russians.\n\n  We have common enemies here in these rogue states. This system is not \nbeing developed against the nations of the former Soviet Union or \nRussia. This is not star wars. Star wars was aimed at--speaking \nsimplistically, if I may--putting a security umbrella over the United \nStates to protect us from a massive ICBM attack from the Soviet Union. \nThis is a highly limited system aimed at trying to preserve a measure \nof security for our people against limited missile attack from rogue \nnations.\n  So I am puzzled and troubled about why we should not simply state our \npolicy to develop a defense of our homeland against rogue nations \nbecause there may be some in Russia who misunderstand our intention. We \nunderstand that doing so will compromise the ABM Treaty, negotiated in \na very different context for very different reasons more than a quarter \nof a century ago at the height of the cold war. That is why top level \nofficials of our administration have already begun to speak with the \nRussians about our intention. It is clearly evident from the policy \nthat Secretary Cohen articulated in January, clearly evident from the \nadditional billions of dollars that President Clinton has put into the \ndefense budget in the coming years to accelerate our development of a \nnational missile defense. But I, for one, would feel irresponsible--put \nit another way. I would feel we had not worked hard enough to reassure \nthe Russians that this national missile defense that we state in\n\n[[Page S2636]]\n\nthis measure that we intend to build is not aimed at them. It is aimed \nat common enemies that they and we have.\n  The fact is, in some measure the content of S. 257 is an honest \nexpression to the leadership in Russia, with whom we are working on so \nmany different matters, that this has now become a matter of American \nnational policy--self defense. And, as much as we value good relations \nwith Russia, as much as we adhere to our treaty obligations, we are \nsaying to them here that we have made a judgment in our own national \nself-interest and self-defense that we must develop a limited national \nmissile defense and therefore we must begin, as we have, to renegotiate \nthe ABM Treaty. But to not go ahead with this policy statement for fear \nof the way it will be misread in Russia seems to me to be an \nunderestimation of both our relationship and of our ability to speak \ntruth to the Russians and of their ability to understand it.\n  So, mindful as I am, respectful as I am of the importance of ongoing \narms control negotiations with the Russians, I think we do not serve \nour national interests if we yield to that misapprehension when we know \nthat this system is not being developed to defend against hostile \naction by them.\n  Mr. President, we need the national missile defense. We face a real \nand growing threat that cannot be countered by our conventional forces \nand which will not be deterred by the threat of retaliation. Remember, \nRussia, on whom we are focused in our judgment on this measure--and \nsome are focused to the extent that they will oppose it because of \nconcerns in Russia--we and the Russian-dominated Soviet Union reached \nthis meeting of minds during a cold war that we were each rational \nenough to be deterred by the threat of massive retaliation. Deterrence, \nafter all, requires rationality. By definition, accidental, \nunauthorized, or rogue acts are not the acts of rational leaders and \ncannot be reliably deterred.\n  Thus, we have a choice: Either we will endure the possibility of \nlimited missile attack on our country with weapons of mass destruction, \nor we will commit ourselves, with all that we have in us, and will \nstate so honestly in this measure, that we are going to do everything \nwe can to defend against such an attack.\n  I don't agree that this measure is not needed. It is needed. It is a \nclarion statement of policy about a critical national security \nvulnerability at an important transitional period in our national \nhistory. The fact is, its very existence has already acted as a \ncatalyst in moving this debate forward, the debate about the threat. \nAfter all, congressional concern about this led to the Rumsfeld \nCommission, which led to the report, which predicted the North Korean-\nIranian action, which now has led to a coming closer together between \ncongressional opinion and administration policy.\n  Mr. President, both sides in this debate are, after all is said and \ndone, separated by very little. A critical national security decision \nsuch as this should not be partisan. The amendment that Senator Cochran \nand I and others, I believe Senators Warner and Inouye, put down, which \nmakes clear what was implicit before, that S. 257 will naturally be \nsubjected to the annual authorization and appropriations process, makes \nclear that Congress each year will consider the affordability, the \nextent of the threat, the impact funding of this system has on other \ndefense needs, and even the impact of the level of funding on our \nrelations with Russia and other arms control negotiations.\n  I think that defending against limited missile attacks is something \nthat all of us, both parties, 100 strong, clearly want to do. I take it \nthat the disagreement is how to do it and what we should express, if \nanything, in a statement of policy. This is such an important matter \nand at such a critical moment that I hope in this debate we will listen \nto each other, that we will reason together, and that we will \nultimately come up with a proposal here that a broad bipartisan \nmajority can support.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nprivilege of the floor be extended to John Rood and Gordon Behr, who \nare legislative fellows from the staff of Senator John Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to support \nthe pending legislation. I am listed as a cosponsor, and I believe that \nit is an important statement of U.S. policy which we ought to adopt. \nThis is one of the most direct bills that I have seen in my tenure in \nthe Senate, providing:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to deploy, as soon as \n     is technologically possible, an effective national missile \n     defense system, capable of defending the territory of the \n     United States against limited ballistic missile attack, \n     whether accidental, unauthorized or deliberate.\n\n  The most basic purpose of government is to protect its citizenry. The \nmost basic purpose of the Government of the United States of America is \nto protect the people of the United States from foreign and domestic \ndangers. We have focused a great deal of attention on the threat of \nweapons of mass destruction, and the top of the list involves the issue \nof ballistic missile attack.\n  Beyond ballistic missile attack, we know that there are many other \nconcerns of biological warfare and chemical warfare. Right now a \ncommission is working to try to streamline the Federal Government to \ntry to make some organizational sense, organizational improvements out \nof the 96 separate agencies which now deal with weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  During my tenure as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, \nworking collaboratively at that time with CIA Director John Deutch, a \nprovision was inserted in the Intelligence Authorization bill in 1996 \nto provide a commission to take a look at the 96 separate agencies \ndealing with weapons of mass destruction. We find that the Department \nof Health and Human Services is involved in this venture, as is the \nDepartment of Defense, as is the Department of Justice. Tomorrow we are \nholding a hearing on some aspects of the domestic problem.\n  Internationally, the strategic defense initiative has been a hotly \ncontested subject for debate for more than a decade, going into the \nearly administration of President Reagan when he articulated the idea \nof a strategic defense initiative, popularly known as Star Wars. At \nthat time many people debunked the idea that there could be a shield to \nprotect the United States from a ballistic missile attack, and we have \nrelied upon the theory of mutual assured destruction--accurately \nlabeled, in shorthand, MAD, for mutual assured destruction--with our \nbasic defense posture being that the Soviet Union, our principal \nadversary, would not fire ballistic missiles at the United States \nbecause of fear of retaliation, so that the balance of power was \nmaintained.\n  More than a decade ago, we had some very lively debates on the Senate \nfloor as to whether the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty should have a \nnarrow or a broad interpretation, going back to the origin of the \ntreaty, the history. The debate then was whether we might be able to \ndeploy some sort of strategic defense initiative under a broad \ninterpretation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. That treaty, \nentered into in 1972, has been a subject of very extended debate on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate and beyond. It may well be that with the \nenactment of this policy, there will have to be some negotiations with \nRussia, with other parties to the ABM Treaty. It was entered into by \nthe Soviet Union, which no longer exists. There have been many \nmodifications of the policy with the former Soviet Union, with Russia, \nwhere the United States, under the Nunn-Lugar program, has appropriated \nvery substantial sums of money to acquire and destroy Russian missiles, \nmissiles formerly housed by the U.S.S.R. I do believe that with the \nchanging relationship between the United States and the former Soviet \nUnion, and with the expansion of NATO, a move that many thought Russia \nwould never tolerate but now has become acclimated to,\n\n[[Page S2637]]\n\nthere are signs of a maturation process, a changing relationship \nbetween the United States and Russia.\n  I do believe that it is important to have talks with Russia about the \nAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, but I do think that the treaty is \nsubject to modification. There are provisions for revocation of the \ntreaty on notice by the United States, but we now face a very different \nkind of a threat. We now face a threat, perhaps, from North Korea, \nperhaps soon from rogue nations like Iran or Iraq. It is none too soon \nto look toward the deployment of a national missile defense system \nwhich is intended to deal with the threat posed by the rogue nations.\n  The technology is very hard to calculate as to what can be achieved.\n  When President Reagan articulated the principle, or the idea of a \nstrategic defense initiative, people said it was impossible. I recall \nreading a commentary more than a decade ago about Vannevar Bush's \ncomment back in the mid-forties, about 1945, when Vannevar Bush said it \nwould be an impossibility to have intercontinental ballistic missiles. \nNow look at what has happened; we have them by the thousands.\n  In 1965, then Secretary of Defense McNamara said that the United \nStates was so far ahead of the Soviet Union that they could never catch \nup. They did. For a time, they passed the United States, until we \nrearmed America, leading, in effect, to the bankruptcy of the Soviet \nUnion and the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n  There is a story many people believe to be apocryphal, but it is a \ntrue story, about a man who worked for the Patent Office shortly after \nthe turn of the 19th century who resigned his post because everything \nthat could be discovered or invented had been discovered or invented. \nWe see how modern science has produced discoveries, inventions \nunthought of, uncontemplated. So, too, we may be able to find an \neffective system to protect the United States from missiles from rogue \ncountries.\n  I believe this is an important bill. We could not bring it to the \nfloor in the 105th Congress because we were one vote short of cloture. \nThere are some 54 cosponsors on this bill, and I believe it articulates \na very important principle, to defend America, to defend Americans and \nto find a national missile defense system which would protect our \ncountry against rogue nations, against accidental, unauthorized, or \ndeliberate attacks.\n  We will have other considerations to deal with regarding Russia, \nother considerations to deal with in relation to China where recent \nevents have shown advances in China's missile technology, in part, \naccording to reliable reports, as a result of China having gained \naccess to United States technology through espionage. But this \nprinciple--of having a national missile defense policy--is something \nwhich ought to be adopted.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, first, as a procedural matter, I ask \nunanimous consent that Anthony Blaylock, a defense fellow working in \nSenator Dorgan's office, be granted the privilege of the floor during \ndebate on S. 257.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, we are here today debating an issue of \nfundamental importance to the United States and to the world community, \nand that is whether or not we will adopt a resolution of this Senate to \nproceed with a national missile defense as soon as it is \ntechnologically possible.\n  As many of my colleagues have indicated, I believe there is strong \nrecognition of the need for the careful deployment of a national \nmissile defense because we are at a historical crossroads.\n  First, there have been technological advances by rogue states which, \nfor the first time, allow them in the near future to be able to launch \nintercontinental ballistic missiles that would strike the territory of \nthe United States. That, in and of itself, has focused our attention, \nour resolve, and our commitment to begin accelerated development and, \none would hope, the eventual deployment of a national missile defense.\n\n  But the issue before us today is whether this legislation, S. 257, \nwill materially aid that effort without unduly complicating our \nability, first, to defend the United States and, second, to maintain \nthe regime of deterrence that has lasted throughout the cold war and \nhas avoided to date, and we hope indefinitely, the use of nuclear \nweapons in the world.\n  I mentioned that we are at a historical crossroads, the first element \nof which is the fact that rogue nations can, in fact, begin to launch \nin the near future intercontinental ballistic missiles. But the second \naspect of this historical crossroads is the fact that we have been \nmaintaining over decades a strategic balance which always contemplated \nlimits on offensive capability and which has led to treaties between \nourselves and the former Soviet Union, and now Russia, with respect to \nlimitations on offensive weapons. Complementing that has been, since \n1972, the limitation on antiballistic missile systems.\n  Sometimes I think we take this balance for granted. We assume that is \nthe way it always will be because it exists today. But we are seeing \npressure on this balance. First and most obviously, because of the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union and the constrained position of Russia, we \nare seeing some operational wearing around the edges in terms of their \nability to maintain the same type of controls that they had at the \nheight of the cold war.\n  We are also seeing a situation where operationally they might, \nregretfully, be a little bit quicker on the draw, since they do not \nhave the same type of panoply of long-term observation or radars that \nthey had or those that they have are beginning to deteriorate.\n  The point I want to make with respect to strategic balance is that \nthis is not something automatically that comes into play, it is \nsomething that has to be sustained and maintained, and when we look at \nlegislation like the bill before us, we have to seriously ask the \nquestion, Will this aid the maintenance of this strategic balance, or \nwill it give incentives to act unilaterally? That is a serious question \nwhich I think we have to address.\n  There is a second factor with respect to the historical crossroads, \nand that is, for the first time in recent memory, Russia, as the \nlegatee of the Soviet Union, is not able to match dollar for dollar, \nruble for dollar, if you will, developments that we, in fact, might put \nin place. Unlike the cold war, where they could accelerate their \noffensive missile capability by putting out more launches if we did \nsomething, they cannot do that too easily. Nor could they easily copy \nan extensive national missile defense if we put it in place. Again, \nthis is another strategic aspect that has to be considered when we \nconsider this legislation.\n  All of these issues together suggest a few things. First, we have to \nseriously address the issue of the rogue state with intercontinental \nballistic missiles, but, just as seriously, we have to be concerned \nabout doing something that might destabilize the overall arms control \nregime in the world. What we want to avoid is the temptation for states \nwith nuclear weapons and a capacity for intercontinental-range launches \nto start taking unilateral actions which may imperil us just as much as \nthe development of missiles by a rogue state.\n  Having said that, I think we can look at the situations which we \npotentially are trying to cover with this national missile defense and \npose two questions which I think are at the heart of our debate.\n  First of all, we are really focused at this juncture, with respect to \nthis legislation, on what is called the simple case, as the Ballistic \nMissile Defense Office will describe it, the C-1 situation: A few \nsimple ICBMs, no sophisticated countermeasures. In that context, we are \nproposing to create a system to deter that threat and also, in some \nrespects, to undermine or simply, hopefully, to modify, through mutual \nassent, the arms control regime in the ABM Treaty. That is just one \nsituation.\n  The second situation is what they call C-2. That is not just some \nsimple ICBMs but a few advanced ICBMs--those having, for example, \nmultiple independent reentry vehicles and some more sophisticated \ncountermeasures.\n  Finally, the category of many sophisticated reentry vehicles, many \nwith\n\n[[Page S2638]]\n\nindependently targeted warheads, and also with sophisticated \ncountermeasures.\n  For this latter category we have to ask ourselves, is that \ntechnologically possible, national missile defense scoped and designed \nfor the first simple threat going to meet what might evolve into the \nmore complicated threat? That is a technological question. I think that \nis a question that gives us some pause in the sense of rushing into \nthis, this declaration that we are going to do it now and we are going \nto do it with respect to the rogue nation threat.\n  Again, I think we have to ask two basic questions: First, will this \nfirst technologically possible solution be the best solution, not just \nto our short-run dilemma with respect to potential missile development \nin North Korea or Iran but over time as these systems may well evolve \nfrom a simple missile threat to a very sophisticated missile threat? \nThen second, we have to ask ourselves, will we build a system designed \nto counter this simple threat, the rogue threat, and cause, \nunwittingly, the precipitation of a much more sophisticated threat--to \ncause, unwittingly, powers like Russia, that have the capacity to put \nMIRVs on top of their launchers, to have, through strained resources \nand through frayed nerves, perhaps the potential to shoot a little \nquicker than they did in the cold war? That, I think, would be a \ntremendous misstep in maintaining our strategic balance.\n  For all these reasons, I suggest that we must move with caution--with \ndeliberation but with caution. I think we have to move not with some \nsingle-factor analysis, simply ``technologically possible,'' but with a \nmultifaceted analysis which I hope would undergird all our decisions \nwith respect to momentous decisions and costly decisions. We have to \nconsider cost. We have to consider the evolution of the threat. We have \nto consider our diplomatic relationships and the fact that we have \nmaintained this nuclear balance through mutual decisions.\n  First we maintained it through the policy of mutual assured \ndestruction. We built enough offensive weapons so that no enemy thought \nthey could conduct a successful first strike. And then we moved down a \nmuch more promising road by talking about limiting offensive weapons \nand limiting defensive weapons through diplomacy.\n  The rejection of this mutuality would be a casualty which I do not \nthink any of us would like to see. So I think we have to be very, very \ncareful. And if we need an anecdote to suggest the care which we must \ndevote to this exercise, I think it could be seen from a story I \nrecently read in the Washington Post about an incident that took place \non September 26, 1983, where a Russian lieutenant colonel was sitting \nin his bunker and suddenly all the lights went on that said ``start.'' \nAnd what the ``start'' meant was to start a nuclear retaliation round.\n  But because of that officer's judgment, in the environment of that \ntime of 1983, an environment in which the thought was that a nuclear \nattack by the United States would not be possible --the fact that there \nwas no effective ABM system providing national defense--the fact that \nthe operative motivation was not ordering a counterstrike but waiting \nfor further information, that could be changed by what we do in the \nnext several months, particularly, I think, if we do not make a good-\nfaith effort to modify, through negotiation and through mutuality, the \nABM Treaty.\n  We could have a situation in which, through an error of software, an \nerror of misperception, instead of waiting the extra second, a \nlieutenant colonel in the Russian rocket forces could decide that this \nvery well could be an active launch by the United States and that his \nonly recourse is to launch a retaliatory strike.\n  So we have to be careful. I believe that such care would lead us, I \nhope, to consider legislation that does not just talk about \ntechnological possibility but talks about a range of things, including, \nwe hope, a mutual adjustment of the ABM Treaty.\n  Missile defense is a situation, a topic, that has followed us since \n1940, when we first became aware that Germany was developing \nintercontinental ballistic missiles. It has followed us through my \nentire life, and it will go on, we hope, without a dramatic conclusion, \nfor as long as we can foresee. We have been able to manage these \nissues, and each administration has taken them seriously, and the \nClinton administration is no stranger to the seriousness of this \nendeavor.\n\n  We have also seen changes in terms of programs, in terms of budget. \nJust a few years ago, in the Persian Gulf we discovered that there was \na real threat to our theater forces, our forces in the field, and we \nbegan actively upgrading our theater missile defense, a program which \nwe also bought and which we consider to be vital to the operational \neffectiveness of our forces around the world.\n  In 1996, the administration announced that they were moving forward \nwith respect to national missile defense with their 3+3 approach. That \nwould be 3 years devoted to research and development, a deployment \ndecision due in June of 2000, and then, if required, the deployment \nwould take place within the next 3 years. All of this, of course, \nsupposed and presumed that there would be active discussion with Russia \nand others with respect to the ABM Treaty.\n  We have devoted not only conceptual energy to this project, we have \nalso devoted dollars. We have increased the administration's proposal \nfor efforts through fiscal year 2005 to the order of $10.5 billion. \nThis is not a project that is languishing without financial support and \nfinancial resources.\n  In short, in sum, both the Congress and the administration agree on \nthe importance of missile defense, of providing the resources to do \nthat, and are hoping that we can in fact develop a technologically \nfeasible, cost-effective system that will be appropriate to our needs \nand also, hopefully, will be agreed upon by the world community as a \nnecessary part of our defense.\n  I have mentioned before what I think some of the limitations are of \nthe approach that we are debating today with respect to S. 257. \nPrincipally, it is the sole reliance upon one criterion, and that is, \n``technologically possible.''\n  There are other parameters that we have to look at.\n  The threat: Again, today we are looking at a very limited threat, \nthat C-1 threat, a rogue nation with a simple IBM, without any \ncountermeasures. But that threat quickly will mature to something else. \nIt does not take too much to incorporate countermeasures on our reentry \nvehicle. And once we do that, we might be into a configuration of \nnational defense which does not fit that neat picture of what is \ntechnologically possible right now.\n  Of course, we have to look at cost. And it is not just an issue of \ncost in and of itself, it is the classic issue of opportunity cost. To \ndevelop this system immediately might preclude us from taking other \nsteps which are just as important with respect to our defense, with \nrespect to our missile defense, with respect to other aspects of our \ndefense policy.\n  And then we certainly, I think, have to look at the effect on arms \ncontrol agreements.\n  Consideration of these factors I think would mitigate against \nunconstrained, unconditional support for S. 257 and would suggest that \nwe would amend this measure and adopt a more comprehensive and a more \nrealistic approach to the decision matrix we face when it comes to \nnational missile defense.\n  Just briefly, there is a threat out there; no one is denying that. \nThe administration is not denying it. No one in this body is denying \nit.\n  We have seen just recently, in May of 1998, India and Pakistan \nconduct nuclear tests.\n  We have also been the beneficiaries of the Rumsfeld Commission report \nthat anticipates the ability of a rogue nation to have an \nintercontinental capability by the year 2010.\n  Then, on July 22, 1998, Iran test fired an intermediate-range \nballistic missile capable of hitting most of the Middle East.\n  Then, finally, perhaps most chillingly, on August 31, 1998, North \nKorea launched a Taepo Dong 1 missile that was far more advanced than \nwe thought capable at that time. These threats are serious. They are \nnot taken lightly.\n\n  It is because of these threats that we are moving and committing \ndollars for the development of a national missile defense system. As \nGeneral Shelton, our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of\n\n[[Page S2639]]\n\nStaff, pointed out in ``Seapower'' magazine:\n\n       There are other serious threats out there in addition to \n     that posed by ballistic missiles. We know, for example, that \n     there are adversaries with chemical and biological weapons \n     that can attack the United States today. They could do it \n     with a briefcase--by infiltrating our territory across our \n     shores or through our airports.\n\n  Essentially, it raises the issue that if we, in a break-neck race to \njust deploy our first technologically possible system, all of these \nresources--are we missing out on providing effective deterrence and \ndefense for these other approaches? I think we raise that issue with \nrespect to S. 257.\n  Now, the other aspect of this is we don't want to buy a system with \nbillions of dollars that will work for a couple of years and then be \nobsolete. We don't want to go through the trouble of renegotiating a \ntreaty--or perhaps the worst case, of walking away from a treaty for a \nsystem that is just not going to work.\n  William Perry, our former Secretary of Defense, put it well when he \nsaid:\n\n       Think of this problem in terms of buying a personal \n     computer for college. If you had ordered your computer as a \n     high-school sophomore it would have been obsolete by the time \n     you started college. It would lack the capabilities you now \n     need and would be impossible, or prohibitively expensive, to \n     update.\n\n  In many respects, that is the same type of intellectual dilemma we \nface today. Putting a system in the field because it is technologically \npossible might not be the best approach. That is the only criterion in \nS. 257.\n  We know this is also a very difficult technical problem, essentially \nbecause we are using ``kill'' vehicles that are target upon target, \nusing kinetic energy--i.e. impact. It is like a bullet hitting a \nbullet. That is a tough problem. In fact, we have had very few \nsuccesses in the experiments we have tried to run to date. So few, in \nfact, a Pentagon review panel has called the program to date a ``rush \nto failure.'' We don't want to rush to failure. We want ``progress to \ndeployment'' of a system that works for us, defends the country and \nmaintains our strength--not just in the small case of a rogue nation \nbut in the larger case of international nuclear stability.\n  Now, S. 257 will require us to deploy this system as long as it is \ntechnologically possible. Again, one could ask, what does that mean? Is \nthat the first step that succeeds? Is it a series of two or three tests \nto succeed in any case? That type of analysis alone is not, I think, \nthe optimal way to approach this issue.\n  As I mentioned before, we have to consider costs. Between 1984 and \n1994, the Congressional Research Service estimated that the Pentagon \nspent $70.7 billion on ballistic missile defense activities, yet no \nsystem was deployed. I hope valuable information was gained and \nresearch could be applied to the ongoing projects, but $70 billion was \nspent in a decade without the breakthrough deployment, the breakthrough \ntechnology of a system. Again, we have to consider costs.\n  Just the simple preparation of one site for a national missile \ndefense would range between $6 and $13 billion. These costs would be \njustified in many respects by the threat if we are confident or more \nconfident that the system we are putting in place would be something \nthat could evolve to the greater threats in the future and is something \nthat really does provide comprehensive protections to the United \nStates--not just today but in the future. This legislation does not \ncall for such a comprehensive measure in which to determine whether to \ndeploy or not to deploy.\n  As mentioned before, every dollar we spend on national missile \ndefense is important, but there are some other measures of defense \nwhich are equally important and which may find themselves shortchanged \nif we have this rush for deployment as soon as we are technologically \npossible. Again, we have to consider, I think, this issue in broader \nterms beyond just technological possibility.\n  Then we have to consider, as I have mentioned, the effect of arms \ncontrol agreements. Since 1940, we have been wrestling with this issue \nof how to defend the United States against intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles. We tried to develop defense mechanisms. We have had systems \nin place. We were developing in the 1970s and the late 1960s a central \nsystem. The central system turned into Safeguard and Safeguard was \nmoving forward, but at the height of the cold war at a time when the \ntensions between ourselves and the Soviet Union were extremely \npronounced, President Nixon negotiated and ultimately agreed to an \nantiballistic missile treaty. In fact, this treaty limited what was \ntechnically possible. The Safeguard system was going in place to \nprotect our ICBM fields. It was technically possible, it was thought \nthen that we would be more secure if we limited the deployment of \nballistic missile systems--mutually limited--amongst ourselves and the \nSoviet Union. That decision was made. That decision has stood the test \nof time to date.\n\n  The ABM Treaty has been questioned over time, but it has provided us \na situation where we have a more stable balance between ourselves, \ncertainly, and at one time the Soviet Union, and now Russia.\n  I think, however, recognizing the rise of these rogue states with \ntheir missile capability, it is appropriate to look at ABM. It is \nappropriate to go back and attempt to modify the treaty--modify it not \njust in terms of the simple case, the C-1 case, but look at it in terms \nof modifications that will carry us through the medium and the long run \nfor systems that very well may not be technically possible today or in \n2 years but would be extremely important, indeed perhaps necessary, in \n5 to 10 years. We could do this if we negotiate with the Russians.\n  We have to ask ourselves what kind of message S. 257 would send, \nbasically saying we are going to deploy this as soon as we think it \nworks, without any mention of negotiation of ABM. I don't think it \nsends the right message. It sends the message at a time when the Soviet \nmissile force has been transferred to the Russians. We know it is \nfraying on the edges in terms of command control, in terms of its \nreplacement, in terms of its technological sophistication.\n  Again, do we really want to change what was the operative rule in the \ncold war--that a missile strike by the United States, a first strike; \nor by Russia or the Soviet Union--would be unlikely if not impossible? \nThat is the type of mindset which gave a lieutenant colonel in the \nRussian rocket forces the gut feeling to disregard all the warnings on \nhis computer and on the screen to say, ``This can't be right; it would \nbe reckless and foolish for the United States to launch five or so \nmissiles against us.'' We certainly don't want a situation where some \nlieutenant colonel says, ``They have an ABM system which they put in \nunilaterally without our consent, over our opposition. You know what? \nMaybe these five missiles are more than a mistake on my computer.''\n  We have to very serious about this. I know we are all serious, but I \nsuggest, and I think Senator Levin would suggest later, that this \nlegislation could benefit mightily from the amendments that at least \nacknowledge the importance of negotiation, the importance of cost \nestimates, the importance of evaluation or threat before we go forward.\n  The other aspect of this legislation is that it will not speed up the \ndeployment of a national missile defense. The administration is \ncommitted to developing, doing the research, making a decision based on \nall of these factors I mentioned and deploying a missile defense, at \nthe same time negotiating with the Russians with respect to the ABM \nTreaty. As the President indicated, if those negotiations are \nfruitless, if we are ready to deploy, if the threat is there with \nrespect to rogue states, he is quite prepared at that point to make a \ndecision to deploy.\n  That is a far cry from standing here today saying, ``Disregard \nnegotiations, disregard the evolution of the threat, disregard the \ncost. As soon as we have one successful test we are going to put it in \nthe field.'' I don't think that is the wisest course. I think we can do \nbetter. Indeed, I believe that everyone--the sponsors of the \nlegislation, those who disagree with the legislation--want to do the \nbest for this country and want to ensure that we are protected, want to \nensure that in the long run we have comprehensive national\n\n[[Page S2640]]\n\nsecurity; that we don't have a situation where we might provide for the \ninherent missile strike from a rogue nation, yet we have undermined the \nbalance between ourselves and another major nuclear power--Russia or, \nindeed, China.\n\n  I think we can do this, but I think we have to begin with the \nconception that it is just not one parameter, one criteria, and that it \nis done in a careful way on a multiplicity of issues like cost, \ntechnological possibility, threat, and also maintaining a strong regime \nof arms control, which has benefited us mightily over the course of \nmany decades.\n  So I hope very much that we will be able to amend this legislation to \nreflect those different aspects and, having amended it, to agree \nunanimously to send it forward to the President for his signature. I \nhope we can do that in the days ahead. We will see.\n  At this time, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise in support of S. 257, the National \nMissile Defense Act of 1999. This straight-forward bill states that due \nto the increasing ballistic missile threat we face, ``It is the policy \nof the United States to deploy as soon as is technologically possible \nan effective National Missile Defense system capable of defending the \nterritory of the United States against limited ballistic missile attack \n(whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate).'' This bill is \nessentially identical to last year's measure which was filibustered by \nthe minority and failed to gain cloture by a single vote. I would ask \nthose who opposed the bill last year to consider the events over the \nintervening period which reinforce the arguments in favor of national \nmissile defense:\n  First, North Korea launched a three-stage missile last August that \noverflew Japan in an attempt to orbit a satellite. This missile, the \nTaepo Dong 1, has sufficient range to reach Alaska and Hawaii as \ndemonstrated by the fact that its debris landed 4000 miles out in the \nPacific. The range and the presence of a third stage was a surprise to \nthe Intelligence Community, according to unclassified statements by \nRobert Walpole, National Intelligence Officer for Strategic and Nuclear \nPrograms. Furthermore, successor missile, the Taepo Dong 2 is expected \nto be able to reach all of the American mainland and may be ready for \ntesting this year. As the Chairman of the CIA's National Intelligence \nCouncil noted last October, ``An ICBM threat from North Korea is \nlooming.''\n  Second, Iran tested a medium range missile last July that is capable \nof reaching Israel and U.S. forces throughout the Middle East. This \nmissile, the Shahab-3, may already be in production and Iran, with \nRussian assistance, is developing a longer-range missile capable of \nreaching Central Europe. Russian missile assistance to Iran has \ncontinued despite intensive U.S. efforts to halt this deadly trade. As \nCIA Director Tenet noted in testimony last month to the Armed Services \nCommittee, ``Especially during the last six months, expertise and \nmateriel from Russia has continued to assist the Iranian missile effort \nin areas ranging from training, to testing, to components.'' General \nZinni, our CENTCOM commander has stated that Iran may have nuclear \nweapons within five years. Iran has been typically bloody-minded in its \npropaganda. During a military parade in Tehran last year, slogans were \nwritten on sides of missiles that read ``Israel should be wiped off the \nmap'' and ``the USA can do nothing''. Moreover, last year's hopeful \nsigns that Iranian moderates were gaining ascendancy now look much less \nclear.\n  Third, Iraq has achieved its long-sought goal of escaping from UNSCOM \ninspections. Chief UN arms inspector Butler has stated that Iraq has \nresumed its weapons programs. There is now no inspection regime in \nplace, the UN embargo is under mounting attack including by erstwhile \nallies, potential suppliers are eager to be of assistance, and Iraq \nretains a significant missile production and support infrastructure \nupon which to build. UN inspectors had uncovered drawings of multi-\nstage missiles and they are within a decade of an intercontinental \nmissile capability.\n  Fourth, China continues measured but steady improvement in its \nexisting force of ICBMs which are already capable of hitting American \ncities. China's ICBMs have benefitted from both the outright theft and \nthe unwisely permitted transfers of American space launch vehicle \ntechnology. Recently there have been disturbing published reports that \nChina stole the design of the nuclear warhead of our Trident missile. \nThis sophisticated multiple independently-targeted reentry vehicle or \nMIRV design has the capability to be a real force multiplier. Moreover, \nthe technology that China obtains from the United States may not remain \nthere. According to a Washington Times report on February 23, China has \nassisted North Korea's missile and space technology. China has also \ndeveloped a habit of using ballistic missiles to intimidate its \nneighbors. On the eve of Taiwan's first democratic elections in 1996, \nChina launched M-9 missiles to areas within 30 miles of Taiwan's two \nprimary ports. A report just released by the Defense Department states \nthat China is engaged in an intense buildup of ballistic and cruise \nmissiles opposite Taiwan. Easy assumptions that the U.S. can enjoy a \nconstructive relationship with China may be rooted in hope rather than \nreality. Beijing's recent crackdown on the fledgling Democracy Party \nserves as a reminder that China remains an authoritarian and \npotentially hostile regime with a highly uncertain future.\n  Finally, the condition of Russia is cause for serious concern. Russia \nretains over 6000 strategic nuclear warheads and is still conducting \nlimited modernization even as their strategic forces experience overall \ndecay. While a return to cold war confrontation is unlikely today, the \nprospects for Russia's successful transition to democracy remain \nunclear. Their economic meltdown last summer further aggravated \nproblems of nuclear weapons security, and command and control. The \ncompetence and morale and, hence, the safety of their nuclear forces \nare increasingly in question.\n\n  The timeliness of the warnings of the bipartisan Rumsfeld Commission \nReport last summer have been more than borne out by these events. The \nNorth Korean and Iranian missile tests followed within weeks of that \nreport. You will recall that the Rumsfeld Commission offered three \nmajor conclusions. (1) The missile threat to the United States is real \nand growing. (2) The threat is greater than previously assessed and a \nrogue nation could acquire the capability to threaten the U.S. with an \nICBM within as little as five years. And (3) we may have little or no \nwarning of the emergence of new threats. How prescient these \nconclusions were. How quickly they were borne out by subsequent events.\n  Madam President, the administration is to be commended for its \nrecognition that a missile threat to the United States exists. On \nJanuary 20, Secretary of Defense Cohen stated that ``the United States \nwill, in fact, face a rogue nation threat to our homeland against which \nwe will have to defend the American people'' and that ``technological \nreadiness will be the sole remaining criteria'' in deciding when to \ndeploy a national missile defense system. But subsequent statements by \nadministration spokesman have hedged on this forthright statement and \nsuggested that other considerations may affect our deployment decision. \nFor example, Secretary of State Albright has suggested that any \ndeployment was conditional on the actual emergence of a threat and on \nthe successful renegotiation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.\n  I've just outlined the threat and, in particular, the recent events \nwhich demonstrate that it is closer than many believed. There may well \nbe rogue nations with the capability to reach American shores with \nweapons of mass destruction before we can deploy even a limited missile \nshield under the administration's most optimistic scenarios of \nsuccessful tests and timely decisions. And even after Secretary Cohen's \nannouncement, there has been slippage in a key program, namely the \nSpace-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites for missile detection \nand tracking. I joined several others Senators in expressing my concern \nat this unfortunate decision by the Air Force to delay development of \nthis vial component of any missile defense architecture. If left \nunchanged, this decision will delay the deployment of any NMD\n\n[[Page S2641]]\n\nsystem until 2006 when the first SBIRS-low satellites are launched. The \nbottom line is that the threat is developing more rapidly than our \nresponse to it. We cannot afford additional delays while our potential \nadversaries develop and deploy increasingly capable missiles.\n  Second, Secretary Albright and other administration officials have \nspoken of the need to revise the ABM Treaty to accommodate deployment \nof a national missile defense. Mr. President, the ABM Treaty is an \nanachronism. It is the last relic of the cold war. Whatever its merit \nthen, it has none now. In fact, some legal scholars believe the ABM \nTreaty is no longer binding on the United States since one of the \noriginal parties to the Treaty has ceased to exist. Renegotiation of \nthe ABM Treaty is likely to prove a long and fruitless undertaking. \nRussia will not doubt hold out the prospect of START II ratification as \nthey have done for six years now. The United States has purchased START \nII ratification several times over and we should not do so again. The \neconomic situation in Russia today renders it unlikely that a START II \nlevel, let alone a START I level, of weapons is sustainable. To hold \nhostage the defense of the United States for the constantly receding \nmirage of START II would be strategic folly. Russia is not the target \nof American national missile defense except in so far as we seek the \ncapability to defend against accidental or unauthorized launch. We can \nand should continue cooperative efforts with Russia, but they should \nnot exercise a veto over our decision to defend ourselves against an \nIran or a North Korea.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have advanced \narms control arguments in opposition to missile defense. I suggest that \nAmerican deployment of national missile defense will actually be a \nprofoundly stabilizing step. If we have the prospect of defending our \ncountry from attack by weapons of mass destruction, we are less likely \nto have to resort to nuclear retaliation. Further, our deployment of a \nnational missile defense will reduce the incentive for nuclear and \nmissile proliferation by our prospective adversaries. It will reduce \nthe ability of a North Korea to successfully blackmail us and our \nallies with its nuclear and missile programs.\n  The bill before the Senate does not, however, address the ABM Treaty. \nThe bill does not say what kind of architecture the missile defense \nsystem should have. It does not say where such a system should be \nlocated, or more generally, whether it should be based on land, at sea, \nor in space. It does not specify a date by which such a system should \nbe deployed. It simply states a national goal, a goal on which \nbipartisan agreement should be possible. I am surprised \nand disappointed that the administration has chosen to oppose this \nbill, the purpose of which seems identical to the policy announced by \nthe Secretary of Defense in January. I would have hoped that we could \nagree on the goal and turn our attention to the means to achieve it.\n\n  There is an important debate that has only just begun as to the best \nmeans of providing a national missile defense. For example, one option \nthat I don't think has received enough attention is a sea-based missile \ndefense. While the best defense is obviously an integrated land, sea, \nand space combination, I think it is becoming more and more clear that \nsea-based systems offer our best near term solution to both theater and \nnational missile defense needs. This is because of their operational \nflexibility, cost-effectiveness, ability to deploy rapidly where \nneeded, and the potential for ascent-phase intercepts. As you will \nrecall, the ABM Treaty precludes sea-and space-based defenses. \nUnfortunately, the Clinton administration is attempting to remain \nwithin the sacred scripture of the ABM Treaty by proposing one or two \nfixed land-based sites and hasn't vigorously pursued research and \nfunding of more promising technologies.\n  We need a better alternative. For my money, that alternative is to \ndevelop a robust theater navy system which can provide a limited \ndefense against some strategic missiles possibly at an earlier date \nthan the administration's proposals would allow. Such a system can be a \nbridge to a complete national defense later. For many years now, the \nNavy has been heavily involved in missile defense and has invested over \n$50 billion in the Aegis fleet which now comprises more than 60 ships \nwith more than 5,000 missile launchers. The Navy is currently working \non two missile defense programs to be based on Aegis ships--the area or \n``Lower Tier'' system that will provide protection for point targets \nagainst short-range missiles, and the Theater Wide or ``Upper Tier'' \nsystem capable of defending areas as large as several countries against \nmuch longer range missiles. The Pentagon's current plans do not call \nfor the Navy Theater Wide system to be deployed before 2010 but this \ntiming is driven by budget constraints rather than technology \ndevelopment. In fact, both the navy and the Ballistic Missile Defense \nOffice have recently concluded that if funding were increased by \nroughly $300 million per year, the system could be deployed between \n2003 and 2005 without a significant increase in risk.\n  Madam President, it is a more dangerous world out there than it was \ntwo or five years ago. Rogue nations have been able to pursue missile \nand nuclear programs with little effective hindrance from international \nproliferation regimes. The past twelve months have witnessed the first \ntests of the North Korean Taepo Dong I and the Iranian Shahab-3, the \nlatter based on North Korea's No Dong design. Russia flirts with chaos \nand China once again reminds us that they remain a repressive, \nauthoritarian regime, not a ``strategic partner'' in the \nadministration's ill-chosen phrase. Both continue to assist rogue \nnations in their weapons of mass destruction. The administration's \ndiplomacy has been inconsistent, distracted, and shortsighted at best. \nIts military programs are hobbled by outdated arms control strictures. \nProliferation outstrips anti-proliferation efforts and rogue state \noffensive weaponry is advancing more rapidly than the administration's \nprograms to counter them. The time has come for the United States to \ndefend itself from the increasing missile threat that I have just \ndescribed. The Cochran bill is the first step on this path. I urge my \ncolleagues to support its passage.\n  Madam President, I would like to respond to my friend from Rhode \nIsland and to speak to the question of whether or not we ought to \nmaintain a window of vulnerability, because that is basically what has \nbeen presented here. My friend acknowledged the threat to the United \nStates, but said we ought to go slow; after all, this might cost a lot \nand technology is hard and the Russians are going to be nervous about \nit. Therefore, maybe we ought to go slow.\n  Let me remind my colleagues what this amendment says. It is very \nsimple:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to deploy, as soon as \n     is technologically possible, an effective missile defense \n     capable of defending the territory of the United States \n     against limited ballistic missile attack.\n\n  Madam President, that is pretty straightforward. We are saying that \nwhen it is possible, we should deploy such a system. Why? Because we \nare threatened. Is that threat sometime off in the future? No. The \nthreat is now. There is a window of vulnerability between the time that \nwe are threatened and the time we can deploy a system to protect \nourselves against the threat. Why is this important? We know that \nRussian missiles can reach the United States already. We know Chinese \nmissiles can reach the United States, and we now know that the North \nKoreans probably have a missile that can at least reach some of the \nUnited States, and they are testing further missiles that would have a \nlonger range and eventually have the capability of reaching the \ncontinental United States.\n  Have we ever been threatened by any of these countries? Yes, as a \nmatter of fact, we have. Back when the Chinese were launching missiles \nacross Taiwan before the Taiwanese elections in an obvious effort to \nintimidate them, the United States decided to send carriers to the \nTaiwan Strait. One of the Chinese generals is supposed to have said to \nan American: ``You know, we believe in the long run that you care more \nabout Los Angeles than you do about Taiwan''--the implicit threat \nbeing, of course, if you get in our way, if we are ever serious about \ndoing something to Taiwan, we can threaten to launch ballistic missiles \nagainst Los Angeles.\n  Is it fair for the people of the United States, for their leaders, \nknowing this\n\n[[Page S2642]]\n\nvulnerability exists, to do nothing about it, or to take the ``let's go \nslow'' approach that has just been suggested by my colleague? I think \nnot. We would be negligent to the utmost degree if we understood that a \nthreat existed, yet, we failed to protect the American people against a \npotential attack by a foreign country. That is the first and most \nimportant obligation of the U.S. Government--to protect the American \npeople.\n\n  We now know that ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction \ncarried by them are the weapon of choice--and not just by our old \nadversary, the Russians, but by rogue nations. That is why we should \nnot allow a piece of paper--the ABM Treaty--to get in the way of \ndefending us. Back in the days my colleague was just referring to, the \nUnited States and Russia--whether for good reasons or bad--decided we \nwould remain neutrally vulnerable to an attack by the other; thereby, \nwe would create stability. That may or may not have worked in those \ndays.\n  I argue that there were other factors at play, but let's assume that \nwas the reason. There were only two countries that could threaten each \nother; therefore, this was a workable arrangement. But to tie our hands \nbehind our back mutually with the Russians doesn't account for today's \nreality in which there are other nations that could attack us. So while \nwe politely agree with the Russians to maintain a lack of defense \nagainst ballistic missile attack, other countries have developed that \ncapability and can threaten us, impede our foreign policy goals and, \nGod forbid, even use the weapons against us with impunity because we \ndon't have the means to defend ourselves.\n  Some would argue that we have the nuclear retaliatory capability to \nrespond to such an attack. Well, Madam President, I for one would not \nlike to have to launch a massive nuclear retaliation against North \nKorea, or anyone else, as the price of being attacked myself. I would \nrather deter that attack in the first place by having a defense--a \nlimited defense--which would threaten in no way the Russian system \nbecause it would easily overwhelm it, but which would provide limited \nprotection against an attack by a rogue nation.\n  I applaud Senator Cochran for his perseverance in continuing to bring \nthis before the body, even though many on the other side of the aisle \nhave not up until now allowed us to have a vote on this, and even \nthough the administration strongly opposes it.\n  What were the arguments posed against the amendment? First is that we \nshould not rush to this, and I think I have already made the point. \nThere is no doubt about the threat here. The window of vulnerability \nwill be in the neighborhood of a minimum of 5 or 6 years. That is too \nlong. Under the administration's plan, we would deploy, maybe in 2005, \na system that could defend us--or probably in 2006. We are talking 6 to \n7 years from now. I don't think that trying to deploy this system as \nsoon as technologically possible is rushing in any sense that is bad \nfor the United States. Rather, I see a 6- or 7-year window of \nvulnerability as the problem. I would like to rush even more. I wish we \ncould create the technology tomorrow and deploy this tomorrow. I don't \nthink waiting 6 or 7 years and being threatened during that interim is \nrushing too much.\n  Secondly, my colleague suggested that we have to consider the threat. \nI don't know of anybody that denies the threat. The Rumsfeld Commission \nmade it crystal clear that the Russians, Chinese, and the North Koreans \nhave the capability, and that other countries will soon have the \ncapability of reaching States of the United States. Now, that is a \nthreat from weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  How about the cost? Of course, we have to consider the cost. So how \nmuch is this going to cost? Well, about as much as it has cost us to go \nto Bosnia. The estimates there range from $12 billion to $20 billion. \nWhatever the cost is, certainly protecting the American people from \nballistic missile attack ought to at least be as important as what we \nhave spent in Bosnia, shouldn't it? How about 1 percent of the defense \nbudget? That is what we are talking about. The administration is \ntalking about adding about a billion dollars to a defense budget of \n$260 billion, or maybe $270 billion. So, Madam President, that is less \nthan 1 percent of the defense budget. It is a fraction of the overall \nbudget of the United States.\n  If this represents the No. 1 threat to the United States from rogue \nnations, and if it is 1 percent of the defense budget, is that too \nmuch? How much is too much to protect the American people, I ask my \ncolleagues? Can you put a number on it? I can't. Certainly, 1 percent \nof the defense budget is not too much.\n  So first of all, there is a threat and there is a window of \nvulnerability. We are not rushing this, and we are not spending too \nmuch money on it. I challenge my colleagues to answer the question: How \nmuch is too much to protect the American people? When we don't even \nwant to see one American life lost in a place like Bosnia, and we go to \ngreat lengths to protect our service people when we deploy them abroad \nbecause we don't want to lose one person, how much is too much to \nprotect the people of Hawaii or Alaska, the States that are currently \nthreatened by a country like North Korea, which is a country that \nabsolutely cannot be predicted in terms of its behavior?\n  The third issue is diplomacy. We have the ABM Treaty to deal with. I \nam going to get into a little bit more detail on that in just a moment \nbecause we certainly have to think about strategic stability. We don't \nwant to do anything here that would be so disruptive to our \nrelationships with other nations, that somehow we would find ourselves \nin greater danger than from this particular threat. I suggest to my \ncolleagues that there is no upsetting of the strategic stability of the \nworld if we proceed to defend ourselves, especially from rogue nations.\n  As a matter of fact, I suggest that the deployment of missile \ndefenses to protect the people of the United States will be profoundly \nstabilizing. If we have the prospect of defending our country against a \nballistic missile attack, we are less likely to have to use massive \nnuclear retaliation, which is more destabilizing. Furthermore, our \ndeployment of a national missile defense will reduce the incentive for \nnuclear and missile proliferation by our potential adversaries knowing \nthat they can't succeed against us because we have this defense.\n  That is one of the key things that brought down the Soviet Union--\nknowing that we were committed to develop what was then the Strategic \nDefense Initiative to preclude the Soviet Union from ever succeeding in \nan attack against us. They basically packed it up. They said: We cannot \ncompete with that; therefore, we are going to quit.\n  It seems to me that a strong commitment to defend ourselves will have \nthe right effect. It will cause other countries to get realistic about \nthe ability to try to push the United States around by the development \nof these threatening weapons. They will decide that discretion is the \nbetter part of valor and will decide that they can spend their money on \nmore useful things. It will certainly reduce the ability of countries \nlike North Korea to successfully blackmail the United States and our \nallies because we can't defend ourselves against their weapons.\n  Madam President, let me show, with the aid of a couple of charts, \nsome things that I think are very interesting. This first chart shows \nthe level of offensive weapons, nuclear warheads, permitted under \ndifferent regimens today under treaties. This is the one we are \ncurrently under. It is called the START I. It said both Russia and the \nUnited States had to limit our nuclear warheads to about 6,000. So that \nis where we are.\n  We proposed, and the United States has ratified, the START II treaty, \nwhich almost cuts this in half--down to 3,500. We have been waiting, I \nbelieve now for 6 years, for Russia to ratify the START II treaty. They \nhaven't ratified it yet.\n  We are worried here about making the Russians upset. How about us \nbeing upset? For a long time we have said: Let's create a more stable \nworld; let's get rid of these dangerous weapons; you don't need them; \nwe don't need them; let's reduce them down to 3,500--6 years ago. The \nRussians still haven't ratified. We have given a lot to the Russians as \ninducements for them to ratify. We bought the START II treaty many \ntimes. But they have yet to deliver. So we are still waiting.\n\n[[Page S2643]]\n\n  Some argue that, because it is so costly to maintain these weapons, \nactually the Russians would prefer to go right to a more realistic \nlevel that they could sustain, a START III level, about 2,000; maybe \nthey can afford to keep 2,000 weapons around; and, therefore, we ought \nto just jump right over START II and go all the way down to START III. \nLet's examine that argument for a minute.\n  It turns out that it is not the ABM Treaty at all, or the START II \ntreaty, that is determining the strategic parity between the United \nStates and Russia with respect to nuclear weapons. It turns out that \nthis stability is created more by a very practical situation; that is, \nhow much can the Russians afford? How much, frankly, can the United \nStates afford?\n  As it turns out, Igor Sergeyev, the Russian Minister of Defense, last \nsummer told the Russian Security Council that Russia will be unable to \nmuster a strategic nuclear force of more than 1,500 warheads by the \nyear 2010 and that the reasons have nothing to do with armaments \ncontrol. They can't afford it. Their economy is broken. They have no \nmoney. Much of their military force is in disrepair. And, indeed, the \nonly part they have been modernizing is their strategic nuclear \noffensive capability. As a result, Sergeyev points out that this is the \nmaximum level they are going to be able to maintain with or without an \nABM Treaty, with or without a START II or START III treaty.\n\n  So it is not what we do with respect to these arms control agreements \nthat is going to dictate the parity of nuclear weapons between our two \ncountries; it is the stark reality of what we can both afford.\n  Frankly, this level of 1,500 to 2,000 is about where we are going to \nend up. So it doesn't matter whether we deploy another defensive system \nor not, or a defensive system against nuclear-tipped missiles or not. \nThe fact is, the Russians are going down to this level because they \ncan't afford to do anything else.\n  I think, therefore, that the notion that offensive reductions in \nstrategic nuclear warheads will not occur if this bill is passed is \nsimply not borne out by the facts. This bill has nothing whatsoever to \ndo with that. It is happening and will continue to happen regardless of \nwhat we do today.\n  But let's suppose something. Let's make believe something--that some \nof the arguments similar to those that have just been made are correct \nand that ``Russia would likely retain thousands of nuclear warheads'' \nand somehow they would develop the money to do this that they would \n``otherwise eliminate'' under these arms control agreements. Suppose \nsome miracle occurs and Russia finds the resources to rejuvenate its \nstrategic forces.\n  What rationale would Russia have for doing this?\n  Bear in mind that what we are talking about here is a national \nmissile defense system. We qualified it, it says ``limited,'' and the \nreason is that we do not intend to build anything more, and we would \nnot build anything more, than a limited system capable of providing a \ndefense against a limited attack, an attack that we currently believe \nwe are threatened by a rogue nation like North Korea, or, given the \ndebate about China these days, perhaps a China, which doesn't have the \nsame quantity of missiles that Russia does.\n  There are other nations in the world that I will not list that also \nare developing this capability.\n  Suppose that when we develop this system, Russia looks at it and \nsays, ``How is this going to affect our strategic missile offensive \nwarhead situation? Maybe we ought to have more warheads, because the \nUnited States system is going to degrade our capability of successfully \nattacking them.'' In other words, ``If they have a good defense, maybe \nwe need more offense.''\n  I pointed out that the defense we are talking about is a minimal \ndefense, perhaps capable of defending against just a handful of \nmissiles, not the 6,000 warheads that the Russians may have today. If \nthe strategic stability argument is to be believed, it has to be \nbecause the Russians would find the idea of the United States missile \ndefense so threatening that they would have to retain thousands and \nthousands of warheads in order to be sure they could overcome our \ndefense.\n  So, let's examine the defensive side of the equation.\n  I have another chart which I think will explain this situation. The \noffensive warheads again are in red. This is what was originally \npermitted under START I. You can see that we had about 2,000 warheads \nat the time. But START I eventually got to the level of 6,000 that I \nmentioned a while ago. That is where we are today--both countries in \nthe neighborhood of authorized 6,000 warheads. That is the column in \nred. This is the way it began back when START I was actually ratified, \nand when the ABM Treaty was created. Back in those days, each side was \nlimited by the ABM Treaty to 200 interceptor missiles. In 1974, at the \ntime the treaty was negotiated, or signed, neither side having plans to \ndeploy the full complement of defensive missiles it was allowed, that \nnumber was reduced to 100. That remains the limit today. So both \ncountries have 100 authorized interceptors. Of course, Russia has built \nits system. We have not built our system.\n\n  The limited missile defense system the United States is developing \nwill be capable initially of shooting down, as I said, a handful of \nrelatively unsophisticated warheads. The plans for ``Capability 1,'' as \nwe will call it, called for deployment of 20 interceptor missiles to do \nthis job--just 20 interceptor missiles. This is the system the \nadministration claims can be deployed by 2005. Subsequently, this will \ngrow to ``Capability 2,'' which, according to the Ballistic Missile \nDefense Organization, will consist of up to 100 interceptor missiles \nable to shoot down a somewhat larger number of sophisticated warheads.\n  Although the concept of operations envisions firing several \ninterceptors at each warhead, let's assume for the purpose of argument \nthat each interceptor will work absolutely perfectly and kill one \nwarhead. That is never going to be the case, but we will give the other \nside the absolute maximum benefit of the doubt. That means that, at \nmost, as envisioned today, the United States system will be capable of \ndestroying 100 Russian warheads, out of a START III total of no fewer \nthan 2,000, or perhaps 1,500, if Minister Sergeyev is correct. Let's \nexamine what that means.\n  Back in 1974, when the ABM Treaty was created, there was a 10-to-1 \nratio in terms of offensive to defensive, because you had about 2,000 \nwarheads and 200-interceptor authorized capability, although we never \nbuilt it. We have now built up to 2,000 warheads, and we have an \nauthorized 100-interceptor capability. The blue line here is the \ndefensive warheads, or the defensive missile capability.\n  So you have 6,000 warheads existing, and a 60-to-1 ratio, because you \ncan only intercept 100 at the absolute most, because you get 1 for 1. \nUnder START II, that ratio would be 35 to 1, because you would have \n3,500 warheads and you still have 100 authorized interceptors. Under \nSTART III, it would be 20 to 1, because you would have 2,000 warheads, \n100 interceptors. Even if Minister Sergeyev is correct, as I said, you \nwould have no more than 1,500 warheads in the Soviet Union and you \nwould have 100 interceptors, for a 15-to-1 ratio--15-to-1 ratio. That \nis still greater than the ratio that existed at the time of the signing \nof the ABM Treaty, the time and the age we are trying to go back to and \npreserve. This is the way things ought to be--1974, a ratio of 10-to-1, \noffensive weapons to interceptors. That was strategic stability. That \nwas the ratio, the parity that we wanted, and so we negotiated it. That \nis what is in jeopardy now.\n\n  That is what is in jeopardy now, Madam President? If you give the \nother side the absolute maximum of a 1-to-1 kill ratio, you hit 100 \nmissiles with 100 interceptors, the ratio today at 15 to 1 is still a \ngreater ratio than 10 to 1. How could the Russians be more threatened \ntoday with a 15-to-1 ratio of offensive over defensive capability when \nthey were perfectly happy to sign the ABM Treaty back in 1974 with a \n10-to-1 ratio? How could this be more destabilizing? How could any \nSenator argue against the protection of the American people today \nbecause it would threaten the Russians because it would be \ndestabilizing, it would create a worse situation than existed back in \n1974, when the ratio then was 10 to 1? And it would be 50 percent more \nthan that today--15 to 1.\n\n[[Page S2644]]\n\n  You cannot argue it; it is illogical. And for the Russians to contend \notherwise would be irresponsible. Certainly for us to act on behalf of \ntheir irrational objections would be irresponsible on our part.\n  Incidentally, I might add that this Nation that will allegedly be so \nangered and concerned about the deployment of our limited defense has \nthe world's only ABM system, nuclear armed, recently upgraded, now in \nits fourth generation. It is deployed around Moscow with all 100 \ninterceptor missiles allowed under the ABM Treaty. So how is it that a \ncomparable U.S. system cannot be deployed without unduly angering the \nRussian leadership? They have 100 very modern interceptor missiles \ntoday. We have none. So if we have 100 just like they have, how is that \ngoing to be destabilizing? It is we who should be arguing about \ninstability, not the Russians.\n  I think the argument that strategic stability would be somehow upset \nif the United States did what the ABM Treaty authorizes, and that is \ncreate a capability to intercept first 20 and then 100 missiles, would \nhardly be destabilizing, at least to the point that we should delay or \npreclude ourselves from doing it.\n  Obviously, the Russians will complain; it is in their interest to do \nso. Although the cold war has ended and we still enjoy a much more \npositive relationship with the Russians, all traces of rivalry have not \ndisappeared. They still find it in their interest when possible to work \nin ways inimical to U.S. interests, and they know that our \ndefenselessness against ballistic missile attack constrains our actions \naround the world, and that, in the Russian view, is not necessarily a \nbad thing.\n  So one realistically understands that there will be objections, but \none must realistically evaluate those objections. I wish my colleague \nwho just spoke a few minutes ago, who so tortuously examined all of the \nreasons why we could not move forward with this--it is going to cost a \nlot, the technology is hard, diplomatically we need to think of how the \nRussians would feel--I wish that we were as concerned about the threat \nto the United States as we are the feelings of the Russian leadership. \nAnd I wish we were as concerned about our ability to project our \nnational interests in our foreign policy against the threat of rogue \nnations such as the Irans and the Iraqs and the North Koreans of the \nworld as we are about the feelings of the Russians. Russian soldiers \nand scientists understand the reality that is portrayed on these charts \njust as well as we do, and we know that a very limited missile defense \nsystem that we have the right to deploy in no way threatens strategic \nstability, no matter how loudly they may protest that it does. Our \nrelationship with Russia is something that must be taken very \nseriously, but it cannot prevent us from taking reasonable actions to \ndefend the American people against threats from other countries. The \nday that we conclude that unduly taking Russian concerns into account \nwould inhibit our ability to defend ourselves is the day we have to \nmove forward.\n\n  So, in summary, strategic stability as defined by the other side in \nthis debate, the ABM Treaty at the time that it was negotiated, which \ncreated a 10-to-1 advantage of strategic offensive over defensive \nweapons, that 10-to-1 ratio is not degraded even under the worst set of \nconditions that one might imagine in terms of our ability to defend \nourselves here, or I should say even under the best of conditions \nbecause the ratio will still be 15 to 1 under this condition. It is \nmore likely to be in the neighborhood of 20 to 1 or 35 to 1, the point \nbeing that no Russian could feel threatened with this kind of \nrelationship if they didn't feel threatened back here anyway. And this \ndefines the golden mean, remember.\n  With respect to the cost, I think I have covered that. Even this \nadministration is willing to add money to the budget to pay for what it \nbelieves will be a system that it can build when it is technologically \nfeasible. Recognizing that the technology is hard, we provide in this \namendment that it is our policy to deploy as soon as is technologically \npossible an effective missile defense system.\n  So we are not saying deploy something that is not technologically \npossible. Yes, we know technology is hard, but we also know we can get \nthere, the administration believes, by about the year 2005.\n  So to the thought we should not be rushing forward with this \namendment, I simply say how long do you want to leave the American \npeople vulnerable? How valuable is it to you to leave the American \npeople vulnerable to a missile attack, or to leave our Nation subject \nto blackmail, to the threat of such an attack; to prevent us, for \nexample, from defending our friends in South Korea because the North \nKoreans have a nuclear weapon with a missile capable of hitting Alaska \nor Hawaii; to prevent us from defending Taiwan against Chinese \naggression because they have missiles that can reach Los Angeles; to \nprevent us from supporting a country like Japan or any of the other \ninterests that we may have around the world?\n  Eventually, it boils down to this: We have an obligation to defend \nthe American people. We will have the technological capability of doing \nthat soon in the next century. There is a threat to the American people \ntoday. The cost of building a national missile defense is not \nprohibitive. Even if it were 1 percent of the defense budget, it would \nnot be prohibitive--I submit, even if it were 10 percent, but it is \nobviously not going to cost that much.\n  So given the nature of the threat, given the fact that technology is \ntaken into account in this proposal, that it clearly is not going to \ncost too much even by this administration's analysis, and the fact that \nit will not disrupt strategic stability in the world, it seems to me \nthat we would be derelict in our duty as representatives of the people \nnot to move forward.\n  The first step in moving forward is to adopt this simple resolution \nbecause, as is clear from the debate on the other side, unless we are \ncommitted to deploying a national missile defense, we are going to find \nexcuses for not doing it. And until the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives pass a resolution that says we are going to do this, \nthe bureaucrats and the naysayers and those who don't want to do it \nwill have good reason for not moving forward. We will not have spoken \non the issue in a definitive way. That is why I applaud my colleague, \nSenator Cochran. He understands that we have to get an expression of \nserious intent in order to be able to convince the naysayers to move \nforward. And that is why adoption of this resolution is so important.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this bill when we have a chance to \ndo so; we do it with great pride and with understanding that it \nfulfills the most important responsibility we have to the American \npeople, and that is to provide for the national defense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, if I may just respond briefly to the \ncomments made by my colleague, the Senator from Arizona.\n  First, let me again emphasize something that I think is implicit in \nhis statement, and that is we all recognize the threat that is posed by \nthe potential development of intercontinental delivery systems by these \nrogue nations. No one is discounting that. That has changed the \ncalculus significantly. The question is whether we are going to move \nforward on the very simple--and one might say simplistic--criterion of \n``technologically possible,'' or if we are going to, in this \nlegislation, and in practice, address the complexities of this issue.\n  Historical analogies are never perfect, but I suspect back in the \n1930s when France was debating defense policy, the notion of building a \nseries of concrete forts along their territorial line was not only \ntechnologically feasible but ultimately was constructed. But when it \ncame to 1940, the Maginot Line just did not work to defend the people \nof France. I am not suggesting we are in the same type of debate, but I \nthink it is sometimes too alluring to think in the simple terms of: If \nwe have the technology of doing something, let's do it--particularly \nwhen we get to the issue of national missile defense.\n  The Senator talked about a window of vulnerability, and there is \nincreasing potential, because of the development of these missiles by \nNorth Korea and others, of threats to our territory. But I ask that we \nthink also of the potential vulnerability if Russia, for example, \ndecides, because of our actions, to abandon reasonable arms control;\n\n[[Page S2645]]\n\ndecides, instead, to walk away from START II, to keep their launchers, \ntheir land-based systems with multiple independent reentry vehicles \nwhich complicate our defense enormously; if it decides, in fact, to \nmore aggressively deploy its submarines with cruise missiles that may \nhave nuclear warheads, all of which could easily defeat the system that \nwe are proposing to spend billions of dollars on today to counter a \nlimited military threat.\n  Put that new sort of spirit--an ill spirit, I should suggest--\ntogether with what one can see as a decaying command and control system \nand we might be increasing our vulnerabilities by moving forward with \nthis particular legislation.\n  I think we have to be sensitive to those issues. I would not readily \naccept the notion that simply because of the number of launchers that \nwe have, the number of launchers that they have, that the Russians \nwould simply disregard our unilateral abandonment of the ABM as not a \nthreat to them.\n  We feel threatened, I think with good reason, when the North \nKoreans--a very, very remote and ill-prepared power--begin to \nexperiment with intercontinental ballistic missiles which would have a \ncapability years from now. To hear on the floor the suggestion that the \nRussians will just casually shrug their shoulders, although we have \nmade no attempt to renegotiate the ABM and we will have a law that says \nwe have to put the system in place as soon as we can technologically do \nit, I think misreads their character and, frankly, the predictable \ncharacter of any country--particularly one like Russia which sees its \nnational greatness eroding greatly, to react, perhaps not rationally \nbut predictably--to not be cooperative, in fact creating more \nvulnerability.\n\n  The issue, too, of how much is too much, is a question that can be \nraised in every context. But, frankly, we all understand that there are \nopportunity costs, not with respect to using defense dollars for other \nnondefense matters, but within the context of defense. Take, for \nexample, not the theoretical but the operational possibility of an \nenhanced submarine fleet which the Russians might deploy with cruise \nmissiles. By the way, those cruise missiles launched reasonably close \nto our shores could not be countered by any type of national missile \ndefense, C-1, C-2, or C-3.\n  So, in respect to what we have to do, I think we have to ask \nourselves, for one thing, is this the wisest course of action? Are we \ntruly protecting the American public? And there can be many answers to \nthat question. But I hope, in the course of this debate and in the \nconclusion of this debate, we will simply embrace the reality of the \nsituation. It is not one dimensional. It is not just technological \nfeasibility. It has to do with cost, it has to do with threat, it has \nto do with the evolution of a threat. It has to do with already-\nexisting agreements with respect to international arms control.\n  If we reflect those issues in our legislation, we will find, I \nsuspect, unanimous support for a strong message which would correspond \nwith the administration's message on national missile defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the \nCochran-Inouye Missile Defense Act because I think it is long overdue \nthat this Senate take an action that is so very crucial to the security \nof our Nation. I commend Senator Cochran and Senator Inouye for trying \nso hard to get our Congress to move forward, to deploy this defense \nsystem in the face of opposition from the President of the United \nStates.\n  I appreciate that they have twice come to the Senate and twice been \nfilibustered and have been unable to set this very important national \nsecurity policy. In fact, the question is, Shall it be the policy of \nthe United States to deploy, as soon as technologically possible, an \neffective national missile defense capable of defending the United \nStates against limited ballistic missile attacks? It is a very simple \nquestion, and most people in this country think we already have a \ndefense to an in-coming ballistic missile. But in fact we do not.\n  We now know that Chinese missiles can reach our mainland. In a few \nshort years, Iran, Iraq and North Korea could also be able to attack \nthe United States. Today, we cannot defend the people of our country \nnor any place in the world where we have troops on the ground.\n  The Clinton administration said that we would have 15 years' warning \nfor missiles from North Korea and Iran, but the Rumsfeld report said \nthe danger could arise at any time. I commend former Secretary of \nDefense and former Congressman Don Rumsfeld for really delving into \nthis issue in a very bipartisan commission. He had a very tough row to \nhoe. But he said we are going to get to the bottom of this and he did \nnot stop until he had a unanimous report from his commission, some of \nwhom were naysayers in the beginning, that said this danger is upon us \nand we better do something about it. He gave us the wake-up call, and \nwe should be forever grateful to Don Rumsfeld for having the guts to \nget to the truth so we would have the facts to back up the need for \nthis security for our country.\n  Unfortunately, U.S. espionage has shown that China has tremendously \nboosted its military space and missile capabilities. There is just no \ngood argument against this resolution.\n  The bill has support from both sides of the aisle. It really shows \nthat people are beginning to be aware that we have a security threat to \nthe United States. This bill is not what many of the critics have said. \nIt does not mandate a missile defense architecture. It does not \nauthorize a particular funding level. It is not a production decision, \nand it doesn't lead to the signing of any contracts. Instead, it is a \npolicy statement by the Senate of the United States. But it is an \nimportant step for our national security.\n  America, the innovative Nation that landed a man on the Moon, has \nbuilt up an impressive array of antimissile technology. We have had a \nformal missile defense program since President Ronald Reagan launched \nSDI in 1983, and there were various antimissile technologies in \nresearch before that. An operational system is now within our reach. \nThe experts say we could have one in 2 years, 3 years, perhaps 4. But \nbecause of misinformation, this promising system remains confined to \nthe laboratory, and the Government has never taken the policy step that \nis illustrated in this bill.\n  As long as we continue to ignore this basic policy question, we won't \nhave an antimissile protection for our country, nor an effective \ntheater defense for our forces and allies abroad. We have a chance to \ntake that first step, and it is time that we did this.\n  What do the opponents of a missile defense system fear so much that \nthey will not even permit us to go forward to try to get the technology \nin place? The danger of ballistic missiles can no longer be ignored. \nThe Clinton administration stubbornly sticks to the old ABM Treaty.\n  In a letter to Senator Levin on February 3, the President's National \nSecurity Adviser, Sandy Berger wrote:\n\n       . . . a decision regarding national missile defense \n     deployment must also be addressed within the context of the \n     ABM treaty and our objectives for achieving future reductions \n     in strategic offensive arms through START II and START III. \n     The ABM treaty remains a cornerstone of strategic stability. \n     . . .\n\n  The letter promises a Presidential veto of this measure if it is \npassed in its present form. Our choice is clear. We deploy a missile \ndefense system as soon as technologically feasible, or we hide behind a \n25-year-old treaty with a country that no longer exists. In fact, many \nlegal and treaty scholars believe that as a matter of international \nlaw, the treaty terminated when the U.S.S.R. collapsed. How anyone can \nbelieve that the ABM Treaty is the cornerstone of strategic stability, \nwhen so many nations outside the treaty are flagrantly ignoring its \nprinciples, I do not understand, when nearly three dozen countries are \nbuilding or transferring ballistic missile technology. How does the ABM \nTreaty protect us from high-tech missiles in North Korea, in Iran, in \nIraq and in China?\n  In fact, Mr. President, the White House cannot even say who the \ntreaty partner is right now. To solve that problem, the administration \nnegotiated a new ABM Treaty, signed in 1997 in New York, that would \nmake\n\n[[Page S2646]]\n\nRussia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan parties to the new treaty. It \nwould also impose new limits on the most promising theater missile \ndefenses, limits that were never envisioned in the ABM Treaty of 1972. \nThe New York treaty would handcuff us, crippling our defenses.\n  Where is that treaty now? The Senate has gone on record on several \noccasions insisting that the new treaty be submitted for our \nconstitutionally required advice and consent, but the President has \nconsistently refused to submit the treaty that would put new countries \ninto it to the Senate for ratification.\n\n  Have we learned nothing from the Rumsfeld Commission report, from the \ntest of a three-stage ICBM by North Korea that went right over Japan \nwhere we have thousands of troops on the ground, from the launch of \nIran's Shahab-3, from China's own threats? Eight years after the fall \nof the U.S.S.R., we are still fighting the last war. We are basing our \nsafety in the cold war strategy of arms control with Russia, coupled \nwith deliberate vulnerability to missile attack.\n  Polls show that most Americans believe we have antiballistic missile \nprotection. Can you imagine our country being vulnerable and not even \ntaking the first step, the first step to a policy that says we are not \ngoing to leave ourselves open when countries are threatening that they \nhave ballistic missiles that will reach our shores, based on an \nobsolete treaty that is not even in the best interest of Russia, which \nis the country that this administration says is the other party to the \ntreaty? I think we would sit down with Russia, and it would be in both \nour best interests to have a defense for both of our countries from \nrogue nations that have already shown that they have ballistic missile \ncapabilities, and some even have nuclear capabilities to put right on \none of those ballistic missiles.\n  Mr. President, there is no responsibility any greater for the U.S. \nSenate than the security of our country. That we would not pass the \nCochran-Inouye resolution immediately and go forward with a technology \nthat would protect our country is unthinkable; it is unthinkable. Yet, \nwe have seen a filibuster of this very resolution twice in the last \nyear in the U.S. Senate. I urge my colleagues not to let one more day \npass that this country is not in high gear, pursuing the security of \nour Nation and our forces in any theater in the field and our allies \nwho depend on us for their protection as well.\n  Mr. President, we should not let another day pass or we will be \nwalking away from one of the key responsibilities that Congress has, \nand that is to stand up to the President of the United States, to admit \nthat the ABM Treaty is obsolete and no longer in the best interest of \nthe former U.S.S.R., nor the United States of America, and to say we \nare going to protect the people of America and the troops that are \nfighting for our freedom wherever they may be in the world, that we \nwould protect them from an incoming ballistic missile with nuclear, \nchemical or biological capabilities. That is the statement that we will \nbe making if we pass the Cochran-Inouye bill. I urge my colleagues to \ndo it, hopefully very soon, to start the first step.\n  This does not appropriate the money. It doesn't designate the \nauthorization. It only says it is the policy of this country to go \nforward to make the technology something that will work and to put our \nvery best minds on this issue. Then we will authorize it. Then we will \nappropriate for it. We cannot shirk this responsibility, Mr. President.\n  Once again, I thank Senator Cochran and I thank Senator Inouye for \nbeing determined that on their watch we will do the right thing for the \npeople of the United States of America and all of our allies, wherever \nthey may need us in the future.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, first let me thank the distinguished \nSenator from Texas for her remarks on the bill and other Senators who \nhave spoken today on both sides of the aisle on this subject. I think \nwe have a better understanding now of this issue.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Seeing no other Senators seeking recognition on the \nfloor at this time, in behalf of the majority leader, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate resume the pending missile defense bill at \n11:30 a.m. on Tuesday and at that time there be 1 hour for debate on \nthe pending Cochran amendment, with a vote to occur on or in relation \nto that amendment No. 69 at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday and that no other \namendments be in order prior to that vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there is no objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

A bill to solidify the off-budget status of the old-age, \nsurvivors, and disability insurance program under title II of the \nSocial Security Act and to protect program assets; to the Committee on \nthe Budget and the Committee on Governmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant \nto the order of August 4, 1977, with instructions that if one committee \nreports, the committee have 30 days to report or be discharged.\n\n[[Page S2649]]\n\n             social security fiscal protection act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on tomorrow afternoon, we begin to mark \nup the budget. That is, when I say we, I mean that the Budget Committee \non the Senate side meets to mark up the budget for the year 2000 \ncommencing October 1 this year, and immediately we will hear the cry, \n``Surplus.''\n  I am constrained to say--as in the earliest days of the Republic when \nPatrick Henry said, ``Peace, Peace, everywhere men cry peace,'' and \nthere was no peace--``surplus, surplus, everywhere men cry surplus,'' \nbut there is no surplus.\n  The fact is that we are spending $100 billion more than we are taking \nin already this fiscal year, and under current policy the deficit for \nnext year will be right at $90 billion.\n  Also, Mr. President, another thing to note is the fact that you are \ngoing to hear the cry, ``Saving Social Security.'' I can tell you \ncategorically that neither the Republican plan, policy or approach nor \nthe Democratic White House plan, policy or approach will save Social \nSecurity. Both spend 100 percent of the Social Security moneys coming \nin the fiscal year 2000, as is the case already this year. And \notherwise, all the wonderful talk about paying down the debt is nothing \nmore than fancy rhetoric for a flawed policy that has got us into a \nsituation of fiscal cancer.\n  Now let me go right to the meaning of ``Surplus.'' Yes, we are making \nprogress on the budget and the deficit. At a news conference earlier \ntoday I was asked about this and when did we ever expect to get some \nresults. Well, I see that we are beginning to understand that there is \nno surplus. Most of the nation's astute commentators on the budget see \nthis, too. Allan Sloan of Newsweek said, of course, that the \nPresident's plan was double accounting. Paul Samuelson talks about when \nthey said ``surplus,'' it was ``surplus in the sky.'' The Concord \nCoalition, made up of our former colleagues, Senators Rudman and Nunn, \nwith whom I have had an on-going engagement, finally says there is no \nsurplus. And only two weeks ago Barron's, the conservative financial \nnewspaper--which I hold it here--said: ``Hey, Guys, There is no Budget \nSurplus.''\n  But be that as it may, the White House and many members of Congress \nare going to start dealing around the so-called surplus, nonexistent \nthat it is, for education, Medicare, tax cuts, anything and \neverything--everything but saving Social Security. It has been a \nconstant charade on messages of the party caucuses on both sides since \nJanuary, even during the impeachment days; we have got to get our \nmessage out. Unfortunately, most of the media falls right in line with \nthe message. They don't look into the actual fact or the reality.\n  On the matter of the so-called surplus and the $100 billion that we \nare spending now: mind you me, Mr. President, we set spending caps year \nbefore last, and last year we broke the caps by $12 billion, and we \nhave already broken the cap in this year's budget by $21 billion, which \nwould mean in marking up 2000's budget we would immediately have to cut \nspending $33 billion to conform to the fiscal year 2000 budget cap.\n  Instead of doing that, we have already met in unison, almost like a \nchorus singing ``Whoopee for the military,'' and we have spent $18 \nbillion on the military, money which is unaccounted for. Instead of \ncutting back, the Senate has already exceeded the agreed-to caps by $18 \nbillion. Unless, of course, they intend to cut $18 billion in domestic \nprograms or cut $18 billion in operation, maintenance and readiness \nwithin the defense budget.\n  We are going in the wrong direction. No one should think that Social \nSecurity has a surplus. This fiscal year, we have a surplus of the \namount required to be paid out, but since we have been spending it each \nyear there is a $730 billion deficit due and owing. Social Security is \nin the red.\n  So there are no surpluses. Even trying to get around that to try to \nget something to politic on for this year and next year, the Campaign \n2000, they say, ``Well, wait a minute; we will start our tax cuts in \nthe year 2002 when there is one document to the effect there might be a \nslight surplus in Social Security, over and above the Social Security \namount or otherwise we can spend it on Medicare beginning in 2000''--\nanything for the Campaign 2000.\n  They talk in the Chamber about the Chinese. Come, come, come. It is \nnot the Chinese. It is not the baby boomers in the next generation. It \nis the adults in Congress who are looting the Social Security trust \nfund. Each one of these particular plans spends 100 percent of the \nSocial Security so-called surplus.\n  How do I say that? Well, it is easy. You go back into the original \nlaw--and I have a copy of the law itself--section 201.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      The Social Security Act (Act of August 14, 1935) [H.R. 7260]\n\n\n       Title II--Federal Old-Age Benefits Old-Age Reserve Account\n\n       Section 201. (a) There is hereby created an account in the \n     Treasury of the United States to be known as the Old-Age \n     Reserve Account hereinafter in this title called the Account. \n     There is hereby authorized to be appropriated to the Account \n     for each fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year ending \n     June 30, 1937, an amount sufficient as an annual premium to \n     provide for the payments required under this title, such \n     amount to be determined on a reserve basis in accordance with \n     accepted actuarial principles, and based upon such tables of \n     mortality as the Secretary of the Treasury shall from time to \n     time adopt, and upon an interest rate of 3 per centum per \n     annum compounded annually. The Secretary of the Treasury \n     shall submit annually to the Bureau of the Budget an estimate \n     of the appropriations to be made to the Account.\n       (b) It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury \n     to invest such portion of the amounts credited to the Account \n     as is not, in his judgment, required to meet current \n     withdrawals. Such investment may be made only in interest-\n     bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations \n     guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United \n     States. For such purpose such obligations may be acquired (1) \n     on original issue at par, or (2) by purchase of outstanding \n     obligations at the market price. The purposes for which \n     obligations of the United States may be issued under the \n     Second Liberty Bond Act, as amended, are hereby extended to \n     authorize the issuance at par of special obligations \n     exclusively to the Account. Such special obligations shall \n     bear interest at the rate of 3 per centum per annum. \n     Obligations other than such special obligations may be \n     acquired for the Account only on such terms as to provide an \n     investment yield of not less than 3 per centum per annum.\n       (c) Any obligations acquired by the Account (except special \n     obligations issued exclusively to the Account) may be sold at \n     the market price, and such special obligations may be \n     redeemed at par plus accrued interest.\n       (d) The interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or \n     redemption of, any obligations held in the Account shall be \n     credited to and form a part of the Account.\n       (e) All amounts credited to the Account shall be available \n     for making payments required under this title.\n       (f) The Secretary of the Treasury shall include in his \n     annual report the actuarial status of the Account.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I will send that momentarily to the \ndesk, section 201 of the Social Security Act. Under section 201 of \nSocial Security, we required at this moment--and have been doing so for \nyears--under law to invest only and immediately in T-bills, Treasury \nbills, these special securities of the Federal Government. Once we do \nthat, of course, we get a bond or IOU; the Government gets the money, \nand immediately all of those moneys are transferred to the Government \naccount and it is spent, allocated, or used to pay down the so-called \npublic debt.\n  The one way to stop that is a bill, which I will send to the desk and \nfor which I request proper referral. Mr. President, this bill simply \nsays, amongst other things--and I will read section 5--that:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, throughout each \n     month that begins after October 1, 1999, the Secretary of \n     Treasury shall maintain, in a secure repository or \n     repositories, cash in a total amount equal to the total \n     redemption value of all obligations issued to the Federal \n     Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal \n     Disability Insurance Trust Fund pursuant to section 201(d) of \n     the Social Security Act that are outstanding on the first day \n     of each month.\n\n  Advisedly, Mr. President, this was worked out by none other than my \nSocial Security friends. At one time, I had the distinction of being \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee. We had an outstanding staffer \nthen named Ken Apfel. He is now the Social Security Administrator. I \ncalled over there and I said: Let's stop this roundabout dance\n\n[[Page S2650]]\n\nabout surpluses and spending all the money and everything else; I want \nyou to write a provision whereby we can do exactly what we said when \nCongress passed the Social Security Act.\n  Remember old John Mitchell, under the Nixon administration? He said, \n``Watch what we do, not what we say.'' I am afraid on budget matters we \nhave arrived exactly at that point. But, in any event, to do what we \nsay, we have prepared this bill and now it has been introduced and, if \npassed by the Congress, yes, we will save Social Security.\n  Immediately, one of the distinguished Senators said, ``Wait a minute. \nIs the money going to just sit there?''\n  No. Mr. President, that money will be invested in T-bills, just as it \nhas been all these years. Or, if there is an additional plan, like the \nKerrey-Moynihan plan, like our Thrift Savings Plan--a certain \npercentage invested in the market in order to make more money but take \non more risk--we can debate that. What this particular bill really does \nis save Social Security. Social Security funds will not be spent, save \nand excepting on Social Security purposes.\n  This is exactly what was intended by Mr. Greenspan when he headed the \nGreenspan Commission in 1983. In 1983, section 21 of the Greenspan \nCommission report said to take Social Security outside of the unified \nbudget, outside of the unified deficit, and set it aside in trust. I \nstruggled from 1983 until 1990 to translate Chairman Greenspan's \nrecommendations into law. I thought we had done it in 1990, when we \npassed the Budget Act by a vote of 98 Senators here on the floor of the \nSenate and almost an equal majority, overwhelming as it was, over on \nthe House side. President Bush, on November 5, 1990, signed the bill \ninto law, including section 13301 of the Budget Act, which stated \nCongress could not spend Social Security moneys on anything other than \nthe Social Security program; you had it outside of the unified budget \nand the deficit.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, that has been ignored. That is why I \nhave to reword it this way. But the contemplation at the particular \ntime, the law itself, the policy of the U.S. Government with respect to \ncorporate America--we passed the Pension Reform Act of 1994 saying: \nThou shalt not, in corporate America, spend your pension fund to pay \noff the company debt.\n  The most interesting and ironic thing is, when Denny McLain, the \nformer great pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, became the head of a \ncorporation and paid off its debt with the pension fund, he was sent to \njail for 8 years. If you can find what jail poor Denny is in, say to \nhim, ``Denny, next time, run for the U.S. Senate. Instead of a jail \nterm, they will give you the good government award.''\n  That is exactly what we are doing. We violate our own policy. We pay \noff the debt with the Social Security Trust Fund and have been doing it \nfor 15 years.\n  That gets me immediately to the point of so-called paying off the \npublic debt. You know, they have these euphemisms and different \nexpressions that come around budget time and make you think you have a \nreal policy on board. That has been the policy.\n  Admittedly, if you had a stagnant economy, if you had a dormant stock \nmarket, you could welcome paying off the public debt to get the economy \nand the stock market moving and everything else. But to do it, not over \njust a year or 2, but to do it for the last 15 years to the tune of in \nexcess of $100 billion, what it has really done is given us fiscal \ncancer. We have gone up, up, and away with the national debt, and the \ninterest costs are killing us.\n  Let me dwell a minute on the interest costs on the national debt. The \ninterest cost, when President Lyndon Johnson last balanced the budget, \nwas $16 billion. Today the interest cost is projected to be $357 \nbillion, almost a billion dollars a day. What it says to me is, this \nyear I have to spend--and next year I have to spend--$357 billion for \nnothing. If I had been fiscally prudent, I could have had $80 billion \nfor tax cuts plus $80 billion for spending increases plus $80 billion \nto pay down the debt plus $80 billion to save Social Security. That is \n$320 billion. I would have had $37 billion for you to have a party out \nhere on the west front when I jump off the Capitol dome.\n  Since 1995, I have been telling Chairman Domenici, trying to bring \nsense to this entire budget debate by talking in the extreme, that by \nthe year 2002, if he had a balanced budget, truly balanced--if we were \npaying out less than what we were bringing in or just at that amount--I \nwould jump off the Capitol dome. And I reiterate the pledge. Let's make \nthe bets--``Get old Hollings to jump off the dome.'' Because under \ncurrent policies, no one can possibly balance the budget while \nexceeding revenue by over $100 billion. Nobody is cutting $100 billion. \nThey are spending $18 billion more unaccounted for, breaking the caps. \nNobody is spending less than $90 billion. So we know with all of this \nspending for tax cuts, Medicare, education, housing, and everything \nelse of that kind, that we are in deep trouble.\n  We have fiscal cancer. What we really should do, probably, as Mr. \nGreenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve, finally came around to \nsaying, is do nothing: take this year's budget for next year. I did \nthat as the Governor of South Carolina. I capped the debt. By the way, \nthat would bring truth in budgeting to this crowd, if they are right. \nLet's plead guilty: They are right, I am wrong, there is a surplus and \nwe are going to pay down the debt. If that occurs, we can cap the debt \nas of October 1 of this year, the beginning of the next fiscal year. \nWhatever it is, since there is a surplus and since we are going to pay \ndown the debt, let's cap it so it does not exceed that particular \namount.\n  You cannot get the White House--I faced them down in one of these \nbriefings--to go along with it. I will make the motion and we will see \nhow many people vote for that.\n  I am trying to bring truth to our federal budget. I am trying to \navoid the fiscal cancer. The Republicans talk about an $80 billion \nacross-the-board tax cut. I want a $357 billion tax cut this year, next \nyear, and right along the line. I want, in that 10-year period, $3.5 \ntrillion in tax cuts, not just this $800 billion tax cut. I want to get \nrid of this waste in Government.\n  I served on the Grace Commission to Eliminate Waste. I know what \nwaste is. I speak advisedly. Before long, if those interest rates go \nup, instead of $357 billion, we will be up around $500 billion in \ninterest costs. It is the largest item in the domestic budget for \nspending at this minute.\n  What we ought to do is get a hold of ourselves, start talking sense \nto each other, work out a plan to take care of the needs of Government, \nbut quit using the Social Security surplus and trust fund as a \npolitical slush fund for any and every idea on the media message. And \nthe media are going along with this nonsense and act like we actually \nare doing it. My particular bill will bring sobriety to the entire \nprocess and debate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 605\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Global Exploration and Development \nCorporation, Kerr-McGee Corporation, and Kerr-McGee Chemical, LLC \n(successor to Kerr-McGee Chemical Corporation), and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                          private relief bill\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I introduce S. 606 for Senator \nMack, Senator Feinstein, Senator Hatch, and myself. This bill is \nintended to resolve litigation between the federal government and Kerr-\nMcGee Corporation and Kerr-McGee Chemical, LLC (successor to Kerr-McGee \nChemical Corporation) and Global Exploration and Development \nCorporation. This legislation embodies an agreement that has been \nreviewed and accepted by the Hearing Officer and a three judge \nreviewing panel. The Department of Justice has no objection to this \nlegislation. In addition, this legislation would also make it a \ncriminal act to distribute certain information relating to explosives, \ndestructive devices, and weapons of mass destruction. This bill was \nreported by the Committee on the Judiciary in this form during the \n105th Congress.\n  As background to this relief for Kerr-McGee and Global Exploration, \nin 1964, they first filed applications for phosphate prospecting \npermits in Osceola National Forest. Under Sec. 211(a) of the Mineral \nLands Leasing Act, the Secretary can only grant prospecting permit \napplications following a determination that the public interest will be \nserved by doing so. The U.S. Forest Service must also consent to the \nissuance of the prospecting permits. The permits were granted, and the \nplaintiffs subsequently discovered phosphate deposits.\n  The plaintiffs then filed applications with the Department of \nInterior for leases to mine the deposits in January of 1969. Whether \nthe plaintiffs are entitled to leases is governed by the Mineral Lands \nLeasing Act (30 U.S.C. sec. 181 et. seq.) which requires the Secretary \nof Interior to issue leases to a permittee that has discovered a \n``valuable deposit'' of mineral. The U.S. Geological Survey, the Bureau \nof Mines and the Office of Minerals Policy Department all confirmed \nthat valuable deposits had in fact been discovered (valued at $100 to \n$300 million in 1970's dollars).\n  Kerr-McGee filed suit in 1973 and Global filed suit in 1978 seeking \nthe immediate issuance of the leases. In 1981, the U.S. Forest Service \nbegan setting out the requirements for reclamation. The Department of \nInterior concluded the reclamation technology did not exist based on an \nEnvironmental Assessment (``EA'') prepared by Interior and issued in \nJanuary of 1983. Based on that conclusion, the plaintiffs' applications \nfor leases to mine the deposits were rejected.\n  Agency personnel had told plaintiffs that they would be able to \ncomment on the EA findings before their final issuance. By law, the \ngovernment was required to permit the applicants to participate in the \nEA process by submitting comments and expert analysis on the \nfeasibility of reclamation. Plaintiffs were never given a chance to \nparticipate in the EA process, to show feasibility of reclamation, or \nto comment on the draft EA.\n\n  In 1984, the Florida Wilderness Act (Pub. L. 98-430, 98 Stat. 1665) \nwas enacted which prevented the issuance of phosphate mining leases in \nOsceola, effectively foreclosing a legal remedy since plaintiffs could \nno longer ask for reversal of the prior decision or for relief for \ndamages incurred. The House Committee Report accompanying the Act \nstated that ``in the event the courts ultimately determined that \napplicants have established lease rights, [the Act] provides that \nleases will not be issued. The applicants would instead be compensated \nas required in accordance with constitutional principles.'' H. Rpt. 98-\n102 Part I, 97th Cong., 1st Sess., at 7.\n  The plaintiffs pursued their case in federal district court and the \nCourt of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The Court of Appeals vacated the \ndistrict court's judgment and remanded the case with instructions to \ndismiss the suit as moot in light of Florida Wilderness Act. The U.S. \nCourt of Federal Claims then questioned whether or not it had \njurisdiction to hear the case, leaving plaintiffs without a forum to be \nheard.\n  Under 28 U.S.C. 2509, a congressional reference empowers a judge of \nthe Court of Federal Claims to sit as a Hearing Officer, hold a hearing \nand determine the facts of the case. The Hearing Officer's findings and \nconclusions are then reviewed by a three-judge panel. The panel then \nadopts or modifies the findings and conclusions and submits its report \nto the Chief Judge who then transmits the recommendations to the house \nof Congress which referred the case.\n  On Jan. 10, 1991, H. Res. 29 and H.R. 477 were introduced during the \n102nd Congress to refer the case to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in \norder to compensate plaintiffs for any damages incurred on account of \nthe failure of the Secretary of the Interior to grant and permit mining \noperations pursuant to phosphate leases in the Osceola National Forest. \nOn July 10, 1991, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative \nLaw and Government Relations held hearings on H.R. 477 and H. Res. 29. \nOn October 3, 1991, the Subcommittee reported the resolution, with a \ntechnical amendment, to full Committee. On July 21, 1992, the House of \nRepresentatives passed H. Res. 29, referring H.R. 477 to Court of \nClaims. The formal Congressional reference confirmed jurisdiction for \nthe plaintiffs' suit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.\n  In the Court of Federal Claims, the Government moved for summary \njudgement. The Court ruled that plaintiffs did not have a legal claim \nbut did have an equitable claim since the government failed to comply \nwith the legal requirement of the EA. The court ruled that the \nSecretary of Interior had made an error in denying phosphate mining \nleases on the basis of an EA without allowing plaintiffs the \nopportunity to comment. The court concluded that the error was not \nharmless.\n  Remaining was the question of fact whether reclamation was feasible, \naccording to Forest Service standards as of January of 1983. A 6 week \nevidentiary hearing was held on that issue from October 13 to December \n14, 1995. Plaintiffs presented leading experts in reclamation who \nshowed they could have successfully reclaimed the land, that the \nanalysis in the EA was scientifically incorrect, and that EA members \nwho concluded successful reclamation had their conclusions omitted.\n  Before the court issued its opinion, the parties agreed to a joint \nstipulation of settlement and submitted this stipulation to the Court: \nGlobal is to received $9.5 million; Kerr-McGee is to receive $10 \nmillion, which it will return to the government as partial payment for \na Superfund cleanup site in Louisiana; and Kerr-McGee Chemical LLC is \nto receive $0. Global, Kerr-McGee and the Department of Justice \naccepted the report of the Hearing Officer, dated November 18, 1996, \nand the Review Panel endorsed the decision.\n  On November 18, 1996, the court published its recommendations to \nCongress that the disputes be settled for the amounts set forth in the \njoint stipulation of settlement. The court's recommendation was based \non a finding that the settlement was fair, just, equitable and \nsupported by the evidence. As noted in the Hearing Officer's report, \n``if the case were to proceed to final disposition and plaintiffs to \nprevail, then the Government would face a potential liability \nsubstantially in excess of the proposed settlement amounts. Conversely, \nhowever, a victory for the Government would not assure it of protection \nagainst all future liability.''\n\n[[Page S2652]]\n\n  This legislation would implement this settlement, and we urge its \nprompt consideration and approval by the Senate.\n  For the information of all Senators, I have included the House \nCommittee Report from the 105th Congress which provides a very clear \nbackground and the need for this provision.\n  In addition, the bill includes language related to the prohibition of \ndistribution of information related to destructive devices, explosives, \nand weapons of mass destruction in furtherance of a violent crime. This \nlanguage was added to this legislation during markup of H.R. 1211 \nduring the 105th Congress in the Senate Judiciary Committee by Senator \nFeinstein  and is a reasonable resolution of an issue pushed by Senator \nFeinstein for several years.\n  I urge quick consideration and passage of this overdue and important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 606\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill reauthorize and amend the National Geologic Mapping \nAct of 1992; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n       THE NATIONAL GEOLOGIC MAPPING REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am today introducing along with Senator \nMurkowski, the National Geologic Mapping Reauthorization Act of 1999. \nThis is an act that has been very beneficial to the Nation and deserves \nto be reauthorized.\n  The National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Act (NCGMA) was originally \nsigned into law in 1992. The purpose of this geologic mapping program \nis to provide the nation with urgently needed geologic maps that can be \nand are used by a diverse clientele. These maps are vital to \nunderstanding groundwater regimes, mineral resources, geologic hazards \nsuch as landslides and earthquakes, geology essential for all types of \nland use planning, as well as providing basic scientific data. The \nNCGMA contains three parts; FedMap--the U.S. Geological Survey's \ngeologic mapping program, StateMap--the state geological survey's part \nof the act, and EdMap--a program to encourage the training of future \ngeologic mappers at our colleges and universities.\n  StateMap is a competitive program wherein the states submit proposals \nfor geologic mapping that are critiqued by a peer review panel. A \nrequirement of this section of the legislation is that each federal \ndollar be matched one-for-one with state funds. Each participating \nstate has a StateMap Advisory Committee to insure that its proposal \naddresses priority areas and needs. The success of this program insured \nreauthorization of similar legislation in 1997 with widespread \nbipartisan support in both the House and Senate.\n  According to a recent poll conducted by the Association of American \nState Geologists, the 50 states have produced over 1,900 new geologic \nmaps since the program authorized by this legislation started. There \nare an additional 300 maps currently being completed. Also, the states \nhave digitized 650 existing geologic maps (1:24,000 scale) so they can \nbe used as a computer data base. All of these maps have been submitted \nto the U.S. Geological Survey for inclusion in a national geologic map \ndatabase. One of the purposes of this database is to eventually provide \na digital geologic map of the entire nation at a scale of 1:100,000. \nThis national database will assure that future maps will be easy to use \nby anyone.\n  The Edmap and Fedmap sections of the legislation support mapping \nprojects led by Universities and regional mapping projects that address \nneeds for geologic information to deal with land, water, mineral \nresource, natural hazard mitigation and environmental protection \nissues. Fed map projects are coordinated with State and university \nmapping portions of the program, through regional meetings, liaison \ngroups and national reviews of ongoing projects.\n  Mr. President, the National Geologic Mapping Reauthorization Act \nbenefits numerous citizens every day by assuring there is accurate and \nusable geologic information available to communities and individuals so \nbetter and safer resource use decisions can be made. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this legislation and am committed to its timely \nconsideration.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 607\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                    nuclear waste policy act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with my \ncolleague, Senator Frank Murkowski of Alaska, chairman of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, and Senator Rod Grams to introduce the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1999.\n  Once again, Congress must clarify its intention toward the disposal \nof spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste. It is for this reason that I \nintroduced the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997, which passed with \nbroad bipartisan support in this body last year, as did similar \nlegislation in the other body. It is why I am an original cosponsor of \nthe legislation this year.\n  We must resolve the problem that this Nation faces with disposing of \nnuclear materials. Congress must recognize its responsibility to set a \nclear and definitive nuclear material disposal policy. With the passage \nof this legislation in the last Congress, the Senate expressed its will \nthat Government fulfill its responsibilities. This legislation makes \none significant change to the course we are currently on by directing \nthat an interim storage facility for nuclear materials be constructed \nat area 25 at the Nevada test site and that the interim facility be \nprepared to accept nuclear materials by June 30, 2003.\n  The President and the Vice President do not support this provision. \nThey do not support an interim storage facility at one safe, secure \nlocation in the Nevada desert. What they do support, according to \nEnergy Secretary Bill Richardson, is an interim storage at 70 some \nsites spread across this Nation. They support storage near population \ncenters and major bodies of water, but not at a site located right next \nto a permanent repository, a site where hundreds of nuclear explosions \nhave already been detonated over the last 50 years.\n  In an announcement last month, the administration proposes to \nfederalize storage of spent fuel at commercial reactors around this \ncountry by having the Government come in and take responsibility for \neach site. But do not worry, folks, because they promise to come and \npick up the waste eventually, or at least that is what they have been \npromising for a long, long while. Well, I have some experience with the \nDOE and its promises, as many of my colleagues have, especially in the \narea of nuclear waste over the last number of years.\n  In 1995, the Secretary of Energy promised the State of Idaho, and \nsigned a court enforceable agreement, that transuranic waste in Idaho \nwould be headed out of the State to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant no \nlater than next month. Now DOE says they can't meet that deadline. Why? \nThe Environmental Protection Agency has said that the Waste Isolation \nPilot Plant is safe and ready to receive waste, but the State of New \nMexico won't issue a permit for the disposal and that the court won't \nlift its injunction.\n  Now, I do believe our Secretary of Energy is trying in good faith to \nhonor his commitment to the State of Idaho in moving that waste, but, \nonce again, on issues of this kind of political sensitivity, our \nGovernment has shown no willingness to lead on this issue, and this \nadministration is the prime example of a government without leadership.\n  I know something about the politics of nuclear waste. I know \nsomething about DOE's broken promises. I mentioned the example of WIPP \nas a misuse of environmental regulation to subvert the will of \nCongress. It is this kind of game playing that we must eliminate.\n  I guess my bottom line advice to those living next to one of these \ncommercial nuclear reactors is, when DOE says they will come in and \ntake responsibility for spent fuel and move it later, do not be fooled. \nYou need a centralized interim storage facility and you need this \nlegislation to make it happen.\n  This administration has said that interim storage in Nevada will \nprejudge the repository site investigation now going on at Yucca \nMountain. I think it is important to note that this legislation calls \nfor beginning operation of an interim storage facility in the year \n2003, 2 years after DOE will have recommended the repository site to \nthe President and 1 year after DOE will have submitted a license \napplication for the repository to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. \nThis can hardly be called rushing ahead recklessly on interim storage. \nWhat it is is sealing the deal, trying to build credibility with the \nAmerican people on this Government's responsibility and dedication \ntoward the appropriate handling of high-level nuclear waste.\n  In addition to the billions of dollars that utility ratepayers have \ncontributed to the disposal fund, taxpayers have contributed hundreds \nof millions of dollars to the disposal program for the removal of spent \nfuel and nuclear waste from the Nation's national laboratory sites. \nThis legislation will make good on the Government's commitment to the \ncommunities which agreed to host our defense laboratories--that cleanup \nof these sites will happen, that it will happen sooner rather than \nlater, and that defense nuclear waste, our legacy from the cold war, \nwill be disposed of responsibly.\n  Just this past week, before the appropriate Appropriations Committee, \nI and Senator Domenici heard at length what this administration is \ndoing to help Russia get rid of its cold war nuclear waste legacy. \nWhile we are going headlong to help them, it is ironic that we cannot \nhelp ourselves. This administration has promised and yet, in 6 years, \nhas delivered nothing and finally gave up on its promises and found \nitself in a box canyon with a lot of lawyers lining up in lawsuits, \nbecause they are now out of compliance with an act that this Congress \npassed in the mid-1980s to deal with nuclear waste.\n\n[[Page S2655]]\n\n  This bill will assure that the spent fuel from our nuclear fighting \nships and submarines, currently stored at the Idaho National \nEngineering and Environmental Laboratory, can be sent to the interim \nstorage facility beginning in the year 2003. This is good news for both \nthe Navy and for Idaho. Our nuclear Navy ought to be concerned that DOE \nis still playing games with the real hard fact that sooner, rather than \nlater, they must have a permanent repository for spent nuclear fuel \ncoming from our Navy vessels.\n  Spent nuclear fuel will be moved out of Idaho well before the agreed \ndate of the year 2035 called for in the agreement between Idaho \nGovernor Batt, DOE and the Navy. This legislation will provide \nassurance that nuclear waste now in Idaho for permanent storage will \neventually be disposed of at the repository. The tragedy here, of \ncourse, and we understand it, in the building of safe facilities, is \nthe long lead time necessary. That is why this legislation is important \nnow, to construct an interim storage facility ready to receive by the \nyear 2003.\n  Critics of this legislation will attempt to distract you over the \nissue of transportation. In just a few months we will hear on the floor \nof the Senate the term ``mobile Chernobyl.'' This is just so much \npolitics or political statement. There is absolutely no fact or record \nbehind that statement other than a scare tactic that some of my \ncolleagues will attempt to use to support an absence of fact. The fact \nis that there have been over 2,500 commercial shipments of spent fuel \nin the United States and that there has not been a single death or \ninjury from the radioactivity nature of the cargo. In my State of \nIdaho, there have been over 600 shipments of naval fuel and over 4,000 \nother shipments of radioactive material. Again, there has been not one \nsingle injury related to the radioactive nature of these shipments.\n  This is a phenomenal safety record, but it is a real safety record, \nbecause this Government has insisted that the appropriate handling of \nour spent nuclear fuels and waste long term be dealt with in the right \nway. The proof is in the reality and the responsibility that this \ncountry has taken for years in the transportation of its waste. Those \nare the facts as I have related them.\n  I know that many people would prefer not to address the problem of \nspent nuclear fuel disposal. Some of my colleagues are probably \nfatigued at the prospect of debating this issue once again in the 106th \nCongress. Unfortunately, as long as this administration continues to \nstick its head in the sand, sand that is now going to cost millions of \ndollars in legal fees, my colleagues and I have no choice but to \naddress this issue once again for the sake of our country, for the \nfuture of energy production in our country from radioactive materials, \nand just the tremendous responsibility we have in making sure to our \npublic that all of it is done well and safely.\n  As this legislative body sets policies for the Nation, the Congress \ncannot sit by and watch while key components of the energy security of \nthis Nation, the source of 20 percent of this country's electricity--\nand that is coming from nuclear powerplants--risk going down simply \nbecause we cannot manage our waste.\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1999 will address what neither the \n1982 nor the 1987 Act did, and that is to provide a cost-effective and \nsafe means to store spent fuel in the near term while we continue to \ninvestigate and provide for the ultimate disposal.\n  I thank you, Mr. President. I see my colleague, the chairman of the \nfull committee, has joined me now on the floor. I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wish the Presiding Officer a pleasant afternoon.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Craig, for his statement relative to \nthe reality that 22 percent of the Nation's power is generated by \nnuclear energy.\n  Here we are again today, Mr. President, with an obligation to fulfill \na commitment. That obligation and that commitment was made to the \nratepayers, the individuals all over America who depend on nuclear \nenergy for their power. They paid $14 billion over the last 18 years.\n  What have they paid for? They have paid the Federal Government to \ntake the waste under contract in the year 1998. That was a year ago. \nShakespeare wrote in Henry III, ``Delays have dangerous ends. . . .'' \nWe might also add, ``expensive ends.''\n  In addition to what the ratepayers have paid, there has been over $6 \nbillion expended by the Federal Government in preparation for the waste \nprimarily at Yucca Mountain. Delay has been the administration's answer \nto the problem of what to do with nuclear waste in this country. This \nadministration simply doesn't want to take it up on its watch under any \nterms or circumstances.\n  In 1997, the administration objected to siting a temporary storage \nfacility before 1998 when the viability assessment for Yucca Mountain \nwould be complete.\n  The so-called ``dangerous ends'' to that delay is that 1998 has come \nand gone. The viability assessment was presented and guess what? There \nwere no show stoppers. Safety issues requiring that we abandon the \nproposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository project were not \ncalled for. The next step, of course, is to move on with the licensing, \nwhich is to take place in the year 2001.\n\n  What is the delay this year? It is the inability of the \nadministration to recognize its contractual commitment under the \nagreement. To his credit, the new Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson \nhas come forward with the first ever--and I mean first ever--\nadministration proposal on nuclear waste. The Department of Energy \nwould assume ownership of the used nuclear fuel and continue storing it \nat its commercial and defense sites in the 41 States across the \ncountry. The cost of the storage would be offset by consumer fees \ncollected by the Department of Energy over the past 18 years, as I have \nstated. These are fees that were to have been dedicated to the removal \nand permanent storage of the spent fuel.\n  While this proposal may seem interesting, let's reflect on it a \nlittle bit, because what it means is that there is no date certain to \nremove the waste. The waste would sit onsite near the reactors.\n  It seems that we have gone full cycle in one sense. If you recognize \nthat the Government had contracted to take the waste in 1998, the court \nhas specifically stated that the Federal Government is liable to take \nthat waste. So the court says, in effect, the Federal Government owns \nthe waste onsite.\n  The proposal is the Government take the waste onsite. In fact, it \nowns the waste anyway. Think about it. There is a duplication, of \ncourse. I have a map here that I think warrants a little consideration. \nIt shows some of the sites where we have nuclear fuel and radioactive \nwaste that is destined for the geologic disposal.\n  The commercial reactors are in brown in California, in Washington, in \nArizona, in Texas, up and down the east coast, in Illinois.\n  We have the shutdown reactors with the spent fuel onsite. These are \nthe little triangles. We have them in Oregon, California, and Illinois. \nWe have them in Michigan. This is significant amounts of waste that \nwould go to a central repository at Yucca Mountain if this \nadministration would come to grips with its responsibility.\n  Commercial spent nuclear fuel storage facilities are depicted by the \nlittle black squares. There are a few of them around.\n  Non-DOE research reactors. These are reactors that are spread through \nthe country.\n  Then we have the Navy reactor fuel in Idaho. And we have the \nDepartment of Energy-owned spent fuel, high-level radioactive waste in \nNew Mexico.\n  We have this all around the country, Mr. President, and the whole \npurpose of this legislation is to provide for and put this waste in one \ncentral repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada where it would be \nretrievable. As a consequence, as we look at this proposal--and, again, \nI would like to point out there is no date for removal--one of the more \ninteresting things is that there are claims now brought about by the \nnuclear industry against the Federal Government for nonperformance of \nits contract. Those claims total somewhere between $60 billion and $80 \nbillion.\n  The Government is in default for nonperformance of its contractual \nobligation. One of the proposals circulated\n\n[[Page S2656]]\n\nis if the Government agrees to take the waste onsite, that those claims \nbe dropped. If you think about this a little bit more, the Government \nhas already collected a significant amount of money from the ratepayers \nover the last 18 years, some $14 billion. Now the Government is going \nto take this waste and use that money, paid for by the ratepayers, to \nstore the nuclear waste onsite for no timeframe that can be \nascertained. In other words, this waste is going to sit where it is, \nMr. President. We do not know how long because there is no definite \ndate in the proposal for the administration to take the waste.\n\n  So what have we done? We have simply gone full circle. The court said \nthe Federal Government owned the waste. The Federal Government says \nthey will take it and store it at site. They will not tell you when \nthey are going to get rid of it. They use the money the ratepayers pay \nto store it there. I don't think that is satisfactory. It is a little \ndifferent. It is acknowledging that they have come up with a proposal, \nbut I do not think it is workable.\n  What we have here is, if you will, more delay. The Department of \nEnergy--and really it is not the Department of Energy's fault--it is \nthe administration that has broken its promise to the electric \nconsumers, who depend on nuclear energy, people who have paid more than \n$14 billion to the Federal Government.\n  That $14 billion paid by consumers was designed specifically to \nremove this waste, Mr. President, to a single--a single--storage \nfacility at Yucca Mountain. And that is what we have been building. The \nwaste, again, was supposed to be taken in the year 1998.\n  Where have we been over the past 15 years? We have done nothing but \nslip the schedule on nuclear waste. First it was to have this waste \nremoved by the year 2003, then 2005, then 2010, now 2015. With this \nproposal that I have just mentioned, that is in draft form, they are \nproposing it go back to 2010. Maybe that is progress; I don't know. \nThrough it all, the nuclear ratepayers have paid the bill, but we are \nnot through with the cost.\n  As I have indicated previously, the U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled \nthe Department of Energy had an obligation to take possession of the \nwaste in 1998, whether or not a repository was ready. The court ordered \nthe Department of Energy to pay contractual remedies. This is a pretty \nbig hit on the Federal Government and, hence, the taxpayer, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Estimates of damages range as high as $40, $50, $60--up to $80 \nbillion. How do the damages break down? Here they are: the cost of \nstorage of spent nuclear fuel, $19.6 billion; return of nuclear waste \nfees, $8.5 billion; interest on nuclear waste fees, $15 to $27.8 \nbillion; consequential damages for shutdown of 25 percent of nuclear \nplants due to insufficient storage--these are power replacement costs--\n$24 billion.\n  That is a pretty disastrous scenario for the consumers. It would add, \nif you will, the high cost of replacement power if these reactors go \ndown as a consequence of not being able to basically remove their \nwaste. There is loss of emissions, a free source of electric energy if \nthe nuclear plants are forced to close. And again, I would remind you \nthat 22 percent of our total electric power is generated from nuclear \nenergy.\n  These costs, these ``dangerous ends'' can be fixed. It is really time \nfor the administration to stop trying out bats, if you will, and step \nup to the plate on its obligation. So today I once again, along with \nSenator Craig, and a number of my colleagues, Senator Grams, are \nintroducing the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to solve our immediate \nliability problems by establishing an interim nuclear waste facility at \nthe Nevada test site.\n  Why the Nevada test site? Over the last 50 years, we have tested \nnuclear bombs, nuclear weapons in that area numerous times. As a \nconsequence, it appears, and was selected, to be the best site for a \npermanent repository.\n  What we are proposing, by this legislation, is to move this waste out \nand put it at site, but have it retrievable so when the permanent \nrepository is ready it can be placed there. In the meantime, we will \nremove the waste from some 70 sites around the country.\n  In addition, this measure improves the process towards a permanent \nnuclear waste repository by making sure that funding is adequate and \nthat the process to reach that goal is sound and viable?\n  While my committee will examine the proposal put forth by the \nSecretary, there is some circular reasoning inherent in it.\n  One, the administration's arguments to date have been that building \nan interim storage facility would divert funds from the study of the \nproposed permanent repository. But the Secretary's proposal for \ncontinued onsite storage would do just that. It would redirect consumer \nfunds to pay for continued onsite storage.\n  Do we really want this nuclear waste piling up at 71 sites around the \nNation rather than one? That is the critical question, Mr. President. \nHere is the proposed site for the nuclear waste--out in the Nevada \ndesert. And the Nevada test site was previously used for more than 800 \nnuclear weapons tests. There it is.\n  There is some conversation that suggests, What if the current \nrepository at Yucca Mountain does not prove to be licensable, what will \nyou do with it then? Obviously, we will have to address that. But in \nthe meantime, we would concentrate it out in this area in retrievable \ncasks that would allow us to move it someplace for permanent storage. \nOr there is the technology that is developing on reprocessing that the \nJapanese and the French have proceeded with, which is to recover the \nplutonium out of the spent nuclear fuel and put it back in the \nreactors. That is another alternative.\n\n  So the alternative to leaving it at the 71 sites, vis-a-vis putting \nit out in one place where we have had over 800 nuclear tests over the \npast 50 years, obviously is a logical and reasonable progression to \nremove this from the various sites around the United States.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the time for delay is long past. We have had \nenough delay now. In the last Congress, we had a vote on this matter. \nIt was overwhelmingly bipartisan. There were 65 Members of the U.S. \nSenate that voted yes--that voted yes--to put the waste in a temporary \nretrievable repository at Yucca Mountain. In the House there were 307 \nMembers that voted yes.\n  Obviously the time is now at hand to move this bill out, to meet the \nresponsibility that we have committed to with the ratepayers over these \nlast 18 years and take that $14 billion and move this waste out to the \nNevada test site once and for all until the permanent repository is \nlicensed.\n  So, Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to reflect on the merits \nof this bill--the debate went on in the last Congress--and recognize \nthat we simply cannot put our heads in the sand and ignore this. This \nis a contract commitment. You have to recognize the sanctity of that \ncontract and the recognition of 22 percent of our power is from nuclear \nenergy, and if we are to allow this industry to strangle on its high-\nlevel waste, we are doing a great disservice and simply are going to \nhave to come up with power sources from other generating capabilities \nthat do not offer the air quality that is available by nuclear energy.\n  As we look at global warming and greenhouse gases and various \nlegislative proposals by the administration, the role of nuclear energy \nis noticeably absent. I think that is unfortunate as we recognize that \nnuclear energy contributes to reducing greenhouse gases and hence \nglobal warming.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the Nuclear Waste Policy Act amendments of 1999.\n  First, I would like to thank Senators Murkowski and Craig for once \nagain authoring this legislation and for their combined efforts in the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee on matters related to nuclear \nwaste storage.\n  As we all know, Washington's involvement in nuclear power isn't new. \nSince the 1950's ``Atoms for Peace'' program, the federal government \nhas promoted nuclear energy, in part, by promising to remove \nradioactive waste from power plants. Congress decisively committed the \nfederal government to take and dispose of civilian radioactive waste \nbeginning in 1998 through the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, and its \namendments in 1987. These acts established the DOE Office of Civilian \nRadioactive Waste Management to conduct the program, selected Yucca\n\n[[Page S2657]]\n\nMountain, Nevada as the site to assess for the permanent disposal \nfacility, and established fees of a tenth of a cent per kilowatt hour \non nuclear-generated electricity, and provided that these fees would be \ndeposited in the Nuclear Waste Fund. Furthermore, it authorized \nappropriations from this fund for a number of activities, including \ndevelopment of a nuclear waste repository.\n  Eventually, publication of the standard contract addressed how \nradioactive waste would be taken, stored, and disposed of. The DOE then \nsigned individual contracts with all civilian nuclear utilities \npromising to take and dispose of civilian high-level waste beginning \nJanuary 31, 1998. Other administrative proceedings, such as the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission's Waste Confidence Rule, told the American public \nthat they should literally bank on the federal government's promise.\n  Because of these promises and measures taken by the federal \ngovernment, ratepayers have paid over $15 billion, including interest, \ninto the Nuclear Waste Fund. Today, these payments continue, exceeding \n$1 billion annually, or $70,000 for every hour of every day of the \nyear.\n  Up until recently, however, the administration has acted as if there \nis no problem. They have maintained a hands-off approach to the issue \nand when they have engaged Congress on nuclear waste storage, it has \nonly been to issue a veto threat against this legislation.\n  As a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee last \nyear, I had the opportunity to question Secretary Richardson on nuclear \nwaste issues during his Senate confirmation hearings. Unfortunately, \nhis answers to my questions were generally incomplete and contained \nlittle substantive discussion on the very real problems facing our \nnation's utilities, states, and ratepayers.\n  Mr. Richardson did, however, write some interesting things about \nnuclear power in his responses. Let me share with you a few of those \nresponses. They read:\n\n       Nuclear power is a proven means of generating electricity. \n     When managed well, it is also a safe means of generating \n     electricity.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       It is my understanding that spent nuclear fuel has been \n     safely transported in the United States in compliance with \n     the regulatory requirements set forth by the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission and the Department of Transportation.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The widely publicized shipment last week of spent fuel from \n     California to Idaho is proof that transportation can be done \n     safely. The safety record of nuclear shipments would be among \n     the issues I would focus on as Secretary of Energy.\n\n  I asked Mr. Richardson to tell me who would pay the billions of \ndollars in damages some say the DOE will owe utilities as a result of \nDOE failure to remove spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998. After \nwriting about the DOE's beliefs on their level of liability, he wrote: \n``I will give this issue priority attention once I am confirmed as \nSecretary of Energy.''\n  I asked Mr. Richardson if he felt the taxpayers had been treated \nfairly. Again, after telling me about the history of the Department's \nactions to avoid its responsibilities, he wrote: ``I share your \ninterest in resolving these issues and I will continue to pursue this \nonce I am confirmed.''\n  Now, Mr. President, let's look at how then-nominee Federico Pena \nresponded to my question regarding the responsibility of the DOE to \nbegin removing spent nuclear fuel from my state. He said in testimony \nbefore the Energy and Natural Resources Committee:\n\n       . . . we will work with the Committee to address these \n     issues within the context of the President's statement last \n     year. So we've got a very difficult issue. I am prepared to \n     address it. I will do that as best as I can, understanding \n     the complexities involved. But they are all very legitimate \n     questions and I look forward to working with you and others \n     to try to find a solution.\n\n  Does that sound familiar? I suspect Secretary O'Leary had something \nequally vague to say about nuclear waste storage as well. Secretary \nPena, I believe, said it best when he stated, ``I will do that as best \nas I can, understanding the complexities involved.'' Those \ncomplexities, Mr. President, are not that complex at all. Quite simply, \nthe President of the United States, despite the will of 307 Members of \nthe House of Representatives and 65 Senators, last year refused to keep \nthe DOE's promise.\n  Now, Secretary Richardson has come before the Senate and offered a \n``new'' approach to the nuclear waste storage crisis. He believes we \nshould leave the waste at sites across the country and merely transfer \ntitle, or ownership, to the federal government. The federal government \nwould then be responsible for the costs associated with maintaining \neach of the 73 interim storage sites in 34 states, including the \nPrairie Island facility in Minnesota. To pay for this, Secretary \nRichardson is suggesting we raid the Nuclear Waste Fund, which was \ncreated to pay for the removal of that same spent nuclear fuel.\n\n  While I am glad to see the Administration is finally engaged in the \nnuclear waste debate and that Secretary Richardson has finally been \nallowed to address the issue before the U.S. Senate, his proposal is a \n``year late and several billion dollars short.'' It does nothing to \nactually move the waste out of our states and into an interim storage \nfacility. It is unclear whether his proposal would do anything to \nprevent the premature shutdown of nuclear facilities in states like \nMinnesota. And the one thing we know it will do, is take money from the \nNuclear Waste Fund that was supposed to pay for the removal of spent \nnuclear fuel, not the indefinite continuance of a failed approach to \nnuclear waste management.\n  Mr. President, I want to be very clear that I am sincere in these \ncomplaints. My concern is for the ratepayers of my state and ratepayers \nacross the country. They have poured billions of dollars into the \nNuclear Waste Fund expecting the DOE to take this waste. They have paid \ncountless more millions paying for on-site nuclear waste storage. \nEffective January 31, 1998, they began paying for both of these costs \nsimultaneously, even though no waste has been moved.\n  When the DOE is forced to pay damages to utilities across the nation, \nthe ratepayers and taxpayers will again pay for the follies created by \nthe DOE. Some estimate the costs of damages to be $80 to $100 billion \nor more. The ratepayers will also have to pay the price of building new \ngas or coal-fired plants when nuclear plants must shut down. And, if \nthe Administration gets its way, my constituents will pay again when \nthe Kyoto Protocol takes effect in 2008--exactly the same time \nMinnesota will be losing 20 percent of its electricity from clean \nnuclear power and replacing it with fossil fuels.\n  That is why we must move forward, pass the legislation introduced \ntoday, and send it to the President for his signature. If he refuses to \nsign the bill, then I believe we will be able to find those last two \nvotes we need to override his veto and remove the cloud hanging over \nour nation's ratepayers. There is no scientific or technical reason why \nwe should not move this bill forward and pass it into law.\n  The administration has admitted nuclear waste can be transported \nsafely. They have admitted they neglected their responsibility. They \nhave admitted nuclear power is a proven, safe means of generating \nelectricity. And they have admitted there is a general consensus that \ncentralized interim storage is scientifically and technically possible \nand can be done safely. If you add all of these points together and \nhold them up against this Administration's lack of action, you can only \ncome to one conclusion: politics has indeed won out over policy and \nscience.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to once again support these amendments to \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act and urge my colleagues to move this bill \nquickly through committee and onto the Senate floor where it will once \nagain be approved by an overwhelming majority.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 609. A bill to amend the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and \nCommunities Act of 1994 to prevent the abuse of inhalants through \nprograms under the Act, and for other purposes; read the first time.\n\n\n      the safe and drug-free schools and communities act amendment\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwill help fight a silent epidemic among America's youth. This epidemic \ncan leave young people permanently brain damaged, and in some cases \neven dead. It is called inhalant abuse. An awful lot of attention goes \nto substance abuse--alcohol, drugs--but very little attention is being \ngiven to inhalant abuse. It seems to be the silent killer.\n\n[[Page S2658]]\n\n I ask that the bill be introduced pursuant to Senate rule 14 and be \nplaced immediately on the Calendar.\n  My bill amends the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of \n1994 to include inhalant abuse among the act's definition of ``abused \nsubstances,'' thereby allowing schools the option to educate students \nabout the horrors of inhalant abuse.\n  What exactly are inhalants? What are we talking about? Inhalants are \nthe intentional breathing of gas or vapors for the purpose of getting a \nhigh. Over 1,400 common products can be abused--lighter fluid, \npressurized whipped cream, hair spray; gasoline is often used in my \nrural State of Alaska. These products are inexpensive, they are easily \nobtained, and, most of all, they are legal. One inhalant abuse \ncounselor told me, ``If it smells like a chemical, it can be abused.''\n  It is a silent epidemic because few adults appreciate the severity of \nthe problem or how often it occurs. It is estimated one in five \nstudents have tried inhalants by the time they reach the eighth grade. \nThe use of inhalants by children has nearly doubled in the last 10 \nyears. Inhalants are the third most abused substance among teenagers, \nbehind alcohol and tobacco.\n  Inhalants are deadly. Inhalant vapors react with fatty tissues of the \nbrain and literally dissolve those tissues. A one-time use of inhalants \ncan cause instant and permanent brain damage, heart failure, kidney \nfailure, liver failure, or death. The user can also suffer instant \nheart failure. This is known as sudden sniffing death syndrome. This \nmeans an abuser can die on the very first time he or she tries it or \nthe 10th time or the 100th time that an individual sees fit to use an \ninhalant. In fact, according to a recent study by the National Native \nHealth Consortium, ``inhaling has a higher risk of `instant death' than \nany other abused substance.'' Think of that: Inhalants have a higher \nrisk of instant death, the first time, than any other abused substance.\n  That is what happened last year to Theresa, an 18-year-old who lived \nin a rural western Alaska village. Last year Theresa was inhaling \ngasoline; shortly thereafter, her heart stopped. She was found outside \nin the near-zero temperature. Theresa was the youngest of five children \nand just a month shy of graduation. She was flown to the Fairbanks \nMemorial Hospital where she was pronounced dead on arrival.\n  Earlier this year in Pennsylvania, a teenaged driver with four \nteenaged passengers lost control of her car in broad daylight. The car \nhit a tree with such impact that all the passengers were killed. High \nlevels of a chemical found in computer keyboard cleaners--think about \nthis, computer keyboard cleaners--were found in the young driver's \nbody. The medical examiner report cited impairment due to inhalant \nabuse as the cause of that crash.\n  Mr. Haviland, the principal of the school that the five girls \nattended, said the teacher never suspected that the students were \ninvolved with inhalants. That is why this bill is so important. The \nmost effective prevention against inhalant abuse is education. It is \npreventable. But educators must first know about inhalants before they \ncan teach our kids of their dangers.\n  My bill will amend section 4131 of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and \nCommunities Act to allow States and communities the option to develop \nprograms on inhalant abuse. Under my amendment, the principals, \nteachers, and counselors will be able to learn about inhalants and will \nhave the option to develop educational programs to teach about inhalant \nabuse.\n  There is no cost associated with this legislation. This bill makes \nfiscal sense. A 1993 study by the Alaska Indian Health Service revealed \nthat a 19-year-old chronic inhalant abuser could have an average \nlifetime cost of up to $1.4 million. These are the costs of chronic \nmedical care, substance abuse treatment, rehabilitation treatment, and \nsocial services. The costs go on and on. We can save those costs if we \njust prevent this type of abuse.\n  The goal of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act is to \nsave the lives of young people, but currently only illegal drugs, \nalcohol, and tobacco are covered under the definitions of this act. \nThis bill will help us solve the problem and save the lives of our \nyouth. We support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 609\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain land under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management in \nWashakie County and Big Horn County, Wyoming, to the Westside \nIrrigation District, Wyoming, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                WESTSIDE IRRIGATION DISTRICT LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nwith my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Thomas, that would authorize a \nland exchange project called the Westside Irrigation District in \nWashakie and Big Horn Counties, Wyoming. This project has been many \nyears in the making and is very important to many people in our state. \nIt will provide a strong foundation for economic development in the \narea and it will provide a great opportunity for the public to obtain \nparcels of land that are now in private hands.\n  The Westside District is a win-win project for everyone. It takes \npublic land that is of low value for wildlife or aesthetic enjoyment \nand sells it to a non-profit district for conveyance into agricultural \nuse. The District will pay fair market value for the surface land--not \nthe mineral rights, which would remain federal property--and the Bureau \nof Land Management can then take the money and purchase other property \nthat has a much higher value for public recreation, public access, fish \nand wildlife habitat, or cultural resources. The Bureau presently has \nvery limited funds for this purpose and they could make good use of the \nmoney in the Worland District, which has a very complex land ownership \nmix.\n  The description of the project is nearly 37,000 acres of shelf land \nnear the Big Horn River. The proposal would make use of unallocated \nwater rights to irrigate approximately 20,000 acres, leaving the \nremainder in conservation buffer zones, rights of way and wildlife \nhabitat. The local economy, which has been hit very hard in recent \nyears, would benefit from additional production of barley, corn, beans, \nhay and sugar beets. The anticipated benefit of a fully implemented \nproject could be as many as 216 new jobs in the community. And this is \nin a county that only has about 4,500 working people--so there is a \nreal positive impact expected.\n  The district has been working diligently to address public questions \nthat had been expressed early in the process. Some of these related to \nwater quality, wildlife habitat, access, and land values. The Wyoming \nGame and Fish, the Bureau of Land Management, and the Westside District \nhave been working out plans to mitigate each of the project's impacts. \nFor example, the District will make use of overhead sprinkler systems \nto prevent runoff and will maintain vegetative buffer zones to capture \nany possible runoff due to natural events, such as snow melt. The \nDistrict only plans to irrigate 20,000 acres of the total area, so the \nremaining 46 percent of the land will remain in native cover to provide \nhabitat for wildlife and antelope winter range. The District will also \nhelp support additional staff with the Wyoming Game and Fish for \nmitigation assistance. And all existing rights of way and public access \nto surrounding public lands will be preserved.\n  Mr. President, this bill is necessary because the BLM does not have \nthe statutory authority to complete a sale of lands. Although they \ncould conduct an exchange, the sheer size of this project prevented \ncreating a reasonable exchange portfolio of other lands. This could \nhave been accomplished with existing authority, but was prohibitively \ndifficult to achieve in a single process. This legislation enables the \nBLM to take the money now, and then purchase various private lands as \nthey become available--lands that are more suitable to our public \nobjectives, such as wildlife and resource conservation and public \nenjoyment.\n\n  This bill should be referred to the Senate Energy Committee and it is \nmy hope that a hearing could be held and a report generated with enough \ntime to complete action on the legislation this year. The people in \nWorland, Wyoming, have worked very hard to make this project happen. I \nwould urge my colleagues to review the bill and support it.\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to join \nmy colleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, in introducing legislation to \nconvey certain BLM lands to the Westside Irrigation District. This \nmeasure is a culmination of years of hard work, by folks affected, to \nreach a solution through perseverance and much negotiation. It is a \ncompromise--interested parties working together for a common goal, and \nit has been 30 years in the making. I am pleased today to be part of \nsetting forth what is needed to turn a goal for many Wyoming residents \ninto a reality.\n  This legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior to convey \nroughly 37,000 acres of land under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of \nLand Management in Washakie County and Big Horn County, Wyoming, to the \nWestside Irrigation District. In turn, Westside Irrigation District \nwill irrigate these lands and sell them as farmland parcels. Proceeds \nraised from the land sales will be given to the Secretary of the \nInterior for the acquisition of land in the Worland District of the \nBureau of Land Management, for the purpose of benefiting public \nrecreation, increasing public access, enhancing fish and wildlife \nhabitat and improving cultural resources.\n  In recent years, expanded residential development in Washakie and Big \nHorn Counties has resulted in key loss to the economy--farmland. What \nthis legislation proposes to do is afford communities an opportunity to \nretain their economic vitality while protecting cultural and natural \nresources. It promises to benefit both the business community and \npreserve the environment.\n  Benefits attained from this legislation will be fruitful for all \nparties. Agricultural producers have the rare chance to increase \nprivate land holdings in a largely public lands State. Wildlife \ninterests are given the resources necessary to enhance critical habitat \nareas. In addition, the creation of 200 new jobs and an estimated \nfinancial impact of $16.8 million annually will spur tremendous \neconomic development in these Wyoming counties.\n  Mr. President, let me once again congratulate all of the folks who \nhave worked so hard on this measure--it is a job well done. I hope the \nSenate will give this bill every consideration and I look forward to \ntaking action on it in the near future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 611. A bill to provide for administrative procedures to extend \nFederal recognition to certain Indian groups, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n        Indian Federal Recognition Administrative Procedures Act\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, just as it recognizes foreign \ngovernments, the United States is called upon to consider extending its \nrecognition to Indian tribal governments here at home.\n  From the first days of the republic, the Congress has acted to \nrecognize the unique legal and political relationship the United States \nhas with the Indian tribes. Reforming the process of recognition is the \ngoal of the legislation I am introducing today.\n  Just as the United States at times refuses to recognize foreign \ngovernments, there are and always have been tribal governments which \nhave not been recognized by the Federal government. This lack of \nrecognition does not alter the ``Indian-ness'' of a tribe's members; \nrather it merely means that there is no formal political relationship \nbetween that tribal group and the United States.\n  Federal recognition is critical to tribal groups because it triggers \neligibility for services and benefits provided by the United States \nbecause of their status as members of federally recognized Indian \ntribes.\n  I want to be clear--I am not advocating for the approval of every \npetition for recognition, and I am not proposing that the petitions \nreceive a limited or cursory review. I am concerned with the viability \nof the current recognition process and am interested in seeing \nfairness, promptness, and finality brought into that process while \nproviding basic assurances to already-recognized tribes regarding their \ninherent rights.\n  Federal recognition can be accomplished in two ways: through the \nenactment of federal legislation; or through the administrative process \nthat occurs, or more accurately does not occur, within the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs (BIA).\n\n[[Page S2660]]\n\n  Over the years, uncertainty has developed over just how or when the \nBureau would process tribal group applications for recognition. In \nshort, the current process is not getting the job done.\n  The process in the Department of the Interior is time consuming and \ncostly, although it has improved from its original state. Some tribal \ngroups allege that the Department's process leads to unfair and \nunfounded results. It has frequently been hindered by a lack of staff \nand resources needed to fairly and promptly review all petitions. At \nthe same time, the Congress extends recognition to tribes with little \nor no reference to the legal standards and criteria employed by the \nDepartment.\n  The amount of time some tribal groups have had to wait before their \npetitions are acted on in some cases is outrageous. Sometimes these \napplications for recognition are pending literally for decades. The \nconcerns expressed go beyond the delays I mentioned and involve the \nviability of the current recognition process itself.\n  As with any decision-making body, fairness and timeliness are the \nkeys to maintaining a credible system which holds the confidence of \naffected parties. I believe that it is in the interests of all parties \nto have a clear deadline for the completion of the recognition process.\n\n  In 1978, the Department of the Interior promulgated regulations to \nestablish criteria and procedures for the recognition of Indian tribes \nby the Secretary.\n  Since that time to date, tribal groups have filed hundreds of \npetitions for review. Of those, 42 have been resolved, and 179 are new \npetitioners; During this same time, 89 expressed letters of intent to \npetition, and 5 required legislative authority to proceed which are now \ndeemed inactive.\n  The remainder are in various stages of consideration by the \nDepartment either ready for active status or are already placed on \nactive status. During this same time to date, the Congress has \nrecognized 7 other tribal groups through legislation.\n  In the last twenty years, the Committee on Indian Affairs held \noversight hearings on the Federal recognition process. At each of those \nhearings the record clearly showed that the process is not working \nproperly. At a Committee on Indian Affairs hearing in 1995, the Bureau \ntestified that at the current rate of review and consideration, it \nwould take several decades to eliminate the entire backlog of tribal \npetitions. The record from numerous previous hearings reveals a clear \nneed for the Congress to address the problems affecting the recognition \nprocess.\n  The bill I am introducing today will go a long way toward resolving \nthe problems which have plagued both the Department of the Interior and \ntribal petitioners over the years.\n  This bill, the Indian Federal Recognition Administrative Procedures \nAct of 1999, provides the required clarification and changes that will \nhelp tribal petitioners and the United States in providing fair and \norderly administrative procedures to extend Federal recognition to \neligible Indian groups. The key element of this bill is that it removes \nthe recognition process from the BIA and places it in a temporary and \nindependent ``Commission on Indian Recognition.''\n  This bill provides that the Commission will be an independent agency, \ncomposed of three members appointed by the President, and authorized to \nhold hearings, take testimony and reach final determinations on \npetitions for recognition.\n  The bill provides strict but realistic time-lines to guide the \nCommission in the review and decision making process. Under the \nexisting process in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, some petitioners have \nwaited ten years or more for even a cursory review of their petition.\n  The bill I am introducing today requires the Commission to set a date \nfor a preliminary hearing on a petition not later than 60 days after \nthe filing of a documented petition. Not later than 30 days after the \nconclusion of a preliminary hearing, the Commission would be required \nto either decide to extend federal acknowledgment to the petitioner or \nto require the petitioner to proceed to an adjudicatory hearing.\n  The current recognition process becomes so expensive that the \nconsideration of petitions are stretched out over a number of years \nbecause there have been no real deadlines for these decisions.\n  This bill will allow for a cost-effective process for the BIA and the \npetitioners, will provide definite time-lines for the administrative \nrecognition process, and ``sunsets'' the Commission in 12 years.\n  To ensure fairness, the bill provides for appeals of adverse \ndecisions to the federal district court here in the District of \nColumbia.\n  To ensure promptness, the bill authorizes adequate funding for the \ncosts of processing petitions through the Commission.\n  The bill also provides finality for both the petitioners and the \nDepartment by requiring all interested tribal groups to file their \npetitions within 6 years after the date of enactment and requiring the \nCommission to complete its work within 12 years from enactment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record, and urge my colleagues to join me in enacting \nthis much-needed reform legislation.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 611\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Inouye in introducing the Indian Needs Assessment, Program \nEvaluation and Policy Coordination Act of 1999 to bring about needed \nreforms in the way Indian programs are designed and funded.\n  As the annual funding debates over Indian programs show us year after \nyear, rational and equitable funding decisions are made more difficult \nbecause of the lack of accurate and up to date information about the \nneeds of tribal governments and tribal members.\n  The ability of the Congress to target unmet needs and make available \nadequate funds for tribes and tribal members is directly related to the \nquantity and quality of information available about the type and degree \nof demand for federal programs and services.\n  Within one year of the enactment of this Act, and every 5 years \nthereafter, each Federal agency or department is required to conduct an \n``Indian Needs Assessment'' (``INA'') aimed at determining the needs of \ntribes and Indians eligible for programs and services administered by \nsuch agency or department.\n  To facilitate information collection and analysis, the bill requires \nthe development of a uniform method, criteria and procedures for \ndetermining, analyzing, and compiling the program and service needs of \ntribes and Indians.\n  The resulting ``Indian Needs Assessments'' are to be filed with the \nCommittees on Appropriations and Indian Affairs of the Senate, and the \nCommittees on Appropriations and Resources of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  In addition to a Needs Assessment, the bill also requires that each \nFederal agency or department responsible for providing services to \nIndians file an ``Annual Indian Program Evaluation'' (``AIPE'') with \nthese same committees. The AIPE will measure the performance and \neffectiveness of the programs under the jurisdiction of that agency or \ndepartment, and include recommendations as to how such programs can be \nimproved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 612\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House or Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Needs Assessment and \n     Program Evaluation Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS, PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--the Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States and the Indian tribes have a unique \n     legal and political government-to-government relationship;\n       (2) pursuant to Constitution, treaties, statutes, executive \n     order, court decisions, and course of conduct, the United \n     States has a trust obligation to provide certain services to \n     Indian tribes and to Indians;\n\n[[Page S2666]]\n\n       (3) Federal agencies charged with administering programs \n     and providing services to or for the benefit of Indians have \n     not furnished Congress with adequate information necessary to \n     assess such programs or the needs of Indians and Indian \n     tribes;\n       (4) such lack of information has hampered the ability of \n     the Congress to determine the nature, type, and magnitude of \n     such needs as well as its ability to respond to them.\n       (5) Congress cannot properly fulfill its obligation to \n     Indian tribes and Indian people unless and until it has an \n     adequate store of information related to the needs of Indians \n     nationwide.\n       (b) Purposes.--the purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) ensure that Indian needs for federal programs and \n     services are known in a more certain and predictable fashion;\n       (2) to require that Federal agencies and departments \n     carefully review and monitor the effectiveness of the \n     programs and services provided to Indians;\n       (3) to provide for more efficient and effective cooperation \n     and coordination of, and accountability from, the agencies \n     and departments providing programs and services, including \n     technical and business development assistance, to Indians; \n     and\n       (4) to provide Congress with reliable information regarding \n     both Indian needs and the evaluation of federal programs and \n     services provided to Indians nationwide.\n\n     SEC. 3. INDIAN TRIBAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT.\n\n       (a) Indian Tribal Needs Assessments.--In General.--\n       (1) within 180 days after the enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary, in consultation and coordination with the \n     Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Labor, \n     Justice, Treasury, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs, the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, other relevant agencies, \n     offices, and departments, shall develop a uniform method, \n     criteria and procedures for determining, analyzing, and \n     compiling the program and service assistance needs of Indian \n     tribes and Indians nationwide.

A bill to encourage Indian economic development, to provide \nfor the disclosure of Indian tribal sovereign immunity in contracts \ninvolving Indian tribes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n\n\n INDIAN TRIBAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CONTRACT ENCOURAGEMENT ACT OF \n                                  1999\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nIndian Tribal Economic Development and Contract Encouragement Act of \n1999 to encourage tribal economic development, provide for disclosures \nregarding tribal sovereign immunity, and eliminate excessive and \nunproductive bureaucratic oversight of tribal decisions.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, most Indian tribes are not in the \nposition to fund all, or even most of their governmental operations \nthrough taxes imposed on reservation-based activities or assets. Often \na tribe's own land and other natural resources are the only means a \ntribe has to fund its activities or to promote economic development \nwithin its reservation boundaries.\n  Since land is the basic trust resource, the United States has the \nauthority and the responsibility to oversee the lease of tribal lands. \nWhere tribes propose to enter leases of their lands, a federal statute \nprovides that the lease is only valid if it is approved by the Interior \nDepartment. My proposed bill does not affect the federal government's \nauthority to approve leases. My bill addresses non-lease agreements \nbetween Indian tribes and those that provide services that relate to \nthe tribe's lands.\n  Not that long ago, tribes had to rely on federal bureaucrats to \ndevise ways to develop their lands, to negotiate leases, and to then \napprove those leases. In many instances, tribes are now developing \ntheir own proposals. To assist in the development of a private sector, \nI want to encourage this entrepreneurial spirit.\n  There are strong indications, however, that an ancient federal \nstatute is impeding every Indian tribe's ability to enter into \nagreements with those who might be hired by the tribe to assist it in \ndeveloping its lands. Like most laws, this statute was enacted with the \nbest intentions. I speak of a law enacted over 125 years ago; a law \nenacted when many Indians had to rely on translators to read the \ntreaties between the United States and their tribal government. The \nstatute I propose to amend was enacted in 1871, and it survives in much \nthe same form today as it did then--64 Congresses ago.\n  Section 81, as it is known, provides that a contract ``relating to \nIndian lands'' is not valid unless it is approved by the Secretary. \nSection 81 imposes no limits on how long the BIA may take to review the \nagreement or even what standards apply to decide whether the contract \nshould be approved or denied.\n  The bill I introduce today addresses these issues and others.\n  First, the bill gives the Secretary 90 days to review a proposed \ncontract. This is the same amount of time the Secretary has to review \ncontracts relating to the management of gaming facilities. My bill \nprovides that if the government takes no action for 90\n\n[[Page S2667]]\n\ndays, then the tribe can proceed with the project unhindered by the \nlack of approval.\n  All other federal laws will still apply to the agreement.\n  Second, the Secretary must identify the types of contracts that are \nnot covered by this statute. A tribe can submit such contracts and the \nBIA has 45 days to determine whether they are covered by the law. The \nSecretary is still authorized to reject any contract that violates \nfederal law.\n  Finally, the bill incorporates a suggestion made in 1988 by then-\nAssistant Secretary Ross Swimmer to ``eliminate the current statutory \nrequirements that the Secretary approve the tribal selection of \nattorneys and attorney fees.'' To allow the selection of counsel, \nwithout the Secretary's oversight, is fundamental to Indian self-\ndetermination.\n  My bill addresses one other key matter. Like other sovereign \ngovernments, Indian tribes are free to negotiate with potential \nbusiness partners whether, in what form, and to what extent the parties \ncan sue and be sued under a contract they enter. My bill recognizes a \ntribe's discretion in this area and it leaves it in place.\n  After numerous hearings conducted in the 105th Congress and in \nprevious congresses, I believe the record is clear: Indian tribes have \nbeen increasingly responsible in their consideration of immunity \ndecisions.\n  I am concerned, however, about those who may enter into agreements \nwith Indian tribes knowing that the tribe retains immunity but at a \nlater time insist that they have been treated unfairly by the tribe \nraising the immunity defense.\n  Under my bill, the Secretary must deny approval of contracts if the \nagreement in question fails to state that the parties recognize that \nthe tribe is immune from suit unless immunity is expressly waived.\n  Excessive federal regulation, especially if it impedes business and \neconomic development in Indian Country, needs to be eliminated. Whether \nwe put this belief in terms of the Contract with America, or the \ninitiative to reinvent government, our objective is the same.\n  There is no group of people who have experienced more federal \nregulation of every aspect of their lives than Indians. This bill \nrepresents a commitment to reduce unnecessary and anachronistic federal \nbureaucratic requirements.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this critical \nmeasure.\n  There being no objection, this bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 613\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Tribal Economic \n     Development and Contract Encouragement Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS WITH INDIAN TRIBES.\n\n       Section 2103 of the Revised Statutes (25 U.S.C. 81) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(a)'' before ``No agreement'';\n       (2) in subsection (a), as designated by paragraph (1) of \n     this section--\n       (A) by striking ``, or individual Indians not citizens of \n     the United States,'';\n       (B) by striking ``First.

A bill to provide for regulatory reform in order to encourage \ninvestment, business, and economic development with respect to \nactivities conducted on Indian lands; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n\n\n  INDIAN TRIBAL REGULATORY REFORM AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce another \nkey piece of legislation to encourage private sector development on \nIndian lands. This bill is aimed at removing the obstacles that stand \nin the way of responsive government and greater levels of business \nactivity in Indian country--the Indian Tribal Regulatory Reform and \nBusiness Development Act of 1999.\n  Over the years, laws, regulations and policies have been built up--\noften with good intentions--but have outlived their usefulness or \nrelevance to the contemporary needs of Indian tribal governments and \neconomies.\n  More importantly, the multi-layered bureaucracies, federal as well as \ntribal, have been repeatedly identified as a barrier to Indian \nentrepreneurship and business development on and around Indian lands.\n  Efforts to reduce bureaucracy are not new or unique to Indian \ncountry. Governments around the world have begun\n\n[[Page S2668]]\n\nembarking on efforts to downsize and streamline government operations \nto an appropriate level--one that complements human endeavors rather \nthan hindering them.\n  The bill I am introducing today is part of the much-needed effort to \naccomplish the same goal to benefit the business environments on Indian \nlands nationwide.\n  The legislation requires a comprehensive review of the laws and \nregulations affecting investment and business decisions on Indian \nlands, and requires the Regulatory Reform and Business Development on \nIndian lands Authority to determine the extent to which such laws and \nregulations unnecessarily or inappropriately impair investment and \nbusiness development on Indian lands.\n  The Authority is also required to determine how such laws and \nregulations impact the financial stability and management efficiency of \ntribal governments.\n  Under the provisions of this bill, the Authority is required to \nconduct the review and within one year report the findings and \nrecommendations to the Congress and the President for further actions.\n  Mr. President, this is not the first time an effort of this sort has \nbeen proposed, but I believe that if conducted properly, it can serve \nas a lasting and constructive initiative to further the long-term \nhealth and prosperity of tribal governments and economies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord, and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this key \nmeasure.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 614\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to encourage Indian economic development, to provide \nfor a framework to encourage and facilitate intergovernmental tax \nagreements, and for other purposes.\n\n\n              INTER-GOVERNMENTAL TAX AGREEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, to encourage states and tribes to \nnegotiate and enter fair and binding tax compacts, I introduce today \nthe Inter-Governmental Tax Agreement Act of 1999.\n  In 1998, I introduced similar legislation to provide a mechanism, \nshort of litigation, for the collection of state retail sales taxes. \nThe Committee on Indian Affairs held several hearings on the issue of \ntaxation involving tribes and sales made on Indian lands and heard from \ntribal leaders, state tax officials, private retailers, and other \naffected parties. Though no resolution was reached, the voluminous \nrecord developed by the Committee has helped flesh out the issue of \ntaxation and has led to a fuller picture being developed.\n  Because there is much confusion about Indians and tax matters, I \nshould be clear and explain exactly what we are talking about when we \naddress these matters. Indian tribal governments, like state \ngovernments, pay no federal taxes on income earned by the tribe. \nIndividual members of Indian tribes pay the same taxes other citizens \nof the United States pay: federal income taxes, Social Security taxes, \nand a host of other taxes.\n  What we are focusing on with this bill are state taxes on retail \nsales made to non-Indians on goods such as tobacco and fuel when the \ntransaction occurs on Indian lands. As late as 1991, the Supreme Court \nruled that such taxes are legitimately levied taxes and set out several \npossible remedies available to states including lawsuits against tribal \nofficials and negotiating a tax compact. The court was equally clear, \nhowever, that because of tribal common law immunity from lawsuits, \ntribes cannot be sued to collect the tax revenues.\n  Consistent with that opinion, at least 18 states and dozens of Indian \ntribes have chosen to negotiate and enter into tax agreements. At the \nCommittee hearing in March 1998, it was estimated that more than 200 \n``intergovernmental tax agreements'' are now in place covering a \nvariety of retail goods.\n  These agreements detail the collection and remittance of tax revenues \nby the tribe to the state on sales to non-members of the tribe, and \noften allow for an ``administrative fee'' paid to the tribe for their \nefforts to collect and remit the tax revenues.\n  Two factors were presented to the Committee which are legitimate \nissues for debate in the 106th Congress. First, the question of \nservices provided by the state and/or the tribe to Indians and non-\nIndians living on tribal lands; and second, the devastating impact on \nIndian economies as a result of ``dual'' state and tribal taxes levied \non the same transaction.\n  This legislation encourages state-tribal agreements by requiring that \nstates and tribes attempt to resolve their differences in good faith \nthrough negotiations aimed at entering into a tax compact.\n  If efforts to reach agreement through negotiations and mediation \nfail, under this bill the Interior Secretary may refer the matter to \nthe ``Intergovernmental Dispute Resolution Panel'' consisting of \nrepresentatives of the departments of Interior, Justice, and Treasury, \nIndian tribal governments, and State governments.\n  Rather than create an entirely new mechanism, the framework provided \nby this bill relies on existing mediation services provided by the \nFederal Mediation and Conciliation Service to assist the Panel in \ncarrying out its duties in arriving at fair agreements.\n  The history of state-tribal relations is one full of acrimony with \nbrief periods of cooperation. The tax issue is an emotional one with a \nlong history, Mr. President, but I am hopeful that fair and equitable \nsolutions to matters involving states, tribes and taxation can be \ndeveloped with the input of all affected parties.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord and urge my colleagues to support this important measure.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 615\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Intergovernmental Tax \n     Agreement Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Indian tribal governments exercise governmental \n     authority and powers over persons and activities that occur \n     on Indian lands;\n       (2) a dual State-tribal tax burden on transactions by \n     Indian tribes and members of Indian tribes with non-Indian \n     persons and entities undermines the ability of Indian tribes \n     to finance governmental functions and programs of those \n     Indian tribes;\n       (3) the apportionment of taxes from commercial activities \n     occurring on Indian lands should take into account the \n     government services provided by the State and the Indian \n     tribe involved to members of that Indian tribe and other \n     individuals residing on those lands;\n       (4) the governments of Indian tribes and States have \n     negotiated and entered into more than 200 tax compacts, and \n     those compacts cover a variety of commodities and retail \n     taxes;\n       (5) in cases in which a tax compact between an Indian tribe \n     and a State is not in effect, conflicts between the State and \n     Indian tribe may require the active involvement of the United \n     States in the role of the United States as a trustee for the \n     Indian tribe;\n       (6) alternative dispute resolution--\n       (A) has been used to resolve successfully disputes in the \n     public and private sectors;\n       (B) results in expedited decisionmaking; and\n       (C) is less costly and less contentious than litigation; \n     and\n       (7) it is necessary to facilitate intergovernmental \n     agreements between Indian tribes and States and political \n     subdivisions thereof.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To strengthen the economies of Indian tribes.\n       (2) To encourage and facilitate tax agreements between the \n     governments of Indian tribes and State governments.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage under the medicare program of insulin pumps as \nitems of durable medical equipment; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               medicare insulin pump coverage act of 1999\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, diabetes is a serious and potentially \nlife-threatening disease affecting more than 16 million Americans at a \ncost of more than $105 billion annually. Moreover, since 3 million \nelderly Medicare beneficiaries have been diagnosed with diabetes, and \nanother 3 million are likely to have the disease but not know it, \nnowhere is the economic impact of diabetes felt more strongly than in \nthe Medicare Program.\n  Treating these seniors for the often devastating complications \nassociated with diabetes accounts for more than one-quarter of all \nMedicare expenditures. Therefore, helping diabetic seniors avoid the \ncomplications of their disease will not only improve the quality of \ntheir lives but also help reduce the economic burden that diabetes \nplaces on Medicare. While there is no known cure, diabetes is largely a \ntreatable disease. Many people who have diabetes can often lead \nrelatively normal, active lives as long as they stick to a proper diet, \ncarefully monitor the amount of sugar or glucose in their blood and \ntake their medication, which may or may not include insulin.\n  However, if these people with diabetes are unable to follow or do not \nfollow this regimen, they put themselves at risk of blindness, loss of \nlimbs and have an increased chance of heart disease, kidney failure and \nstroke. Therefore, preventive services for people with diabetes has the \npotential to save a great deal of money that would otherwise go for \nhospitalizations or acute care costs--not to mention a great deal of \nunnecessary pain and suffering.\n  Congress recently took a number of important steps to improve \nMedicare coverage of preventive care for diabetics. Prior to the \nenactment of the balanced budget amendment in 1997, Medicare covered \ndiabetics' self-maintenance education services in inpatient or \nhospital-based settings and in limited outpatient settings, \nspecifically hospital outpatient departments or rural health clinics. \nMedicare did not, however, cover education services if they were given \nin any other outpatient setting, such as a doctor's office. Moreover, \nwhile Medicare did cover the cost of blood-testing strips used to \nmonitor the sugar in the blood, the program did so for only Type I \ndiabetics who require insulin to control their disease.\n  The balanced budget amendment of 1997 rightly expanded Medicare to \ncover all outpatient self-management training services as well as \nproviding uniform coverage of blood-testing strips for all persons with \ndiabetes. With the enactment of the balanced budget amendment, we made \nsignificant progress toward improving care for our senior citizens with \ndiabetes. However, there is more that we can do.\n  External insulin infusion pumps have proven to be much more effective \nin controlling blood glucose levels than conventional therapy injection \ntherapy for insulin-dependent diabetics whose blood sugar levels are \ndifficult to control. Such pumps help them to avoid the expensive \ncomplications and suffering resulting from uncontrolled diabetes. \nHowever, Medicare currently does not cover these pumps, even when they \nhave been prescribed as medically necessary by a patient's physician.\n  I am, therefore, pleased to introduce today legislation, the Medicare \nInsulin Pump Coverage Act of 1999, that would expand Medicare coverage \nto include insulin infusion pumps for certain Type I diabetics.\n  External insulin pumps are neither investigational nor experimental. \nThey are widely accepted by health care professionals involved in \ntreating parties with diabetes. Moreover, studies such as the Diabetes \nControl and Complications Trial sponsored by the National Institutes of \nHealth have established that maintaining blood glucose levels as close \nto normal as possible is the key to preventing devastating \ncomplications from this disease. For many patients, the use of an \ninfusion pump is the only way that optimal blood glucose control can be \nsafely achieved. That is why virtually all other third\n\n[[Page S2671]]\n\nparty payers--including many State Medicaid Programs and CHAMPUS--cover \nthe device. Moreover, there is precedent in Medicare since it currently \ndoes cover infusion pumps for numerous cancer drugs, as well as for \npain control medications.\n  The need for this legislation became apparent to me based on my \nattempts to help one of my constituents, Nona Frederich of Raymond, ME. \nShe is an example of the Medicare patient who would benefit from the \npump but who is currently being denied what is for her the most \neffective form of glucose control. Nona has been an insulin-dependent \ndiabetic since 1962. Because of her extremely volatile insulin \nsensitivity, her diabetic specialists placed her on an insulin infusion \npump in January 1982. Until she reached the age of 65, the cost of the \npump and operating supplies were underwritten in large part by her \ninsurer.\n\n  In March of 1995 it became necessary for Nona to purchase a new \ninfusion pump. However, by this time, she was now on Medicare and \nMedicare refused to cover it, even though her doctor had prescribed it \nas clearly being medically necessary. With the help of my Portland \noffice, the Frederichs worked their way through the Health Care \nFinancing Administration system of appeals. Unfortunately, in January \nof last year, they received final notification of a negative decision. \nTheir only remaining option is to file a civil suit which they are \nsimply not in a position to pursue.\n  The Frederichs literally have notebooks filled with documentation of \nthe procedures they followed and the evidence they submitted. Moreover, \nthey personally paid close to $5,000 in original pump costs and \nsupplies for which they received no reimbursement. For a Medicare \nbeneficiary with a limited income, these kinds of costs would be \ndevastating and would place the pump--the medically necessary pump--\ncompletely out of reach. In such a case, they would be forced to return \nto or to continue with conventional insulin therapy which simply just \nmay not be as effective in controlling blood sugar. As a consequence, \nthese patients are admitted to the hospital over and over again, and \nMedicare now picks up the bill--a far greater bill than if Medicare had \nsimply paid for the pump in the first place.\n  While potentially devastating for an individual, the financial costs \nto Medicare of expanding coverage to include the insulin infusion pump \nwill not be great. Under my bill, the pump would have to be prescribed \nby a physician and the beneficiary would have to be a Type I diabetic \nexperiencing severe swings of high and low blood glucose levels. Of the \nestimated 3 million Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes, only about 5 \npercent are Type I, or insulin dependent; of these, it is estimated \nthat the pump would be appropriate for only about 4 percent. Mr. \nPresident, what a difference it would make for those individuals.\n  The American Diabetes Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, \nthe American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American \nAssociation of Diabetes Educators, as well as officials at the Centers \nfor Disease Control, all have advocated expanding Medicare to cover \ninsulin infusion pumps for Type I diabetics who otherwise would have \ngreat difficulty in controlling their blood sugars.\n  I am pleased to introduce legislation today to do just that. I urge \nall of my colleagues to join me in support of this important \nlegislation, legislation that would not cost much money but would \nenrich the lives of those diabetics who need these pumps immeasurably.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation as well as \nthe letters of support from the American Diabetes Association and the \nJuvenile Diabetes Foundation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 617\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Insulin Pump \n     Coverage Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. COVERAGE OF INSULIN PUMPS UNDER MEDICARE.\n\n       (a) Inclusion as Item of Durable Medical Equipment.--\n     Section 1861(n) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395x(n)) is amended by inserting before the semicolon the \n     following: ``, and includes insulin infusion pumps (as \n     defined in subsection (uu)) prescribed by the physician of an \n     individual with Type I diabetes who is experiencing severe \n     swings of high and low blood glucose levels and has \n     successfully completed a training program that meets \n     standards established by the Secretary or who has used such a \n     pump without interruption for at least 18 months immediately \n     before enrollment under part B''.\n       (b) Definition of Insulin Infusion Pump.--Section 1861 of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n\n                        ``Insulin Infusion Pump\n\n       ``(uu) The term `insulin infusion pump' means an infusion \n     pump, approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration, \n     that provides for the computerized delivery of insulin for \n     individuals with diabetes in lieu of multiple daily manual \n     insulin injections.''.\n       (c) Payment for Supplies Relating to Infusion Pumps.--\n     Section 1834(a)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395m(a)(2)(A)) is amended--\n       (1) in clause (ii), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in clause (iii), by inserting ``or'' at the end; and\n       (3) by inserting after clause (iii) the following:\n       ``(iv) which is an accessory used in conjunction with an \n     insulin infusion pump (as defined in section 1861(uu)),''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply with respect to items of durable medical \n     equipment furnished under title XVIII of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) on or after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Statement by the American Diabetes Association in Support of the \n                   Medicare Insulin Pump Coverage Act\n\n       The American Diabetes Association lends its full support to \n     passage of the Medicare Insulin Pump Coverage Act in \n     Congress. Effective maintenance of blood glucose levels is \n     imperative if people with diabetes are to forestall the onset \n     of the complications of diabetes, such as cardiovascular \n     disease, end-stage renal disease, blindness or amputations. \n     External insulin infusion pumps have proven to be more \n     effective in controlling blood glucose levels than \n     conventional injection therapy for insulin-dependent people \n     whose blood sugar levels are difficult to control. Many, \n     including those who have had access to the insulin pump prior \n     to becoming a Medicare beneficiary, need access to the pump \n     for better control. Medicare access to the insulin pump will \n     help Medicare enhance the quality of life for people with \n     diabetes and contain the costly complications of diabetes.\n       Diabetes is a disease that requires a lifetime of medical \n     care and self-treatment. People with diabetes must have full \n     access to supplies, equipment and education. The Diabetes \n     Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), a 10-year clinical \n     study conducted by the National Institutes of Health, proved \n     that maintaining blood glucose levels as close to normal as \n     possible is the key to preventing the devastating \n     complications associated with diabetes.\n       ``Unfortunately, many health insurance plans, including \n     Medicare, do not provide comprehensive coverage for the \n     supplies and education people with diabetes need to control \n     their disease,'' said Gerald Bernstein, MD, President of the \n     American Diabetes Association. ``For example, Medicare does \n     not provide coverage for the insulin pump,'' Bernstein added.\n       According to the Health Care Financing Administration \n     (HCFA), the federal agency responsible for administering the \n     Medicare program, the insulin pump is not covered because \n     ``there [is no] medical advantage to using controlled \n     continuous insulin infusion (via infusion pump) rather than \n     conventional multiple daily injections to treat diabetes.''\n       Bernstein added, ``The use of the insulin pump has proven \n     to be effective for individuals who, despite multiple insulin \n     injections and frequent monitoring, have unstable diabetes. \n     For many of these individuals, use of the insulin pump is a \n     life-enhancing decision.'' The Medicare Insulin Pump Coverage \n     Act will require Medicare to cover insulin pumps for \n     beneficiaries with Type 1 diabetes who are experiencing \n     severe swings of high and low blood glucose levels or who \n     have used an insulin pump without interruption for at least \n     18 months immediately before enrollment under Medicare Part \n     B.\n       According to Bernstein, ``This legislation is especially \n     important for those individuals who face the prospect of \n     losing their coverage of the pump upon entering Medicare. Now \n     is the right time for HCFA to move forward with coverage of \n     the insulin pump in these limited circumstances.''\n       For these reasons the American Diabetes Association \n     strongly supports The Medicare Insulin Pump Coverage Act and \n     applauds Senator Susan M. Collins (R-ME) for introducing this \n     important legislation. Passage of the Collins Bill will \n     dramatically improve the lives of those striving to maintain \n     a healthy life, while at the same time, reducing costly \n     hospital stays.\n\n[[Page S2672]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n         Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International, The Diabetes \n           Research Foundation,\n                                    Washington, DC, March 8, 1999.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Juvenile Diabetes \n     Foundation International (JDF), I want to express our strong \n     support for your insulin pump legislation which would ensure \n     that pumps are covered by the Medicare program.\n       Diabetes is a devastating disease that affects 16 million \n     Americans and 120 million people worldwide. A new case of \n     diabetes is diagnosed every forty seconds, and diabetes kills \n     one American every three minutes. Diabetes is the leading \n     cause of kidney failure, adult blindness, and nontraumatic \n     amputations, and it substantially increases the risk of \n     having a heart attack or stroke. In all, the life expectancy \n     of people with diabetes averages 15 years less than that of \n     people without diabetes.\n       As you know, people with diabetes who use insulin take up \n     to five injections daily to treat their diabetes. However, \n     injection therapy does not work will for many diabetes \n     sufferers. In these and other cases, insulin pumps are an \n     effective and critical tool in assisting persons with \n     diabetes in more closely controlling blood glucose levels. \n     Better control of blood glucose levels is likely to lead to \n     fewer health complications from diabetes, and will result in \n     enormous cost savings to the Medicare system where one in \n     four Medicare dollars presently goes to pay for health care \n     of people with diabetes.\n       Senator Collins, the JDF applauds you for introducing this \n     important legislation to help our nation's seniors and other \n     Medicare-covered Americans have access to cost-effective and \n     life-improving medical supplies such as the insulin pump.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Leah J. Mullin,\n                               Chairman, JDF Government Relations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN:\n  S. 618. A bill to provide for the declassification of the journal \nkept by Glenn T. Seaborg while serving as chairman of the Atomic Energy \nCommission; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                          private relief bill\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation I introduced in the 105th Congress to require the \nDepartment of Energy to return the journal Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg kept as \nChairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, who \ndied on February 25 at the age of 86, was the co-discoverer of \nplutonium, and led a research team which created a total of nine \nelements, all of which are heavier than uranium. For this he was \nawarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1951 which he shared with Dr. \nEdwin M. McMillan.\n  Dr. Seaborg kept a journal while chairman of the AEC. The journal \nconsisted of a diary written at home each evening, correspondence, \nannouncements, minutes, and the like. He was careful about classified \nmatters; nothing was included that could not be made public, and the \njournal was reviewed by the AEC before his departure in 1971. \nNevertheless, more than a decade after his departure from the AEC, the \nDepartment of Energy subjected two copies of Dr. Seaborg's journals--\none of which it had borrowed--to a number of classification reviews. He \ncame unannounced to my Senate office in September of 1997 to tell me of \nthe problems he was having getting his journal released, saying it was \nsomething he wished to have resolved prior to his death. Although he \nhas left us, it is fitting that his journal should finally be returned \nto his estate. This bill would do just that. I introduced a bill to \nreturn to Dr. Seaborg his journal in its original, unredacted form but \nto no avail, so bureaucracy triumphed. It was never returned. Now he \nhas left us without having the satisfaction of resolving the fate of \nhis journal. It is devastating that a man who gave so much of his life \nto his country was so outrageously treated by his own \ngovernment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 619. A bill to provide for a community development venture capital \nprogram; to the Committee on Small Business.\n\n\n    THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT VENTURE CAPITAL ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nCommunity Development Venture Capital Assistance Act of 1999. This bill \nwould create a demonstration program to promote small business \ndevelopment and entrepreneurship in economically distressed communities \nthrough support of Community Development Venture Capital funds.\n  While our nation has enjoyed a historic period of economic growth \nover the past several years, there are concentrated pockets of poverty, \nin rural and urban areas, which have not experienced development of \njobs and opportunities for its residents. Small businesses, which have \nled America's economic expansion, have not been able to gain a toehold \nin these areas. A major reason for this lackluster performance is \ninability for entrepreneurs in economically distressed areas to access \ncapital.\n  No business can grow without infusions of capital for equipment \npurchases, to conduct research, to expand capacity, or to build \ninfrastructure. At some point all successful ventures outgrow \nincubation in the entrepreneur's garage or living room; additional \nstaff must be hired and the complexity of managing supply and demand \nincreases. Yet it is clear that throughout the country there are small \nbusiness owners who are being starved of the capital necessary to take \nthis step. They have viable businesses or ideas for businesses but \ncannot fully transform their aspirations into reality because of this \nfinancial roadblock.\n  Traditional venture capital firms are not meeting the need for equity \ncapital in disadvantaged communities. Such investments are risky in the \nbest of circumstances, but they can and do succeed with adequate time \nand attention. These communities need patient investors who are willing \nto work closely with small business owners to realize a financial \nreturn over the long term. Often, the investments needed are smaller \nthan those made by traditional sources. Throughout America, \norganizations known as Community Development Venture Capital funds are \nmaking these kinds of equity investments in communities and are \nproducing excellent results.\n  CDVC funds make equity investments in small businesses for two \npurposes: to reap a financial return to the fund, and to generate a \nsocial benefit for the community through creation of well paying jobs. \nThis ``double bottom line'' is what makes CDVC funds unique. There are \naround 30 CDVC funds currently operating throughout the country, in \nboth rural and urban areas. These funds are demonstrating the success \nof socially conscious investment and entrepreneurial solutions to \nsocial and economic problems.\n  My own state of Minnesota is home to a good example of a seasoned, \nand successful CDVC fund: Northeast Ventures Corporation of Duluth. NEV \nserves a seven county rural area and focuses on creating good jobs in \nhigh value-added industries. NEV targets 50% of the jobs created \nthrough investments to women, and to low income and structurally \nunemployed persons. They also require portfolio companies to offer \nemployees an opportunity to participate in a health care plan to which \nthe employer contributes. The following story illustrates an NEV \nachievement:\n  In 1990 a group of entrepreneurs approached Northeast Ventures about \nsetting up a car wash equipment manufacturing facility in Tower, a town \nof 508 people, in one of the poorest parts of Northeastern Minnesota. \nWhile NEV thought that the market opportunity was attractive, the \ncompany, called Powerain, had an incomplete business plan and lacked a \nChief Operating Officer. NEV also felt that the business provided a \ngood opportunity to create jobs and bring some economic vitality to an \narea that needed it badly.\n  Other assistance was needed before NEV could provide financing for \nthe effort. Northeast worked closely with Powerain's founders to revise \nthe business plan and identify a strong CEO candidate for the company. \nNortheast also invested $200,000 in equity into the business.\n  Northeast's involvement did not stop after making its first \ninvestment. NEV staff conducted the strategic planning sessions of \nPowerain and continue to be essential in developing the company's \nstrategic plan. They assist in identifying the need for key personnel; \nrecruit the necessary staff; and are integral in qualifying the short \nlist of candidates. Over a multi year period, NEV has talked daily with \nthe Powerain CEO regarding subjects as diverse as sales, distributor \nrelationships and the financial structure of loans. Over an\n\n[[Page S2673]]\n\neight year period, NEV has assisted Powerain in all subsequent rounds \nof financing totaling $826,932.\n  Powerain had a record sales year in 1998 and is expecting another \nrecord year in 1999. The company currently employs 20 full-time people, \nand expects to increase that number significantly in the future. The \ncompany provides ongoing training to its staff and entry level \npositions begin at $8 an hour--with full benefits. Most employees earn \nwell in excess of $10 per hour. Success stories such as these are \ntypical for CDVC funds.\n  The purpose of the Community Development Venture Capital Assistance \nAct is to grow the capacity of the CDVC fund ``industry'' by \nauthorizing a $20 million four year demonstration program through the \nSmall Business Administration. First, the bill would authorize $15 \nmillion for SBA grants to private, nonprofit organizations with \nexpertise in making venture capital investments in poor communities. \nThis will provide hands-on technical assistance to the new and emerging \nCDVC funds. These grants could also be used to fund the start up and \noperating costs of new CDVC organizations. Grants to these intermediary \norganizations would be matched dollar for dollar with funds raised by \nthe intermediary from non-Federal sources. Second, the bill would \nprovide $5 million in SBA grants to colleges, universities, and other \nfirms or organizations--public or private--to create and operate \ntraining programs, intern programs, a national conference, and academic \nresearch and study dealing with community development venture capital.\n  This legislation would provide support for entrepreneurial solutions \nto economic development issues in rural and urban America. It will \nallow the Federal government to promote what's working in distressed \ncommunities. Last year, the Senate approved a nearly identical \nprovision as part of an SBA technical amendments bill. I was pleased \nthat the demonstration program enjoyed bipartisan support last year and \nI hope it will again.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. \n        Campbell):\n  S. 620. A bill to grant a Federal charter to Korean War Veterans \nAssociation, Incorporated, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n     legislation to grant a federal charter to korean war veterans \n                              association\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation together with Senators Warner, Campbell, and Murray, which \nwould grant a Federal Charter to the Korean War Veterans Association, \nIncorporated. This legislation recognizes and honors the 5.7 million \nAmericans who fought and served during the Korean War for their \nstruggles and sacrifices on behalf of freedom and the principles and \nideals of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, the year 2000 will mark the 50th Anniversary of the \nKorean War. In June 1950 when the North Korea People's Army swept \nacross the 38th Parallel to occupy Seoul, South Korea, members of our \nArmed Forces--including many from the State of Maryland--immediately \nanswered the call of the U.N. to repel this forceful invasion. Without \nhesitation, these soldiers travelled to an unfamiliar corner of the \nworld, and joining an unprecedented multinational force comprised of 22 \ncountries, they risked their lives to protect freedom. The Americans \nwho led this international effort were true patriots who fought with \nremarkable courage.\n  In battles such as Pork Chop Hill, the Inchon Landing and the frozen \nChosin Reservoir, which was fought in temperatures as low as 57 degrees \nbelow 0, they faced some of the most brutal combat in history. By the \ntime the fighting had ended, 8,177 Americans were listed as missing or \nprisoners of war--some of whom are still missing--and 54,246 Americans \nhad died, the most of any American war in the 20th Century. One hundred \nand thirty-one Korean War Veterans were awarded the Nation's highest \ncommendation for combat bravery, the Medal of Honor. Ninety-four of \nthese soldiers gave their lives in the process. There is an engraving \non the Korean War Veterans Memorial which reflects these losses and how \nbrutal a war this was. It reads, ``Freedom is not Free.'' Yet, as a \nnation, we have done little more than establish this memorial to \npublicly acknowledge the bravery of those who fought the Korean War. \nThe Korean War has been termed by many as the ``Forgotten War.'' Mr. \nPresident, freedom is not free. We owe our Korean War Veterans a debt \nof gratitude. Granting this federal charter--at no cost to the \ngovernment--is a small expression of appreciation that we as a nation \ncan offer to these men and women, one which will enable them to work as \na unified front to ensure that the ``Forgotten War'' is forgotten no \nmore.\n  The Korean War Veterans Association was originally incorporated on \nJune 25, 1985. Since its first annual reunion and memorial service in \nArlington, Virginia, where its members decided to develop a national \nfocus and strong commitment to service, the association has grown \nsubstantially to a membership of over 25,000. At present, the KWVA is \nthe only veterans organization comprised exclusively of Korean War \nVeterans and one of the few such organizations of its size without a \nfederal charter. Over the years, it has established a strong record of \nservice and commitment to fellow Korean War veterans, ranging from its \nefforts on behalf of Project Freedom to its successful effort to \nconstruct a national Korean War Veterans Memorial on the Mall. A \nfederal charter would allow the Association to continue and grow its \nmission and further its charitable and benevolent causes. Specifically, \nit will afford the Korean War Veterans' Association the same status as \nother major veterans organizations and allow it to participate as part \nof select committees with other congressionally chartered veterans and \nmilitary groups. A federal charter will also accelerate the \nAssociation's ``accreditation'' with the Department of Veterans Affairs \nwhich will enable its members to assist in processing veterans' claims.\n  Mr. President, the Korean War Veterans have asked for very little in \nreturn for their service and sacrifice. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin supporting this legislation and ask that the text of the measure be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 620\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enhance competition among and between rail carriers \nin order to ensure efficient rail service and reasonable rail rates in \nany case in which there is an absence of effective competition; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n        RAILROAD COMPETITION AND SERVICE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a \nbill that will, twenty years after the Staggers Rail Act, finally \ndeliver the benefits of market competition to the railroad industry and \nits customers--the Railroad Competition and Service Improvement Act of \n1999. I am joined in this effort by Senators Dorgan, Burns, Roberts and \nConrad, and I thank them for their leadership on this bill for the \nbenefit not only of rail customers but also the future health of the \nrailroads themselves.\n  As many of my colleagues know, there are certain issues that I feel \nespecially strongly about, and all of them are issues that have far-\nreaching consequences for the State of West Virginia and for our \nnation. Competition--or the lack thereof--in the railroad industry is \none of those issues.\n  In the United States we have a railroad industry that has gone from \n63 class I railroads in 1976 to 9 class I railroads today, of which \nonly 5 control the vast majority of rail freight across the country: 2 \nin the East, 2 in the West, and one down the Mississippi River in the \nmiddle of the country. We also have a railroad industry with service \nproblems so expansive and so disruptive that grain and chemical and \nother manufacturers have lost tens of millions of dollars in recent \nyears, must operate with the vulnerability of future service crises, \nand have no choice but to constantly be on the lookout for better and \nmore reliable transportation options. And we have a railroad industry \nthat seems continually to assert undue and anti-competitive power over \nits customers in increasing local monopoly situations.\n  I believe the railroad industry is at a crossroads. It's been nearly \ntwenty years since the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which limited the \nregulation of the railroad industry by allowing government intervention \nonly where a railroad customer has no effective means of competition. \nBy many measures, the railroads are in far better financial health \ntoday, and rail freight transportation is far more safe, stable and \nefficient than in the dire days of the 1970s.\n  Yet despite these apparent gains, shippers across the nation are \nbroadly discontent. As a significant new report from the General \nAccounting Office confirms, rail shippers believe that in the aftermath \nof Staggers--and in direct conflict with the intent of Staggers--we \nhave in fact created a system that very heavily, and with tremendous \nfinancial consequences, favors monopoly railroads and shuts shippers \nout of the regulatory process that is supposed to protect them.\n  We have put in place a system that leaves 70 percent of shippers with \npoorer rate and service options than they need to run their businesses \ncost-efficiently, and a system in which nearly 60 percent of shippers \nfear retaliation from the railroads should they access the rate relief \nprocess--a process which costs between $500,000 and $3 million per \ncomplaint and can take up to 16 years to get a resolution. The GAO \nmakes crystal clear that the rate relief process for shippers with no \ncompetitive rail options is too costly and too time-consuming to be \neffective.\n  Now some would say that customers always want more and better \nservice, always want lower prices, and always are unhappy--so we should \ndiscount their railroad customer concerns and leave the system alone. \nThey would say that the railroads are happy with the status quo, so \nStaggers must be working well.\n  To my mind, that's a cop-out. The ``shipping community'' is the \nbackbone of our nation--they are our farmers, our auto and chemical \nmanufacturers, our utilities, our coal miners, our forest products \nworkers--and they're not just crying wolf. They have legitimate \nproblems with a skewed system, and they deserve the Congress' full \nattention and a commitment to deal with increased concentration and a \ndeveloping pattern of service problems by infusing some degree of real \nand effective competition into the railroad industry as a whole.\n  The legislation we introduce today is designed to do just that: it \nwill jump-start competition and uphold the common carrier obligation by \nrequiring railroads to quote a rate on any given segment; it will \nreduce monopoly routing by facilitating terminal access; it will \nstreamline the rate relief process by simplifying the market dominance \ntest; it will restore the integrity of the Surface Transportation Board \nby eliminating its annual revenue adequacy pronouncements; it will \nbolster rail access for small farmers by creating a targeted rate \nrelief process; and it will require the railroads to file monthly \nservice performance reports with the Department of Transportation, \nsimilar to what we require of the airline industry, so that rail \ncustomers have access to the information they need to make good \nrailroad and transportation choices.\n  We intend to offer this legislation as an amendment to the Surface \nTransportation Board reauthorization legislation later this year, and \nwe especially look forward to working with our colleagues on the \nCommerce and Agriculture Committees to that end.\n\n[[Page S2675]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 621\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Railroad Competition and \n     Service Improvement Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2 PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to clarify the rail transportation policy of the United \n     States by requiring the Surface Transportation Board to \n     accord greater weight to the need for increased competition \n     between and among rail carriers and consistent and efficient \n     rail service in its decision making;\n       (2) to eliminate unreasonable barriers to competition among \n     rail carriers serving the same geographic areas and ensure \n     that smaller carload or intermodal shippers are not precluded \n     from accessing rail systems due to volume requirements;\n       (3) to ensure reasonable rail rates for captive rail \n     shippers;\n       (4) to provide relief for certain agricultural facilities \n     lacking effective competitive alternatives; and\n       (5) to remove unnecessary regulatory burdens from the rate \n     reasonableness procedures of the Surface Transportation \n     Board.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that:\n       (1) Prior to 1976, the Interstate Commerce Commission \n     regulated most of the rates that railroads charged shippers. \n     The Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Act (1976) and the \n     Staggers Rail Act (1980) limited the regulation of the rail \n     industry by allowing the Interstate Commerce Commission to \n     regulate rates only where railroads have no effective \n     competition and established the Interstate Commerce \n     Commission's process for resolving rate disputes.\n       (2) In 1976, when the Congress began the process of \n     railroad deregulation, there were 63 class I railroads in the \n     United States. By 1997, through mergers and other factors, \n     the number of class I railroads shrunk to nine.\n       (3) The nine class I carriers accounted for more than 90 \n     percent of the industry's freight revenue and 71 percent of \n     the industry's mileage operated in 1997.\n       (4) Rail industry consolidation has diminished competition, \n     creating an even greater dependence upon a rate relief \n     process through a regulatory body such as the Surface \n     Transportation Board.\n       (5) Agricultural, chemical, and utility industries in \n     particular rely heavily upon rail transportation, and \n     unreasonable rail rates and inadequate service have a \n     dramatic impact on these important industries.\n       (6) According to a report issued by the General Accounting \n     Office, ``. . . [t]he Surface Transportation Board's standard \n     procedures for obtaining rate relief are highly complex and \n     time-consuming'' and the General Accounting Office estimates \n     that over ``70 percent [of shippers] believe that the time, \n     complexity, and costs of filing complaints are barriers that \n     often preclude them from seeking relief.''\n       (7) The General Accounting Office analyzed all 41 rate \n     complaints filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission and \n     its successor, the Surface Transportation Board, since 1990 \n     and found that each complaint cost shippers between $500,000 \n     to $3 million apiece and took between a few months and 16 \n     years to resolve.\n       (8) The General Accounting Office surveyed over 700 \n     shippers and found that--\n       (A) 75 percent of the shippers believed that they are \n     overcharged with unreasonable rates and\n       (B) over 70 percent of the shippers believed that the time, \n     complexity, and costs of filing complaints create \n     unsurmountable barriers and therefore preclude them form \n     pursuing the rate relief they are entitled to under the law.\n       (9) The General Accounting Office survey of shippers \n     identified the following barriers to obtaining rate relief \n     under the current process:\n       (A) The costs associated with filing complaints outweighs \n     the benefits of winning relief.\n       (B) The rate complaint process is too complex and too \n     lengthy.\n       (C) Developing the stand-alone revenue-to-variable cost \n     model is too costly.\n       (D) Most shippers believe that the STB is most likely to \n     decide in favor of the railroad.\n       (E) The discovery process is too difficult because the \n     shipper is dependent upon the railroad for all the necessary \n     data.\n       (F) Responding to the railroads requests for discovery is \n     too difficult and time consuming.\n       (G) Shippers fear reprisal from the railroad.\n       (H) The Surface Transportation Board filing fee is too \n     high.\n       (10) According to the General Accounting Office report, the \n     vast majority of shippers believe that the following changes \n     in the rate relief process are necessary to provide them with \n     the ability to seek the rate relief:\n       (A) The Surface Transportation Board's time limit for \n     deciding a rate relief case should be shortened.\n       (B) The complaint fee required upon filing should be \n     eliminated or reduced.\n       (C) The market dominance requirement should be simplified.\n       (D) Mandatory binding arbitration should be used to resolve \n     rate disputes.\n       (E) The Surface Transportation Board's jurisdictional \n     threshold of 180% revenue-to-variable cost should be lowered.\n       (11) According to the General Accounting Office report, \n     shippers believe that increasing competition in the railroad \n     industry would lower rates and diminish the need for a rate \n     complaint process. Proposals to increase railroad competition \n     identified in the report include the following:\n       (A) Require the STB to grant trackage rights; require \n     reciprocal switching at the nearest junction or interchange \n     upon request of a shipper or competing railroad; and increase \n     rail access for shortline and regional railroads.\n       (B) Overturn the STB's ``bottle neck'' decision by \n     requiring railroads to quote a rate for all route segments.\n       (12) Consolidation in the railroad industry has diminished \n     competition, thwarting the intended objectives of \n     deregulation to allow competition to lower rates and improve \n     service.\n       (13) The rate protection intended for shippers without \n     effective competition has been de-railed by a complex, \n     costly, and time-consuming maze of discovery, findings, and \n     appeals that take years and cost millions of dollars.\n       (14) Because of diminished rail competition, a rate relief \n     process plagued with unsurmountable barriers and blanket \n     antitrust immunity unique to the railroad industry, captive \n     shippers have no effective recourse under the current system.\n\n     SEC. 4. CLARIFICATION OF RAIL TRANSPORTATION POLICY.\n\n       Section 10101 of title 49, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``In \n     regulating''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) Primary Objectives.--The primary objectives of the \n     rail transportation policy of the United States shall be--\n       ``(1) to ensure effective competition among rail carriers \n     at origin and destination;\n       ``(2) to maintain reasonable rates in the absence of \n     effective competition; and\n       ``(3) to maintain consistent and efficient rail \n     transportation service to shippers, including the timely \n     provision of railcars requested by shippers; and\n       ``(4) to ensure that smaller carload and intermodal \n     shippers are not precluded from accessing rail systems due to \n     volume requirements.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. FOSTERING RAIL TO RAIL COMPETITION.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Rate.--Section 11101(a) of title 49, \n     United States Code, is amended by inserting after the first \n     sentence the following: ``Upon the request of a shipper, a \n     rail carrier shall establish a rate for transportation and \n     provide service requested by the shipper between any two \n     points on the system of that carrier where traffic \n     originates, terminates, or may reasonably be interchanged. A \n     carrier shall establish a rate and provide service upon such \n     request without regard to--\n       ``(1) whether the rate established is for only part of a \n     movement between an origin and a destination;\n       ``(2) whether the shipper has made arrangements for \n     transportation for any other part of that movement; or\n       ``(3) whether the shipper currently has a contract with any \n     rail carrier for part or all of its transportation needs over \n     the route of movement.\n\n     ``If such a contract exists, the rate established by the \n     carrier shall not apply to transportation covered by the \n     contract.''.\n       (b) Review of Reasonableness of Rates.--Section 10701(d) of \n     title 49, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (4); and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following:\n       ``(3) A shipper may challenge the reasonableness of any \n     rate established by a rail carrier in accordance with \n     sections 11101(a) and 10701(c) of this title. The Board shall \n     determine the reasonableness of the rate so challenged \n     without regard to--\n       ``(A) whether the rate established is for only part of a \n     movement between an origin and a destination;\n       ``(B) whether the shipper has made arrangements for \n     transportation for any other part of that movement; or\n       ``(C) whether the shipper currently has a contract with a \n     rail carrier for any part of the rail traffic at issue, \n     provided that the rate prescribed by the Board shall not \n     apply to transportation covered by such a contract.''.\n\n     SEC. 6. SIMPLIFIED RELIEF PROCESS FOR CERTAIN AGRICULTURAL \n                   SHIPPERS.\n\n       (a) Limitation of Fees.--Nothwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, the Surface Transportation Board shall not \n     impose fees in excess of $1,000 for services collected from \n     an eligible facility in connection with rail maximum rate \n     complaints under part 1002 of title 49, Code of Federal \n     Regulations.\n       (b) Simplified Rate and Service Relief.--Section 10701 of \n     title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end \n     thereof the following:\n       ``(e) Simplified Rates and Services.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, a rail carrier may not charge a rate for shipments from \n     or to an eligible facility which results in a revenue-to-\n\n[[Page S2676]]\n\n     variable cost percentage, using system average costs, for the \n     transportation service to which the rate applies that is \n     greater than 180 percent.\n       ``(2) Acceptance of requests.--Nothwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, a rail carrier shall accept all requests, \n     for grain service from an eligible facility up to a maximum \n     of 110 percent of the grain carloads shipped from or to the \n     facility in the immediately preceding calendar year. If, in a \n     majority of instances, a rail carrier does not in any 45-days \n     period, supply the number of grain cars so ordered by an \n     eligible facility or does not initiate service within 30 days \n     of the reasonably specified loading date, the eligible \n     facility may request that an alternative rail carrier provide \n     the service using the tracks of the original carrier. If the \n     alternative rail carrier agrees to provide such service, and \n     such service can be provided without substantially impairing \n     the ability of the carrier whose tracks reach the facility to \n     use such tracks to handle its own business, the Board shall \n     order the alternative carrier to commence service and to \n     compensate the other carrier for the use of its tracks. The \n     alternative carrier shall provide reasonable compensation to \n     the original carrier for the use of the original carrier's \n     tracks.\n       ``(3) Cancellation penalties.--A carrier may accept car \n     orders under paragraph (2) subject to reasonable penalties \n     for service requests that are canceled by the requester. If \n     the carrier fills such orders more than 15 days after the \n     reasonably specified loading date, the carrier may not assess \n     a penalty for canceled car orders.\n       ``(4) Damages.--A rail carrier that fails to provide \n     service under the requirements of paragraph (2) is liable for \n     damages to an eligible facility that does not have access to \n     an alternative carrier, including lost profits, attorney's \n     fees, and any other consequences attributable to the \n     carrier's failure to provide the ordered service. A claim for \n     such damage may be brought in an appropriate United States \n     District Court or before the Board.\n       ``(5) Timetable for board proceeding.--The Board shall \n     conclude any proceeding brought under this subsection no \n     later than 180 days from the date a complaint is filed.\n       ``(6) Definitions.--In this subsection:\n       ``(A) Eligibility facility.--The term `eligible facility' \n     means a shipper facility that--\n       ``(i) is the origin or destination for not more than 4,000 \n     carloads annually of grain as defined in section 3(g) of the \n     United States Grain Standards Act (7 U.S.C. 75(g));\n       ``(ii) is served by a single rail carrier at its origin;\n       ``(iii) has more than 60 percent of the facility's inbound \n     or outbound grain and grain product shipments (excluding the \n     delivery of grain to the facility by producers), measured by \n     weight or bushels moved via a rail carrier in the immediately \n     preceding calendar year; and\n       ``(iv) the rate charged by the rail carrier for the \n     majority of shipments of grain and grain products from or to \n     the facility, excluding premium for special service programs, \n     results in a revenue-to-variable cost percentage, using \n     system average costs, for the transportation to which the \n     rate applies that is equal to or greater than 180 percent.\n       ``(B) Reasonable compensation.--The term `reasonable \n     compensation' shall mean an amount no greater than the total \n     shared costs of the original carrier and the alternative \n     carrier incurred, on a usage basis, for the provision of \n     service to an eligible facility. If the carriers are unable \n     to agree on compensation terms within 15 days after the \n     facility requests service from the alternative carrier, the \n     alternative carrier or the eligible facility may request the \n     Board to establish the compensation and the Board shall \n     establish the compensation within 45 days after such request \n     is made.\n       ``(C) Original carrier.--The term `original carrier' means \n     a rail carrier which provides the only rail service to an \n     eligible facility using its own tracks or provides such \n     service over an exclusive lease of the tracks serving the \n     eligible facility.\n       ``(D) Alternative carrier.--The term `alternative carrier' \n     means a rail carrier that is not an original carrier to an \n     eligible facility.''.\n\n     SEC. 7.

Performance Reports\n\n``541. Rail carrier service quality performance reports''.\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join Senators \nRockefeller, Burns, and Roberts today in introducing the ``Railroad \nCompetition and Service improvement Act of 1999.'' This legislation is \ndesigned to stimulate railroad competition and level the field for \nshippers who need relief from unreasonable rates. Earlier this month, \nthe General Accounting Office (GAO) issued a report on the barriers to \nrate relief that prevent small captive shippers from unreasonable \nrates. That report, outlined below, identified a number of remedies \nthat would give captive shippers a fighting chance at rate relief. This \nlegislation closely mirrors the GAO's findings and if enacted, would go \na long way to improve rail service and promote competition.\n  In my home state of North Dakota over fifty percent of the state \neconomy is dependent upon agriculture. Our ability to move its \nagricultural production to distant markets affects large sectors of \nNorth Dakota's economy. Over eighty percent of all the grain shipped \nout-of-state moves by rail and 97 percent of North Dakota's grain \nelevators have access to only one railroad. Those who survive on \nfarming and those who live in states like North Dakota whose main \nbusiness is agriculture have a great deal at stake when it comes to \nrail transportation. Overcharges cost us millions of dollars a year, \nadding a substantial cost to a product that already operates at very \nlow margins.\n  Since virtually all of the shippers in North Dakota are subject to \nmonopoly service, our farmers and county grain elevators are paying a \npremium for a service they cannot afford to live without. Rail service \nin this country is supposed to be competitive where the forces of \ncompetition determine shipping rates and in the absence of competition, \nthe STB is suppose to have a process that will protect captive shippers \nfrom overcharges. Unfortunately, rail competition is more of an \nexception than the rule and the process that is designed to protect \ncaptive shippers is so costly and time-consuming that shippers are \nwithout recourse; left to the mercy of monopoly railroads who not only \ndetermine whether or not their product will get to market but\n\n[[Page S2677]]\n\nalso how much they will charge to deliver that product. This is a \ncircumstance that must be addressed as the Congress considers the \nreauthorization of the STB this year.\n  Prior to 1976, the ICC regulated almost all the rates that railroads \ncharged shippers. The Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Act (1976) \nand the Staggers Rail Act (1980) limited the regulation of the rail \nindustry by allowing the ICC to regulate rates only where railroads \nhave no effective competition and established the ICC's process for \nresolving rate disputes.\n  At the time when the Congress began the process of railroad \nderegulation (1976) there were 63 class I railroads in the United \nStates. By 1997, through mergers and other factors, the number of class \nI railroads shrunk to nine. These nine carriers accounted for more than \n90 percent of the industry's freight revenue and 71 percent of the \nindustry's mileage operated in 1997. In July, 1998, the STB approved \nanother Class I merger by splitting the assets of Conrail between CSX \nand Norfolk Southern (reducing the Class I count to 8 once \nimplemented). Another merger between Canadian National Railway and \nIllinois Central is pending before the STB.\n\n  This consolidation has diminished competition, creating an even \ngreater dependence upon a rate relief process through a regulatory body \nsuch as the STB. Agricultural, utility, and chemical industries in \nparticular rely heavily upon rail transportation and the cost of \nunreasonable rail rates has a dramatic impact on these important \nindustries.\n  According to GAO/RCED-99-46, ``Railroad Regulation: Current Issues \nAssociated With the Rate Relief Process,'' February 1999, ``[t]he \nSurface Transportation Board's standard procedures for obtaining rate \nrelief are highly complex and time-consuming'' and the GAO estimates \nthat over ``70 percent [of shippers] believe that the time, complexity, \nand costs of filing complaints are barriers that often preclude them \nfrom seeking relief.'' The report documents that the process for a \nsmall captive shipper to obtain rate relief under the current \nregulatory and legal framework is broken and unworkable. The reasons \nfor these barriers are multiple:\n  (A) Historical regulatory precedence has created a complex web of \nhurdles an barriers building an insurmountable maze for a small shipper \nto seek rate relief;\n  (B) contradictory statutorily directives based on a statute that was \ndesigned to protect the financial health of railroads while at the same \ntime attempt to protect the needs of shippers to challenge unreasonable \nrates; and\n  (C) the time and cost entailed in filing a rate complaint has reached \nabsurd levels, far outweighing the potential savings that could be \nachieved through a successful challenge to an unreasonable rate.\n  The STB rate complaint process involves an up front filing fee cost \nof $54,500 ($5,400 for the simplified guidelines)--plus the costs of \npursuing the case through years of negotiation through a complex maze \nof discovery; evidentiary hearings; rebuttals; and administrative \nappeals.\n  Seeking rate relief under the current process is very costly to \nshippers. The rate relief cases analyzed by the GAO cost shippers \nbetween $500,000 to $3 million each to file and wade through the \nprocess and took between a few months and 16 years to resolve. For \nexample, the McCarty Farms case took over 16 years to resolve and ended \nup in Federal District Court.\n  The GAO surveyed over 700 shippers and found that (a) 75 percent of \nthe shippers believed that they are overcharged with unreasonable \nrates; and (b) over 70 percent of the shippers believed that the time, \ncomplexity, and costs of filing complaints create unsurmountable \nbarriers and therefore preclude them from pursuing the rate relief they \nare entitled to under the law. (It is not surprising that the GAO found \nthat the railroad monopolies unanimously support the current process \nand see no need for change.)\n\n  The report reviewed all the rate relief filings pending before the \nSTB (and its predecessor, the ICC) since 1990. The GAO found that only \n41 rate relief filings were either pending or have been filed since \n1990. About half of these complaints were settled outside of the STB's \nprocess and therefore dismissed. Of the remaining complaints, 7 were \ndecided in favor of the railroad and only 2 have been decided in favor \nof the shipper; 9 are still pending; and 5 were dismissed without \nsettlement.\n  The GAO also found that, in 1997, only 18 percent of the total \ntonnage shipped via rail in this country is subject to rate regulation \nby the STB. About 70 percent of all shipments is exempt because it is \nshipped under contract and the STB has exempted another 12 percent. \nThus, the GAO's analysis of barriers to shippers only relates to a \nportion of the total tonnage of rail shipments in the United States.\n  The ICC Terminations Act required the STB to develop simplified \nprocedures for rate complaint filings. While the STB has developed \nthose simplified procedures, the railroad industry has already \nchallenged them in court and not a single shipper has filed a complaint \nunder these new procedures since the STB issued the simplified \nguidelines in December 1996.\n  The GAO survey of shippers found that the vast majority of shippers \n(over 70%) believe that the STB rate relief process is too costly, \ncomplex, and time consuming. Shippers identified the following barriers \nto obtaining rate relief under the current process:\n  The legal costs associated with filing complaints outweighs the \nbenefits of winning relief.\n  The rate complaint process is too complex and takes too long.\n  Developing the stand alone revenue to variable cost model (shippers \nare required to calculate that the rate they are charged exceeds 180% \nof the revenue to variable cost of a hypothetical railroad to provide \nthem service) is too costly.\n  Most shippers believe that the STB is most likely to decide in favor \nof the railroad so the effort is not worth its costs.\n  The discovery process is too difficult because the shipper is \ndependent upon the railroad for all the necessary data to calculate the \nrevenue to variable cost ratio.\n  Responding to the railroad requests for discovery is too difficult \nand time consuming (note: the GAO identified instances in its analysis \nof the 41 cases filed since 1990 that railroads often extended the \ncomplaint process through lengthy discovery requests).\n\n  Fear of reprisal from the railroads.\n  The STB filing fee in itself is too high to consider filing a rate \ncomplaint.\n  The GAO report found that shippers desire to see (1) a more \nsimplified rate complaint process and (2) increased competition in the \nrailroad industry that would lower rates and diminish the need for a \nrate complaint process.\n  According to the GAO report, the vast majority of shippers believe \nthat the following changes in the rate relief process are necessary to \nprovide them with the ability to seek the rate relief--\n  The STB's time limit for deciding a rate relief case should be \nshortened (the current limit is 16 months).\n  The complaint fee required upon fining should be eliminated or \nreduced.\n  The market dominance requirement should be simplified.\n  Use mandatory binding arbitration between shippers and railroads to \nresolve rate disputes.\n  Lower the STB's jurisdictional threshold from the current level of \n180% of revenue to variable cost.\n  While shippers contend that the rate complaint process needs serious \nrepair, shippers believe that increasing competition in the railroad \nindustry would do more to lower rates and diminish the need for a rate \ncomplaint process. Proposals to increase railroad competition \nidentified in this report include the following:\n  Require the STB to grant trackage rights; require reciprocal \nswitching at the nearest junction or interchange upon request of a \nshipper or competing railroad; and increase rail access for shortline \nand regional railroads.\n  Overturn the STB's ``bottle neck'' decision by requiring railroads to \nquote a rate for all route segments.\n  Consolidation in the railroad industry has diminished competition, \nthwarting the intended objectives of deregulation to allow competition \nto lower rates and improve service. The rate protection intended for \nshippers without effective competition has been de-railed by a complex; \ncostly; and\n\n[[Page S2678]]\n\ntime consuming web of discoveries, findings, and appeals that take \nyears and cost millions of dollars. The result is that we have more \ncaptive shippers whose only recourse for rate protection is an \nimpossible process that is simply not worth the expense. This cannot \ncontinue.\n  Small shippers are forced to take on well financed railroad \ncorporations populated with hundreds of lawyers who can use the complex \nsystem to make rate relief an impossible maze of endless filings, \nappeals, and delays. In the GAO's survey, shippers emphasized the time, \ncost, and complexity involved in filing a rate complaint as significant \nenough barriers as to prevent them from attempting to seek rate relief \nthrough the STB process. Since the railroad industry has blanket \nantitrust immunity--which is a status not enjoyed by another industry--\ncaptive shippers have no recourse and will remain overcharged unless \nCongress takes some action to level the field.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Attached is a \nsummary of the bill's provisions. I ask unanimous consent that the \nsummary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Railroad Competition and Service Improvement Act--Summary\n\n\n                         section 1. short title\n\n       The ``Railroad Competition and Service Improvement Act of \n     1999''\n\n\n                          section 2. purposes\n\n       The purpose of the legislation is to require the STB to \n     accord greater weight to increase rail competition; to \n     eliminate unreasonable barriers to competition; ensure \n     reasonable rates in the absence of competition; and remove \n     unnecessary regulatory barriers that impede the ability of \n     rail shippers to obtain rate relief.\n\n\n                          section 3. findings\n\n       The Congress finds that the railroad industry has become \n     concentrated and that rail industry consolidation has \n     diminished competition, creating a greater dependence upon \n     the Surface Transportation Board's rate relief process, whose \n     procedures for obtaining rate relief, according to a report \n     issued by the General Accounting Office, ``are highly complex \n     and time-consuming.''\n       The GAO also found that--\n       75 percent of the shippers believed that they are \n     overcharged with unreasonable rates and over 70 percent of \n     the shippers believed that the time, complexity, and costs of \n     filing complaints create unsurmountable barriers and \n     therefore precluded them from pursuing the rate relief they \n     are entitled to under the law;\n       The STB rate relief process cost shippers between $500,000 \n     to $3 million per complaint and took between a few months and \n     16 years to resolve;\n       Over ``70 percent [of shippers] believe that the time, \n     complexity, and costs of filing complaints are barriers that \n     often preclude them from seeking relief''; and\n       While shippers contend that the rate complaint process \n     needs serious repair, shippers believe that increasing \n     competition in the railroad industry would do more to lower \n     rates and diminish the need for a rate complaint process.\n       Consolidation in the railroad industry has diminished \n     competition, thwarting the intended objectives of \n     deregulation to allow completion to lower rates and improve \n     service. The rate protection intended for shippers without \n     effective competition has been de-railed by a complex; \n     costly; and time consuming web of discoveries, findings, and \n     appeals that take years and cost millions of dollars.\n\n\n           section 4. clarification of transportation policy\n\n       The legislation requires the STB to give priority to the \n     following policy objectives:\n       (1) ensuring effective competition among rail carriers;\n       (2) maintaining reasonable rates where there is an absence \n     of effective competition;\n       (3) maintaining consistent and efficient service to \n     shippers, including the timely provision of railcars \n     requested by shippers.\n\n\n                 section 5. fostering rail competition\n\n       The bill overturns the STB's ``bottle neck'' decision that \n     has been disappointing for shippers. Under the legislation, \n     rail carriers would have to quote a rate for transportation \n     over a segment of line upon the request of a shipper. If the \n     rail carrier refuses, the STB shall establish the rate.\n\n\n          section 6. relief for certain agricultural shippers\n\n       Places a $1,000 limit on filing fees on rate complaints \n     filed by small, captive agricultural shippers; establishes a \n     simplified and streamlines rate complaint process for small, \n     captive agricultural shippers; and would allow a small, \n     captive agricultural shipper to request service from another \n     railroad or file for damages when their carrier fails to \n     honor railcar orders.\n\n\n         section 7. competitive rail service in terminal areas\n\n       Eliminates the requirement that evidence of anti-\n     competitive conduct be produced when the STB determines the \n     outcome of requests to allow another railroad access to rail \n     customer facilities within an area served by the tracks of \n     more than one railroad.\n\n\n          section 8. simplified standards for market dominance\n\n       The market dominance standard (which establishes the terms \n     in which rail shippers may have standing to challenge the \n     reasonableness of a rate) is simplified in a goal to minimize \n     the regulatory burdens confronting captive rail shippers. \n     Under this legislation, a rail carrier will be presumed to \n     have market dominance if the shipper is served by only one \n     rail carrier and if the rail shipper can demonstrate that the \n     carrier's rate is above 180% revenue to variable cost. \n     [Currently, a shipper must demonstrate--in addition to the \n     above criteria--there is no geographic or product \n     competition. This legislation would eliminate those hurdles \n     for the shipper.]\n\n\n               section 9. revenue adequacy determinations\n\n       Repeals the revenue adequacy test [which is a determination \n     by the STB on the financial fitness of the railroads and \n     creates another obstacle for shippers seeking rate relief \n     from the STB].\n\n\n                section 10. service performance reports\n\n       Requires the railroads to submit service performance \n     reports to the Department of Transportation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n

Mr. President, I rise today to direct your \nattention to a milestone soon to be celebrated by one of America's \noldest friends and allies. On March 20, 1999, Tunisia observes its \nNational Day, the 43rd anniversary of freedom from foreign control.\n  Tunisians have many reasons to be proud of their progress during \nthese last four decades. We as Americans should share that \nsatisfaction, because we have important common values and a long \nhistory of strong, mutually beneficial relations.\n  In fact, when Tunisia was still governed by Pasha Bey of Tunis, as a \nunit of the Ottoman Empire, Tunisia became one of the first treaty \npartners of the newly independent United States. The two nations signed \na ``Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation'' in 1797. The pact \nprovided for ``perpetual and constant peace'' between the parties. If \nall our treaties were as faithfully observed as this one, our foreign \nrelations would be more serene.\n  Whether protecting Mediterranean shipping lanes against Barbary \npirates, opposing the Nazi war machine in North Africa, or supporting \nWestern interests during the Cold War, the U.S. could count on Tunisia. \nMore than 30 years ago, Tunisia displayed great courage in urging other \nArab nations to seek an equitable settlement with Israel. Tunisia later \nbuilt on that pioneering stand by playing an important role as an \nhonest broker at delicate points in the peace process.\n  You do not see many headlines or television footage about Tunisia. \nThe reason is that news coverage of Africa and the Middle East is \ndominated by conflict, extremism, famine, and other calamities. \nTunisia, by enviable contrast, is a quiet success. On a recent visit to \nTunisia, Undersecretary of State, Stuart Eizenstat, called Tunisia a \n``model for developing countries.'' He was correct. During these last \n43 years, Tunisia has built a stable, middle class society. Tunisia has \nadopted progressive social policies that feature tolerance for \nminorities, equal rights for women, universal education and a first-\nrate public health system, and avoided the pitfall of religious \nextremism that has tormented so many other developing nations.\n  Under President Ben Ali's leadership, Tunisia has undertaken \npolitical reforms toward political pluralism and become the first \nnation south of the Mediterranean to formally associate itself with the \nEuropean Union.\n  These are only some of the accomplishments of this small, resilient, \nforward-looking nation. We should be mindful of this enviable record. \nWe should also take satisfaction that, 43 years ago, the United States \nwelcomed Tunisia's independence and provided both moral and financial \nsupport. If all our investments abroad paid such dividends, the world \nwould be a more peaceful place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/15/senate-section/article/S2680-4", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2680-S2681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RAIL COMPETITION AND SERVICE IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, since the early 1980's, Montana has \nbeen faced with a very serious transportation problem regarding the \ntransportation of our grain and coal out of our state at reasonable \nprices and in a reasonable period of time.\n  Montana is a classic case of what happens to rail customers when you \neliminate competitive transportation alternatives. Our rail rates go \nthrough the roof and our rail customers end up subsidizing rail rates \nin regions where competition is present. In a nutshell, our rail \ncustomers pay more for less service. The rail customers in regions with \ncompetitive alternatives pay less and receive more service.\n  Now, we're seeing the same thing happen in other regions around the \nnation. Montana has been down this road and I encourage my colleagues \nto look at the problems we face in Montana as a pre-cursor to what will \nhappen in their states.\n  The Surface Transportation Board (STB), based on their deliberations \nover the McCarty Farms vs. Burlington Northern case, has indicated to \nthe producer that BNSF's rates are not excessive. I am concerned that \nafter 17 years of adjudication using the STB's decision making process, \nthat process is flawed.\n  In the West, we have only two Class I railroads and in Montana, we \nhave only one Class I railroad. Under today's deregulated environment, \nwe have come full circle back to limited competition. Because of this \nlack of competition, Montana's producers pick up the tab for those who \nhave competition.\n  Montana's shippers pay some of the highest rates in the world while \nour neighbors pay a significantly lower cost for transportation. In \nMontana, we are truly dependent on the railroads to transport bulk \ncommodities that could not be efficiently transported by any other \nmeans.\n  Agricultural shippers are the most vulnerable to predatory marketing \nby monopolistic practices of railroads. The farm producer unlike every \nother industry we know of in America, cannot pass the freight costs on \nto anyone else, they must simply eat it.\n\n[[Page S2681]]\n\n  We do not need to re-regulate the railroads; rather we need to \nrestore the balance between rail customers and the railroads that \nCongress intended to achieve originally in the Staggers Rail Act of \n1980. I look forward to working with my colleagues to restore the \ncompetitive balance in the rail transportation industry and level the \nplaying field for our nation's rail customers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/15/senate-section/article/S2681-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF YVONNE GELLISE, RSM\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to honor Yvonne Gellise, who \nwas awarded the Mary Maurita Sengelaub, RSM, Award for Meritorious \nService for 1997. This award is presented annually to a person ``whose \ncontributions to the healing ministry are in striking harmony with the \nworks of Catherine McAuley, foundress and first Sister of Mercy.''\n  Yvonne Gellise was born in Bay City, Michigan, the fifth and last \nchild of Levy and Regina Gellise. An early experience with polio \nfostered her early determination that characterized her many efforts on \nbehalf the community. In 1995, Yvonne joined the Religious Sisters of \nMercy and became Sister Yvonne Gellise. Since then, Sister Yvonne has \nserved in several administrative positions in Mercy facilities in \nMichigan and Iowa. A milestone in her career came when she was named \nchief executive officer of St. Joseph Mercy Hospital, Ann Arbor. Sister \nYvonne provided indispensable leadership during the relocation of the \nhospital to its current site. Sister Yvonne currently serves as senior \nadvisor for Governance at Saint Joseph Mercy Health System, Ann Arbor.\n  Mr. President, Sister Yvonne Gellise is a very deserving recipient of \nthe Mary Maurita Sengelaub, RSM, Award for Meritorious Service. I know \nmy Senate colleagues join me in honoring her on the notable \ncontribution she made to our community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/15/senate-section/article/S2681-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       HEALTH CARE PERSONAL INFORMATION NONDISCLOSURE ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS: Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nHealth Care Personal Information Nondisclosure Act, or the Health Care \nPIN Act of 1999, which I introduced last Wednesday with my friend, \nSenator Dodd. This timely piece of bipartisan legislation sets the \nnecessary national standards that will secure the privacy and \nconfidentiality of every American's medical records.\n  This legislation clarifies patients' rights to copy or amend their \nmedical records. The legislation also encourages insurers and providers \nwith large sets of records to implement their own safeguards and \nprotections from misuse. It sets clear guidelines for the use and \ndisclosure of medical information by health care providers, \nresearchers, insurers, and employers. Most importantly, it requires \nthat individually identifiable health care information not be released \nwithout the patient's informed consent.\n  In the past few decades, the delivery and administration of medicine \nhave evolved by leaps and bounds. Technological advances have \ncontributed to a better and more efficient health care system. They \ncreate new opportunities for the prevention and treatment of disease. \nElectronic pharmaceutical records make it possible for pharmacists to \nidentify potential drug interactions before they fill a prescription. \nTelemedicine will make it possible for patients at Copley Hospital in \nMorrisville, Vermont, a small village of 2,000 people, to benefit from \nthe expertise of physicians fifty miles away at Fletcher-Allen, \nBurlington, Vermont's nationally known academic medical center.\n  The improved access to this information does not come without a risk. \nWe often don't know with any certainty, who has access to our private \nrecords. The establishment of large computer databases, some with \nmillions of patient records, has not only allowed for new, life-saving \nmedical research but has increased the potential for misuse of private \nmedical information.\n  Last month, for example, at the University of Michigan Medical \nCenter, several thousand patient records were inadvertently posted on \nan Internet site. Private patient records containing names, addresses, \nemployment status, and treatment for specific medical conditions \nlingered on the Web for two months. Fortunately, in this case, the \nlapse was discovered before anyone accessed the site, or any damage \ndone.\n  The Health Care PIN Act establishes clear guidelines for the use and \ndisclosure of medical records by health care providers, researchers, \ninsurers, and employers. With very few exceptions, individually \nidentifiable health care information should be disclosed for health \npurposes only, which includes the provision and payment of care and \nplan operations. In order to protect patients from abuse and \nexploitation, this bill imposes civil and criminal penalties on \nindividuals who use information improperly through unauthorized \ndisclosure.\n  Other nations have taken steps to protect patient privacy. In 1995, \nthe European union enacted the Data Privacy directive. This Directive \nrequires all 15 European Union member states establish consistent \nnational privacy laws. This initiative raises the concern that the \nEuropean Union could limit the flow of data between countries that do \nnot provide for comparable protections. If we do not act promptly, this \ndirective may act as a deterrent to the international exchange of \nhealth information and restrict the ability of American companies to \ncompete overseas.\n  Even more pressing is the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act of 1996, also known as the Kassebaum-Kennedy Act, \nwhich established several mandates relating to medical records privacy. \nOne provision set August, 1999, as the deadline by which Congress must \nact to ensure the confidentiality of electronically transmitted data. \nIf, for some reason, Congress fails to act by this date, HIPAA includes \na default provision directing the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to promulgate regulations. We are introducing this bill now \nand we must act as soon as possible in order to meet the HIPAA \ndeadline.\n  Our bill recognizes that some states, like my home state of Vermont, \nhave already taken the lead in the area of privacy protections. Last \nyear's bill provided a uniform federal standard for protected health \ninformation, with the exceptions of state mental health and public \nhealth laws. In addition to these protections, this bill will also \nallow stronger medical records privacy laws enacted prior to the \neffective date of the act to remain in place.\n  Senator Dodd and I look forward to working with members of the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, as well as others \nwho have contributed time and effort to this issue, as we move forward \nto enact this necessary and bipartisan Health Care PIN Act of \n1999.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/15/senate-section/article/S2681-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          COMMEMORATION OF THE 108TH BIRTHDAY OF MS.

Mr. President, it is my pleasure to rise today to \ncongratulate Ms. Nora Hill of Yakima, Washington, who celebrated her \n108th birthday on February 1, 1999.\n  Nora Maddie Wilson was born on February 1, 1891 in Benton County, \nArkansas and is the youngest of twelve children. Nora never had a \nformal education, but was educated by her older brothers and sisters. \nShe loved to read and had beautiful penmanship. Nora was also an avid \nquilter, making extra money by making quilts for other people. In 1911, \nNora married John Bunyon Hill and had four children. In 1940 her family \nmoved to the Yakima Valley in Washington state. Nora could handle a \nteam of horses and a wagon with the best of them, however, she never \nwanted to learn how to drive an automobile, as it made her too nervous.\n  Nora is a survivor of cancer at the age of 99 and a broken hip at the \nage of 104. Both of Nora's sons, who served in World War II, have since \npassed away. Her daughters are still living. Nora has over sixty grand, \ngreat grand, great-great grand and great-great-great grand children.\n  Please all join me in wishing Ms. Nora Hill of Yakima, Washington a \nvery happy 108th year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/15/senate-section/article/S2681-4", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2681-S2682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NATIONWIDE DIFFERENTIAL GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today is a great day for South \nDakota and the nation as March 15, 1999, marks the\n\n[[Page S2682]]\n\noperation of a Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System \n(NDGPS) site in Clark, South Dakota. This morning, Secretary of \nTransportation Rodney Slater officially ``flipped the switch'' on the \nClark site, which activated the Coast Guard's expansion of its maritime \nglobal positioning system into the NDGPS. The Clark site, along with \none in Whitney, Nebraska, will provide South Dakota with complete NDGPS \nservice at no fee.\n  It is not often that a Senator from South Dakota has the opportunity \nto work with the Coast Guard on a project that benefits the people of \nmy state. About two years ago, Rudy Persaud with South Dakota \nDepartment of Transportation contacted me about a technology that was \ndeveloped to find ships out at sea. Rudy, along with a number of \ncommunity development districts in my state, convinced me that this \nsame technology could have enormous benefits on the prairies of South \nDakota. In fact, the benefit to cost ratio for the NDGPS system is an \nastounding 150 to 1, with future uses for the technology appearing \nalmost limitless.\n  Working with the development districts, the South Dakota Department \nof Transportation's goal was to map every mile of every road in the \nstate of South Dakota to give the state and local governments the \nability to develop their communities and allocate important highway \nfunds.\n  I was pleased to introduce legislation in 1997 to expand the Coast \nGuard DGPS into a nationwide system. With the help of Senator Daschle, \nthe legislation was added to the Department of Transportation's annual \nappropriations bill.\n  Throughout the process of securing funding for NDGPS, I have become \naware of the numerous benefits NDGPS has for rural states like South \nDakota. Four nonprofit planning districts in South Dakota currently use \nthe technology for mapping roads. In some counties, NDGPS will be \nintegrated with E-911 systems to provide accurate addresses for rural \nhouseholds.\n  NDGPS will allow hospital helicopters to electronically locate \naccident sites. The need for such technology was evident two winters \nago when a Webster woman became stranded in her car in the middle of a \nblizzard. Running low on gas, and with the temperature around -50 \ndegrees, it took rescue crews several hours to find her and take her to \nsafety.\n  The US Geological Survey will also map potential flood areas in the \nstate, potentially saving lives and millions of dollars in property. \nConsidering the farms and communities already inundated with flooding \nfrom the past two years, I am pleased this technology will allow South \nDakotans to take a proactive approach to identifying potential flood \nareas.\n  The Mid-Dakota Rural Water System is using NDGPS to locate PVC \npipeline for its system that will provide clean drinking water to over \n30,000 South Dakotans who currently rely on wells or municipal water \ntrucked to their home.\n  One of the most promising benefits of NDGPS technology will probably \ncome in agriculture, South Dakota's number one industry. I look forward \nto working with agriculture leaders in South Dakota to promote and \nsupport this technology in a way that makes NDGPS an affordable and \naccessible tool. NDGPS, used in precision farming, may save $5 to 14 \nper acre by showing farmers exactly how best to apply fertilizer and \nchemical inputs on their land, so as to treat the land well for future \ngenerations while cutting costs now. NDGPS-based field mapping helps \ndetermine more accurate yields and makes it easier to more accurately \nutilize fertilizers, chemicals, and crop inputs. This technology can \nalso be used by farmers to keep better crop production records. For \nexample, this technology makes it possible for a properly equipped \nspray rig to switch chemicals or rates of application to address a \nspecific weed problem in a specific section of the field.\n  As of today, March 15, 1999, the NDGPS technology is available in \nevery community in South Dakota. I want to commend Rudy Persaud and the \nmany others involved with NDGPS for their dedication and hard work and \nlook forward to working with them on future uses of this incredible \ntechnology.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/15/senate-section/article/S2682-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2682-S2683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CHILD DEVELOPMENT ACT\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I address you today to speak \nabout a problem that is one of the most pressing facing our nation \ntoday. Ten million children in America are eligible for federal child \ncare assistance, yet we provide for only 1.4 million of them. Fully 86 \npercent of eligible children are left unattended or are forced into \ninadequate facilities that are often overcrowded. These are the only \nviable options for parents who are struggling to make ends meet even in \nthese times of national prosperity. The waiting list for child care \nassistance in many states extends to tens of thousands of eligible \nfamilies. And so many parents who would give almost anything to be able \nto stay at home and care for their children themselves simply can't \nafford to do so. Something needs to be done soon. The problems that we \nare facing today will only compound as children who have been \ninadequately cared for struggle in school and society. As President \nKennedy said, ``the time to fix the roof is when the sun is shining.''\n  Today I reintroduce the most ambitious effort to address this problem \nto date, The Child Development Act. With this one piece of legislation, \nour nation will cut our most threatening problem in half. This bill \nprovides support for half of the ten million American children who are \neligible for federal child support assistance, and provides billions of \ndollars in tax credits for parents who choose to stay home with their \nchildren.\n  The Child Development Act will help children and their parents \nseveral ways. First, it will greatly increase funding for the CCDBG \nprogram, a tried and proven method of providing for care of our \nchildren. The bulk of this money ($37.5 billion over 5 years) will be \nused to provide more affordability for families wanting to enroll their \nchildren in child care programs. There is also $4 billion in CCDBG \nfunds set aside for improving the quality of child care in our country, \nwhich is definitely necessary as Children's Defense Fund studies show \nthat 6 out of 7 child care facilities in this country provide only poor \nto mediocre service, and one out of eight centers actually put the \nsafety of children at risk. Five billion dollars in CCDBG increases is \nset aside for improving afterschool programs for school age children. \nAdditional $2 billion in CCDBG increases is allocated for new child \ncare facilities construction ($500 million) providing 50,000 to 75,000 \nnew high quality child care slots each year; increases in public/\nprivate partnerships where states and local communities' private \nsectors must each match twenty five percent of grants ($500 million); \nand $1 billion is allocated for professional development of child care \nworkers. The remaining portions of the $62.5 billion bill are $1 \nbillion in loan forgiveness to those who earn a degree and work in \nearly childhood education, and $13 billion in tax credits for low- and \nmiddle-income working parents, so that they can better afford quality \ncare for their children. Those parents who make the tough financial \ndecision to stay at home and care for their children will be greatly \nassisted by this provision.\n  Research has shown that much of what happens in life depends upon the \nfirst three years of development. The brain is so profoundly influenced \nduring this time because the brain of a three-year-old has twice as \nmany synapses (connections between brain cells) as that of her adult \nparents. The process of brain development is actually one of \n``pruning'' out the synapses that one does not need (or more \naccurately, does not use) from those that become the brains standard \n``wiring.'' This is why the first three years of development are so \nimportant--this is the time that the brain must develop the wiring that \nis going to be used for the rest of one's life. According to a report \non brain development published by the Families and Work Institute, \n``Early care and nurture have a decisive, long lasting impact on how \npeople develop, their ability to learn, and their capacity to control \ntheir own emotions.'' If children do not receive proper care before the \nage of three, they never receive the chance to develop into fully \nfunctioning adults.\n  We are not allowing our children a chance in life when we do not \nprovide them with proper care in their early\n\n[[Page S2683]]\n\nyears. If America is to achieve its goal of equal opportunity for our \nchildren, we need to start with proper care in their early years. It is \na painful statistic then that our youngest citizens are also some of \nthe poorest Americans. One out of every four of our country's 12 \nmillion children under the age of three live in poverty. It becomes \nvery difficult to break out of the cycle of poverty if poor children \nare not allowed to develop into fully functioning adults.\n  Yet many parents in America do not have the option of providing \nadequate care for their children. For parents who can barely afford \nrent it is nearly impossible to take advantage of the Family Medical \nLeave Act, and sacrifice 12 weeks of pay in order to directly supervise \na child. Many mothers need to return to work shortly after giving birth \nand find that the only options open to them are to place their children \nin care that is substandard, even potentially dangerous--but \naffordable. According to the Children's Defense Fund, six out of seven \nchild care centers provide only poor to mediocre care, and one in eight \ncenters provide care that could jeopardize children's safety and \ndevelopment. The same study said that one in three home-based care \nsituations could be harmful to a child's development. How can we abide \nby these statistics?\n  This is a serious problem, and frighteningly widespread. The \neligibility levels set for receiving child care aid through the federal \nChild Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) is 85 percent of a \nstate's median income. Nationally, this came out to about $35,000 for a \nfamily of three in 1998. However, according to the Children's Defense \nFund, fully half of all families with young children earn less than \n$35,000 per year. Half! A family that has two parents working full time \nat minimum wage earns only $21,400 per year. This is not nearly enough \nto even dream of adequate child care.\n  Child care costs in the United States for one child in full-day day \ncare range from $4,000 to $10,000 a year. It is not surprising that, on \naverage, families with incomes under $15,000 a year spend 23 percent of \ntheir annual incomes on child care. And in West Virginia, if a family \nof three makes more than that $15,000, they no longer qualify for child \ncare aid! In fact, thirty-two states do not allow a family of three \nwhich earns $25,000 a year (approximately 185 percent of poverty) to \nqualify for help. Only four states in our nation set eligibility cut-\noffs for receiving child care assistance at 85 percent of median family \nincome, the maximum allowed by federal law. There is obviously not \nenough funding to support the huge need for child care assistance in \nour nation, and that is why I am proposing the Child Care Development \nAct.\n  There is widespread support for expanded investments to improve the \naffordability and quality of child care. A recent survey of 550 police \nchiefs found that nine out of ten police chiefs surveyed agreed that \n``America could sharply reduce crime if government invested more in \nprograms to help children and youth get a good start'' such as Head \nStart and child care. Mayors across the country identified child care, \nmore than any other issue, as one of the most pressing issues facing \nchildren and families in their communities in 1996 survey. A recent \npoll found that a bipartisan majority of those polled support increased \ninvestments in helping families pay for child care - specifically, 74% \nof those polled favor a bill to help low-income and middle-class \nfamilies pay for child care, including 79% of Democrats, 69% of \nRepublicans, and 76% of Independents.\n\n  It is clear that many like to talk about supporting our children, and \nmany are in favor of supporting our children, but what action is \nactually taken? Yes, the addition of new child care dollars in 1996 has \nhelped welfare recipients, but it has done nothing for working, low-\nincome families not receiving TANF. The Children's Defense Fund \nrecommends that Congress pass comprehensive legislation that guarantees \nat least $20 billion over five years in new funding for the Child Care \nDevelopment Block Grant (CCDBG). My Child Care Development Act goes \nbeyond this, yet even my bill is just a first step. This bill is \ndesigned to provide affordable, quality child care to half of the ten \nmillion American children presently in need of subsidized care. It will \nprovide $62.5 billion over 5 years--$12.5 billion a year--nearly three \ntimes the amount proposed in the President's most ambitious, and still \nunprosecuted, proposal. In 1997 the President proposed extending care \nto 600,000 children from poor families, leaving fully 80% of eligible \nchildren without aid. The last time we heard about that proposal was \n1997.\n  If we are serious about putting parents to work and protecting \nchildren, we need to invest more in families and in child care help for \nthem. Enabling families to work and helping children thrive means \ngiving states enough money so that they can set reasonable eligibility \nlevels, let families know that help is available, and take working \nfamilies off the waiting lists.\n  The Child Care Development Act will require $62.5 billion over five \nyears. There will be several offsets necessary if we are serious about \ngiving children in this country the type of care they need and deserve. \nShifting spending from these offsets demonstrates that our true \nnational priority is children, not wasteful military spending and \ncorporate tax loopholes.\n  The offsets that will be necessary are as follows. If we repeal the \nreductions in the Corporate Minimum Tax from the 1997 Budget Bill, we \ncreate $8.2 billion. The elimination of the Special Oil and Gas \nDepletion Allowance will make room for and additional $4.3 billion. An \noffset of $575 million will come from a repeal of the Enhanced Oil \nRecovery Credit and an offset of $13.8 billion will come from the \nelimination of exclusion for Foreign-Earned Income. From these four \ndifferent offsets in tax provisions a sub total amount of $26.8 billion \nis created to spend on child care.\n  Defense cuts will also be necessary in the amount of $24.4 billion. \nThis will come from canceling the F-22, a plane plagued with troubles, \nwhich will free up $19.3 billion, and $5.1 billion will come from a \nreduction in Nuclear Delivery Systems Within Overall Limits of START \nII.\n  The remaining offsets can be made by reducing the Intelligence Budget \nby 5%, which would save $6.7 billion; by reducing Military Export \nSubsidies by $850 million; and by canceling the International Space \nStation, which costs $10 billion. All of which, when added together, \nallows for an additional $68.8 billion to be used to support our \nchildren.\n  This is, finally, a child care bill on the same scope as the problem \nitself. We as a nation are neglecting the most vulnerable and important \nportion of our society--our children. Here is an ambitious solution to \nthis vast problem that has been plaguing our country, so that we don't \nhave to be a country that just talks about putting our children \nfirst.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/15/senate-section/article/S2683-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2683-S2684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNITION OF STEVEN BOLTON, MD\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to honor Dr. Steven Bolton, \nwho was recently awarded the Mary Maurita Sengelaub, RSM, Award for \nMeritorious Service for 1998. This award is presented annually to a \nperson ``whose contributions to the healing ministry are in striking \nharmony with the works of Catherine McAuley, foundress and first Sister \nof Mercy.''\n  Steve Bolton was raised in the city of Detroit. While growing up in \nthe city his parents placed a strong emphasis on helping the less \nfortunate in our society, and he has passed that feeling along to his \nthree sons. This experience led Steve Bolton, following in the \nfootsteps of his older siblings, to dedicate himself to becoming a \ndoctor in order to ``understand what makes us human and to use this \nknowledge to help others.'' Steve eventually came to understand how \npoverty affects the health of the ``working poor'' and is now a general \nsurgeon at St. Joseph Mercy Oakland making a difference in the lives of \nworking families.\n  Steve Bolton has also served over the past seven years as volunteer \nmedical director of Mercy Place in Pontiac, Michigan. Mercy Place is a \nclinic offering free health care to the community. In addition to his \ndemanding work schedule as a general surgeon, Steve volunteers several \ndays a week at the clinic. He also often donates his professional fees \nif a patient needs surgery and cannot afford to pay.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Steve Bolton is most deserving of the Mary Maurita\n\n[[Page S2684]]\n\nSengelaub, RSM, Award for Meritorious Service.

Mr. President, I want to take just a few moments \ntoday to salute one of the young leaders of the Indo-American \ncommunity, someone who is providing for all of us an exemplary model of \nwhat it means to serve our neighborhoods, our communities, and our \nfellow Americans.\n  Mr. Sunll ``Sunny'' Aghi is the founder and President of the Indo-\nAmerican Political Foundation, an organization based in California, \ndedicated to engaging Indo-Americans in the political process and \nensuring that Indo-Americans gain a foothold in our government as \nelected officials. Sunll Aghi has brought an impressive energy to this \nmission--actively recruiting Indo-Americans to meet the challenges of \nparticipatory democracy as voters, supporters, and candidates, whether \nthe be new citizens or established leaders in California's diverse \ncommunities.\n  Sunll has also found substantial ways to contribute to life in \nCalifornia beyond politics. Mr. Aghi is the founder of Thank You \nAmerica--an organization dedicated to providing food and clothing to \nthe homeless of Orange County each year on Thanksgiving Day, an effort \nwhich has benefits over 500 needy individuals each holiday. Sunll hopes \nto expand Thank You America's operations to eventually include \nproviding college scholarships for talented, young Californians \nstruggling to afford a college education. These efforts demonstrate to \nall of us the truth that DeTocqueville spoke of 150 years age when he \nsaid ``America is great because Americans are good.'' Sunll Aghi is \nkeeping that tradition of civic responsibility alive and well for a new \ngeneration of our citizens.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to have the chance to acknowledge Mr. \nAghi for his contributions to our country and to the democratic \nprocess. I applaud his efforts and share his hopes that someday soon we \nwill bring all Indo-Americans into the mainstream of American politics \nas full participants, and that in the coming years we will build an \nAmerica where Indo-Americans serve in and are fully represented in the \nHouse, the Senate, and the Administration. His work is an inspiration \nto all of us, and I hope more Americans will follow his tremendous \nexample of activism and citizenship raised to a higher level.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/15/senate-section/article/S2684-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2684-S2692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FOREIGN CURRENCY REPORTS\n\n  In accordance with the appropriate provisions of law, the Secretary \nof the Senate herewith submits the following report(s) of standing \ncommittees of the Senate, certain joint committees of the Congress, \ndelegations and groups, and select and special committees of the \nSenate, relating to expenses incurred in the performance of authorized \nforeign travel:\n\n   CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF EXPENDITURE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL BY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. SENATE, UNDER AUTHORITY OF SEC. 22, P.L. 95-384--22\n                                            U.S.C. 1754(b), COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION AND FORESTRY FOR TRAVEL FROM OCT. 1 TO DEC. 31, 1998\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Per diem               Transportation             Miscellaneous                 Total\n                                                                                         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar\n              Name and country                             Name of currency                 Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent\n                                                                                            currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.\n                                                                                                         currency                  currency                  currency                  currency\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStephanie Mercier:\n    USA....................................

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 38, H.R. 540.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 540) to amend title XIX of the Social Security \n     Act to prohibit transfers or discharges of residents of \n     nursing facilities as a result of a voluntary withdrawal from \n     participation in the Medicaid Program.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I rise as an original co-sponsor of S. \n494, the Nursing Home Resident Protection Amendments of 1999, a \nbipartisan bill that would protect Medicaid patients from being dumped \nout of nursing homes in favor of patients who pay only through private \nfunds.\n  When a senior citizen enters a nursing home facility he or she does \nso with the intention of making it their new home. It may not have the \nmemories or immediate comfort level of the home they are used to, but \nfor each elderly person that must enter a nursing home, they are \nexchanging the feelings of familiarity connected with their old home \nfor the security and peace of mind that only comes with constant \nmedical attention. In the recent past, some nursing home companies took \nactions that jettisoned these residents from the beds of their new \nhomes based solely on their method of payment. Those who had the \neconomic capability to pay with private funds were allowed to remain in \nthe facility while those that needed governmental assistance in \npayment, paying with Medicaid dollars, were told to leave.\n  The eviction is not just a matter of the inconvenience of finding a \nnew home, it is a matter of life and death. Studies show that death \nrates among nursing home patients who are transferred or evicted is two \nto three times higher than normal.\n  In some circumstances people were left without any real ``home'' to \ngo to. Someone's method of payment should not determine whether or not \nthey can continue to live in their new community or receive necessary \nmedical attention. Once a facility has decided to accept a resident \nthey should not be able to remove them based on whether they pay with \nprivate dollars or Medicaid. That is discrimination. Therefore, I \ndecided to co-sponsor this bill and join the efforts of Senator Bob \nGraham and others to prevent this discriminatory and traumatizing event \nfrom happening to even one more person.\n  I fully agree that the nursing home industry is a vital element in \nthe continuum of care available to the elderly, and that a balance must \nbe struck between encouraging private operators to\n\n[[Page S2693]]\n\nmake the investment necessary to operate these vital facilities and \nprotecting patients and their families from unfair treatment. The \nreality is that nursing homes are a business and it must be \neconomically feasible for them to operate. However, once a nursing home \naccepts a patient they should fulfill their promise and allow the \npatient to remain a part of the nursing home community regardless of \npayment status.\n  This issue is of particular concern to me since Indiana seniors \nexperienced this unfair treatment. Approximately sixty elderly patients \nfrom one nursing home facility in Indiana, Wildwood, were told to leave \nbecause of their method of payment. In some cases, after they had \nworked hard to save for their future and were forced to spend every \ndollar to support themselves in the nursing home. Even spending every \ndollar they saved did not ensure them security since, once that money \nwas depleted and they received government assistance, they were told \ntheir money was not good enough to keep them in the facility.\n  Robyn Grant was the Indiana State Long-Term care Ombudsman for eight \nyears. She recently testified on behalf of the National Citizens' \nCoalition for Nursing Home Reform before the House Subcommittee on \nHealth and Environment in regard to this issue. Ms. Grant relayed the \nletter of a daughter of a resident who was evicted because they were \npaying with Medicaid. That woman wrote that ``You have destroyed lives \nand emotions and torn apart families. Yes, many of these people though \nnot blood related, considered their companions and friends as family. \nYour facility was their home. Physical and emotional health was gravely \nendangered by the insensitive actions of the nursing home company.''\n  Current law must be changed so there is no propensity for seniors to \nbe torn apart from their newly found families in the future.\n  Nursing homes should have the ability to chose what payment programs \nin which they will participate. However, if a facility decides to \naccept Medicaid patients, they must uphold the promise they made to \nthose seniors. This bill would prevent a nursing home that decides to \nwithdraw from the Medicaid program from evicting residents who were \naccepted prior to the facility's withdrawal. In addition, if a facility \nis a private-pay only, it would be required to notify the resident upon \nher entrance to the facility that she could be evicted after her \nprivate funds were exhausted. The Nursing Home Resident Protection \nAmendments of 1999 would protect the 68% of nursing home residents who \nrely on Medicaid at some point during their stay. This bill will not \ncost anything, but will have a significant positive impact on the lives \nof seniors faced with the need to enter a nursing home.\n  We owe it to all our citizens to keep them informed and protected \nfrom discriminatory practices. This bill does that and I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in turning this legislation into law.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed; that the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table; and that any statements relating to the bill \nappear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 540) was considered read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/15/senate-section/article/S2693-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, MARCH 16, 1999\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.
