Mr. President, on January 6 of this year, the majority \nleader stood on the Senate floor and told us that education would be a \nhigh priority for the Senate. This is exactly what he said:\n\n       Education is going to be a central issue this year. \n     Democrats say it is important and it will be a high priority. \n     Republicans say it will be a high priority.\n\n  I am sorry to say Republicans cannot make that claim today. I want to \ntake a few moments this afternoon, along with some of my colleagues, to \nassess where education is on the leadership's priority list.\n  We have less than 7 legislative days, and that is counting Mondays \nand Fridays--we do not do much on Mondays and Fridays--before the end \nof the fiscal year. There is one Education bill that must be enacted, \nand that is the Education appropriations bill.\n  Despite proclamations that education will be a top priority, the \nSenate has been working on all but 1 of the 13 appropriations bills. We \nhave done at least some work on 12 appropriations bills. We have 1 \nleft. Dead last: education. This is a list of all of the appropriations \nbills:\n  Military construction, No. 1 on the list--the President has already \nsigned that--leg branch; Treasury; District of Columbia; \nTransportation; Defense; energy and water; Commerce-Justice-State; \nInterior; Agriculture; and VA-HUD, the full committee approved VA-HUD \nlast week, and it will be on the floor this week. Education, no action \ntaken. It is dead last on that list, and education is supposed to be a \nhigh priority with the leadership in the Senate? Those are wrong \npriorities. Education should be at the top of this list, not at the \nbottom of the list.\n  Despite a valiant effort by the chairman of our subcommittee, Senator \nSpecter, the Education appropriations bill has not even been written. \nSenator Specter has fought every day to move this bill forward. He \ntried in June, July, August, and September. He tried again last week, \nand we cannot even meet to mark up the bill.\n  If that is not bad enough, the leadership has robbed the Education \nbill to pay for other bills. As a result, we are looking at deep cuts \nin all of the programs funded by the Labor, Health and Human Services, \nand Education appropriations bill.\n  Not only is education dead last on the calendar, it is dead last for \nresources. Our subcommittee started with an allocation, an allocation \nwe received earlier this year, substantially below a freeze from last \nyear. If that is not bad enough, it is even worse now.\n  Last week, the leadership staged another raid on education and took \n$7.276 billion in budget authority, $4.969 billion in outlays, from \neducation and other essential priorities in the bill so they can get \nthe VA-HUD bill to committee.\n  Our subcommittee allocation is $15.5 billion below a freeze. That \nmeans we are facing a whopping 17-percent cut in education.\n  This chart illustrates that. In fiscal year 1999, the year we are in \nright now, we had slightly more than $89 billion. This year, where we \nstand right now, we have $73.6 billion. That is a 17.3-percent cut that \nwill be across the board.\n  What does that impact? A lot of things. Here is one: That cut will \nimpact reducing class size and improving teacher quality. This cut will \nforce communities to lay off 5,246 newly hired teachers. These are the \nthe teachers hired this year, for whom we put money in, for reducing \nclass size. They will have to be let go after just 1 year.\n\n  Funding will be cut for the Teacher Quality Enhancement Program for \n24 States and 52 partnerships to improve recruitment and training of \nteachers. That is where we are right now.\n  We came to the Chamber last Thursday and talked about this issue. \nLater on in the day, the assistant majority leader, Senator Nickles, \ncame to the Chamber and said:\n\n       I would like to correct the record, because I know I heard \n     a number of my colleagues say the Republican budget is \n     slashing education, it's at the lowest end, it's the last \n     appropriation bill we are taking up. Let me correct the \n     record.\n\n  He says:\n\n       One, the budget the Republicans passed earlier this year \n     had an increase for education. . . .\n\n  The budget. We are not talking about the budget. We are talking about \nactual money. I do not care what the budget said. I want to know where \nthe real money is. When that budget got to our appropriations bill, we \nwere cut below a freeze for last year, and certainly the leadership \nought to know that.\n  Then he said:\n\n       The Appropriations Committee has yet to mark up the Labor-\n     HHS bill.\n\n  Our Education bill. Not that we have not tried. Senator Specter tried \nin June, July, August, and September to bring it up, and we are not \nallowed to bring it up. We are not allowed to mark it up.\n  Mr. Nickles said:\n\n       I understand from Senator Specter and others they plan on \n     appropriating $90 billion. The amount of money we have in the \n     current fiscal year is $83.8 billion.\n\n  That is off a little bit.\n  He says:\n\n       So that is an increase of about $6.2 billion. . . . That is \n     an increase of about 9 percent. That is well over inflation.\n\n  I am quoting Senator Nickles. Our assistant majority leader says:\n\n       I think it is too much. I think we should be freezing \n     spending.\n\n  He is talking about education. He says it is too much. He says we \nhave $90 billion. That is not so. Right now we have a total of $73.6 \nbillion for our committee. That is it. If Mr. Nickles has $90 billion, \nI wish he would show me the money. We would love to mark it up. We \nwould love to give education an increase.\n  With all due respect to my friend from Oklahoma, the assistant \nmajority leader, I wholeheartedly disagree with him that we freeze at \nlast year's level of funding for education. I will go into that a \nlittle bit later, but we need an increase in education because of what \nis happening around the country.\n  Mr. Nickles said:\n\n       I think we should be freezing spending.\n\n  That says it all. The leadership is not committed to increased \ninvestments in education. If they had their way, according to the \nassistant majority leader, they would freeze funding for education.\n  We need additional investments in education. Why? Let's look at it \nthis way: The average school building in the United States is 42 years \nold; 14 million children attend classes in buildings that are unsafe or \ninadequate. Enrollment is booming. There are more children in U.S. \nschools than at any time in our history. Class sizes are expanding. It \nis not unusual for elementary schools to have 30 to 35 kids in a class.\n  Our schools are literally bursting at the seams to accommodate the \n53.2 million students enrolled in public schools. These students need \nteachers; they need the latest technology; they need computers in the \nclassrooms if we are going to compete in the next century, in the next \nmillennium.\n  So when the assistant majority leader says he wants to freeze \neducation funding at last year's level, that says it all. They are not \ngoing to make education a priority. They do not care what is happening \nwith the burgeoning classroom sizes.\n  There are priorities and there are priorities. The leadership found \n$16 billion more for the Pentagon. It is interesting that this is $4 \nbillion even more than what the Pentagon asked for. Having spent a \nnumber of years myself in the military and having been on the \nAppropriations Committee for a number of years, I can say, without any \nfear of contradiction, I have never seen, nor do I think I will live \nlong enough to ever see, the Pentagon ask for less money than they \nactually need. They always ask for more money than they need. Yet the \nleadership said that is not even enough; we are going to give you $4 \nbillion more.\n  I have heard one plan after another for how we are going to fund \neducation. The assistant majority leader said we have $90 billion, but \nwe only have $73\n\n[[Page S11077]]\n\nbillion. I do not know where he found this money. I challenge the \nassistant majority leader to come on the floor and tell us where we get \nthe $90 billion. I would like to see it.\n  They are talking about delaying the earned-income tax credit for poor \nworking Americans. How about that for funding education. Talk about \nrobbing Peter to pay Paul.\n  Then there is talk about cutting Medicaid, or a large across-the-\nboard cut in the bill.\n  Then we have heard talk about extending the fiscal year; we are going \nto have another month. We are not going to have 12 months in a year. We \nare now going to have 13 months in a year. I have even heard grade \nschool kids laughing about that one. That does not pass the laugh test \naround here.\n  All I can say is President Clinton sent us a budget that increased \nfunding for education programs which had the offsets necessary so we \ndid not have to raid Social Security and Medicare. It was not as much \nof an increase as I would like to have seen, but at least it is an \nincrease and not a 17-percent cut. He had the offsets there, too.\n  In fact, whenever the leadership so deigns that our education \nsubcommittee can meet and mark up our bill, I will propose an offset \nthat will deal with raising $5.9 billion next year for cutting teen \nsmoking, which has been fully calculated by the CBO to raise that much \nmoney. So we get two things: We will cut teen smoking and raise some \nmoney for education.\n\n  Over the past 5 years, we have had many legislative fights over the \neducation budget. In 1995, the Republican leadership was so insistent \non cutting education they shut down the Federal Government to make \ntheir point. The American people made their views well known at the \ntime. They said: Do not cut education. As a result, the cuts were \nrestored and additional investments were made. I must say that since \n1996, education investments have increased, although the leadership has \nbeen dragged, kicking and screaming, to the table every single year. \nAnd this year is no exception.\n  The American people understand this. They are telling us loudly and \nclearly to make education a top priority. A recent ABC News poll found \nthat three out of four Americans say improving education will be very \nimportant in the next election. Another poll, done by the University of \nChicago, found that 73 percent of Americans favor increasing Federal \ninvestment in education. Yet our assistant majority leader says we need \nto freeze it. Someone is out of step with the American people.\n  Lastly, there is one other chart I want to show about what is \nhappening. I continually hear from my constituents in Iowa and from \nIowa legislators, and others, that property taxes keep going up all the \ntime. Property taxes are going up. State legislators are feeling the \npinch about putting more and more money into education. They are \nwondering what is happening. This chart shows what is happening.\n  In fiscal year 1980, of all the money spent in this country on \nelementary and secondary education, the Federal Government provided \n11.9 percent. In 1998, last year, the Federal Government provided only \n7.6 percent of the total funding for elementary and secondary \neducation.\n  The Federal Government, through the 1980s--the Reagan and Bush years \nand on into this decade--had been cutting the amount of Federal support \nfor elementary and secondary education. This gap from about 11.9 \npercent to 7.6 percent is made up in property taxes. It is made up in \nlocal taxes and State taxes--where they have been asked and see the \nneed to fill in that gap. So we have failed in our responsibility to \nadequately help our States and local communities fund education.\n  I see my friend from Hawaii is here. I just want to make one other \nshort comment and I will yield the floor to him.\n  Last Thursday, the assistant majority leader said something about \nteachers. He said:\n\n       I heard both of my colleagues say--\n\n  Being me since I was the one speaking--\n\n       ``Boy, we need more Federal teachers or more school \n     buildings.''\n\n  Then Senator Nickles said:\n\n       Is that really the business of the Federal Government?\n\n  I never said we need more Federal teachers. But I did say we need \nmore local teachers. We need more teachers to help reduce the size of \nclasses. I believe that is a legitimate Federal responsibility, going \nout and helping our local communities. Not a one of those teachers we \nhired this year to reduce class size works for the Federal Government. \nThey work for local school districts. But we are doing our part in \nhelping.\n\n  To say that we need more school buildings is right. There are more \nchildren in U.S. schools than at any time in our history--53.2 million \nstudents. The average age of our buildings is 42 years old.\n  Yes, Mr. Nickles, we need some newer schools, more schools, and we \nneed some more computers in classrooms; we need more qualified teachers \nand more teachers to reduce class size. But, again, education is last \non the list.\n  Last, we are facing the end of the year. We have a 17-percent cut \nwhere we stand right now in education--dead last. So much for \nRepublican priorities on education.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Do I control the time, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time was allocated to the Senator from \nIllinois, Mr. Durbin, or his designee.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to yield \nwhatever time he may consume to the Senator from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to others who are \ncalling for increases in education funding. Our investment in the \neducation of future generations that will someday run this country \ncannot be undervalued. We must ensure the best education for our young \npeople. However, this will not happen if we undermine education as a \npriority by cutting funding for schools, classrooms, and students. This \nfunding would be deeply reduced for years to come without a veto of the \ntax bill, as President Clinton has promised. In addition, we may see \nreductions in fiscal year 2000 funding if we do not give greater \nemphasis to education as a priority in the current appropriations \nprocess.\n  This is the challenge before us today. Education's share of the \nFederal budget has declined, and it did not start out at a significant \npercentage to begin with. Education makes up 2 percent of the fiscal \nyear 1999 budget. Compare this 2 percent with about 15 percent for \ndefense, 22 percent for Social Security, 11 percent for Medicare, and \n13 percent for interest on the debt. These numbers are reported by the \nCommittee for Education Funding.\n  In addition, the Federal share of education funding has declined, \nfalling from 14 percent for elementary and secondary programs in fiscal \n1980 to 6 percent in fiscal year 1998. For higher education, the \nFederal share fell from 18 percent to 12 percent from 1980 to 1998. \nBecause Federal dollars leverage more support for education from other \nsectors of the economy, we cannot allow the Federal share to dwindle.\n  We can scarce afford to continue this way and shrink the education \ndollar if we look at what lies ahead. According to the recent Baby Boom \nEcho Report from the U.S. Department of Education, total public and \nprivate school enrollment in this country has risen to a record 53 \nmillion students. Furthermore, between 1989 and 2009, elementary school \nenrollment will have increased by 5 million children, secondary \nenrollment by almost 4 million students, and college by 3 million \nstudents.\n  The report lists Hawaii among the top 15 states in enrollment growth. \nFor public elementary and secondary enrollment, in a decade, Hawaii \nwill have 26,000 more students in its schools, reaching 227,000 \nstudents. This means 13 percent more students will be in Hawaii's \nclassrooms in 2009 than are there today. Many States are facing similar \nprojections, and there seems to be no end in sight to this growth.\n  There will be tremendous repercussions from this Baby Boom Echo. One \nexample is in the need for school construction and modernization. Mr. \nPresident, in Hawaii, about three in every four schools need to upgrade \nor repair buildings to good overall condition. More than half of \nschools report\n\n[[Page S11078]]\n\nat least one inadequate building feature, whether the roof is leaking, \nplumbing is not functioning well, or windows are inadequate. In \naddition, four out of five schools report at least one unsatisfactory \nenvironmental factor, such as air quality, ventilation, or lighting. We \nwill need to attend to some or all of these conditions soon as Hawaii \ncontinues to feel the impact of increasing enrollments.\n  Over the next decade, the Hawaii Department of Education estimates \nthat it will need $1.5 billion for capital improvements. This will \ninclude 15 new elementary schools, 2 new intermediate schools, and 2 \nnew high schools. The figure also accounts for 400 new permanent \nclassrooms and $120 million for building replacement.\n  In addition, class size will need to be reduced before learning is \nstifled altogether--this will be had to do with more students in \nschools. Hawaii's average class size is already in the mid-20s, while \nthe recommended size is 18. These are only a few examples of the need \nin our public schools that will be heightened by rising enrollments.\n  It is easy to see shy I cannot condone the education cuts that would \nresult if the tax bill became law. I am not opposed to tax cuts, but \ncommitting $792 billion to tax cuts at this time would lead to serious \nneglect of this country's greater priorities. In an era of budget \nsurplus, we would have to hang our heads in shame for using funds for \ntax breaks when problems loom large: Social Security and Medicare need \nto be made solvent for future decades; the amount we are putting toward \ninterest on the debt must be reduced; and our domestic priorities, \nincluding education, most be boosted.\n  However, the majority's tax plan calls for about 50-percent cuts in \nnondefense discretionary programs. For education, this means: 6 million \nchildren denied extra academic support under Title I funds for the \ndisadvantaged, including 25,000 students in Hawaii; almost 800,000 \nstudents denied a Pell grant, including 2,000 in Hawaii; and nearly $3 \nbillion less in IDEA funding to States, including $9 million intended \nfor special education in Hawaii. The tax bill would mean a giant step \nbackward for education.\n  Now, it appears that the majority is going after education funding \nfor the next fiscal year. It is bad enough that the Labor-HHS-Education \nappropriations bill is often left for last, which means that it picks \nup ``leftovers'' after other appropriations bills have been taken care \nof. This is how we treat a bill that contains programs for the most \nvulnerable Americans.\n  We are currently tangling with an even bigger problem with this bill \ncaused by low allocations for the Labor-HHS bill--something which could \nhave been avoided in this era of surplus. In their zeal to keep the \nbudget surplus sacred for tax cuts, my colleagues in the majority \ncapped the Labor-HHS bill at $73.6 billion. This would translate into a \n17-percent cut in overall education funding.\n  We know that this 17-percent cut will be felt by State and local \neducation agencies, school districts, schools, and classrooms. Its \nimpacts will go directly to our children. The Safe and Drug Free \nSchools Program will be cut almost $80 million from current funding, \nwhich means a cut of more than $375,000 from programs in Hawaii's \nschool- and community-based drug education and prevention activities. \nLooking at title I for the disadvantaged once again, Hawaii would lose \nmore than $3 million. Hawaii's schools cannot afford this loss in \nfunding. There are additional cuts I could list. The bottom line is \nthat it would be a travesty to see this Congress ravage education \nfunding.\n  Mr. President, I stand here not only as a Senator representing the \npeople of Hawaii. I stand here as a former teacher, vice principal, \nprincipal, and administrator in Hawaii's school system. I remember what \nit is like to be at the front of a classroom with young faces and \nbright eyes eager to learn and looking for guidance. I listened to \nparents' concerns at PTA meetings. I talked to individual students \nabout a poor academic record, spotty school attendance, or disruptive \nbehavior that made it difficult for others in the class to learn. I \nremember what it was like being on the front lines of education.\n  I cannot see any good for the future of our country coming out of \nthese large education cuts. We bemoan problems facing our schools today \nsuch as unexpected and shocking incidents of violence. Let us put \nmuscle behind our rhetoric and treat education as a priority by \npreventing this 17-percent cut.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in restoring education as a priority \nand calling for increases, not huge decreases, in the investment in our \ncountry's future. I thank my colleagues for this opportunity to speak \non an issue that is near and dear to my heart, and I yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for \nup to 10 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11078-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11078-S11081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    QUALITY TEACHERS FOR ALL ACT AND THE TECHNOLOGY FOR TEACHING ACT\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, during the next couple of weeks, I plan \nto introduce a series of education bills for consideration in the \ncontext of reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct (ESEA). As you know, one of the most important issues facing \nAmerica today is improving the quality of our public school system. \nImproving the quality of education in America requires a comprehensive \napproach. I believe the basis for that approach must be raising \nstandards and achieving greater accountability. This approach cannot \nfocus on any one facet of our education system but must address all \nfacets. The bills that I will introduce address three key areas; these \nbills raise standards and improve accountability for our teachers, for \nour schools and for our students. Today, I am pleased to introduce two \nbills, which I believe will go a long way towards raising standards for \nteaching in America's schools--the Quality Teachers for All Act and the \nTechnology for Teaching Act.\n  Improving teacher quality continues to be one of my top priorities in \nthe Senate, because research demonstrates that teacher quality is the \nsingle most important factor in student achievement. The Quality \nTeachers for All Act will improve instructional quality by ensuring \nthat teachers in Title I classrooms possess the subject matter \nknowledge, teaching knowledge and teaching skills necessary to work \neffectively in our nation's classrooms. The Technology for Teaching \nAct, which I introduce today on behalf of myself, Senator Patty Murray \nand Senator Cochran, will improve the quality of instruction by \nproviding teachers with necessary training in the use of technology in \nthe classroom.\n  I am a strong supporter of the hard-working teachers in American \nclassrooms. As the son of two teachers, I know that the profession is \nextremely challenging and meaningful. I also know that the vast \nmajority of our teachers are dedicated, professional and competent. Far \ntoo many schools in America, however, allow classrooms to be led by \nteachers with insufficient training and qualifications to teach. \nUnfortunately, it is the schools and classrooms with the neediest \nchildren who often have the greatest number of unqualified teachers. \nDuring a time when we are demanding increased levels of performance for \nour schools and our children, we also must set high standards for all \nour teachers, including those instructing students who will have the \ngreatest hurdles to overcome in the learning process.\n\n  Improving teacher quality is one of the most important changes we \nneed to make to our educational system--especially if we are serious \nabout improving the education of low-income and minority children. Good \nteachers are so important that almost half of the achievement gap \nbetween minority and white students would be erased if minority \nchildren had access to the same quality of teachers, according to \nrecent research published by the Education Trust. Parents, business \nleaders, and the public at large rank teacher quality as a top concern \nbecause it just makes sense that a student's teacher would have a \ndominant effect on his or her education. The need for further progress \nin improving teacher quality was recently highlighted in two 1999 \nstudies--one from the Secretary of Education, the other from Education \nWeek.\n\n[[Page S11079]]\n\n  Over 30 percent of all math teachers are teaching outside of their \nfield of academic preparation--with even higher percentages in other \nacademic areas and in high-poverty schools. Almost 15 percent of the \nnew teachers hired in high-minority districts lack full teaching \ncredentials, which usually involve passing tests to demonstrate needed \nskills and knowledge. In my home State, during the past school year, \n1,074 people were teaching in New Mexico's schools with substandard \nlicenses. Another 737 of New Mexico's teachers were teaching subjects \nthey weren't certified to teach.\n  The Quality Teachers for All Act addresses this problem by requiring \nthat all teachers in schools receiving Title I funds be fully \nqualified. This means possessing necessary teaching skills and \ndemonstrating mastery in the subjects that they teach. By ensuring \nquality teachers in every classroom, we will be empowering our children \nby providing one of the most important resources for academic \nachievement. Under the Quality Teachers for All Act, an elementary \nschool teacher must have State certification, hold a bachelor's degree \nand demonstrate subject matter knowledge, teaching knowledge and \nteaching skills required to teach effectively in reading, writing, \nmathematics, social studies, science, and other elements of a liberal \narts education. Middle school and secondary school instructional staff \nmust have state certification, hold a bachelor's degree, and \ndemonstrate a high level of competence in all subject areas in which \nthey teach. This demonstration of competence may be achieved by a high \nlevel of performance on a rigorous academic subject area test, \ncompletion of an academic major (or equal number of courses, or in the \ncase of mid-career professionals, a high level of performance in \nrelevant subject areas through employment experience.\n  Recognizing that some areas have difficulty attracting qualified \nteachers, the Quality Teachers for All bill addresses this problem by \nallowing school districts to use funds authorized under the bill to \nprovide financial incentives for fully qualified teachers, such as \nsigning bonuses. In addition, the bill supports efforts to recruit new \nteachers by providing alternative means of certification for highly \nqualified individuals with college degrees, including mid-career \nprofessionals and former military personnel. The bill also provides \nsupport for State efforts to increase the portability of teachers' \npensions, certification and years of experience so that qualified \nteachers can have greater mobility and districts can fill unmet needs \nfor qualified teachers more easily. School districts also may use the \nfunds to support new teachers to ensure that we retain the qualified \nteachers that start in the profession.\n  The bill also empowers teachers by providing financial support for \nprograms designed to assist teachers currently working in the system to \nachieve the qualifications required under the bill. The bill will \nprovide grants to assist States and LEAs to provide necessary education \nand training to teachers who do not meet the necessary qualifications. \nThe forms of assistance can include tuition for college or university \ncourse work.\n  Recognizing the critical role played by parents and the need to make \nthem a partner in our efforts to raise teaching standards, this bill \nrequires districts and schools to provide parents with information \nregarding their child's teacher's qualifications. This effort builds on \nprovisions I authored which became part of the Higher Educations Act of \n1998. Those provisions require a national report card on teacher \ntraining programs. By reporting this information, the public as well as \nthe schools can assess the strengths and weaknesses of teacher training \nprograms. Likewise, the parental right-to-know provision in the Quality \nTeachers for All Act will empower parents by informing them of the \nstrengths and weaknesses of their children's teachers and help them to \nprovide support for increased teacher quality efforts.\n  If our educational system is going to prepare our children for the \n21st Century, we must do a better job at preparing our teachers and our \nstudents to use the tools of the 21st Century--technology. We also must \nuse this valuable resource to improve instruction and expand access to \nlearning. Therefore, efforts to raise standards for teaching also must \ninclude greater incorporation of technology into our teacher training \nprograms and our classrooms. In response to this need, I--along with \nSenators Murray and Cochran--are proud to introduce the Technology for \nTeaching Act. If enacted, this bill will build on existing efforts to \nimprove teacher training in the use of technology in the classroom and \nprovide resources to develop innovative uses of technology in the \nclassroom.\n\n  Education technology can enlarge the classroom environment in ways \nthat were unimaginable only a decade ago and can empower students to \ndevelop as independent thinkers and problem-solvers. Teachers deserve \nthe skills needed to bring these extraordinary resources and \nopportunities into the classroom. Without these skills, America's \nteachers will find it increasingly difficult to meet the rising \ninternational standards of educational excellence. We also must provide \nfor research and development, as well as evaluation of existing uses of \ntechnology, in order to ensure that the most effective education-\nrelated technology is in place in our nation's schools. In addition, we \nmust close the digital divide by making technology available to all \nstudents, during the school day and outside the school day.\n  The Technology for Teaching bill will provide federal support to: (1) \nprovide training to teachers to assist them to integrate technology \ninto their classrooms; (2) evaluate the role of technology in the \nclassroom; (3) stimulate the development and use of innovative \ntechnologies to assist students to achieve high academic standards; and \n(4) narrow the ``digital divide'' by providing high-need communities \nand students with greater access to technology.\n  Experts say that we should invest at least 30 percent of our \ntechnology budget in training. Nationally, we are now investing less \nthan one-third that amount. Only 15 percent of teachers had 9 or more \nhours of technology instruction in 1994. Trained teachers help make \ncomputers useful to students, connect school to the home and community, \nand help prevent misuses of technology. Most of all, trained teachers \ncan improve student achievement by applying the technology to academic \ncontent areas. The Technology for Teaching Act establishes two teacher \ntraining programs, administered by the Office of Education Technology \nin the Office of the Deputy Secretary of Education, to make competitive \ngrants to State Departments of Education. One program promotes the \ninclusion of education technology in the initial undergraduate \npreparation of new teachers; the other focuses on ongoing professional \ndevelopment of current teachers.\n  Schools of education that train new teachers will be eligible to \napply to State Departments of Education for grants to improve their \nprograms in education technology. Grant support would require and \nenable schools of education to work in collaboration with local K-12 \nschool districts and the education technology private sector. Through \nthese partnership activities, schools of education will improve and \nexpand the ways in which they prepare future teachers to use technology \nin the classroom.\n  Local K-12 Education Agencies (LEAs) will be eligible to apply to \nState Departments of Education for grants to improve their professional \ndevelopment programs in education technology. In applying for grants, \nLEAs will be required to develop consortia that include one or more \nschools of education, education technology companies, and other \npartners able to help improve their professional development programs. \nThese consortia will provide LEAs and teachers with access to the \nlatest education research and the most current education technology \navailable. The results of these partnership activities will be new and \ninnovative programs for teacher professional development.\n  The question of whether education technology is an effective tool in \nthe classroom is already being answered in part by solid peer-reviewed \nstudies which show a significant improvement in student performance and \nattitude in all age groups and all subject areas through better use of \ntechnology. This research demonstrates what advocates have believed all \nalong: if used correctly, technology in the classroom\n\n[[Page S11080]]\n\nproduces measurable improvement in student achievement and enthusiasm. \nA new $25 million research and evaluation program at the National \nScience Foundation will provide even more insight into the positive \nimpact of education technology. The need for a larger scale research \nand coordination initiative remains. The Technology for Teaching Act \nrequires the Secretary of Education to evaluate existing and \nanticipated future uses of educational technology. The Secretary may \nconduct long-term controlled studies on the effectiveness of the use of \neducational technology; convene experts to identify uses of technology \nthat hold the greatest promise for improving teaching and learning and \nto identify barriers to the commercial development of effective, high-\nquality, cost-competitive educational technology and software.\n\n  We also must continue to support research and development efforts to \nexplore new uses for technology to improve instruction. The bill \nprovides for grants to stimulate the development of innovative \ntechnology applications. The Secretary awards competitive grants to \nconsortia of public and private entities developing innovative models \nof effective use of educational technology, including the development \nof distance learning networks, software (including software deliverable \nthrough the Internet), and online learning resources. For example, \ngrants could be awarded to projects seeking to develop web-based \ninstruction to provide access to challenging content such as Advanced \nPlacement courses.\n  Reduces inequities in access to computers and the Internet must \ncontinue to be a main function of federal education technology \nprograms. Education technology can engage students, provide much-needed \nemployment skills, and open up a world of learning and experiences. But \nlike well-trained teachers and new school buildings, these resources \ntend to flow to wealthier school districts. If we believe that no child \nshould be too poor to have a quality teacher, a safe classroom or \ntextbook, the same should hold true for access to computer technology. \nThe federal government ha always been the great equalizer between the \nhaves and have-nots. Therefore its main mission with respect to \neducation technology should be to do what it does best--level the \nplaying field so all students can acquire the computer skills to \nfunction in today's world. the bill targets existing technology grants \nand the new grant funds authorized by this bill to high-poverty, low-\nperforming schools. The bill also supports the development and \nexpansion of community technology centers to serve disadvantaged \nresidents of high-poverty communities. The centers provide access to \ntechnology and training for community members of all ages.\n  By ensuring high-quality, well-prepared teachers in our classrooms, \nwe empower our educational system and our nation to meet the challenges \nof an increasingly complex and challenging world. I know that most, if \nnot all, of my colleagues agree that a critical first step in improving \nour nation's schools is to support efforts to raise standards for \nteaching in our poorest and most challenged schools and to prepare our \nteachers and our children in the use of technology, while also \ncapitalizing on the benefits of technology as an educational tool. We \nmade great progress in our efforts to improve the quality of \ninstruction by raising standards for teacher quality in the higher \nEducation Act last year and through existing program supporting the use \nof education technology in schools. I urge my colleagues to continue to \nsupport these efforts by supporting passage of the Quality Teachers for \nAll Act and the Technology for Teaching Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I hope our colleagues pay careful attention to the \nexcellent presentation that has been made by my friend and colleague \nfrom New Mexico. I think all Members who are fortunate enough to serve \non the Education Committee know Senator Bingaman has been tireless in \naddressing the issue of enhancing the quality of education for the \nchildren of this country. This afternoon he outlined very important, \nthoughtful steps that I think ought to draw strong bipartisan support. \nHe has certainly urged our colleagues to try to find ways in which we \ncan work together in support of those proposals. I join with him in \nurging our colleagues to do so.\n  For the number of years I have been in the Senate, the issue of \neducation has never been a partisan issue. I think for the first 15 \nyears I was in the Senate on the Education Committee, we never had a \nsingle vote that divided Republicans and Democrats on issues of \neducation--not that we always got it right, but we always attempted to \nfind ways of working closely together.\n  We recognize there are limited resources we can provide for \neducation, probably 7 cents out of every $1, but what the American \npeople are looking for is a partnership to try to find ways we can \nenhance educational opportunities to children.\n  I rise somewhat reluctantly to draw attention to the fact that we are \nin a very desperate situation as we come to the end of this session in \nregards to addressing the issues of education. I think many of us \nremember the early January speeches by our Republican leader. Senator \nLott said, ``Education is going to be a central issue this year. The \nDemocrats say it's important and it should be a high priority. \nRepublicans say it's a high priority.'' Many were hoping this was the \nclarion call for all to come together and work together. We had similar \nstatements by our good friend, the chairman of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Domenici, who said, ``I'm going to recommend the Republicans \nsay it's time to quit playing around the edges and dramatically \nincrease the amount of money that we put in public education.'' This \nwas enormously encouraging.\n  At the outset, I will say just allocating resources is not always the \nanswer to the challenges we are facing in education. It is a pretty \nclear indication of what our Nation's priorities are. We heard from the \nleadership in the Senate the rhetoric that this was going to be the \neducation Congress and the education year.\n  It is appropriate that we look back over this past year and over the \npast few years to find out exactly what our record has been under this \nleadership in the areas of education. I can remember right after the \n1994 elections with the new leadership elected in the House and the \nSenate of the United States Congress, one of the first things we had \nwas not an appropriation of additional funding in the areas of \neducation, but we had a recision.\n  What does a recision mean? It means it is the judgment of the House, \nthe Senate, and the President to allocate certain resources in the \neducation programs. In my hand I have the conference report, the 1995 \nrecisions: $1.7 billion in the House of Representatives. Those were \nprograms, for example, such as the Title I program to help some of the \nneediest children; it was cut back almost a third; the Eisenhower \nProfessional Development Programs, which enhance teacher qualities for \nmath and science in our high schools, cut $100 million; the Safe and \nDrug Free Schools, cut $472 million.\n  We air a great deal of rhetoric on the floor of the Senate about how \nwe will make our schools more safe and secure. Going back to 1995, we \nfind the attempted recisions in the areas of education. Then in 1996--I \nhave the report on the appropriations, the request from the House \nappropriations which is $3.9 billion below the 1995 figures. That is \nunder the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives--$3.9 \nbillion below.\n\n  Does this sound as if it is beginning to be a pattern?\n  Wait just a moment, and we will find out what happened in 1997. I \nhave the committee report on appropriations for 1997. This was $3.1 \nbillion below the President's request.\n  Now we have 1995, we have 1996, we have 1997; we have 1998, $200 \nmillion below the President's total; and now, 1999, $2 billion below \nthe President's request.\n  That is a fearsome record in terms of the allocation of scarce \neducation resources. Now we see this happening again this year. That is \nwhy Democrats are so concerned.\n  We have seen under the Republican leadership a recommendation of a 17\n\n[[Page S11081]]\n\npercent cut in education that would be represented by a $15 billion cut \nthis year in the education programs on an appropriation that we cannot \neven have sent here to the Senate. We find that somewhat distressing \nand disturbing.\n  What has happened in the past when the Republican leadership had \nresponsibilities? The education proposal in 1995 came in 7 months after \nthe end of the fiscal year. In 1997, the final agreement was not passed \nuntil the final day of the old fiscal year, September 30, 1996. In \n1998, it was passed 1 week after the end of the fiscal year. In 1999, \nit was passed 3 weeks after the end of the fiscal year.\n  There is a pattern here--cutting back on education resources and \ndoing it at the very end, the last business for the Congress.\n  If a political party wants to put education at the top of the \nAmerican agenda, it doesn't come last, it comes first. It doesn't come \nwith the greatest kinds of cuts we have seen in any appropriations bill \nin recent times; it comes after due deliberation of these very needs \nand requirements and then the support for those programs. That is the \nway we deal with it.\n  That is what we find as we come into the last weeks--the enormous \nfrustration of many in this body who believe very deeply, as the \nAmerican public does, that if we are going to meet our responsibilities \nin education, we ought to have the opportunity to debate these issues \nin a timely way and not have the efforts that have been made on 17 \ndifferent occasions when we tried to bring up various amendments, to \nhave those amendments either immediately tabled or immediately \neffectively ignored, virtually denying Members the opportunity of \nhaving a full and complete debate on what are our fundamental and basic \nresponsibilities for a national Congress and a President of the United \nStates in education.\n  So I believe the Republican leadership bear grave responsibilities in \nthis area. We will over these next few days point this out in very \ncareful detail, about what these particular cuts and programs are, and \nhow they have really affected and adversely impacted the opportunities \nfor children to move ahead. That is the record. It is one of great \ndiscouragement, and it is one I hope our Republican friends will be \nwilling to address.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11081-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MINIMUM WAGE AND BANKRUPTCY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last Thursday the majority leader filed a \ncloture motion on S. 625, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999. If the \nSenate adopts cloture, an amendment to increase the minimum wage could \nnot be offered to the bill. Some Senators may support cloture because \nthey believe the minimum wage is not relevant to the bankruptcy debate, \nbut I disagree. Raising the minimum wage is critical to preventing the \neconomic free-fall that often leads to bankruptcy, and many of us have \nsponsored the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 1999 to begin to right that \nwrong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is that all 15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 10 minutes allotted to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Then I yield to myself just 4 of the last 5 minutes, \nplease.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, invoking cloture would deny us the opportunity, on the \nfloor of the Senate, to offer a minimum wage amendment that will raise \nthe minimum wage 50 cents next January and 50 cents the year after and \nprovide some $2,000 of purchasing power for minimum wage workers. In \nall, over 11 million Americans will benefit from an increase in the \nminimum wage.\n  We seek to raise the minimum wage at a time of virtual price \nstability, at a time of virtual full employment, and at a time when the \nink is not even dry on the vote by the Members of the Senate to give \nthemselves a pay increase of over $4,000 this year. I will say, at \nleast the Democrats who voted in support of that increase would also \nvote in support of an increase in the minimum wage. But why should we \nbe denied that opportunity? Why should we be denied the opportunity to \nhave a vote on this particular issue? It makes such a difference to \nfamilies that work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year.\n  We believe raising the minimum wage is relevant to the bankruptcy \nissue. The threat of bankruptcy is related to the availability of \nresources. The fewer financial resources individuals have, the more \ndifficult it is for them to meet their economic challenges. We do not \nhave the opportunity, at least at this time, to get into all of the \nreasons so many individual Americans are going into bankruptcy. But we \nfind half of the women are in bankruptcy because their husbands refuse \nto pay child support. Of workers who are over 55, the greatest \npercentage of those in bankruptcy are there because they don't have \nhealth insurance. Many in bankruptcy are workers dislocated from their \njobs because of mergers, who find themselves caught in a downward \neconomic spiral.\n  We should have an opportunity to address those issues. Why does the \nRepublican leadership deny us the chance to have a fair vote on raising \nthe minimum wage, providing hard working Americans with an extra \n$2,000? That might not seem like a lot to many here, but it is about 7 \nmonths' worth of groceries for a family, or 5 months of rent. It will \npay for almost two years of tuition for a worker or her son or daughter \nto attend a community college. It is a lot of money for many hard-\nworking Americans.\n  Finally, the minimum wage is a children's issue because the children \nof workers who earn minimum wage are impacted by their parents' scarce \nresources. It is a women's issue, because the majority of minimum wage \nworkers are women. It is a civil rights issue because one-third of \nminimum wage workers are African-American or Hispanic. It is basically \nand most fundamentally a fairness issue. At the time of the greatest \nprosperity in the history of this country, are we going to continue to \ndeny our brothers and sisters, Americans who are working hard, 40 hours \na week, 52 weeks of the year, the opportunity to have a livable wage?\n\n\n                         privilege of the floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Kathy Curran, a Labor \nDepartment detailee, be granted the privilege of the floor during \ntoday's debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts, as \nwell as the Senators from Hawaii and Mexico, for joining in our \nmessage.\n  My fear is, in the closing weeks of this session, if the Members of \nthe Senate were accused of having passed legislation this year to help \nthe families of America, we could not gather enough evidence to prove \nthe charge. We are about to leave town in a few weeks emptyhanded, \nhaving done little or nothing on education, little or nothing on \nminimum wage, little or nothing on health care. Frankly, I think the \nAmerican people sent us to this body to do things to make life better \nfor families across America. The Senator from Massachusetts speaks \nabout minimum wage and education. There are so many other items on the \nagenda that should be addressed by a Congress listening to the American \npeople.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

They did not \nmention Ed-Flex, one of the most important education bills that has \nbeen passed in this Congress, which allows families and school boards \nand States to have more say in education. They didn't talk about the \ntax bill which provides an opportunity for families to invest and save \ntheir\n\n[[Page S11082]]\n\nmoney so it can be used for education. They did not talk about \nstandards and accountability, the fact we are going to take up these \nbills, the elementary school and secondary education bill, or Social \nSecurity, where we have done something about the proposal there, or the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights.\n  It is interesting; when they talk about some of the things they would \nlike to see happen, they somehow forget about the things we have done. \nI guess that indicates we do have a different view. It is proper. It is \nperfectly legitimate to have a different view about how we accomplish \nthe things we are about.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma such time as he \nmay consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for \nyielding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11082-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11082-S11085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE IMPORTANCE OF VIEQUES\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I do want to talk about some of the tax \nramifications, today's subject. I think it is very significant.\n  Prior to doing that, though, we have an issue that is current, rather \nsensitive, and is rather serious in terms of our Nation's security.\n  Tomorrow, the committee I chair, the Readiness Subcommittee of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, will be holding a hearing to review \nthe national security requirement for continued training operations of \nthe naval facility off the island of Puerto Rico called Vieques. It is \na very important issue, military readiness, with the lives of military \npersonnel on one side of the debate and the interests of the local \ncommunity on the other.\n  At this point, I remind the President that for 57 years we have used \nthis island of Vieques, an island that is approximately 20 or 25 miles \nwide, one small area way over on the east end of this island as a \nrange, a bombing range--57 years. During that time, we have lost the \nlives of one person, who was a civilian employee working for the Navy. \nThis happened last April and created quite a bit of hysteria. There are \nmany people trying to use this as an excuse to close down the range \nthat is so vital to our interests.\n  We have seen all the press reports outlining the concerns of those \nwho oppose the military's use of the island. We have also witnessed the \nintroduction of legislation to close this range. Unfortunately, far \nless attention has been given to the national security requirement for \ncontinued access to the training provided by this range. In fact, I \nhave not heard anyone address the increased risk to our Nation's youth \nwho serve in uniform and what they will face if we send them into \ncombat without the benefit of the training that is offered only at \nVieques Island. The subcommittee will be meeting tomorrow to explore \nthe requirements of this language.\n  It is my hope that once the panel, appointed by the Secretary of \nDefense to review this matter and make recommendations for appropriate \nresolution, issues its report, the committee will be able to then meet \nto review those recommendations and hear from the people of Puerto Rico \nas well as the military.\n  The Secretary of the Navy recently released a report, prepared by two \nof its senior officers, which examines our training activities on \nVieques and explores potential alternative training sites. Although no \nalternative site has yet been identified that would replace the \ntraining Vieques provides, I understand the panel appointed by the \nSecretary of Defense and by the President continues to seek a \nresolution to this issue.\n  I will read a couple paragraphs out of the Navy report prepared by \nthose individuals. I think it is very significant:\n\n       The Inner Range at Vieques is the only range along the \n     Atlantic seaboard that can accommodate naval gunfire, the \n     only range at which strike aircraft are afforded the use of \n     air-to-ground live ordnance with tactically realistic and \n     challenging targets and airspace which allows the use of high \n     altitude flight profiles.\n\n  This is very similar to what we witnessed in Kosovo, and they were \nvery successful. Even though to begin with we should not have been \ninvolved, it was necessary to use high-altitude bombing to be out of \nthe range of surface-to-air missiles. We did that successfully, and \nthey received their training at Vieques. I do not know what the degree \nof success would have been otherwise.\n\n  Continuing from the report:\n\n       It is the only range at which live naval surface, aviation \n     and artillery ordnance can be delivered in coordination. \n     Additionally, Vieques is the only training venue that can \n     accommodate amphibious landings supported by naval surface \n     fires. . . .\n\n  It continues and talks about how this is the only facility we have, \nand if we do not have this facility, we are going to be deploying \ntroops into areas without proper training. One of the conclusions of \nthe report is:\n\n       This study has reaffirmed that the Vieques Inner Range \n     provides unique training opportunities vital to military \n     readiness, and contributes significantly to the ability of \n     naval expeditionary forces to obtain strategic objectives. \n     This study examined alternative plausible sites and concluded \n     that none, either in existence or yet undeveloped, would \n     provide the range of training opportunities at Vieques Inner \n     Range.\n\n  The U.S.S. Eisenhower is going to be deployed in February to the \nArabian Gulf and to the Mediterranean to do just this type of exercise \nand will be called upon to do something to defend this country when \nthey will not have had the proper training from Vieques because right \nnow there is a moratorium and the U.S.S. Eisenhower has not had the \nopportunity to have that training.\n  Any resolution must provide the military with the ability to achieve \nthe same level of proficiency that the training operations at Vieques \ncurrently provide. Any proposal to move operations to a phantom or an \nunidentified site as of yet is unacceptable. Before any decision is \nmade to move operations from Vieques, a specific alternative site must \nbe identified and all actions necessary to make it functional, from \nenvironmental studies to military construction, must be completed. \nFailure to identify a specific site and make it available will simply \nprove the validity of the Navy's position that no viable alternative \nexists. Therefore, any decision to continue the use of Vieques, but at \na reduced level of operations, must still allow the military to perform \nthe training necessary to meet the required wartime proficiency.\n  I fear that a decision is going to be made based on politics rather \nthan national security. I am concerned that this administration may \ntake action that will place at risk the lives of sailors and marines \nsimply to court the popular vote in favor of candidates with close ties \nto this President.\n  One only has to look back at the recent decision to release \nterrorists from prison to fully appreciate the extent to which this \nPresident is willing to place American lives and interests at risk in \norder to garner votes for his friends and family. The inappropriate \npoliticization of the issue has already been demonstrated by the \nJustice Department and the U.S. attorney's office in Puerto Rico which \nhave refused take necessary action to protect the lives of American \ncitizens.\n  As many of my colleagues already know, as we speak today, there are \nprotesters over there, some four groups of protesters, who are on the \nlive range with live ordnances. I had occasion to spend a good bit of \nthe recess looking at this. I have been over every inch of the island \neither by helicopter or by car or on foot. I have seen the protesters \nout there throwing around live ordnances. Just imagine, in 57 years, \nhow much is out there. One particular individual came out carrying a \nlive ordnance and tried to get on a commercial aircraft, which would \nhave killed everybody on the aircraft.\n\n  It is a very serious thing, and I cannot believe our Justice \nDepartment has refused to enforce the laws of trespassing on Federal \nmilitary Government property. I hope these explosives do not fall into \nthe hands of some of the terrorists the President recently released \nfrom prison.\n  One thing about this issue is certain. The primary mission of \nRoosevelt Roads is to support training operations at Vieques. If \nmilitary access to Vieques is eliminated, the value of Roosevelt Roads \nwill be greatly reduced, and those functions, other than supporting \nthis range, can be performed very well in other areas where there is \nexcess capacity.\n\n[[Page S11083]]\n\n  The U.S. military cannot afford to fund a base that provides little \nor no benefit to national security. Therefore, today I have introduced \nS. 1602, legislation which will close naval station Roosevelt Roads at \nsuch time as the military terminates military operations at Vieques, if \nthat should become a reality.\n  I have seen this. I have become convinced. Our hearing tomorrow will \neither disprove or prove what I am saying today--that it is absolutely \nnecessary to have the benefits of this range and that there is no place \nelse we have in our arsenal, no other range, that provides the type of \ntraining that will save American lives. If we send in our troops, as we \nare preparing to do right now on the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and they get \ninvolved in some kind of a problem and do not have the benefit of the \ntraining at Vieques as those who participated in Kosovo, it could \ncertainly cost American lives, and we will be sending our troops at far \ngreater risk, which I weigh and measure in terms of human life.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am happy to yield to the distinguished chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee of jurisdiction over this issue, for spending the time on \na careful analysis of this very important problem. We will have the \nhearing tomorrow. We consulted on this, and I am hopeful that he will \nconsider a follow-on hearing, because as I look over tomorrow's agenda, \ngiven the time we have, it is my view that we will need a subsequent \nhearing on this.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me respond to the chairman. In the subcommittee, we \nare only going to address what alternatives there are, why it is \ncritical. There are far more things to consider. It is my hope the full \ncommittee that my colleague chairs will hold a hearing.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I agree that we will look at the policy \nissues involved. At the moment, we need to have a record before the \nSenate on the absolutely vital nature of this range to the very safety \nof individual service persons, primarily those flying aircraft, but in \nevery respect those in the Marine Corps doing amphibious work.\n  Mr. President, we cannot send, as the Senator from Oklahoma said, \nthese individuals into harm's way without adequate training. We are \ndoing that with the next battle group, as you pointed out.\n  So I think we should advise the Senate of the hearing tomorrow, the \nimportance of that, the subsequent hearing, maybe at the subcommittee \nlevel, depending on further readiness aspects, and then the full \ncommittee on a policy issue.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I agree with the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  I had the opportunity last night to be with the President--Senator \nDomenici and I--with regard to the debate that we will have tonight on \nthe conference report of the authorization bills of the Senate and the \nHouse, and I brought this subject up.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the colloquy with \nthe Senator from Oklahoma my letter to the President, which I discussed \nwith him last night on the VA issue, be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. I am sure you mentioned that across the board the \nuniformed side of the Department of Defense stands foursquare with the \ncomments that you have made today. I have had consultations, as you \nhave had, with the Chief of Naval Operations, the Commandant of the \nMarine Corps, General Shelton, the Chairman, and others, on this issue.\n  This is an issue that I have had considerable familiarity with for \nmany years--when I was the Under Secretary and Secretary of the Navy in \n1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, and 1972. We had recurring problems of this \nnature down at Vieques. We constantly worked with the political \nstructure at that time to resolve the problems.\n  But I think you are absolutely correct. At the moment, we have to \nregain control of this range for training purposes. I hope the \ncommission--the several officers looking at this--will come forward \nwith a program that will indicate to the Puerto Ricans we want not to \nbe offensive to the people of Puerto Rico but to indicate the need for \nthis area and, hopefully, to have some program by which we can meet the \ndesires of all parties to work it out in some way.\n  At this moment, I am not prepared to indicate what the workout should \nbe. I want to study the report of this commission. The Senator from \nOklahoma and I should have private consultation with the Secretary of \nDefense and others. But let's see what we can do to meet the \nrequirements of all parties involved but focusing on the essential \nnature of this range to America's readiness of its Naval and Marine \nCorps forces and embarking periodically to trouble spots in the world \nfrom the East Coast.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  I would only say that it is not very often you get total agreement \nfrom all of the commanders in the field, all of the CINCs in the field, \nas well as all the chiefs. All four chiefs are on record right now \nsaying this is absolutely necessary to have as part of our training.\n  One of the things I have been trying to do is to quantify in terms of \nAmerican casualties when you go from low to high to very high risk--\nwhat that means. There is no question there is not one who will not say \nif we send our troops in there without this very valuable training that \nthey can only get at the Vieques, it is going to be at a higher risk, \nwhich means American lives.\n  I certainly hope the people of Puerto Rico understand we are talking \nabout their lives, too. So we should all be focused on the same thing.\n  Mr. WARNER. I presume you include in your remarks direct reference to \nthe Navy and Marine Corps aviators who flew missions in Kosovo, who are \nflying tonight and tomorrow and for the indefinite future missions with \nregard to the containment of Iraq, in many instances in hostile fire. \nTonight, tomorrow, and the next day----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. For the indefinite future, we are asking them to endure \nthis hostile fire. And from time to time they have to drop live \nordnance to protect themselves in fulfillment of this containment \nmission over Iraq.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I did allude to that.\n  I suggest to the Senator from Virginia also the fact that the \nsuccesses we had in Kosovo were directly related to the Vieques. The \nlast place they got training before going into Kosovo was at the \nVieques.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 1999.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear. Mr. President: As Chairman of the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee, I write to express my grave concern over \n     the future of the United States Navy's training facility \n     located on the Puerto Rican Island of Vieques. Ever since I \n     was the Secretary of the Navy, I have worked to keep this \n     facility available to the Department of Defense.\n       The last two east coast carrier battlegroups which deployed \n     to the Adriatic and Arabian Gulf, completed final integrated \n     live fire training at Vieques. Both battle groups, led by the \n     carriers U.S.S. Enterprise and U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, saw \n     combat in Operations Desert Fox (Iraq) and Allied Force \n     (Kosovo) within days of arriving in theater. Their success, \n     with no loss of American life, was largely attributable to \n     the realistic and integrated live fire training completed at \n     Vieques. This island is unique in character, both in terms of \n     its geography, with deep open water and unrestricted \n     airspace, and its training support infrastructure. The \n     training range is absolutely vital to our readiness, and \n     there is no replacement facility available.\n       Without a doubt, America enjoys the best trained, best \n     equipped and most motivated military force in the world. But \n     combat skills, practiced at Vieques, are perishable. Aviators \n     must hone targeting and weapons delivery skills; ammunition \n     leaders and flight deck personnel must coordinate weapons \n     assembly and leading; naval surface fire support teams must \n     integrate calls for fire support with ground units; gunfire \n     spotters must refine targeting skills; and ground units must \n     practice the seamless transfer of command ashore. The Armed \n     Forces have learned these lessons well. Untrained forces are \n     exposed to higher casualty rates and experience less mission \n     success.\n       Mr. President, I urge you to take no action which limits or \n     degrades our Armed Force's\n\n[[Page S11084]]\n\n     ability to properly and thoroughly prepare for the challenges \n     they face in today's world.\n       The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton, \n     who testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee last \n     week, confirmed the continuing requirement for live fire \n     training operations at Vieques.\n       Due to the moratorium on training on Vieques, the next \n     carrier battlegroup is deploying with reduced combat \n     readiness in its airwing and naval surface fire support \n     capability. I encourage you to now signal your support for \n     all the men and women of our Armed Forces by allowing the \n     critical live fire training at Vieques to continue.\n       With kind regards, I am,\n           Respectfully,\n                                                      John Warner,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Comander in Chief,\n\n\n                                        U.S. Atlantic Command,\n\n                                                  August 27, 1999.\n     Hon. William S. Cohen,\n     Secretary of Defense, 1000 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary, I can appreciate the difficulty of \n     adjudicating the competing desires of groups for the use of \n     Vieques Island. It is important to me to be clear . . . \n     Vieques training area is not just nice to have . . . it is \n     part of the complex training regime that allows us to send \n     our men and women into harms way with a clear conscience. As \n     I mentioned to you in my July Quarterly Issues and Activities \n     Report, the moratorium on this live fire training will have \n     an impact on the readiness of military forces assigned to \n     U.S. Atlantic Command and on the quality of the joint forces \n     that I provide worldwide to the other CINCs.\n       Continued access to the Vieques training area, because of \n     its geographic location and access to base support, provides \n     us with a unique ability to conduct year-round integrated \n     live fire training. The island is one of the few locations in \n     the world where carrier battle groups can conduct high volume \n     ordinance training, from ``magazine to target.'' It is the \n     only East Coast facility that offers a live fire land target \n     complex with unencumbered access to airspace and deep-water \n     sea space. Shifting portions of this training to other \n     locations would degrade the quality of training while \n     increasing the OPTEMPO for our East Coast forces.\n       I firmly believe that we have a critical need for this live \n     fire and combined arms training to fulfill my responsibility \n     of providing trained and ready joint forces worldwide. Part \n     of the equation in this complex case must be, I believe, a \n     requirement to identify a suitable alternative before we \n     restrict this realistic training in any way.\n       I support the effort to retain the Vieques training area \n     and to continue this mission essential training. Combined and \n     integrated live fire training on the island is a valid joint \n     warfighting requirement. I am willing to assist in any way \n     necessary to resolve this readiness issue.\n           Very respecfully,\n                                                 H.W. Gehman, Jr.,\n     Admiral, U.S. Navy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Central Command,\n\n\n                             Office of the Commander in Chief,\n\n                                       Macdill Air Force Base, FL.\n     Gen. Henry H. Shelton, USA,\n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 9999 Defense Pentagon, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear General Shelton: As the issue of the Vieques Island \n     Training Range continues to be debated, I wanted to offer the \n     CENTCOM perspective. Live fire training at the Vieques \n     Training Range is vital to the readiness of naval forces \n     assigned to U.S. Central Command. As you know, the Vieques \n     training range is the only Atlantic Fleet live-fire range \n     where land, sea, and air forces can practice combat \n     operations. Although the range closure potentially affects \n     several warfighting areas, the most serious and immediate \n     degradation would occur in our ability to conduct precision \n     air to ground strike.\n       If the Vieques Training Range does not re-open soon, we can \n     anticipate less effective air to ground weapons delivery \n     accuracy in the early stages of our newly deploying battle \n     groups. Vieques is the only U.S. range that can support the \n     kind of high altitude TACCAIR ordnance delivery that we \n     regularly employ in Operation Southern Watch. It is the only \n     Atlantic Fleet range with airspace and facilities that can \n     support full air to ground and Naval Surface Fire Support \n     (NSFS) training from planning, to execution, to debrief. This \n     training is an absolute necessity to prepare our ships, \n     aircraft, and aircrews for ongoing operations (Southern \n     Watch), short-notice contingencies or MTW operations.\n       Although we have not recently seen the use of naval gunfire \n     in surface engagements or in support of forces ashore, it is \n     a capability our ships do and should routinely exercise. \n     NAVCENT will experience the first effects of not having this \n     training when U.S.S. John Hancock in-chops on 18 October. The \n     degradation of this ship is not significant in terms of \n     present operations and can be partly mitigated by other \n     means, however this shortcoming will continue to grow and \n     will degrade our standard of readiness for combat operations.\n       It is imperative that Atlantic Fleet ships and Navy and \n     Marine Corps aircraft have access to realistic training \n     ranges in support of their NSFS and air to ground \n     qualifications. Forces deployed to the CENTCOM AOR have faced \n     the very real potential for combat operations everyday. These \n     forces must be prepared to fight and win upon arrival in \n     theater. The Commander, Marine Corps Forces, Atlantic, and \n     Commander, Second Fleet have always provided me, and other \n     Unified Commanders, with battle ready forces essential to the \n     successful execution of our mission. Short of development of \n     a fully functional alternative range or training process, we \n     must reopen Vieques and allow our forces to receive this \n     critical training prior to facing real world operations and \n     contingencies in our theater.\n           Respecfully,\n                                                       A.C. Zinni,\n     General, U.S. Marine Corps.\n                                  ____\n\n     Gen. Henry H. Shelton,\n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Pentagon, Washington, \n         DC.\n                                                  August 23, 1999.\n       Dear General Shelton, I have followed with interest and \n     concern recent events in Vieques and Puerto Rico and their \n     potential impacts on Southern Command and fleet readiness. \n     This controversy has come at a crucial time for SOUTHCOM as \n     our components depart Panama and activate their new \n     Headquarters on Puerto Rico. Fortunately, up to this point \n     unit relocations and Vieques ranges have been treated as \n     separate issues on the island and by the press here in Miami \n     which has considerable influence in San Juan.\n       By virtue of past assignments, I am familiar with the \n     importance of Vieques to Fleet and Fleet Marine Force \n     readiness. Working through contacts on Puerto Rico, I have \n     tried to assist the Navy by creating increased awareness of \n     the unique and vitally important nature of the training that \n     is conducted on Vieques. While doing so, I have emphasized \n     the creative steps the Navy has taken or is considering to \n     ensure the health and safety of Vieques residents and to \n     promote the economic development of the island. \n     Unfortunately, I have yet to receive an encouraging response \n     from even our most consistent and energetic supporters. I \n     have also followed closely efforts to identify alternative \n     training sites to Vieques Island. Thus far, no suitable \n     alternative has surfaced.\n       Though Southern Command has a minimal stake in the training \n     that is conducted on Vieques, I am compelled to voice my \n     support for the Navy/Marine Corps cause. I have followed \n     closely efforts to identify alternative training sites to \n     Vieques Island. Due to a variety of hydrographic, geographic \n     and other considerations these efforts have not yet borne \n     fruit.\n       Whether the solution is Vieques or some other site in the \n     SOUTHCOM AOR, I am prepared to assist in any way that I can \n     as we strive to ensure that our forward-deployed forces \n     maintain their combat edge.\n           Very respectfully,\n\n                                                 C.E.

Henry H. Shelton.\n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Pentagon, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear General Shelton: Wanted to take this opportunity to \n     address an issue of importance to the readiness on naval \n     forces assigned to the European command--live fire training \n     at Vieques Island, Puerto Rico.\n       Concerned that with the current moratorium on training at \n     Vieques, the naval forces that will be assigned to EUCOM in \n     the future may not be fully combat ready to perform their \n     assigned missions. As you know, during the recent conflict in \n     the Balkans the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt battlegroup arrived \n     on station, and within hours of arrival was conducting \n     sustained combat operations. The level of precision and low \n     collateral damage achieved by naval forces during the Kosovo \n     conflict was possible primarily due to the realistic live \n     fire strike warfare training the carrier battlegroup \n     completed at Vieques just before their deployment.\n       Similarly, the 26th MEU assigned to the U.S.S. Kearsarge \n     Amphibiouis Ready Group also performed flawlessly during the \n     Kosovo conflict. Although Marines were not committed ashore \n     in an opposed battlefield environment, our Marines were fully \n     prepared to conduct force entry operations if the situation \n     would have required an amphibious capability under combat \n     conditions. Clearly, the coordinated and integrated \n     operational training that they received in a live fire \n     environment at Vieques was instrumental in preparing our \n     Marines for Kosovo and the combat conditions they encountered \n     as they entered Yugoslavia. Remain deeply appreciative of the \n     efforts of Commander, Second Fleet and Commander, Marine \n     Forces Atlantic to provide me, and the other Unified \n     Commanders with the most battle ready force possible, one \n     that is combat ready and can win on the sea, in the air, and \n     on the ground.\n       Firmly believe that there is an enduring need for live fire \n     training. We fight like we train, and a great measure of the \n     success our forces achieved in Kosovo can be directly \n     attributed to the realistic training environments in which \n     they prepared for combat. The live fire training that our \n     forces were exposed to at training ranges such as Vieques \n     helped ensure the forces assigned to this theater were \n     ``ready on arrival'' and prepared to fight, win, and survive. \n     To provide our Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, and Airmen with \n     less than this optimum training in the future would be \n     unconscionable, cause undue\n\n[[Page S11085]]\n\n     casualties, and place our nation's vital interests at risk.\n       Realistic training under live fire conditions is a \n     necessity to ensure our men and women are afforded every \n     possible advantage over their potential adversaries.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Wesley K. Clark,\n                                                     General, USA.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Has the Senator from Virginia concluded his comments?\n  Mr. WARNER. Correct.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I yield to the Senator from New Hampshire as much time as \nhe needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I rise today to talk about the recent clemency decision, \npardon decision by the President, relative to 16 Puerto Rican \nterrorists. This occurred on September 10.\n  There has been a lot of discussion in the newspapers and amongst \npeople generally as to the reasons for this, as to the background of \nwhy this occurred, and as to the political implications within the \nelection cycle as to what were the real causes. But that is not what I \nwant to talk about.\n  What I want to talk about is the effect of this action by the \nPresident on our domestic terrorism policy and our preparedness to deal \nwith domestic terrorism. The committee that I chair, the Commerce-\nState-Justice Committee, has spent a great deal of time trying to build \nan infrastructure to address the threat of terrorism.\n  Regrettably, we know as a nation that some time in the coming years \nwe will be subjected to another terrorist attack. That is the nature of \nthe times that we live in. Regrettably, it is even possible that such \nan attack may be a chemical or biological attack or an even more \nthreatening attack.\n  We have attempted over the last 3 years to develop a coherent, \nthoughtful strategy for how to get ready for, to anticipate, and to \nhopefully interdict an attack and, should an attack occur, to respond \nto such a terrorist event. We have set up a system of developing a \npolicy of addressing the issue of terrorism as a result of that.\n  The decision by the President to free these terrorists who were \njailed for terrorist activity has fundamentally undermined this effort \nat reforming and preparing for the terrorist threat in the United \nStates.\n  Stated simply, the question has to be: How can you claim you are \nbeing tough on terrorism if you free terrorists from your jails?\n  Today, we held a hearing in my committee, in the committee that I \nchair. We heard from the director at the FBI, Neil Gallagher, the \ndirector of the bureau dealing with terrorism. He is their expert on \nit. And we heard from Patrick Fitzgerald, the head of the terrorism \nbureau in the U.S. attorney's office in the city of New York. These two \nindividuals talked about the policy implications and the effect of the \ndecision by this President to free these terrorists.\n  I want to review a little bit of what the testimony was because it \nwas startling and it was serious, and it shows that the implications of \nthis decision by the President could have a very broad-reaching impact \non the lives of Americans.\n  First off, we discussed the issue of what type of terrorist act these \nfolks participated in relative to the decision for clemency. The \ndecision for clemency has been represented in the press by the White \nHouse public spokespersons as having been made because these people \nwere not actually involved in a violent act or, if they were involved \nin a violent act, they were not charged with participating in a violent \nact; therefore, they really were not that bad is essentially the \ndefense that the administration makes for giving clemency to these 16 \nterrorists.\n  First off, it should be pointed out the FBI agent recited that these \nindividuals participated in activities which led to the death of five \ndifferent individuals as a result of bombings and terrorist attacks, \nwhich also led to the injury of 83 individuals, many of them U.S. \nservice people who were directly attacked by the organization, the \nFALN, that also represented millions of dollars of property damage and \nspanned a period of approximately 10 years of violent action against \nthe United States, citizens of the United States, and military and \npolice personnel of the United States, leading to the death and the \nmaiming of American citizens by the actions which were participated in \nby these 16 individuals. Yes, they were charged and convicted, in most \ninstances, of something less than actually pulling the trigger--no \nquestion about that.\n\n  So I asked the U.S. attorney from New York, what was Sheik Abdul-\nRahman, who was the orchestrater of the World Trade Center bombing, \ncharged with? Was he present at the scene? Did he pull the trigger? Did \nhe light the fuse that blew up the World Trade Center?\n  Of course, the U.S. attorney said, no, he was not there. He is blind. \nHe was charged with seditious conspiracy--the same thing that the \nPuerto Rican terrorists from the FALN were charged with.\n  Then I asked him: What was Terry Nichols charged with, who was not at \nthe scene of the explosion in Oklahoma City where so many Americans \nwere killed but, rather, who aided the individual who undertook that \nspecific act? And he said he was charged with seditious conspiracy.\n  Then I asked, if we bring to trial Osama bin Laden--and an indictment \nhas been brought back against Osama bin Laden--who perpetrated the \nattacks on the American embassies in Kenya and Dar es Salaam--and that \nindictment is not for lighting the fuse or being at the scene of the \ncrime but for conspiracy to participate in the crime--all of these \nmajor terrorists who have caused huge harm to American citizens and to \nthe American institution of Government, to our free democratic form of \ngovernment were not on the scene of the crime any more than were the \nPuerto Rican terrorists, at least as they were charged and \nconvicted. Rather, they were all, with the exception of Bin Laden \nbecause he wasn't American, he wasn't on American soil. But the tenor \nof the charges being, they were all essentially charged with seditious \nconspiracy--all 16, I believe, FALN members, the sheik, Mr. Nichols, \nand Bin Laden.\n\n  So if the logic of the White House is--the logic of the President \nis--well, these aren't such bad people because they weren't convicted \nof actually killing the police officers, of actually maiming the police \nofficers, of actually undertaking the heist of the armored cars, of \nactually attacking the U.S. Navy personnel and killing them, of \nactually killing the individual, Mr. Connor, in Chicago, of actually \nmaiming the 83 other people who had been injured by these folks, \nbecause they weren't actually charged and convicted of that, and \ntherefore they should be given clemency because their charge is a \nlesser charge, then the White House and the President are going to have \nto explain why the White House, why the President, is not giving \nclemency to Sheik Abdul-Rahman, Terry Nichols, and why they are even \ngoing forward with the prosecution of Bin Laden.\n  The defense of the White House on that point simply does not stand. \nThese people participated in acts of terrorism, orchestrated acts of \nterrorism, and should not be let out early as a result of having not \nbeen convicted of actually being physically on the site of the \nterrorist event any more than we should let out Sheik Abdul-Rahman, \nTerry Nichols, or Bin Laden should we be successful in prosecuting and \nconvicting him.\n  That was the first point. But it flows into the second point, which \nis, What is the effect of these clemencies on our ability as a nation \nto defend ourselves against other terrorist acts?\n  The U.S. attorney from New York made a lot of excellent points. He \nsaid they are going to keep working hard, they are going to keep trying \nto prosecute, and they will aggressively prosecute to the fullest \nextent of their ability any terrorist they can charge and convict. And \nI congratulate them for that. But he also made the point, he said, you \nknow, their decision could be misconstrued in foreign capitals around \nthe world, and this decision for clemency could have an impact on how\n\n[[Page S11086]]\n\ntrials are undertaken of terrorists in our country.\n  So I followed that up. I asked Agent Gallagher: What impact will this \nhave on our ability to deal with foreign countries?\n  A great deal of our capacity to be successful in terrorism \ninterdiction requires that our FBI agents overseas--and we have been \nexpanding our FBI presence overseas, and our CIA and our State \nactivities overseas--have the confidence of the countries they are \ndealing with--the police officers in those states, the law enforcement \nagencies in those states--that when they are given information which \nmay lead to them having the capacity to act against a terrorist group \nby bringing them to trial and maybe extraditing them to the United \nStates, that foreign official or country has the confidence that our \nlegal system and our political system is going to handle this terrorist \naggressively and they aren't going to let that person out so that \nsomeday they may come back to that country and take retribution for \nhaving had that country assist us in capturing them.\n  This is a huge issue for our law enforcement agencies because without \nthat sort of confidence, they can't get the cooperation they need in \norder to get the intelligence they need in order to capture these \npeople before they act against us, against our country.\n  The U.S. attorney, supported essentially by Agent Gallagher of the \nFBI, said essentially many countries may misread this decision on \nclemency--a generous way to say it. What they were really saying was: \nYes, this has now created a problem for us; when our agents go overseas \nto try to interdict terrorists, we are going to have to deal with that \nforeign government, with that foreign official saying to us: Why should \nwe cooperate with you? Your President frees terrorists for political \nreasons. Why should we cooperate with you and put our political system \nat risk by maybe having that terrorist return to our streets as a \nresult of your President's clemency action?\n  Then the U.S. attorney made another point: In the trial of \nterrorists, I do expect that the defense attorneys will use this \ndecision on clemency in their defense of their clients, which is only \nreasonable. If you were a trial attorney and you were representing \nSheik Omar Abdul-Rahman, or you were representing Terry Nichols, or you \nwere about to try the Bin Laden case, you would say they were charged \nwith the same crime for which the President just released 16 people. So \nwhy should my client have to go to jail when the President just let 16 \nof these people out for the same crime, seditious conspiracy?\n  Although it may not be definitive, it will certainly have an impact \non the trial activity. And this point was made rather bluntly.\n  Another question that comes to mind is: When the decision was made to \nproceed with clemency, since these folks had not been convicted of \nactually pulling the trigger which killed the 5 individuals involved \nhere, or maimed the 83 others, or caused the robbery of the armored \ncar, or did the other millions of dollars' worth of damage to places \nsuch as the Fraunces Tavern that they blew up--I think there were 70 \ndifferent incidents of bombings--before these people were released, did \nthe White House have the courtesy to come to the FBI or any other law \nenforcement agency and say: Hey, we are going to give these folks \nclemency, but why don't you go talk to them and find out what really \nhappened and who really is responsible. And if there is anybody out \nthere on the street we should be picking up and arresting for the \nactual event, is there anybody we missed? Is there any intelligence we \ncould gain?\n\n  This is very typical. This is not an unusual situation. Before you \nrelease someone on parole, you expect that person to be cooperative. \nThere is usually a quid pro quo in a parole situation. Since clemency \nis a much broader event of freedom than parole, you don't answer to \nanyone in any instance of clemency. I am not sure what the rules were \nwhich were set down on this, but I suspect there is very little \noversight, considering how the White House handled these individuals. \nShouldn't they have at least afforded the FBI and the other law \nenforcement agencies the opportunity to talk to these individuals \nbefore they freed them, so the FBI would have the opportunity to find \nout the intelligence necessary to go after some of the other people who \nwere bad actors?\n  For example, there is a fellow named Morales--I think that is his \nname--who escaped from jail, who was part of their group and showed up \nat the rally, supposedly, in Puerto Rico to celebrate their return and \nin between went to Mexico and allegedly killed someone in Mexico. One \nwonders, if the FBI had been given an opportunity to try to track this \nfellow down through some information from these folks, whether that \nwouldn't have been helpful to the cause of law enforcement.\n  Much more information could also have been obtained by the FBI if \nthey had a chance to talk to these people maybe a little bit before the \nclemency occurred, which one would think is just good elementary law \nenforcement.\n  Although the FBI did not specifically answer this question because \nthey felt it was a matter of executive privilege, communications with \nthe White House specifically stated that they had not interviewed these \nfelons, these terrorists; since the time of their incarceration, the \nterrorists had not agreed to talk to them and they had therefore not \nbeen able to talk to them.\n  So one assumes that the opportunity was not afforded by this White \nHouse to talk to these people and try to find out a little bit more \nabout what was going on--a little information that might help save a \nfew American lives down the road when we get another terrorist from \nthis group, or their ancillary groups. In fact, it is discouraging.\n  Another point that Agent Gallagher made was that on September 13, 3 \ndays after clemency was ordered for these people, the FBI received a \ncommunication from another activist-independence group in Puerto Rico \nthat an individual, whose name I have forgotten, unfortunately, said \nessentially that they were going to turn to armed activity to make \ntheir point relative to the military base--I think earlier being \ndiscussed here--on an island off Puerto Rico unless they got their way.\n  So within 3 days of clemency, you actually have the threat of further \nterrorist action occurring by a sister or brother organization of the \nFALN. The threat was directed not only against the military but against \nthe FBI.\n  The President was able to buy 3 days of peace with this clemency \ndecision and at the same time turn 16 people loose who had participated \nin the most heinous crimes against American citizens.\n  I asked what the standard of pardon petitions was in making this \ndecision. Unfortunately, these folks do not specialize in this. They \nwouldn't know the answer to that question. But I want to read into the \nRecord that Presidential pardons are subject to a certain standard. \nThere is a set standard for them.\n  Under section 1-2.112 of the Standards for Considering Pardon \nPetitions, there is a sentence that says:\n\n       In the case of a prominent individual or a notorious crime, \n     the likely effect of the pardon on law enforcement interests \n     or upon the general public should be taken into account.\n\n  I asked these folks if they felt it was taking into account the \neffect on law enforcement interests to not advise law enforcement or \nnot give the law enforcement community the ability to interview these \nindividuals. Obviously, it wasn't. Obviously, that standard of pardon \nwas clearly not met--probably wasn't even considered. It didn't have \nanything to do with politics.\n  But the most devastating statement made this morning--and I know it \ntook courage to say this because there probably will be some reaction \nto it, but I think it was a very appropriate thing for Agent Gallagher \nto say because it is his job to protect us. And when he sees the \nAmerican people at risk, or when the FBI sees the American people at \nrisk, I think they have to speak up, even if it may affront the \nsensibilities of the President and the White House.\n  His summation of the present status of the FALN was: ``As of today, \nthey represent a threat to the United States.'' ``Today they represent \na threat to the United States.''\n  And more importantly, or equally important, the action of this \nPresident in granting pardons to these 16 terrorists has impacted our \npolicy on terrorism and fighting terrorism dramatically. It has \nliterally shredded that policy.\n\n[[Page S11087]]\n\n  We find ourselves now with a terrorism policy which has two \nstandards: Once you are convicted of seditious conspiracy, which is the \nkey offense in terrorism, you may be freed if you have political \nfriends; you will stay in jail if you don't have political friends. If \nyou are a terrorist, go out and find some political friends. It means \nforeign countries will no longer have the confidence to deal with our \nlaw enforcement agencies in releasing information or even physically \nreleasing terrorists to our control for prosecution because they will \nbelieve that person could potentially be returned to their shores.\n  It means trials of terrorists will now be tainted--when the charge of \nseditious conspiracy is included--by a clemency for 16 people who \ncommitted violent acts against the United States and were charged with \nseditious conspiracy.\n  It has undermined the morale of those who work on our front lines to \nprotect us from terrorism. And all for what purpose? I see none that \ncan justify this action. I think we should condemn it. I hope we, as a \nnation, do not have to pay a dear price because of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11087-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11087-S11088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      APPROPRIATIONS AND OVERSIGHT\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for \nsharing the results of the hearing he had this morning. It is one of \nthe real serious issues before the Senate, as is the case with the \nSenator from Oklahoma when he talks about the military problems in \nPuerto Rico. We have a lot of things with which to deal.\n  Most importantly, of course, is finishing our appropriations work. \nThe end of the fiscal year occurs within 2 weeks. We will have at that \ntime all the appropriations bills to the President. We intend to do \nthat. It is difficult, of course, to go through the appropriations \nprocess and stay within those boundaries we have given ourselves, to \nstay within the boundaries of the caps, to stay within the boundaries \nof available funds and, maybe most important, to stay within spending \nlimits without reaching into Social Security funds, which I think \neveryone is committed not to do.\n  There is a great difference of philosophy about how we do this. It \nseems to me we need to continue to think. There are those who \nlegitimately want to see more government, more Federal Government, more \ninvolvement, more programs, and others who believe there ought to be a \nlimited Federal Government--that, indeed, the role of the Federal \nGovernment is limited.\n  I had the opportunity yesterday to celebrate with four junior highs \nin my hometown of Casper, WY, the 212th anniversary of the signing of \nthe Constitution. These were 9th graders. It was great fun. Some of \nthem had on Uncle Sam suits in red, white, and blue. They all signed \ntheir own copy of the Constitution. One of the issues talked about by \nthese 9th graders was the 10th amendment. The 10th amendment says the \nFederal Government's duties are spelled out in the Constitution. If \nthey are not, they are left to the States or the people. It was \ninteresting to talk about that. These young people who read that say: \nWhat are some of the things that our Government is doing? Of course, \nthere is a legitimate debate about that.\n  Each year, as we come into the appropriations process, it seems to me \nwe miss an opportunity to have evaluated where we want to go, what we \nlegitimately want to do, and then fund it. Unfortunately, we get into \nthe funding proposition before we have decided what it is we want to \ndo; maybe more importantly, before we have had the opportunity to \nmeasure the effectiveness of what is in place.\n  That is one of the reasons many Members are seeking to have a \nbiennial budget--so that the appropriations process only takes place \nevery other year. In that case, agencies have a longer time to know \nwhat their budget is.\n  The key is that the Congress has oversight responsibility. Indeed, it \nshould be looking at the expenditures; it should be looking at programs \nand setting priorities; it should be decided how effective they are and \nwhat the expenditures have been.\n  We had a little example this morning. About a year ago, three Members \nasked the GAO to do an examination of the cost of Presidential travel. \nThey came in with their primary report yesterday. Even though there are \na great many trips to be made, this President has made more trips than \nany other President in recent history. We asked that three trips be \nexamined--a trip to Chile, a trip to China, and a trip to Africa--to \nsee what it cost taxpayers.\n  The trip to Chile. Chile is not too far. There were a couple of \nstops. It cost $10.5 million; 592 people traveled with the President, \n109 from the White House. That was the least expensive trip.\n\n  The trip to China last year was almost $19 million; 510 people \ntraveled, 123 from the White House.\n  These are the type of things at which we need to look. I think it is \nperfectly legitimate for the President to travel. Is it legitimate to \nhave these costs?\n  Africa. There was contact with six countries. It cost nearly $43 \nmillion to visit Africa. Mr. President, 1,300 people traveled with the \nPresident, 205 from the White House.\n  These are the kind of expenses we should evaluate. These are the \nthings at which we ought to look. These are the areas we ought to say: \nYes, there ought to be trips, but $43 million for a trip to Africa is a \nbit expensive and a little extensive.\n  That is what the oversight is all about. I think we need to be sure \nwe evaluate those things. We need to see if programs now in place, \nprograms that are now being funded, are still as necessary as they were \nwhen they began, or do they need to be changed. There is a constituency \nthat builds up around programs. Any change is resisted. That is not how \nto run any other business. We have to take a look to see if it is still \neffective, see what the mission is, see if that mission is being \ncarried out, see if the dollars could be spent more efficiently \nsomewhere else. That is what the budget process is about.\n  Now we are faced with having put together a budget some time back, \nabout 3 or 4 years ago, and finding ourselves being pushed hard to \nbreak through the budget caps put in place at that time, largely \nthrough emergency spending. It is legitimate when we have emergencies \nsuch as we have had this year with weather.\n  We are committed not to go into Social Security money. The President \nhas been saying for 4 years: Save Social Security. But he doesn't have \na plan. We have a plan to save Social Security. We are going to do our \nwork towards implementing that plan so the dollars that come in have a \nplace to go so they, indeed, are kept for Social Security.\n  I think the key is the idea of individual accounts, which is what we \npropose to do. People under a certain age would have an individual \naccount crediting a portion of the money they paid into Social \nSecurity. It would be their account, their money, invested in the \nprivate sector to return a much higher yield, to ensure that benefits \nare available. In that way, the money would not be spent for other \nthings, as has been in the past.\n  It also deals with the fact that such changes have taken place. I \nmentioned we have to look at programs from time to time. When Social \nSecurity began, I think there were 150 people working for every \nbeneficiary. It came down to 30. Now there are about three workers for \nevery beneficiary and headed towards two. The choices in that program \nhave become simple: We have to raise taxes, and most people don't want \nto do that; reduce benefits, and most people don't want to do that; or \nwe can increase the return on revenue, increase the return on the money \nthat is in the account--in this case, your individual account.\n  These are the kinds of things that seem to me to be part of the \nappropriations process, part of the budgeting process. That is what we \nare facing. It will be difficult to complete that task, but we are \ndedicated to doing it.\n  As I indicated, there is a legitimate difference of philosophy. I \nunderstand that. We see some of it every day. There are those who \nbelieve more spending, more government is better. There are those who \nbelieve in the 10th amendment, that more government ought to be closer \nto the people; that States and communities, and in the case of schools, \nschool districts, have\n\n[[Page S11088]]\n\nthe best opportunity to make the decisions that affect their children. \nI believe in that strongly. I think most on this side of the aisle do.\n  There was a long discussion about education today. Education is \nimportant to all Members. I think also there was an interesting set of \npolling done which indicated that for the most part, people do want to \nmake the decisions at the local level, to make the decisions where the \nkids are, to make the decisions where the families are.\n\n  There is quite a difference between what needs to be done in \nJugwater, WY, or Philadelphia. So the one-size-fits-all kind of program \ndoes not fit. We want to have the flexibility to make the changes that \nare necessary to do that.\n  Unfortunately, our bills will go to the President. The President has, \nof course, vowed to veto the tax relief bill that we have sent. I do \nnot believe there will be much opportunity to negotiate the basis for \nthat. That is too bad. As we project, there will be excesses. We think \nthey ought to go back to the taxpayers. In fact, the President wants to \nspend more money, indeed, increase some taxes--for instance, 55 cents \non cigarettes that would be there to offset more spending.\n  So these are the kinds of things with which we must deal. We must do \nthat soon. I believe we are headed in the right direction to have the \nbudget that does reflect our needs, that does deal with patients' \nhealth care. We passed a bill. We will do that and we will move forward \nand complete our work by the end of September.\n  Mr. President, I think we have taken nearly all of our time. I yield \nthe remainder of our time and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11088-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11088-S11094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time between now and 5:30 is equally \ndivided between the Senator from Utah and the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this bill is a bipartisan bill, drafted \njointly by Senators Grassley and Torricelli. This legislation has been \ndeveloped in a fair and inclusive manner.\n  The reforms proposed in this bill have been carefully studied and \nhave been deliberated upon at length. Indeed, Congress has been engaged \nin the consideration of this issue now for several years. The National \nBankruptcy Review Commission spent two years comprehensively examining \nthe bankruptcy system. The findings and opinions of the Commission, \nwhich were reported to Congress, have proved helpful in identifying the \nproblems in the bankruptcy system and in finding appropriate solutions.\n  Furthermore, the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \nCourts, which is chaired by Senator Grassley, has held numerous \nhearings on the issue of bankruptcy reform. The subcommittee heard \nextensive testimony on the subject from dozens of witnesses. Again, I \nwould like to thank Senators Grassley and Torricelli for their \nleadership in this important consumer bankruptcy reform, and also last \nsession's ranking member of the Administrative Oversight and the Courts \nSubcommittee, Senator Durbin, along with other members of the Senate, \nfor their hard work on this issue.\n  Throughout the process of consideration of this bill, at both the \nsubcommittee and full committee level, changes suggested by the \nminority were included in the bill. During this entire process, I have \nexpressed my willingness to work to address any remaining concerns the \nminority has about the bill. It is apparent, however, that efforts are \nunderway to defeat this important legislation by attaching irrelevant, \nextraneous ``political agenda'' items to it, such as minimum wage, \nguns, abortion and tobacco, to name a few.\n  I am open to full debate on relevant issues. Nevertheless, some of my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle continue to tie up consideration \nof this bill for what appears to be political points.\n  Despite the efforts of those in opposition, I remain hopeful and \noptimistic that we will be able to pass legislation this year that \nprovides meaningful and much-needed reform to the bankruptcy system.\n  The House of Representatives passed a much more stringent bankruptcy \nreform bill by an overwhelming bipartisan majority earlier this spring. \nThe time has come for us to rise above politics and to do what is right \nfor the American people. It is time for meaningful and fair bankruptcy \nreform.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture so we may consider the \nsubstance of this important legislation and make our bankruptcy system \nbetter for all Americans.\n  The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999 closes many of the loopholes in our \nbankruptcy system that allow unscrupulous individuals to use bankruptcy \nas a financial planning tool rather than as a last resort.\n  Despite the White House's statement of opposition to the House's \nbankruptcy reform bill, H.R. 833, the House of Representatives realized \nthat the time has come to restore personal responsibility to our \nnation's bankruptcy system. House Democrats and Republicans alike \nrecognized that if we do not take the opportunity to reform our broken \nsystem, every family in my own State of Utah and throughout the \ncountry, many of whom struggle to make ends meet, will continue to bear \nthe financial burden of those who take advantage of the system. As a \nresult, the House bill passed by an overwhelming margin of 313 to 108. \nHalf of the House Democratic Caucus joined with every House Republican \nto support the bill. And notably, the House bankruptcy reform bill is \nmore stringent in its reforms than the Senate bill before us today.\n\n  More than three decades ago, the late Albert Gore, Sr., then a \nSenator, commented on the moral consequences of a lax bankruptcy \nsystem. He said:\n\n       I realize that we cannot legislate morals, but we, as \n     responsible legislators, must bear the responsibility of \n     writing laws which discourage immorality and encourage \n     morality; which encourage honesty and discourage deadbeating; \n     which make the path of the social malingerer and shirker \n     sufficiently unpleasant to persuade him at least to \n     investigate the way of the honest man. (Cong. Rec. 905, \n     January 19, 1965.)\n\n  I too believe that the complete forgiveness of debt should be \nreserved for those who truly cannot repay their debts. S. 625 provides \nus with the opportunity to prevent people who can repay their debts \nfrom ``gaming the system'' by using loopholes that are presently in \nplace.\n  Mr. President, S. 625 provides a needs-based means test approach to \nbankruptcy, under which debtors who can repay some of their debts are \nrequired to do so. It contains new measures to protect against fraud in \nbankruptcy, such as a requirement that debtors supply income tax \nreturns and pay stubs, audits of bankruptcy cases, and limits on repeat \nbankruptcy filings. It eliminates a number of loopholes, such as the \none that allows debtors to transfer their interest in real property to \nothers who then file for bankruptcy relief and invoke the automatic \nstay. And, the bill puts some controls on the ability of debtors to get \nlarge cash advances on their credit cards and to buy luxury goods on \nthe eve of filing for bankruptcy.\n  At the same time, the Senate bill provides many unprecedented new \nconsumer protections. It imposes penalties upon creditors who refuse to \nnegotiate in good faith with debtors prior to declaring bankruptcy. \nAlso, it imposes penalties on creditors who willfully fail to properly \ncredit payments made by the debtor in a chapter 13 plan, and for \ncreditors who threaten to file motions in order to coerce a \nreaffirmation without justification. Moreover, the bill imposes new \nmeasures to discourage abusive reaffirmation practices.\n  Mr. President, S. 625 addresses the problem of bankruptcy mills, \nfirms that aggressively promote bankruptcy as a financial planning \ntool, and often end up hurting unwitting debtors by putting them in \nbankruptcy when it may not be in their best interest. The bill also \nimposes penalties on bankruptcy petition preparers who mislead debtors.\n  Importantly, the bill makes major strides in trying to break the \ncycle of indebtedness. It educates debtors with\n\n[[Page S11089]]\n\nregard to the alternatives available to them, sets up a financial \nmanagement education pilot program for debtors, and requires credit \ncounseling for debtors. I must commend Senator Sessions for his \nleadership on these important credit counseling provisions.\n  I am proud that the bill also makes extensive reform to the \nbankruptcy laws in order to protect our children. I have authored \nprovisions of the bill to ensure that bankruptcy cannot be used by \ndeadbeat dads to avoid paying child support and alimony obligation. \nUnder my provisions, the obligation to pay child support and alimony is \nmoved to a first priority status, as opposed to its current place at \nseventh in line, behind attorneys fees and other special interests. My \nmeasures also ensure the collection of child support and alimony \npayments by, among other things, exempting state child support \ncollection authorities from the ``automatic stay'' that otherwise \nprevents collection of debts after a debtor files for bankruptcy, and \nby exempting from discharge virtually all obligations one ex-spouse \nowes another. A new amendment will make changes to a number of \nprovisions in the bill to clarify that the provisions are not intended, \ndirectly or indirectly, to undermine the collection of child-support or \nalimony payments.\n  The bill includes a provision that I offered, which was accepted in \nthe Judiciary Committee, which creates new legal protections for a \nlarge class of retirement savings in bankruptcy, a measure which is \nsupported by groups ranging from the AARP, to the Small Business \nCouncil of America and the National Council on Teacher Retirement.\n  Rampant bankruptcy filings are a big problem. In 1998, 1.4 million \nAmericans filed for bankruptcy. That was more Americans than graduated \nfrom college, were on active military duty, or worked in the post \noffice. Indeed, more people filed for bankruptcy in 1998 than lived in \nthe states of Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Montana, New \nHampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, or \nWyoming.\n  Last year, about $45 billion in consumer debt was erased in personal \nbankruptcies. Let me give this number some context. Forty-five billion \ndollars is enough to fund the entire U.S. Department of Transportation \nfor a year. Losses of this magnitude are passed on the American \nfamilies at an estimated cost--if we use low estimates--of $400 to \nevery household in America every year. That $400 could buy every \nAmerican family of four: five weeks worth of groceries, 20 tanks of \nunleaded gasoline, 10 pairs of shoes for the average grade-school \nchild,  or more than a year's supply of disposable diapers.\n\n  Under current law, families who do not file for bankruptcy are \nunfairly having to subsidize those who do. Currently, our bankruptcy \nsystem is devoid of personal responsibility and is spiraling out of \ncontrol. This is our opportunity to do something about it.\n  As noted scholars Todd Zewicky of George Mason Law School and James \nWhite of the University of Michigan Law School recently wrote:\n\n       Current law requires a case-by-case investigation that \n     turns on little more than the personal predilections of the \n     judge. This chaotic system mocks the rule of law, and has \n     resulted in unfairness and inequality for debtors and \n     creditors alike. The arbitrary nature of the process has also \n     undermined public confidence in the fairness and efficiency \n     of the consumer bankruptcy system.\n\n  I am proud to be proposing several enhancements to the bill that \nprimarily are designed to protect consumers and further provide \nincentives for consumers to take personal responsibility in dealing \nwith debt management.\n  In the area of domestic support, as I indicated earlier, Senator \nTorricelli and I intend to build upon the new legal protections we \ncreated, as part of the underlying bill, for ex-spouses and children \nwho are owed child support and alimony payments. The changes will \nfurther strengthen the ability of ex-spouses and children to collect \nthe payments they are owed, and will make changes to a number of \nexisting provisions in the bill to clarify that they will not directly \nor indirectly undermine the collection of child support or alimony \npayments.\n  In the area of education, Senator Dodd and I, along with Senator \nGregg, have developed an amendment that will protect from creditors \ncontributions made for education expenses to education IRAs and \nqualified state tuition savings programs. This is a significant \nprotection for those who honestly put money away for the benefit of \ntheir children and grandchildren's educational expenses. The potential \nthat education savings accounts will be abused in bankruptcy is \naddressed by the amendment's requirement that only contributions made \nmore than a year prior to bankruptcy are protected. I believe that \nprotecting educational savings accounts is particularly important \nbecause college savings accounts encourage families to save for \ncollege, thereby increasing access to higher education. Nationwide, \nthere are more than a million educational savings accounts, meaning \nthere are more than a million children who would benefit from this \namendment. As much as I believe that the bankruptcy laws need to be \nreformed to prevent abuse and to ensure debtors take personal \nresponsibility, the ability to use dedicated funds to pay the \neducational costs of children should not be jeopardized by the \nbankruptcy of their parents or grandparents.\n  I have also developed a debt counseling incentive provision, which \nbuilds on the credit counseling provisions currently in S. 625. It \nremoves any disincentive for debtors to use credit counseling services \nby prohibiting credit counseling services from reporting to credit \nreporting agencies that an individual has received debt management or \ncredit counseling, and establishes a penalty for credit counseling \nservices that do. Debt management education is vital to reducing the \nnumber of Americans who, because of poor financial planning skills, are \nforced to declare bankruptcy. Providing crediting counseling--\ninstruction regarding personal financial management--to current and \npotential filers will help curb bankruptcy filing.\n  In addition, I intend to offer an amendment that is designed to curb \nfraud in filing. This amendment puts in place new procedures and \nprovides new resources to enhance enforcement of bankruptcy fraud laws. \nIt will require No. 1 that bankruptcy courts develop procedures for \nreferring suspected fraud to the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office for \ninvestigation and prosecution and No. 2 that the Attorney General \ndesignate one assistant U.S. attorney and one FBI agent in each \njudicial district as having primary responsibility for investigating \nand prosecuting fraud in bankruptcy.\n  I also plan to offer an amendment that will allow a victim of a crime \nof violence or drug trafficking offense or another party in interest to \npetition the bankruptcy court to dismiss a petition voluntarily filed \nby a debtor who was convicted of the crime of violence or drug \ntrafficking offense. In order to protect women and children who may be \nowed payments by such a debtor, however, the amendment would still \nallow the bankruptcy petition to continue if the debtor can show that \nthe filing of the petition is necessary to ensure his ability to meet \ndomestic support obligations. Bankruptcy is not an entitlement--it is a \nprocess by which certain qualifying individuals with substantial debts \nmay cancel their debts and obtain a ``fresh start.'' Under this \namendment, violent criminals and drug traffickers--individuals who have \nchosen to engage in serious, criminal conduct--would be precluded from \navailing themselves of the benefits of bankruptcy protection.\n  Again, I thank Senator Grassley, the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \nCourts, for his leadership and dedication to this effort, and look \nforward to working with him and the subcommittee's ranking member, \nSenator Torricelli, in passing this legislation.\n  Let's look at a couple of other charts. This one is done by Penn, \nSchoen and Bergland Associates, Inc.: 83 percent of the American people \nfavor an income test in bankruptcy reform. Only 10 percent oppose it \nand 7 percent don't know. So we should have an income test in \nbankruptcy reform.\n  Americans agree that bankruptcy should be based on need. Ten percent \nbelieve an individual who files for bankruptcy should be able to wipe \nout all their debt regardless of their ability to repay that debt. Only \n10 percent of our society believe that, and I am surprised that many \npeople believe that. If somebody has the ability to pay a debt,\n\n[[Page S11090]]\n\nwhy should they stiff other people with their debts and why shouldn't \nthey have to live up to paying off their debts?\n  Four percent refused to answer this. But 87 percent believe an \nindividual who files for bankruptcy--all of this yellow--should be \nrequired to repay as much of their debt as they are able and then be \nallowed to wipe out the rest.\n  That makes sense. Otherwise, we have people who are using the \nbankruptcy laws as an estate planning device. We have people who every \n5 years file for bankruptcy after running up all kinds of bills and \nenjoying the life of Riley during those intervening years. What we want \nto do is have people realize there are some disincentives for doing \nthat and that they have to pay some of these bills themselves.\n  These particular charts show that the American people have their \nheads screwed on right, except for about 10 percent of them. If an \nindividual has the ability to repay some of the debt, they ought to be \nable to and they ought to want to, they ought to do what is right, and \n87 percent of the American people believe that is the case. Only 10 \npercent believe they should be able to wipe out any debts at any time \nby going into bankruptcy.\n  I hope we can get people to vote for cloture on this matter so we can \nproceed and so we will not have any further delay in passing what \nreally will be one of the most important bills in this particular \nsession of Congress.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nthat the time be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time will be charged to both sides. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will speak briefly in opposition to cutting off \ndebate on S. 625, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999. I say to my \ncolleagues, the entire concept of the bill is wrong. It addresses a \n``crisis'' that appears to be self-correcting. It rewards the predatory \nand reckless lending by banks and credit card companies which fed the \ncrisis in the first place, and it does nothing to actually prevent \nbankruptcy by promoting economic security for working families.\n  To support, if you will, my case on the floor, I will talk about a \ncouple of amendments I intended to offer to this bill which I think \nwill make a huge difference. Let me give a couple of examples.\n  One amendment will prevent claims in bankruptcy on high-cost credit \ntransactions in which the annual interest rate exceeds 100 percent, \nsuch as pay-day loans and car title pawns. Pay-day loans are intended \nto extend small amounts of credit, typically $100 to $500, for an \nextremely short period of time, usually 1 week or 2 weeks.\n  These loans are marketed as giving the borrower a little extra until \npay day, hence the term ``pay-day'' loan. The loans work like this:\n  The borrower writes a check for the loan amount plus a fee. The \nlender agrees to hold the check until an agreed-upon date and gives the \nborrower the cash. On the due date, the lender either cashes the check \nor allows the borrower to extend the loan by writing a new check for \nthe loan. In any case, the annual interest rate can get as high as 391 \npercent.\n  We ought to do something about that, Mr. President. I have an \namendment that will make a difference. I believe I would win if I \noffered this amendment to address this problem.\n  Another amendment I want to offer is about making sure banks offer \nlow-cost banking services to their customers. For about 12 million \nAmericans, having a checking account is a simple convenience which they \ncannot afford. Why? Because quite often there is a large minimum or you \nhave fees that are really too high, and therefore people cannot even \nhave these accounts. I want to make sure these banks are responsive to \nlow-income citizens as well.\n  Mr. President, I was on the floor last week for several hours talking \nabout the crisis in agriculture. I said that those of us from the farm \nStates want an opportunity to pass legislation that would change the \ncourse of policy and prevent our family farmers from being driven off \nthe land and prevent, really, what is right now the devastation of our \nrural communities.\n  The minority leader, Senator Daschle, has an amendment to get the \nloan rate up, to get prices up, which I support. I have an amendment--\nand Senator Dorgan will join me--which basically says we are going to--\nfor 18 months, until we pass some antitrust action--put a moratorium on \na lot of these mergers and acquisitions. We want to have some \ncompetition in the food industry.\n  I think I can get a lot of support from Republicans as well as \nDemocrats. I think there will be a lot of support on the floor of the \nSenate for these amendments that try to do something about changing \nfarm policy so our producers--whether they be in Minnesota, whether \nthey be in Idaho, whether they be in the Midwest, or whether they be in \nthe South--are able to make a living and support their families.\n  In all due respect--I hate to say this--bankruptcy is all too \nrelevant to what these family farmers are going through. I have an \namendment that says we ought to do some policy evaluation if we are \ngoing to be talking about bankruptcy and we are not going to do a darn \nthing to deal with the predatory policies of these credit companies, \nthat we are not going to do a darn thing about the ways in which they \nhook people in who have precious little consumer protection, that if we \nare going to talk about low-income citizens, I would like to see some \npolicy evaluation.\n  I would like to see us have some understanding about what is going on \nin welfare. Where are these mothers and children who are no longer on \nthe rolls? What are their wage levels? Is there affordable child care? \nDo these families have health care coverage or do they not have health \ncare coverage?\n  It is also the case that my colleague who sits right next to me, \nSenator Kennedy, has an amendment he wants to offer to raise the \nminimum wage. I find it interesting that what we have here is a piece \nof legislation that does nothing by way of providing consumer \nprotection, does nothing by way of challenging these credit card \ncompanies, and does absolutely nothing to prevent the bankruptcy in the \nfirst place.\n  We have the evidence that shows that very few people--maybe 3 \npercent--have abused the law. And because of that, we are passing a \ndraconian, harsh piece of legislation which imposes enormous \ndifficulties on the poorest families, on working-income families. Yet \nwhen some of us say we want to bring some amendments to the floor that \ndeal with exorbitant interest rates, to make sure that low-income \npeople have access to banking services, and to make sure we do \nsomething about the economic security for working families--and I \ninclude family farmers who are going bankrupt--we are told by the \nmajority leader we are going to be shut out from being able to offer \namendments, and therefore the majority leader files cloture.\n  We will have a cloture vote. I am going to vote against cloture; I am \nsure many of my colleagues are going to vote against cloture, and then \nI am sure the majority leader is going to pull the bill. If he pulls \nthe bill, that will be actually a plus for Americans. This is a deeply \nflawed piece of legislation--great for the credit companies, terrible \nfor consumers.\n  But if he pulls the bill, also that is basically a message to those \nof us who for weeks now have been saying we want to come to the floor \nwith substantive amendments, to fight for the people we represent, to \ndo something about making sure they have a decent chance--and I am \ntalking in particular about family farmers. Basically what I am hearing \nfrom the majority leader\n\n[[Page S11091]]\n\nis: Anytime you say you are going to come to the floor with these \namendments, I am going to pull the legislation. I am not going to give \nyou a vehicle. We are not going to have an up-or-down vote on minimum \nwage.\n  Apparently, a lot of my colleagues on the other side do not want to \nbe on record; we are not going to have an up-or-down vote on getting \nfarm prices up; we are not going to have an up-or-down vote on a \nmoratorium dealing with these mergers and acquisitions; We are not \ngoing to have an up-or-down vote on amendments that really do deal with \nthese payday loans, with these exorbitant interest rates, making sure \nagain that low-income people have access to banking services.\n  I think there will not be enough votes for cloture. I do not think \nthere should be enough votes for cloture. I want to say today on the \nfloor of the Senate, especially to the majority leader--not so much to \nmy colleague from Utah--if each and every time, as a Senator from an \nagricultural State, I am going to be shut out from having any vehicles \nwhereby I can bring some amendments to the floor to change farm policy \nso these producers do not go under in my State, then I am going to have \nto look for whatever leverage I have as a Senator to force some \ncooperation on the other side so we can have a genuine, substantive \ndebate about a lot of issues that are important to people's lives.\n\n  Let's talk about raising the minimum wage. Let's talk about what is \nhappening to family farmers. Let's talk about health care policy. Let's \ntalk about consumer protection.\n  This effort on the part of the majority leader--and I guess, \ntherefore, the majority party--to shut us out from introducing \nsubstantive legislation that would make all the difference in the world \nto the people we represent is just simply unacceptable. I do not think \nthis is any way for us to operate as a Senate. I urge my colleagues to \nvote against cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Iowa and appreciate his \nsteadfast leadership on this issue. I also thank the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, for his leadership.\n  We have worked over the past several years to produce a much needed \npiece of legislation, a reform of Federal bankruptcy law. Bankruptcy is \nprovided for in the U.S. Constitution, and we have seen some remarkable \nchanges in the last few years that demand that we reform the system.\n  Last year there were over 1.4 million bankruptcies filed in America. \nThat comes out to almost 4,000 filings every day of the year. Since \n1990, personal bankruptcies are up 94.7 percent. This dramatic increase \nin personal bankruptcies occurred in spite of the fact that over that \nsame period business bankruptcies fell 31 percent and the country \nenjoyed a healthy and expanding economy. These statistics demonstrate \nthere is need for reform immediately.\n  Bankruptcy exists to provide relief as a last resort for the most \ndebt-ridden individuals. It is not a financial planning device. This \nbill was needed last year, but it did not pass due to the same kinds of \npartisanship and political tactics we have seen here today.\n  This year, I think Congress will pass this bill. I hope we will \nproceed to it today for a final vote. The majority leader of the Senate \nand the Members of this Senate have a lot of work to do this year. We \nhave quite a number of critical appropriations bills, including the \nDefense appropriations that may come up later tonight. We have to \nconsider those bills.\n  We cannot have a bankruptcy bill like the one that passed this Senate \nlast year with 97 votes--a very similar bankruptcy bill which almost \nevery single Senator voted for. That bill turned into a Christmas tree \nof amendments on every kind of unrelated issue that any Senator wanted \nto bring up, and I am afraid that the same thing might happen today.\n  Why is this happening? I will tell you why. Some Senators do not want \nthis bill to pass, but they are afraid to vote against it straight up, \nand so they offer amendment after amendment, and they tell the majority \nleader: We won't have any limit. We want to offer as many amendments as \nwe can on a number of unrelated subjects--international affairs, \neconomics, whatever they want to bring. This means we could be here for \nweeks on a bill that has been debated for the last 2 years with great \nintensity. The Senate does not need that. The majority leader cannot \nallow that to happen. We will have to not proceed with it, I assume, if \nwe cannot get cloture today.\n  A bankruptcy bill similar to this passed the House earlier this year \n313-108. Senator Grassley's bill came out of the Judiciary Committee \n14-4. So I am proud to be a key sponsor of this. I think it makes the \nkind of changes we need without changing the fundamental principles \nthat if a person is over their head in debt, helplessly unable to pay \ntheir debts, they ought to be able to wipe out those debts and start \nover. We have no dispute with that principle. That is a fundamental, \nhistoric principle.\n  I know it makes a lot of people mad to think that somebody does not \nhave to pay their debts, that they can just go to court and wipe out \ntheir duly signed contract. But this country has always adhered to the \nview that if your debts reach a certain level and you cannot pay them, \nyou can start afresh.\n  We do not have debtors' prisons. And I certainly agree with that. But \nwe do have a growing trend in America in which people making $60,000, \n$80,000, $100,000 a year owe a significant--but not great--debt and \njust go into court and file straight bankruptcy under chapter 7. If \nthey make $100,000 a year and they owe $60,000 that they could easily \npay off in a period of years, they can go into bankruptcy court and \nwipe out their debt. These individuals can file under Chapter 7 and \njust not pay their debts--whether it is the guy next door, the garage \nmechanic, the automobile car dealer, the credit card bank note--that \ndebt can simply be wiped out. There is no way a court can stop this \nbehavior right now. It is not being stopped. And it is going on \nregularly.\n  What Senator Grassley's legislation does is say to the courts: You \nhave a duty to look at the debtor's income, to analyze what a person's \nincome is. If they are able, over a reasonable period of time, to pay \nback a significant portion of their debt, they ought to pay it back. \nWhy? Because it is a moral question. And the moral question is this: \nThe man making $100,000, who owes $60,000 in debt--$2,000 of that may \nbe to the mechanic who fixed his car--who ought to be paying that?\n  Who ought to get the money? The man who did the work for him and \nfixed his car or fixed the roof on his house? Should he be paid, or \nshould this man be able to live in his house bankrupt and not pay his \ndebt to the people who helped fix it for him? It is just that simple. \nIt is a question of justice and right and wrong.\n  One provision that I worked hard to put into this bill that I think \nis good and very innovative is a requirement that people at least \nconsider an approach to credit counseling before they actually file for \nbankruptcy. There are a number of excellent credit counseling agencies \nin America. They can sit down with people and negotiate with their \ncreditors and get them to reduce the interest rates. They can help \npeople make payment plans. They help the family put a budget together. \nIf somebody is addicted to gambling, these credit counseling agencies \ncan get them in Gamblers Anonymous. If they have mental health \nproblems, they can help with that. The agencies can help them decide \nwhich debts ought to be paid first, such as the ones with the highest \ninterest. They can negotiate on behalf of their clients delays in \ncertain debt so they can pay others first.\n  I visited for virtually a full day at a credit counseling agency in \nmy hometown of Mobile. I was extraordinarily impressed with what they \ndo and the services they offer. This bill would require that, before \nyou file for bankruptcy, you ought to at least talk to one of these \ncredit counseling agencies.\n  We have seen what is happening today before. Senator Grassley saw \nthis at just about this time last year. We had a bill that came up and \ncleared the committee by an overwhelmingly\n\n[[Page S11092]]\n\nbipartisan vote--a bill that we got through this body with an \noverwhelming vote. I believe 97 Senators voted for it. Yet when it came \nback up, we had just these kinds of dilatory tactics designed to delay \nand put the bill off to avoid a vote. I don't know why that is true.\n  There is nothing but fairness and justice and improvement in this \nbill. It is time for us to respond to this growing rush of people who \nare claiming bankruptcy, many of whom don't deserve or need the \nprotections of the judicial system to address their debts. We want \nbankruptcy to be available for those who truly need it but not for \nthose who view it as an easy way to wipe out debts that they could pay.\n  I think we have made some real progress with this bill. I hope \npolitics doesn't enter into the Senate's consideration of these \nreforms. If it does, I hope the American people will understand and \nlook through the political tactics and the manipulation to see right \nthrough this.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all, before the Senator from \nAlabama leaves, he needs to be thanked for the outstanding work he has \ndone to help put this compromise piece of legislation together that \ncame out of committee by a bipartisan vote of 14-4, and also during the \nremarks he just presented for laying out the history of this \nlegislation last year in which the bill passed 97-1. He very accurately \nstated what the situation is.\n  He also now raises the question, which is a legitimate question: What \nhas gotten rotten in Denmark, so that all of a sudden a bill that \npassed 97-1 about a year ago is being filibustered in the effort to \nbring it up, if some people aren't playing some sort of game?\n  I thank the Senator from Alabama for his work on this bill.\n  I also thank him for reminding the Senate of what that situation was \na year ago and raising the question of what has changed. Not much has \nchanged. It is just that some people want to use tactics behind the \nscenes to keep a bill from coming out in the open when they wouldn't \nexpress those same views in a vote on the floor of the Senate.\n  Also, there was a previous speaker on the other side, a friend of \nmine, who recently spoke against the cloture motion to bring debate on \nthis bill to a halt on the motion to proceed and then immediately get \nto the bill; he expressed a view that there ought to be opportunity to \noffer nongermane amendments on the issue of agriculture.\n  Normally, I am sympathetic to those opportunities to bring to the \nfloor of the Senate the complaints and concerns of an economic crisis \nsuch as we are facing in agriculture. But I think there are \nopportunities available to do that other than messing up an opportunity \nto bring needed reform to the bankruptcy code.\n  Besides, during my remarks today, I am going to point out to the \nSenator from Minnesota how there are opportunities in this very \nbankruptcy bill to help the family farmer. They relate directly to the \npermanent reauthorization of chapter 12 bankruptcy. If that is not \nauthorized in this bill--in fact, if this isn't done by the 1st of \nOctober--there is no chapter 12. Then, instead of using a chapter of \nthe bankruptcy code that is written to the special needs of \nagriculture, the farmers are going to have to file for bankruptcy under \nchapter 11. That was written for corporate America. That doesn't fit \nthe needs of agriculture. They are going to find, unlike chapter 12's \nexistence for reorganization of farmers where 88 percent of them are \nstill able to farm and maintain the family farming operation, that \nthere will be a very high percentage of farmers forced to file under \nchapter 11, the chapter friendly to corporate structure, and they are \nnot going to be farming anymore at all. They won't be farming as family \nfarmers, if they farm.\n  Mr. President, we are coming soon to a cloture vote on the bankruptcy \nbill. If cloture is not invoked, it will be very unfortunate. I've \nworked very closely with the minority and with Senator Torricelli, who \nis the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight \nand the courts, to fashion a bill which contains many changes and \nmodifications requested by Democrats. For instance, the means-test is \nlooser than I would personally prefer. But I have made this change to \nrespond to concerns raised by the other side of the aisle.\n  I think we're in this situation because we have Members from the \nminority party who want to offer an unlimited number of amendments on \nsubjects totally unrelated to bankruptcy. This, of course, is a delay \nand stalling tactic by imposing these nongermane amendments upon a very \nimportant bill, a bill that will pass this body by an overwhelming \nmargin, if we get it up for a vote, but a bill that can be stalled by \npeople who maybe don't want this bill to pass and don't want to face it \nhead on, because this bill passed by a 97-1 vote in the last Congress.\n\n  From my conversations with the Republican leadership, I think it's \nfair to say that we are willing to accommodate a few unrelated \namendments from the minority. But, it appears that some Members of the \nMinority want to turn the bankrupticy bill into a Christmas tree for \neverything you can think of. Obviously, that's not acceptable. So here \nwe are. At some point, I hope that this situation is resolved. We \nRepublicans stand ready to be reasonable.\n  I want to take this opportunity to talk about what is being delayed. \nThe bankruptcy bill contains some very important provisions that are \nvital for family farmers, especially Midwestern family farmers, and \nparticularly with this economic crisis even in my State of Iowa.\n  As we all know from recent debate on the emergency agriculture \nappropriations bill, which is in conference this very night to iron out \nthe differences between the House and Senate, many of America's farmers \nare facing financial ruin. We have some of the lowest commodity prices \nin 30 years. Pork producers have lost billions of dollars--not just in \nincome but in equity. The price of corn is currently well under the \ncost of production. And the cash market for soybeans has reached a 23-\nyear low. This is all in addition to the poor weather conditions in \nparts of the Midwest and the drought in the 10 States of the Eastern \nUnited States.\n  Just last week, I sent a letter with a number of farm State Senators \nfrom both parties, including the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, \nsigning it, to all Senators, discussing the needs for reauthorization \nof chapter 12, which is done in this all-encompassing bankruptcy reform \nlegislation.\n  As you can imagine, these difficult financial circumstances have sent \nmany farming operations into a tailspin. Clearly, we need to make sure \nthat the family farmers continue to have bankruptcy protection \navailable during this difficult period. But bankruptcy protection won't \nbe available if this bill is blocked by turning it into a Christmas \ntree.\n  I don't pretend to talk about bankruptcy being needed by the family \nfarmers as a substitute for anything that can be done here in the \nCongress or what can be done through the marketplace to bring \nprofitability because that is what is absolutely necessary. But under \nany circumstances, in good times or bad times, some farmers are going \nto need to have the protection of chapter 12, just as corporations in \nAmerica have the protection of chapter 11. And farmers are entitled to \na chapter that fits the needs of agriculture, the same way corporate \nAmerica is entitled to a chapter that fits the needs of corporate \nAmerica.\n  Title X of this bill makes chapter 12 permanent and makes several \nchanges to chapter 12 to make it more accessible for farmers and to \ngive farmers new tools to assist in reorganizing their financial \naffairs.\n  As things stand now, chapter 12 will cease to exist by September 30 \nunless we get this bill through the Senate, through conference, and on \nthe President's desk. It would be a supreme act of irresponsibility if \nwe let chapter 12 die and we leave our farmers without a last ditch \nprotection against foreclosure and forced auctions.\n  Make no mistake about it. By delaying this bill, Senators who vote \nagainst cloture will leave family farmers across America exposed to \nforced auctions and foreclosures. That is what I urge the Senator from \nMinnesota to be cognizant of as he votes against cloture, as he \nindicated he would do.\n  Back in the mid-1980s, when Iowa was in the midst of another \ndevastating\n\n[[Page S11093]]\n\nfarm crisis, I wrote chapter 12 to make sure family farmers would \nreceive a fair shake in dealing with the banks and the Federal \nGovernment as a lender of last resort. At that time I didn't know if \nchapter 12 was going to work or not, so it was only enacted on a \ntemporary basis. Chapter 12 has been an unmitigated success. As a \nresult of chapter 12, many farmers in Iowa and across the country are \nstill farming and contributing to the American economy. With a new \ncrisis in the farm country, we need to make chapter 12 a permanent part \nof Federal law. This bankruptcy bill provides for permanency for \nfarmers.\n  Chapter 12 worked in the mid-1980s and it should be made permanent so \nfamily farmers in trouble today or any time in the future can get \nbreathing room and a fresh start. This statement that chapter 12 works \nfor farmers is backed up by an Iowa State University study of farmers \nwho used chapter 12 during the 1980s. Mr. President, 88 percent of \nthose farmers were successfully farming at the time of the study.\n  The Bankruptcy Reform Act doesn't just make chapter 12 permanent; the \nbill makes improvements to chapter 12 so it will become more accessible \nand helpful for farmers. First, the definition of a family farmer is \nwidened so more farmers can qualify for chapter 12 bankruptcy \nprotections. Second, and perhaps more importantly, my bankruptcy bill \nreduces the priority of capital gains tax liabilities for farm assets \nsold as a part of a reorganization plan. This will have the beneficial \neffect of allowing cash-strapped farmers to sell livestock, grain, and \nother farm assets to generate cash-flow when liquidity is essential to \nmaintaining a farming operation. Together, all of these suggested \nreforms will make chapter 12 more effective in protecting America's \nfamily farms during this difficult period. These reforms will never \nhappen if the bill is continually blocked by Senators offering \nunrelated and nongermane amendments.\n  It is imperative we keep chapter 12 alive. Before we had chapter 12, \nbanks held a veto over reorganization plans. They wouldn't negotiate \nwith farmers and the farmer would be forced to auction off the farm, \neven if the farm had been in the family for generations. The fact is \nthat fire-type sales under these circumstances actually drive down \nprices at those auctions so both the creditor and the debtor end up \nwith less. Now, because of chapter 12, the banks are willing to come to \nterms.\n  We must pass this bankruptcy reform bill to make sure America's \nfamily farms have a fighting chance to reorganize their financial \naffairs. Unless things change, this bill may be set aside because of \nstalling tactics by some Members on the other side of the aisle.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter signed \nby five Members, including Senator Johnson of South Dakota, Senator \nBrownback of Kansas, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, and Senator Tom \nDaschle of South Dakota.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 13, 1999.\n\n           Support Bankruptcy Protections for Family Farmers\n\n       Dear Colleague: As the Senate returns to work for the final \n     months of the first session of the 106th Congress, we will \n     likely consider S. 625, ``the Bankruptcy Reform Act.'' We are \n     writing to ask your support for Title X of S. 625, which \n     contains vital protections for America's family farmers.\n       By now, we are sure that you are aware that the \n     agricultural sector of our economy is experiencing severe \n     distress. Due to grain, livestock, cotton, rice, and \n     commodity indexes plunging to record lows this summer, many \n     family farmers are in the midst of an economic crisis. \n     Farmers across the nation are suffering some of the lowest \n     farm commodity prices in 30 years. Pork producers have lost \n     billions of dollars in equity, the price of corn is currently \n     well under the cost of production and the cash market for \n     soybeans has reached a 23 year low. This is all in addition \n     to the poor weather conditions in parts of the Midwest.\n       In the midst of desperate times in farm country, we believe \n     that the important reforms contained the Title X of S. 625 \n     are essential. Title X makes Chapter 12 of the bankruptcy \n     code permanent. As it stands now, Chapter 12 will expire at \n     the end of this fiscal year. If that happens, millions of \n     family farms may face foreclosure and forced auctions. We \n     believe that Congress has an affirmative responsibility not \n     to leave financially troubled family farmers without the \n     protections of Chapter 12.\n       Title X also alters Chapter 12 to make it more accessible \n     and helpful for farmers. First, the definition of family \n     farmer is widened so that more farmers can qualify for \n     Chapter 12 bankruptcy protections. Second, Title X also \n     reduces the priority of capital gains tax liabilities for \n     farm assets sold as a part of a reorganization plan. This \n     will have the effect of allowing cash-strapped farmers to \n     sell livestock, grain and other farm assets to generate cash \n     flow when liquidity is essential to maintaining a farming \n     operation. Together, we believe that these reforms will make \n     Chapter 12 even more effective in protecting America's family \n     farms during this difficult period.\n       While floor debate may focus on other provisions of S. 625, \n     we ask that you support Title X.\n     Chuck Grassley.\n     Tim Johnson.\n     Sam Brownback.\n     Bob Kerrey.\n     Tom Daschle.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor and ask unanimous consent that a \nquorum call I suggest be equally charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will say a few words about the cloture \nvote we will have shortly on the bankruptcy bill, S. 625. I understand \nmany in this body want to pass bankruptcy legislation this year. \nCertainly, the credit card industry is eager for the Senate to act. I \nwant to be able to vote for what I consider a balanced bankruptcy bill.\n  Hardball tactics of this kind will not move this body closer to that \ngoal. By filing a cloture motion a few seconds after he brought up the \nbill, the majority leader is predetermining the outcome. Cloture, I am \nglad to say, will not be achieved this afternoon. Cloture should not be \nachieved until Senators have a chance to offer amendments to the bill.\n  Bankruptcy is, of course, a very complicated area of the law. We have \nnot had real bankruptcy reform and change since 1978. It has an impact \nupon millions of American consumers and businesses. Unfortunately, S. \n625 is a very one-sided piece of legislation. I have found an amazing \nvirtual unanimity among all the experts on bankruptcy. Whether talking \nto academics or judges or trustees and even practitioners--of course \nyou expect to hear this from debtors' attorneys but also from many \ncreditors' attorneys--they all say this bill as it stands today should \nnot pass.\n  The only way to make it work, the only way to improve it, is to amend \nit. However, many of the amendments we want to offer--and they are very \nmuch relevant to the bankruptcy issue--could not be offered if we \ninvoke cloture today.\n  So I am hopeful and believe Democrats will vote today against \ncloture, to protect their right to offer bankruptcy amendments to this \nbankruptcy bill.\n  Let me also take a moment to remind my colleagues that this body \npassed a bankruptcy reform bill last year by a vote of 97 to 1. I voted \nfor it. We had nearly a unanimous vote for a bill. That bill could have \nbecome law if the conference committee had not disregarded the wishes \nof the Senate. Let me just be clear, in response to the comments a few \nminutes ago of the Senator from Iowa, there is nothing fishy going on \nhere. It is not as if the same bill that passed 97 to 1 is before us. \nIt is very much the opposite. This is the hard nosed, one-sided \nlegislation that in my mind is the fantasy of the other body in this \ninstitution. It is not the bill I was comfortable voting for and was \npleased to vote for last year.\n  This bill is not the balanced approach that the Senate came up with \nlast year. So amendments, many amendments, frankly, are needed. The way \nto reduce the number of amendments is to accept some of them. Many of \nthe amendments I and my colleagues are going to offer on this bill are \nreasonable, moderate, and widely supported. They will make this a more \nfair and balanced piece of legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on cloture. And even more, I urge \nthe majority leader and the proponents of this\n\n[[Page S11094]]\n\nbill to simply face the honest policy disagreements that need to be \nresolved either through amendments or through negotiations. Strong-arm \ntactics like filing for cloture right off the bat on a bill of this \nmagnitude and complexity are not going to work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask consent to speak for 10 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11094-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE TRADE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today there was an announcement by the \nCommerce Department about this country's monthly trade deficit. This \nmonth our trade deficit in goods and services surged to a high of $25.2 \nbillion just for the month. If you are just worried about manufactured \ngoods, it's much higher than that; but for goods and services, the \ntrade deficit was $25.2 billion just this month. It is the 7th \nconsecutive month. We have a very serious trade deficit problem and \nnothing seems to be being done about it.\n  I want to show my colleagues a chart that describes what is happening \nwith both exports and imports in this country. Incidentally, this will \nbe met with a large yawn tomorrow in the newspapers. I assume the daily \npapers here in Washington, DC, will go to the same so-called experts \nfor comments about what is causing the trade deficit. They will give \nthe same comments they have given month after month, year after year. \nIn fact, in the old days they used to say that the reason we have a \ntrade deficit is because we have a fiscal policy deficit and as soon as \nwe get rid of the budget or fiscal policy deficit, we will not run a \ntrade deficit. Of course that is not the case. The trade deficit \ncontinues to grow at an alarming pace, even when the Federal budget \ndeficit is largely erased.\n  The question is whether this Congress and this administration will \ndecide that the current trade policy, which is drowning this country in \nred ink, will be changed and if so how it will be changed. I find it \ninteresting that we are now headed towards a World Trade Organization \nmeeting in Seattle, in late November and early December. During that \nfirst week of December, our trade officials will go to Seattle and talk \nwith representatives from other countries around the world, talking \nabout our trade policies. If ever there was a need for this country to \ndecide its current trade strategy is unworkable, it is now, at this \nmoment.\n  I thought it would be interesting to talk a little bit about what our \ntrade officials have been doing while this huge trade deficit continues \nto explode. Recently, this country got angry with the European Union \nfor, among other things, the European Union's refusal to lower barriers \nto the import of bananas into Europe. We do not produce bananas, but \nlarge American companies produce bananas in the Caribbean. They wanted \nto ship these bananas into Europe, but Europe didn't want their \nbananas.\n  This got us upset, so this country is taking tough action against \nEurope. We said, Europe, if you don't shape up this is what we are \ngoing to do. We are going to impose 100 percent tariffs on your \nproducts and selected the products we want to impose 100 percent \ntariffs on.\n  We went through a similar dispute with the European Union over \nimports of beef with growth hormones. And we imposed 100 percent \ntariffs on selected products. Let me show you what they are, among \nothers: Roquefort cheese. That is getting tough, imposing a 100 percent \ntariff on Roquefort cheese. Goose livers--that's going to scare the \ndevil out of the Europeans, a 100 percent tariff on goose livers. How \nabout chilled truffles? That is getting tough. And animal bladders.\n  So this country cranks up all its energy because we can't get bananas \nwe don't produce into Europe. In our dispute over beef hormones, we \ndecide that we are going to clamp down on goose livers, truffles, and \nanimal bladders. That is a trade strategy? I don't think so. If down at \nTrade Ambassador's office, down at Commerce or elsewhere, you want to \ndo something to help this country's trade balance, then get serious \nabout it. Do something to stand up for this country's producers. Force \nopen foreign markets and demand--literally demand--other countries to \nstop the dumping of products into our marketplace below their \nacquisition cost, injuring our producers.\n\n  I have talked for a moment about goose livers, truffles, Roquefort \ncheese and animal bladders. Let me talk about something that is a bit \ndifferent--durum wheat that is being hauled into this country from \nCanada in record supply. In North Dakota we produce 80 percent of all \nthe durum produced in America. Durum, by the way, is ground into \nsemolina flour and then turned into pasta. If you eat pasta, you are \nlikely eating something that came from a field in North Dakota. Guess \nwhat is happening? Our farmers are losing money hand over fist, and at \nthe same time Canadian farmers are dumping massive quantities of durum \nwheat into our marketplace, undercutting our farmers and injuring them \nbadly.\n  What are we doing about it? Nothing. We don't lift a finger. We are \nwilling to go to war over truffles and goose livers. We are willing to \ntake tough action against the Europeans with Roquefort cheese. Do you \nthink anybody will go to the northern border and decide to stop unfair \ntrade coming into this country, injuring our family farmers? No. Not \nwith this trade strategy.\n  This Congress and this administration need to understand that this is \na very serious problem. Today's announcement of a $25.2 billion trade \ndeficit for the month of July suggests again that we must take \nadditional action. As we head towards the December meeting of the World \nTrade Organization, and as we see this morning's announcement about the \ntrade deficit, I hope meetings here in the Congress, and with the \nadministration, will allow us to develop a trade strategy that better \nrepresents this country's economic interests, stands up for this \ncountry's producers, and demands open foreign markets.\n  Mr. President, I know the Senator from Vermont wants to speak on the \nbill that is going to be pending so at this point let me yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11094-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11094-S11096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

So the Senator from North Dakota effectively used my time? \nIs that what the Presiding Officer is saying?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand.\n\n[[Page S11095]]\n\n  Mr. President, I was on the floor last week when the majority leader \nbrought up S. 625, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999, but then he \nimmediately filed for cloture on the bill. I was rather surprised by \nthe action, since, on behalf of the Democratic leader, I did not object \nto proceeding to the bankruptcy bill. Indeed, my side of the aisle was \nready for a reasonable and fair debate on passing bankruptcy reform \nlegislation. But when you file for cloture within seconds of bringing \nthe bankruptcy reform bill up for debate on the Senate floor, that is \nnot reasonable or fair. A cloture motion is for the express purpose to \nbring to a close debate but this was saying we will bring to close the \ndebate before we even have the debate. It is as if we were in Alice in \nWonderland. Cloture first, then debate.\n  Mr. President, every American agrees with the basic principle that \ndebts should be repaid. The vast majority of Americans are able to meet \ntheir obligations. But, for those who fall on financial hard times, \nbankruptcy should be available in a fair and balanced way.\n  Our country's founders felt this principle was so important that it \nshould be enshrined in the Constitution.\n  Article I, section 8 of the Constitution explicitly grants Congress \npower to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies \nthroughout the United States.\n  We in Congress have a constitutional responsibility to oversee our \nnation's bankruptcy laws. The Senate should now take that \nconstitutional responsibility seriously.\n\n  Unfortunately, this premature cloture motion to cut off debate before \nit even started on this bill is not a serious effort.\n  If we are going to respect the fact we are dealing with a \nconstitutional issue here we should not start off the debate by \nstopping the debate. We know there is a rise in bankruptcies and people \nare abusing the system. Fine, let's close any loopholes in the \nbankruptcy code. But there are some other issues we should look at. \nWhat about credit cards? Last year we had a very balanced reform bill \nwhich passed 97 to 1 in the Senate. We had consumer credit card reforms \nin that bipartisan bill. Now we do not any consumer credit card reforms \nin this bill before us today. Should we not have some debate on whether \nwe should get those reforms back in this bill to add balance to any \nreform measure?\n  As the Department of Justice stated in its written views on this \nbill: The challenge posed by the unprecedented level of bankruptcy \nfilings requires us to ask for greater responsibility from both debtors \nand creditors. Credit card companies must give consumers more and \nbetter information so that they can understand and better manage their \ndebts.\n  The Administration has made it clear that for the President to sign \nbankruptcy reform legislation into law it must contain strong consumer \ncredit disclosure and protection provisions. I wholeheartedly agree.\n  The credit card industry must shoulder some responsibility for the \nnationwide rise in personal bankruptcy filings. Last year, the credit \ncard lenders sent out 3.4 billion solicitations. That is more than 12 \ncredit card solicitations a year for every man, woman and child in \nAmerica.\n  I have an example of one of these credit card solicitations. Let me \nshow you what happens in some of these credit card solicitation. Here \nis one for a Titanium Visa card. It was passed out after the movie: \n``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.'' You get some kid coming out, \nhe's handed this, it's ``titanium, baby.'' They will give one for you \nand one for Mini-me, I guess, at the movie theater. It calls its credit \ncard ``titanium, baby.'' It has an introductory rate of only 2.9 \npercent. How could any 13-year-old coming out of that movie not want \nthat great credit card?\n  Besides, it comes in three versions. Especially attractive to the 10-\nyear-olds who might be getting one of these credit cards: ``Groovy \nFlowers,'' ``Shagadelie Swirls,'' and, of course, for their older \nsiblings who might be 16 or 17, and more staid, you have \n``Traditional.''\n  The next chart shows the second page of this credit card \nsolicitation. They are now called, I can't quite do it like Austin \nPowers, but they are ``smashing baby.'' But then look at the small \nprint: ``2.9 percent introductory,'' you teenagers, you cannot do \nbetter. Of course that's available only for the 5 billing cycles. Then \nthe interest rate goes to 10.99 percent. Getting awful close to 11 \npercent. However, that is not quite the full story. You have an annual \ninterest rate for cash advances that is 19.99 percent.\n  We are now up to 20 percent. Oh, no, wait. There is another little \ninsy-binsy-winsy-tiny print in this solicitation. That is, if you have \ntwo late payments during any 6-month period, whoops, you are up to \n22.99 percent.\n  Can you imagine, as the kids get these Austin Powers credit card \napplications as they are walking out of the theaters for 2.9 percent, \nall of a sudden they are up to 22.99 percent?\n  It is not all bad, and I want to speak in favor of the credit card \ncompanies. Most people seeing this would figure they are really out to \nshaft you; they are taking advantage of you; they are being unfair to \nyou; they are being usurious; they are being greedy; they are being \nmean; they are being sneaky; they are trying to loop these people in. I \nknow most people say that about the credit card companies, but I want \nto be fair to them because if you apply for this, you get the chance to \nreceive two free tickets to the movie, one medium popcorn, and two \nsmall drinks.\n  I hope Senators who thought, because these credit card companies were \ndeceiving these teenagers into something to give them a 22.9-percent \nrate, those credit card companies were being mean feel badly about \nthat. After all, you forgot about the medium popcorn and the two small \ndrinks and the two free movie tickets.\n  There are billions of credit card solicitations like this sent to \nAmericans every year, and that has increased the number of personal \nbankruptcies. If cloture is invoked, then the Senate will be prevented \nfrom adding any credit industry reforms to this bill because the \namendments will not be germane. That is not a reasonable or fair.\n  Senator Torricelli and Senator Grassley negotiated with the credit \ncard industry to craft a managers' amendment that incorporates many of \nthe credit industry reforms proposed by Senators Schumer, Reed, Dodd, \nSarbanes, and others. It is a bipartisan effort, and I commend them. I \nam pleased to cosponsor this amendment to add more balance to the bill. \nBut we cannot even hear about this bipartisan effort if we invoke \ncloture.\n  Senator Kennedy plans to offer an amendment to increase the minimum \nwage over the next 2 years from $5.15 to $6.15 an hour. I am proud to \nbe a cosponsor of that amendment. Maybe if we had a decent minimum wage \nwe would have a lot less bankruptcies. It is more than appropriate to \nhelp working men and woman earn a livable wage on a bill related to \nbankruptcy.\n  These minimum wage workers are some of the same Americans who are \nstruggling to make a living everyday and might be forced into \nbankruptcy by a job loss, divorce or other unexpected economic event. \nMore than 11 million workers will get a pay raise as a result of a $1 \nincrease in the minimum wage. We should all agree to help millions of \nhard working American families live in dignity.\n  But the Senate would be prevented from considering any amendment to \nraise the minimum wage if cloture is invoked on this bill now--on the \nfirst day of debate on bankruptcy reform. That is not reasonable or \nfair.\n  As we move forward with reforms that are appropriate to eliminate \nabuses in the system, we need to remember the people who use the \nsystem, both the debtor and the creditor. We need to balance the \ninterests of creditors with those of middle class Americans who need \nthe opportunity to resolve overwhelming financial burdens.\n\n  I welcome Senator Torricelli, the new Ranking Member of the \nAdministrative Oversight and the Courts Subcommittee, to the challenges \nthis matter presents. I know that he and his staff have been working \nhard and in good faith to improve this bill.\n  As the last Congress proved, there are many competing interests in \nthe bankruptcy reform debate that make it difficult to enact a balanced \nand bipartisan bill into law. Unfortunately, Congress failed to meet \nthat challenge last year after the Senate had crafted a bill that \npassed 97-1.\n  I look back to what Senator Durbin did, with heroic efforts, last \nyear in\n\n[[Page S11096]]\n\ncrafting a bill that passed 97-1, and then it fell apart in a partisan \nconference. This is not a matter that should be partisan. Every one of \nour States has people who are facing bankruptcy. Every one of our \nStates has the kind of shoddy practices shown here where we have these \ncredit card applications passed out to kids coming out of a movie. They \nare almost designed to get them to go from this 2.9 percent interest to \n23 percent interest as fast as they possibly can.\n  But if we are going to go into bankruptcy reform, let's do it right. \nI think we should. I worked hard in the Judiciary Committee on this \nbipartisan bill. Let's do it in a way that we look at all aspects of \nit, and let's ask some of the credit card companies and others if they \nare not doing as much to create the problem as anybody else.\n  I can give a lot of other examples. I could show you a member of my \noffice whose 6-year-old son received a preapproved credit application \nfor $50,000. All he had to do was sign it. I do not know about kids \ntoday, but when I was 6 years old, if I had a credit card with $50,000 \nworth of credit in my pocket, I could have thought of a lot of things I \nwould have liked to have bought.\n  This may not be the spy that shagged us; it may well be the credit \ncard companies that shagged the Senate. We ought to pay attention to \nthe fact that when they are asking kids to pay 22.99 percent interest, \nthere is more than one reason why we have bankruptcies in this country.\n  I am hopeful that this year Republicans and Democrats in the Senate \ncan work together to pass and enact into law balanced legislation that \ncorrects the abuses by both debtors and creditors in the bankruptcy \nsystem.\n  But this partisan attempt to prematurely cut off debate before we \neven started to consider this bill does not bode well for that effort.\n  I hope that once this cloture motion is defeated, the Senate will \nbegin a reasonable and fair debate on bankruptcy reform legislation \nthat reflects a balancing of rights between debtors and creditors.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 55, the nays are \n44. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I deeply regret that we have reached this \npoint in connection with the nomination of Brian Theadore Stewart to \nthe District Court for Utah. Please understand that Democrats are \nprepared to vote on this nomination, as we are on all of the judicial \nnominations pending on the Senate Executive Calendar. This impasse is \ncaused not by Democrats' refusals to vote on that nomination but by \nRepublican refusals to allow a vote on the nominations of Judge Paez or \nMs. Berzon. If we can vote on the Stewart nomination in less than 2 \nmonths, we should be able to vote on the Paez nomination within 4 years \nand the Berzon nomination within 2 years.\n  This debate is about fairness. The Senate needs to be fair to all \npeople in this country. For too long nominees--judicial nominees like \nJudge Paez, Ms. Berzon and Justice Ronnie White of Missouri, and \nExecutive Branch nominees like Bill Lann Lee-- have been opposed in \nanonymity through secret holds and delaying tactics. They have been \nforced to run a gauntlet of Senate confirmation. Those strong enough to \nsurvive are being dealt the final death blow not by being defeating in \na fair up or down vote on the nomination but through a refusal of the \nRepublican leadership to call them up for a vote. These nomination are \nbeing killed through neglect and silence, not defeated by a majority \nvote.\n  Today we are not asking for any Senator's vote for any nomination. \nInstead, I am asking the Senate recognize that its responsibility is to \nvote on all the judicial nominations on the calendar. We can vote for \nthem or against them, we can vote them up or vote them down, but after \n44 months or 27 months or 20 months, after completing every step in \nwhat is a long, tortuous confirmation process, the nominations of Judge \nRichard Paez, Justice Ronnie White and Marsha Berzon are as entitled to \na Senate vote as the nomination of Ted Stewart.\n  I do not begrudge Ted Stewart a Senate vote. Despite strong \nopposition from many quarters from Utah and around the country, from \nenvironmentalists and civil rights advocates alike, I did not oppose \nthe Stewart nomination in Committee and I expect to vote for his final \nconfirmation here on the floor of the United States Senate. I have been \nsupportive of Chairman Hatch in his efforts to expedite Committee \nconsideration of the Stewart nomination with the expectation that these \nother nominees who have been held up so long, nominees like Judge \nRichard Paez, Marsha Berzon and Justice White, were to be considered by \nthe Senate and finally voted on, as well. The Chairman and I have both \nvoted for Judge Paez and Justice White each time they were considered \nby the Committee and we both voted for and support Marsha Berzon.\n  I have tried to work with the Chairman and with the Majority Leader \non all these nominations. I would like to work with those whom the \nMajority Leader is protecting from having to vote on the Paez and \nBerzon nominations, but I do not know who there are. In spite of what \nwas supposed to be a Senate policy that did away with anonymous holds, \nwe remain in a situation where I do not even know who is objecting to \nproceeding to schedule a vote on the Paez and Berzon nominations, let \nalone why they are objecting. In this setting I have no ability to \nreason with them or address whatever their concerns are because I do \nnot know their concerns. That is wrong and unfair to the nominees.\n\n  I do not deny to any Senator his or her prerogatives as a member of \nthe Senate. I have great respect for this institutions and its \ntraditions. Still, I must say that this use of anonymous holds for \nextended periods that doom a nomination from ever being considered by \nthe United States Senate is wrong and unfair.\n  Again, I say that this debate is about fairness and about the Senate \nbeing fair to all nominees and to other Senators and to the American \npeople. If we can vote on the Stewart nomination within 4 weeks in \nsession, we can vote on the Paez nomination within 4 years and the \nBerzon nomination within 2 years. That is the point that the \ndistinguished Democratic Leader was making by moving to proceed to \nconsider those nominations this evening. The Republican majority has \nrefused to debate those nominations and continues its steadfast refusal \nto vote on them after years of delay.\n  I do not want to see any judicial nomination held up without a vote, \nbut the Republican leadership is not being fair to the other judicial \nnominees on the calendar. We ask only for a firm commitment that they \nwill each get an up or down vote, too. The Republican Majority refuses \nto make even that commitment to a vote before the end of the session on \nthese qualified nominees.\n  In my statement last week I detailed the path that each of these \nnominees has traveled to the Senate. All are now available for a vote \non confirmation by the Senate. All should be accorded an up or down \nvote.\n\n[[Page S11098]]\n\n  Judge Richard Paez is an outstanding jurist and a source of great \npride and inspiration to Hispanics in California and around the \ncountry. He served as a local judge before being confirmed to the \nfederal court bench several years ago and is currently a Federal \nDistrict Court Judge. He has twice been reported to the Senate by the \nJudiciary Committee and has spent a total of 9 months over the last 2 \nyears on the Senate Executive Calendar awaiting the opportunity for a \nfinal confirmation vote. His nomination was first received by the \nSenate in January 1996, 44 months ago.\n  Justice Ronnie White is an outstanding member of the Missouri Supreme \nCourt and has extensive experience in law and government. He is the \nfirst African American to serve on the Missouri Supreme Court. He has \nalso been twice reported favorably to the Senate by the Judiciary \nCommittee and has spent a total of 7 months on the floor calendar \nawaiting the opportunity for a final confirmation vote. His nomination \nwas first received by the Senate in June 1997, 27 months ago.\n  Marsha Berzon is one of the most qualified nominees I have seen in 25 \nyears. Her legal skills are outstanding, her practice and productivity \nhave been extraordinary. Lawyers against whom she has litigated regard \nher as highly qualified for the bench. Nominated for a judgeship within \nthe Circuit that saw this Senate hold up the nominations of other \nqualified women for months and years--people like Margaret Morrow, Ann \nAiken, Margaret McKeown and Susan Oki Mollway--she, too, is listed \nahead of the Stewart nomination on the floor calendar. Ms. Berzon was \nfirst nominated in January 1998, 20 months ago, and a year and one-half \nbefore Mr. Stewart.\n  It is against this backdrop that we are asking the Senate to be fair \nto these judicial nominees and all nominees. I do not want to see votes \ndelayed on any nominee. For the last few years the Senate has allowed \none or two or three secret holds to stop judicial nominations from even \ngetting a vote. That is wrong.\n  The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court wrote in January \nlast year:\n\n       Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time \n     for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. \n     . . . The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any \n     particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry \n     it should vote him up or vote him down.\n\n  Let us follow the advice of the Chief Justice. Let the Republican \nleadership schedule up or down votes on the nominations of Judge Paez, \nJustice White and Marsha Berzon so that we can vote them up or vote \nthem down. And so that we can proceed on all the judicial nominations \nthat our federal courts need to do their job of administering justice. \nLet us be fair to all.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I voted against cloture on the Stewart \nnomination because the process that brought us to this vote has, to \ndate, prevented the Senate from even considering the nominations of \nseveral other judicial nominees who have been waiting far longer than \nhas Mr. Stewart.\n  Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, two nominees for the 9th Circuit, \nhave both been reported by the Judiciary Committee and have been on the \nSenate Executive Calendar since July. But, more important, their \nnominations have been pending in the Senate for years--2 years in the \ncase of Ms. Berzon and three years for Judge Paez!\n  It is patently unfair to ignore these fine nominations while moving \nforward on the Stewart nomination. I have no problem with Mr. Stewart, \nas far as I know. But this is an important process question, and I \nsimply had no choice but to vote no on cloture on Stewart until we are \nassured of also moving ahead with those nominations which have been \npending far longer.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, Ted Stewart, as any other nominee, deserves \na vote. And eventually, I expect to vote for him, because I respect the \njudgment of my friend Orrin Hatch and of the President. But there is a \nlong line of qualified nominees ahead of him and, at least at this \npoint, it's not right for him to ``cut'' in line.\n  For example, just compare Mr. Stewart's path with that of another \nqualified candidate, Tim Dyk, a nominee for the Federal Circuit. Mr. \nDyk was first nominated 18 months ago, came out of Committee with \nstrong bipartisan support, then stalled on the floor in the last days \nof the session because of a ``secret'' hold. He was nominated again \neight months ago, and he has still never been placed on the agenda.\n  As for Mr. Stewart, he was nominated less than two months ago, and it \ntook him just 48 hours to go from nomination, to hearing, to Committee \napproval. Now Mr. Stewart is up for a full Senate vote just 53 days \nafter he was nominated. Meanwhile, five hundred and two days after Tim \nDyk was nominated, he seems to be going nowhere fast.\n  That makes no sense to me or, I suspect, to Chairman Hatch, who also \nsupports this nominee.\n  Mr. President, as with Mr. Stewart, Mr. Dyk will, I predict, be \nconfirmed with bipartisan support. He's a first-rate intellect. He \npassed this Committee by a 14 to 4 vote last year, and all of us know \nthat the Federal Circuit would be lucky to have someone of his caliber.\n  Like Tim Dyk and Ted Stewart, there are many other deserving nominees \nout there. Let's not play favorites. These nominees, who have to put \ntheir lives on hold waiting for us to act, deserve an ``up or down'' \nvote. And, more importantly, the American people deserve prompt action, \nso that our courts can stay on top of their workload, and continue \nputting criminals behind bars.\n  So, Mr. President, I expect to support Ted Stewart, but don't think \nhe alone should get the timely consideration that all nominees--\nincluding Tim Dyk, Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez--deserve. So I hope \nwe can get an agreement to move forward not only Mr. Stewart, but also \nother deserving nominees. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11098-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to have the opportunity to talk \nabout the next four votes because it is critical that everyone \nunderstand what really is at stake tonight. Many Democratic Senators \nare in favor of the bankruptcy bill. Many of us have indicated publicly \nwe support a bankruptcy bill. But we also support debate on a \nbankruptcy bill.\n  We support the opportunity to take up a bill under the regular rules \nof the Senate, regular order, have a good debate, have amendments \noffered, do what we should do in the Senate tradition, and have the \nkind of full and open debate we have not had on a bill since last May.\n  We have not brought a nonappropriations bill to the Senate floor \nsince last May under the normal Senate rules.\n  Every single bill that has come before us since May has been under \nunanimous-consent agreements that circumvent, if not completely \neliminate, the use of the normal Senate rules.\n  I had a clear understanding, as early as last summer, that when we \nbrought the bankruptcy bill up, it would come up under normal Senate \nrules. I understand times change and circumstances\n\n[[Page S11099]]\n\nchange, but it is regrettable--although not surprising--that once again \ncloture was filed preemptively and without good cause.\n  Keep in mind, when one files cloture, it calls for the end of all \ndebate. It is amazing to me that tonight we are voting on a motion to \nend all debate before we have even had any debate. Not a word of debate \nhas been uttered on the bankruptcy bill.\n  We find ourselves in an amazing Orwellian circumstance in which we \nare ending debate before it begins, calling it a debate, filing \ncloture, and calling it quits. We cannot do that.\n  Time after time, I have indicated that many of us have opportunities \nto stop legislation, and we will be inclined to do that if we have no \nopportunity to bring up amendments, as regular order would allow. \nAgain, many of us support bankruptcy reform and want to see a \nbankruptcy bill, but we also want to be able to offer amendments.\n  If cloture is invoked tonight, many of the amendments we had agreed \nto prior to bringing the bill to the floor will fall--amendments that \nboth sides agree will improve the bill. Cloture will actually prevent \nthose relevant amendments from being considered.\n  I do not know why any colleague would vote to eliminate even relevant \namendments, amendments for which there is agreement. We have a \nmanagers' amendment to make improvements to the bill, but under cloture \nit would be subject to a point of order.\n  We want to go to bankruptcy. I want to see if we can reach some \nagreement on going to bankruptcy, but we cannot continue to gag \nSenators and prevent them from using the normal rules of the Senate in \noffering amendments.\n  Second issue: Cloture on Mr. Stewart. I have indicated publicly that \neven though I have some misgivings about Mr. Stewart, I will support \nhim. This issue is not about Mr. Stewart. This issue is about the 45 \nnominations that are still pending, awaiting Senate action a few weeks \nbefore the end of the session. This issue has to do with 38 nominations \nin committee, 24 district, 13 circuit, and 1 International Trade Court \njudge. This issue has to do with nominees who have been waiting for the \nSenate to act now since January of 1996.\n  Judge Richard Paez, who is currently a U.S. district court judge, was \nfirst nominated in January of 1996. Judge Paez has been waiting 3\\1/2\\ \nyears for a Senate vote--3\\1/2\\ years. That is half a Senate term. He \nhas been waiting half a Senate term for the Senate to act. He has been \nwaiting for more than 1,300 days for the Senate to vote, or 25 times \nlonger than Mr. Stewart. Mr. President, 1,300 days is a long time to \nwait for the Senate to act. Judge Paez is a patient man, but I do not \nthink it is too much to ask that, up or down, we let him get on with \nhis life, up or down he have the opportunity to have a vote, up or down \nwe say yes or no, you will be a circuit judge.\n  Justice Ronnie White, the first African American to serve on the \nMissouri Supreme Court, was originally nominated on June 26 of 1997. He \nwas actually put on the calendar in this Congress on July 22 of 1999, \nbut he has waited for a total of over 7 months on the calendar in this \nand in previous Congresses.\n  Marsha Berzon was first nominated in January of 1998. Her nomination \nhas been pending over 10 times longer than Ted Stewart's nomination.\n  There are 64 vacancies in the Federal judiciary today. Chief Justice \nRehnquist has noted that and has urged the Senate to act. We have 45 \nnominations pending in the Senate right now awaiting action either in \nthe committee or on the floor. There are seven nominations on the \nExecutive Calendar. Only 17 judges have been confirmed to date.\n\n  Some might claim: We have seen that happen before. I hate to say \n``when we were in the majority,'' but when we were in the majority, \nduring the first session in 1991, the last year we were in the majority \nin a nonelection year, we confirmed 57 judges; in 1992, an election \nyear, we confirmed 66 judges. In the election year 1994, the last \nelection year where we were in the majority, we had 101 judges \nconfirmed.\n  All one has to do is look back at past precedent. All one has to do \nis look at the terrible unfairness of someone having to wait 1,300 \ndays, 25 times longer than Ted Stewart, months and months--10 times \nlonger than Ted Stewart in the case of Marsha Berzon--to see how unfair \nthis system is.\n  I want to find a way to work through this. I know Senator Hatch, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, wants to find a way through it. I \nam hopeful we can find a way through it within the next few days. \nTonight I will move to proceed to the nominations of Judge Paez and Ms. \nBerzon, and we will have an opportunity to express ourselves on the \nimportance of these judges. We will vote. I hope the majority will not \noppose moving to proceed to those two judges: Ms. Berzon, an \nexceptional nominee for the ninth circuit; and Judge Paez, a sitting \ndistrict court judge, a Hispanic American, also fully qualified, a \nnominee for the Ninth Circuit. I hope we can find a way to resolve our \ndifferences and move forward.\n  I felt strongly about the importance of having these votes. I feel \nequally strongly about the importance of trying to resolve this \nimpasse. We will make every effort to do so. I believe my colleagues \nwill support an effort to break this impasse, recognizing that, as \nimportant as this is, we cannot go home leaving all of this work \nundone.\n  I hope we can do so this week. I know the majority leader has \nindicated a willingness to perhaps even hotline Judge Paez and Ms. \nBerzon. I hope that will happen this week. If that happens, we will be \nin a better position to know just how much opposition there is. We have \nto move on. We have to have these votes. We have to confirm these \nnominations. We have to ensure we can pass a good bankruptcy bill. \nThere is so much more we can and ought to do. That will take working \ntogether, and I stand ready to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11099-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NOMINATION OF MARSHA L.

Mr. President, I must begin by confessing my \ndisappointment that the minority would refuse to avoid a filibuster of \none of the nominees of its own administration, when the record of this \nSenate so dramatically proves the deference this Senate has shown to \nthis administration's judicial nominees. But that is what has just \nhappened this evening, and in the face of this blatant double standard \nby the minority, I will only say that I will continue to work in good \nfaith to secure a vote on the merits on the President's nomination of \nTed Stewart to be a Federal district court judge.\n  When I speak of the traditional deference the Senate has shown to the \nexecutive in matters of Federal judicial nominations, I believe I speak \nwith considerable experience. Since the time I was first sworn into the \nSenate in 1977, I have participated in and witnessed the confirmation \nof 1,159 judges and Justices, and have voted in favor of almost all of \nthem.\n  I have personally presided over the confirmation of 321 of President \nClinton's judicial appointments. This accounts for almost a quarter of \nthe entire Federal judiciary. And this session alone, I have held 4 \njudicial confirmation hearings, and reported 24 nominees out of \ncommittee.\n  This evening's cloture vote concerns me all the more because I had \npublicly stated, in response to some of my colleagues' concerns about \nmoving forward with other judicial nominations, that we would hold \nanother hearing in this month of September, yet another in October, \nand, if the Senate continued in session throughout November, that it \nhad been my hope to hold yet another hearing during that time.\n  With these plans, we would have been on track to equal or exceed the \nhistorical average for first-session judicial confirmations by the \nSenate. And so I find it incredible that this distinguished body \nresorted to the unfounded criticism that we are not doing as much as we \nshould to fill the ranks of the Federal judiciary.\n  And now, in light of today's vote on cloture, we shall have to \nreexamine the best way to move forward on judicial nominees so that we \neliminate the double standard that has been applied tonight.\n  To take a step back, and apply some perspective to the matter at \nhand, I want to emphasize that I have made every effort to promote a \nfair nominations process, recognizing the defference a President is \ntraditionally accorded in nominating judges akin to his political \nphilosophy. I have done as much notwithstanding the sometime heated \ncriticism of interest groups opposed to President Clinton's \nnominations.\n  Even nominees attacked by interest groups as liberal and \ncontroversial have received my support in the Judiciary Committee and \non the Senate floor. In fact, since I have been chairman, I have never \nvoted against any of the 31 Clinton judicial nominations for whom there \nhas been a roll call vote. I have supported these nominees not because \nI agreed with their philosophies, but because I have always believed \nthat the judicial nominations process should be as free from politics \nas possible.\n\n  But let me offer some specifics. I have supported getting out of \ncommittee controversial nominees such as Judge William Fletcher, Judge \nRichard Paez, Judge Lynn Adelman, and Marsha Berzon, even though I \nwould not have nominated them had I been President. Rather, so long as \na nominee is qualified and capable of serving with integrity in a \nposition, and I have his/her assurance that they will follow precedent, \nI believe they deserve to be confirmed.\n  Judge Fletcher, Judge Paez, and Ms. Berzon were opposed by a number \nof conservative organizations; yet, I supported their report by the \ncommittee to the floor. Now, Mr. Stewart is being unduly attacked by \nliberal groups. In this same spirit of bipartisanship with which I have \nsupported this administration's nominees, it had been and continues to \nbe my hope that the Democrats would support the nomination of Ted \nStewart.\n  I ultimately want this body to recognize that, in the same manner \nthat I have been fair to this administration's nominees in the face of \nsevere opposition, trust must be placed in the judgment of home State \nsenators for a nominee whose jurisdiction would be confined wholly to \nthat senator's State. So now, as I expect we will soon be considering \nTed Stewart, I will ask you to extend your deference to President \nClinton's choice and the Judiciary Committee's ranking member's \nsupport, but also to extend your trust to the judgment of both senators \nfrom Utah.\n  Ted is a good, honorable person, who has been deemed qualified for a \nposition as District judge of the District of Utah and who will make a \nwonderful District Court Judge. I urge the Democrats to stop playing \npolitics with this nomination and allow a vote expeditiously.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record pertinent \ncharts.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n               Status of article III judicial nominations\n\nTotal number of Clinton judges appointed,

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from South \nDakota, Mr. Daschle, stated the case very well this evening about the \nunprecedented sequence of three votes on judicial nominations. As I \nlook at the Senate floor now, I have served in this body longer than \nanybody presently on the floor. In 25 years, I have not seen an \ninstance where we have had such a series of votes.\n  We certainly have had times when Republicans have been in control of \nthe Senate and times when Democrats have been in control of the Senate \nwhere nominees were sometimes voted down and sometimes were voted up, \nwhich is the way it should be. When the President is of a different \nparty from the party controlling the Senate, that does not mean that \nthe President's nominee, the man or woman he nominates for whatever \nposition, automatically has to be voted against because one party \ncontrols the Senate and a different party is in the White House.\n  I look at two of my very distinguished, dear friends on the floor--\nthe Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Michigan--both of whom \nhave voted many times for nominees of the President of the other party \nin a whole lot of areas, certainly within their expertise on armed \nservices but also for ambassadors and judicial nominations.\n  I am sure that if the distinguished Senators sitting here were to go \nback and search their memories, they could think of a number of people \nfor whom they voted who were confirmed and who were not the persons \nthey would have nominated had they been President. They might have \npicked somebody else. They might have picked somebody with a different \npolitical\n\n[[Page S11102]]\n\nbent or ideology. But I think they have given the President of the \nUnited States the benefit of the doubt, and if the person is otherwise \nqualified, he or she gets the vote.\n  We have come to a difficult situation with judges. There continue to \nbe a large number of vacancies, and there are a lot of nominees who are \nnot being voted on. There are some that have waited for several years \nto be voted on. We talked about Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon who have \nbeen waiting for years to be voted on. We should either vote for or \nagainst them.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee deserves \ngreat credit for having gotten these nominees through our committee, \nnotwithstanding opposition from some members of his own party, and for \nhaving gotten them onto the floor and on the calendar. I compliment the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, for what he has \ndone.\n  I have worked closely with him to help him get matters out of that \ncommittee. There were some matters with which I disagreed and that I \nvoted against. But he was chairman, and I thought he should have as \nmuch leeway as possible in setting the agenda. I made it possible \nthrough various procedural actions for him to get his legislation out \nof committee.\n  Tonight we had a situation born out of the frustration, possibly \nmistakes, and, unfortunately, some unnecessary partisanship--although \nnot partisanship between the distinguished chairman of the committee \nand myself. I intend to vote for his recommended nominee for district \njudge from Utah, Mr. Stewart. I intend to vote for him as I did in the \ncommittee.\n  I also intend to vote for Marsha Berzon. I intend to vote for Judge \nRichard Paez, Justice Ronnie White, and, for that matter, for all of \nthe other judicial nominees who are on the Executive Calendar. I intend \nto vote for every one of them.\n  I hope we will have a chance to vote on them, not just in committee \nwhere I have voted for each one of them, but on the floor of the \nSenate. That is what the Constitution speaks of in our advise and \nconsent capacity. That is what these good and decent people have a \nright to expect. That is what our oath of office should compel Members \nto do--to vote for or against. I do not question the judgment or \nconscience of any man or woman in this Senate if they vote differently \nthan I do, but vote.\n  We have just a very few people, a small handful of people stopping \nthese nominees from coming to a vote. Basically, the Senate is saying \nwe vote ``maybe\"--not yes or no--we vote maybe. That is beneath Members \nas Senators.\n  We are privileged to serve in this body. There are a quarter of a \nbillion people in this great country. There are only 100 men and women \nwho get a chance to serve at any time to represent that quarter of a \nbillion people in this Senate. It is the United States Senate. No one \nowns the seat. No one will be here forever. All will leave at some \ntime. When we leave, we can only look back and say: What kind of \nservice did we give? Did we put the country's interests first? Or did \nwe put partisan interest first? Did we put integrity first, or did we \nplay behind the scenes and do things that were wrong?\n  I hope my children will be able to look at their father's \nrepresentation in this body as one of honor and integrity, as many of \nmy friends on both sides of this aisle have done.\n  I hope what happened tonight was something we will not see repeated. \nI understand the distinguished majority leader in going forward with \nhis motion. I understand and support the motion of the distinguished \nDemocratic leader.\n  Now that this has happened, can it be like the little escape valve on \na pressure cooker? The distinguished Presiding Officer and I are from a \ngeneration that remembers the old pressure cookers prior to the age of \nmicrowaves. Certainly, my wife and I as youngsters saw a pressure \ncooker now and then in the kitchen. Let us hope that maybe tonight's \nvotes will act as a little valve and let the pressure off.\n  I do not want to infringe on the kindness of the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, two of the \nvery best friends I have ever had in the Senate and two Senators whom I \nrespect and like the most here.\n  Let me close with this: Maybe the pressure cooker has allowed its \npressure to be released now. I suggest that the distinguished majority \nleader, the distinguished Democratic leader, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah, Mr. Hatch, and I now sit down and perhaps quietly, without \nthe glare of publicity and the cameras, try to work out where we go \nfrom here. It may be necessary for the four of us to meet with the \nPresident. But let us find a way to tell these nominees they will get a \nvote one way or the other.\n  I am not asking anybody how they should or should not vote but allow \nnominees to have a vote. All the people being nominated are extremely \nhighly qualified lawyers and judges. They have to put their lives on \nhold and the lives of their family on hold while they wait. They are \nneither fish nor fowl as a nominee. In private practice, all your \npartners come in and throw a big party and say it is wonderful, we are \nso proud of you, could you move out of the corner office because we \nwant to take it now. And you cannot do anything while you wait and wait \nand wait.\n  Vote them up, vote them down.\n  Now that we have done this, let the cooler heads of the Senate \nprevail so the Senate can reassure the United States we are meeting our \nresponsibility. Again, each Member is privileged to be here. There are \nonly 100 Members, with all our failings and all our faults, to \nrepresent a quarter of a billion people. Let us represent that quarter \nof a billion people better on this issue.\n  The distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, and I have a close \npersonal relationship. We will continue to have that. We will continue \nto work together, but the Senate has to work with us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11102-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11102-S11103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for several months, many of us have been \nconcerned about the Senate's continuing delays in acting on President \nClinton's nominees to the federal courts. Since the Senate convened in \nJanuary, we have confirmed only 17 judges and 43 are still waiting for \naction. These delays can only be described as an abdication of the \nSenate's constitutional responsibility to work with the President and \nensure the integrity of our federal courts.\n  At the current rate it will take years to confirm the remainder of \nthe judicial nominees currently pending before the Judiciary Committee. \nThis kind of partisan, Republican stonewalling is irresponsible and \nunacceptable. It's hurting the courts and it's hurting the country. \nIt's the worst kind of ``do nothing'' tactic by this ``do nothing'' \nSenate.\n  The continuing delays are a gross perversion of the confirmation \nprocess that has served this country well for more than 200 years. When \nthe Founders wrote the Constitution and gave the Senate the power of \nadvice and consent on Presidential nominations, they never intended the \nSenate to work against the President, as this Senate is doing, by \nengaging in a wholesale stall and refusing to act on large numbers of \nthe President's nominees.\n  Currently, there are 61 vacancies in the federal judiciary, and \nseveral more are likely to arise in the coming months, as more and more \njudges retire from the federal bench. Of the 61 current vacancies, 22 \nhave been classified as ``judicial emergencies'' by the Judicial \nConference of the United States, which means they have been vacant for \n18 months or more.\n  The vast majority of these nominees are clearly well-qualified, and \nwould be confirmed by overwhelming votes of approval. It would be an \nembarrassment for our Republican colleagues to vote against them. It \nshould be even more embarrassing for the Republican majority in the \nSenate to abdicate their clear constitutional responsibility to do what \nthey were elected to do.\n  The delay has been especially unfair to nominees who are women and \nminorities. Last year, two-thirds of the nominees who waited the \nlongest for confirmation were women or minorities. Already, in this \nCongress, the Senate is on track to repeat last year's dismal \nperformance. Of the 11 nominees who have been waiting more than\n\n[[Page S11103]]\n\na year to be confirmed, 7 are women or minorities. On the 50th \nanniversary of President Truman's appointment of the first African \nAmerican to the Court of Appeals--Judge William Hastie--the Republican \nleadership should be ashamed of this record, particularly given the \ncaliber of the distinguished African American, Latino, and female \nnominees waiting for confirmation.\n\n  For example, Marsha Berzon, Richard Paez, and Ronnie White have \nwaited too long--far too long--for a vote on the Senate floor. Ms. \nBerzon is an outstanding attorney with an impressive record. She has \nwritten more than 100 briefs and petitions to the Supreme Court, and \nhas argued four cases there. When she was first nominated last year, \nshe received strong recommendations and had a bipartisan list of \nsupporters, including our former colleague, Senator Jim McClure, and \nFred Alvarez, a Commissioner on the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission and Assistant Secretary of Labor under President Reagan. Her \nnomination is also supported by major law enforcement organizations, \nand by many of those who have opposed her in court.\n  Ms. Berzon was first nominated in January 1998--20 months later, the \nSenate has still not voted on her nomination.\n  The Senate is also irresponsibly refusing to vote on two other \ndistinguished nominees--Judge Ronnie White, an African American Supreme \nCourt judge in the state of Missouri, and California District Court \nJudge Richard Paez. Judge White was nominated to serve on the District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Missouri more than two years ago. \nJudge Paez was first nominated three years ago--three years ago--to \nserve on the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n  It is true that some Senators have voiced concerns about these \nnominations. But that should not prevent a roll call vote which gives \nevery Senator the opportunity to vote ``yes'' or ``no.'' These nominees \nand their families deserve a decision by the Senate. Parties with \ncases, waiting to be heard by the federal courts deserve a decision by \nthe Senate. Ms. Berzon, Judge White, and Judge Paez deserve a decision \nby this Senate.\n  While Republican leaders play politics with the federal judiciary, \ncountless individuals and businesses across the country are forced to \nendure needless delays in obtaining the justice they deserve. Justice \nis being delayed and denied in courtrooms across the country because of \nthe unconscionable tactics of the Senate Republican majority.\n  It is long past time to act on these and other nominations. I urge my \nRepublican colleagues to end this partisan stall and allow the \nPresident's nominees to have the vote by the Senate that they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11103-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

That is the pending business.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am prepared to stay here for the \nremainder of the evening. This is a very important subject. I am joined \nby the distinguished ranking member, Mr. Levin.\n  However, I observed our distinguished colleague from New Mexico in \nthe Chamber. It was my understanding he desired to lead off the \ncomments on this bill tonight since the bill incorporates a very \nimportant provision which was sponsored by Senator Domenici, Senator \nMurkowski, and Senator Kyl. Seeing Senator Domenici I yield the floor \nto him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my fellow Senators, this bill \nis a very important bill. The part I worked on is very small. It has to \ndo with reforming the Department of Energy as it pertains to the \nhandling and maintenance of nuclear weapons and everything that goes \nwith them.\n  I compliment those who prepared the overall bill. It is a very good \nbill for the defense of our Nation, and it deserves the overwhelming \nsupport of the Senate.\n  We had no other way to accomplish something very important with \nreference to a Department of Energy that was found to be totally \ndysfunctional, not by those who have tried over the years to build some \nstrength into that Department, some assurance that things would be \nhandled well, but rather by a five-member select board that represented \nthe President of the United States, headed by the distinguished former \nSenator Warren B. Rudman.\n  Those five members of the President's commission, with reference to \nserious matters that pertain to our national security, concluded that \nthe Department of Energy could not handle the work of maintaining our \nweapons systems, maintaining them safe from espionage and spying, and \ncould not handle an appropriate counterintelligence approach because \nthere was no one responsible and, thus, everybody pinned the blame on \nsomeone else and we would get nowhere in terms of accountability.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the names of the five members of that \nboard be printed in the Record, with a brief history of who they are \nand what they have done in the past.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Panel Members\n\n       The Honorable Warren B. Rudman, Chairman of the President's \n     Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. Senator Rudman is a \n     partner in the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton, and \n     Garrison. From 1980 to 1992, he served in the U.S. Senate, \n     where he was a member of the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence.

Ms. Caracristi, of \n     Washington, DC, is a former Deputy Director of the National \n     Security Agency, where she served in a variety of senior \n     management positions over a 40-year career. She is currently \n     a member of the DCI/Secretary of Defense Joint Security \n     Commission and recently chaired a DCI Task Force on \n     intelligence training.

Mr. President, I am just going to address three issues \nas it pertains to the reform of the Department of Energy as it pertains \nto nuclear weapons development.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. You opened by saying that this was a way to have the \nSenate\n\n[[Page S11104]]\n\naddress this important subject. Of course, the Senator is aware that \nthe Armed Services Committee oversees about 70 percent of the budget of \nthe Department of Energy, so this is a very logical piece of \nlegislation on which to put the important provision. And, of course, \nyou and I worked together on it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Absolutely.\n  Mr. President, what I want to do is dispel any notion that the \namendment that created a semiautonomous agency within the Department, \nto be headed by an assistant secretary who would be in charge of \neverything that has to do with nuclear weapons development--and they \nwould do things in a semiautonomous way, not in the way that the rest \nof the Department of Energy does its business--is taking away the \nauthority of the Secretary; that is, the Secretary of Energy.\n  The Department of Energy is an amorphous Department put together at a \npoint in history when a lot of things were dumped in there. Some have \nno relationship to other matters in the Department. And, yes, we put \nthe nuclear defense activities in that Department.\n  No one could contend that if the Congress of the United States, and \nthe President concurring, wanted to take all of the nuclear weapons out \nof that Department and put them in an independent agency--which was one \nof the recommendations of the five-member panel--that that would be \nunconstitutional, illegal. And there would be no Secretary of Energy \ninvolved at all.\n  The other suggestion was, rather than make it totally independent, to \nleave it within the Department and make it semiautonomous. We did that.\n  The Secretary, and some of those arguing on behalf of a different \napproach, chose to say that the Secretary does not have enough to do \nand enough say-so about nuclear weapons development, and therefore it \nis wrong.\n  I want to read from the bill's two provisions.\n\n       In carrying out the functions of the administrator--\n\n  That is the new person in charge of the semiautonomous agency--\n\n     the undersecretary shall be subject to the authority, \n     direction, and control of the Secretary.\n\n  Second:\n\n       The Secretary shall be responsible for establishing policy \n     for the National Nuclear Security Administration.\n\n  It goes on with two other provisions assuring that the overall policy \nis under the jurisdiction of the Secretary.\n  But I remind everyone, had we chosen not to do that, it would have \nbeen legal. We could have taken it all out and had no Energy Secretary \ninvolved. We chose not to. We chose to say: Leave it there so there can \nbe some cross-fertilization between the Energy Department's work and \nthe nuclear activities on behalf of our military and our defense.\n  We got this finished, and we made accommodation on the floor of the \nSenate with reference to the environment. Never was it intended that \nthe semiautonomous agency would be immune from any environmental law. \nIn fact, the first writing of this bill had a legal opinion that if you \ndo not mention it, it is subject to all environmental laws.\n  We came to the floor and some Members on the other side, I think \nquite properly, said: Why don't you specifically mention that the new \nsemiautonomous agency is subject to the environmental laws? We did \nthat. In fact, it says:\n\n       The administrator shall ensure that the administration \n     complies with all applicable environmental, safety, health \n     statutes, and substantive requirements. Nothing in this title \n     shall diminish the authority of the Secretary of Energy to \n     ascertain and ensure that compliance occurs.\n\n  Because we wrote it in, some quibble with the words that we used to \nwrite it in. Now they are saying: Are you sure you included everything? \nWe thought we included everything by mentioning nothing; then we tried \nto include everything verbally and some said: You have to change the \nwords because you really don't mean it.\n  There is nothing to indicate that we have exempted or immunized any \nof our environmental laws in this statute. They are totally applicable. \nIt is just that the new administrator applies them to the nuclear \nweapons department separate and distinct from the rest of the \nactivities of the Department of Energy--and it is high time, in my \nopinion.\n  There are some letters from attorneys general, and I just want to say \nI read some of them. I have no idea how they came to their conclusions. \nI will just cite one. The attorney general of Texas, in responding \nafter he received an explanation of the bill from the distinguished \nchairman, Senator Warner, wrote a letter saying:\n       After reading your letter, I am satisfied that this \n     legislation was neither intended to affect existing waivers \n     of Federal sovereign immunity nor to exempt in any way the \n     NSAA--\n\n  The new semiautonomous agency--\n\n     from the same environmental laws and regulations applied \n     before the reorganization.\n\n  For those attorneys general who are worried about Hanford out on the \nwest coast--and it might be difficult for attorneys general in the \nStates to be involved--let me remind them that facility does not even \ncome under the jurisdiction of the new semiautonomous agency. It is not \nconsidered to be part of the current ongoing nuclear weapons \nactivities.\n  In closing, I just want to make sure that my fellow Senators \nunderstand that some people working in the Department of Energy will \nsay almost anything about us trying to reform it. Secretary Richardson \nis doing a good job for a department that is dysfunctional. He wakes up \nevery week with something that has gone wrong.\n  We ought to start fixing it with the passage of this bill with a new \nsemiautonomous agency in control. But there is a general that was hired \nnamed Habiger. He is the Secretary's czar for the Department right now. \nHe went to the State of New Mexico and said--I am paraphrasing: I never \ninvolve myself in politics. Those are secret and private between me and \nmy wife. However, in this case, I suggest that the creation of this \nsemiautonomous agency is political.\n  I tried to find out who was playing politics. Was it the five-member \ncommission that I just cited, headed by Warren Rudman, with one of the \nmembers, Dr. Sidney Drell, one of the most refined and articulate and \nknowledgeable people on this whole subject matter? Were they playing \npolitics? Was the Senate playing politics when we got an overwhelming \nvote? What is the politics of it?\n  If you think the only way to preserve and maintain our nuclear \nweapons development and to maximize the opportunity for accountability \nand less opportunity for spying is to have a Secretary of Energy who \nruns that part of it, then you will not be happy. Because the truth of \nthe matter is, the Secretary will be in charge overall, but there will \nbe a single administrator in charge of this department in the future, \nwith everything that has to do with nuclear, including its security; \nalthough in counterintelligence we have agreed with the administration, \nwith the Secretary, and have permitted the counterintelligence to be in \ntwo places. There is a czar under the Secretary, and there will be \nsomebody running the counterintelligence within the new semiautonomous \nagency.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the story in the Albuquerque Journal \nregarding the distinguished general, who I suggested knows nothing \nabout the Department of Energy--he has been there 3 or 4 months, and \nmaybe he ought to learn a little more about it before he goes to New \nMexico and elsewhere and mouths off about the independent \nsemiautonomous agency--be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Albuquerque Journal, Sept. 17, 1999]\n\n                  Security Chief Pans New Nuke Agency\n\n                            (By Ian Hoffman)\n\n       The Security chief for the U.S. Department of Energy says \n     legislation creating a new nuclear-weapons agency inside DOE \n     is being driven by politics and could impair, rather than \n     promote, tighter security at the nation's nuclear weapons \n     labs.\n       Gen. Eugene Habiger, the new DOE security czar, \n     acknowledges the Energy Department needs reform to fix \n     ``organizational disarray'' and a longstanding lack of \n     accountability.\n       But the latest version of a bill to create the new National \n     Nuclear Security Administration actually will insulate the \n     new weapons agency from oversight of security for nuclear \n     secrets, he said.\n       ``What you're doing is creating a bureaucracy within a \n     bureaucracy that's going to perpetuate the problems of the \n     past--lack of\n\n[[Page S11105]]\n\n     focus on security, lack of awareness of security and lack of \n     accountability,'' Habiger said Thursday at Sandia National \n     Laboratories while presiding over hearings on proposed \n     polygraph testing for weapons workers.\n       House lawmakers approved the new weapons agency Wednesday \n     by voting overwhelmingly in favor of the 2000 Defense \n     Authorization Bill. Congress has billed the new agency as a \n     way to increase security and accountability in the wake of \n     China's alleged theft of U.S. nuclear-warhead designs.\n       The new agency is largely the handiwork of Sen. Pete \n     Domenici, R-N.M., but the original legislation underwent \n     changes last month in a closed-door conference of select \n     Senate and House members. Habiger sees some of the changes as \n     dramatically reducing his authority to ensure security at the \n     nuclear-weapons labs.\n       ``I'm not political. Nobody knows my politics except my \n     wife,'' said Habiger, former commander in chief over the U.S. \n     Strategic Command. ``What's going on now--It's not about \n     security. It's about politics.''\n       He declined to speculate on the political motivations in \n     Congress behind the new agency.\n       Habiger's comments add to mounting criticism of the \n     legislation, which is being promoted by its authors as the \n     answer to lax security and poor accountability in the U.S. \n     nuclear-weapons program.\n       The leading critics are states that host DOE facilities, \n     environmental watchdog groups and Energy Secretary Bill \n     Richardson.\n       The National Governors Association and the National \n     Association of Attorneys General urged Congress earlier this \n     month to reconsider the legislation as written. They were \n     joined by 46 state attorneys general, including New Mexico's \n     Patricia Madrid. They say the bill stands to harm the \n     environment and the safety of workers and the public by \n     curtailing or eliminating oversight by the states, as well as \n     by the remainder of DOE itself.\n       The bill would package DOE weapons work into its own semi-\n     autonomous agency, with its own internal security, \n     environmental and safety apparatus. As such, the bill \n     codifies a more independent and insulated version of DOE's \n     Office of Defense Programs, a politically well-connected \n     office renowned for its resistance to outside oversight of \n     security, safety and environmental protection.\n       In separate letters to Congress, the governors' association \n     and the attorneys general said the new agency would preserve \n     the self-regulation of the nuclear weapons complex that has \n     left a legacy of more than 10,000 contaminated sites. Cleanup \n     or fencing off of those sites could take 75 years, at a DOE \n     estimated cost of at least $147 billion.\n       ``For over four decades, DOE and its predecessors operated \n     with no external (and little internal) oversight of \n     environment, safety and health,'' the attorneys general \n     wrote. ``Over the past 12 years or so, the disastrous \n     consequences of this self-regulation have become plain . . . \n     Much of this land and water will never be cleaned up.''\n       To date, many of the nation's toughest environmental and \n     safety laws and regulations still contain explicit exemptions \n     for the U.S. nuclear-weapons complex, its wastes and worker \n     safety.\n       Richardson forced the resignation in May of former \n     Assistant Secretary for Defense Programs Vic Reis, partly for \n     Reis' role in pressing lawmakers for the new agency and \n     partly for his failure to attend to security at the weapons \n     labs.\n       Habiger took Richardson's offer to become director of DOE's \n     newly formed Office of Security and Emergency Operations on \n     several conditions. Habiger insisted he work directly with \n     Richardson and report solely to him. He also requested full \n     control of the department's security apparatus and its entire \n     $800 million security budget.\n       The new bill transfers emergency operations to the deputy \n     administrator of the new weapons agency. And it provides the \n     agency with its own security and counterintelligence \n     authority and funding, Habiger said.\n       The changes threaten to roll back the tightened security \n     measures that he and Richardson have taken in recent months, \n     Habiger said.\n       ``Unfortunately, the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration Act would derail this progress,'' he said. \n     ``The bill would negate the president's ability to hold the \n     Secretary of Energy responsible for managing the nation's \n     nuclear defense and production complex. It would strip the \n     secretary's responsibility to determine and manage sensitive \n     classified programs. And it would shield DOE's nuclear \n     defense work from the rest of the department's regimens, \n     insulating it from secretarial oversight, supervision and \n     scrutiny. . . . To continue our work, we need expanded \n     oversight at the nuclear labs, not the insulated system this \n     bill proposes.''\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. With that, I yield the floor and say I hope the Senate, \nby bipartisan, overwhelming majorities, passes this bill with this \namendment on it, which is going to be good for America, good for \nnuclear weapons, and it will diminish the chances for spying and \ncounterintelligence to work against our nuclear weapons in the secrets \nthat are so imperative. Let's look back on this day and say we finally \ndid something to move in the right direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have had the real privilege of working \nwith Senator Domenici on this particular amendment from its inception. \nTogether with Senators Murkowski and Kyl, we crafted this very \ncarefully.\n  The original concept was adopted by the Senate in the consideration \nof the intelligence bill. We then incorporated it in our bill, and we \nworked it with the House. I will go into further details.\n  Throughout, Senator Domenici has been really the leader of this \neffort. The Senate owes Senator Domenici a deep debt of gratitude for \nhis perseverance on this provision. I am sure that America will \nrecognize that service because it is in the best interests of the \ncountry. It was not motivated by politics. It was crafted carefully on \nthe report of our distinguished colleague, Senator Rudman, who, of \ncourse, is one of the principal advisors to the President on \nintelligence and other matters. He was selected by the President to do \nthis report. So we thank you, I say to the Senator.\n  Last night, Senator Domenici took the initiative of going down to see \nthe President. I was privileged to accompany him and join in that \nmeeting. We were going to have a meeting for, I suppose, 20 minutes or \nso. The President had just arrived. He still had a little mud on his \nboots from visiting a flood area and was in his clothes from the trip, \nhis casual clothes. He was preparing his address to the United Nations.\n  But he stopped to take the time to carefully evaluate the concern of \nthe Senator from New Mexico, and a meeting of 20 minutes lasted well \nover an hour on this and other subjects. But primarily he has a grasp \nof the issues. He asked specific questions. And the Senator from New \nMexico, together with his able staff member, Alex Flint, who was also \nthere with us, responded.\n  The Senator from New Mexico talked to one question tonight. But I \nwanted to raise the second question and put it in the Record.\n  He will recall the concern he had about the split provision and where \nit was. I went back, researched, and found in our record a letter dated \nJuly 29 from Jacob Lew, Director of the Executive Office of the \nPresident, Office of Management and Budget. Mr. Lew wrote me the \nfollowing:\n       I understand that Representative Spence has proposed an \n     amendment for the FY 2000 defense authorization bill \n     conference concerning the creation of a National Nuclear \n     Security Administration at the Department of Energy. The \n     Administration strongly opposes this language because it does \n     not provide sufficient authority to the Secretary of Energy \n     to assure proper policy development for, and oversight of, \n     the new organization at the Department of Energy. The \n     language jeopardizes the creation of sound \n     counterintelligence, intelligence, and security efforts, and \n     environmental, safety, and health compliance activities at \n     the new organization. If this legislation were presented to \n     the President, his senior advisors would recommend that it be \n     vetoed.\n\n  We carefully tried to take into consideration Mr. Lew's concerns. We \ndrafted that provision for that specific reason. So we were trying to \nfollow the directions of the Director of Budget.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be printed in the Record a short \nletter from me to the President thanking him for the meeting last \nnight, containing a copy of this letter and explaining just how we \narrived at that provision. But I think it would be helpful for the \nRecord if the Senator from New Mexico were to expand on the President's \nquestion and the response of the Senator.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 21, 1999.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Thank you for meeting with Senator \n     Domenici and me last night to discuss the Department of \n     Energy (DOE) reorganization provisions in the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 Conference \n     Report.\n       You expressed concern last night with the organization of \n     counterintelligence functions within DOE and the National \n     Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). The provisions in the \n     conference report were crafted in\n\n[[Page S11106]]\n\n     response to a July 29, 1999, letter from Office of Management \n     and Budget Director, Jacob Lew, which stated that the \n     Administration would oppose language that does not ``ensure \n     that the Secretary is provided sufficient authority to assure \n     proper policy development for, and oversight of, the new \n     organization . . .''. The letter identified \n     ``counterintelligence, intelligence, security, and \n     environment, safety and health compliance activities'' as the \n     organizational areas of concern.\n       Chairman Spence and I took Director Lew's letter very \n     seriously and modified the conference report specifically to \n     address the concerns in his letter. We modified the \n     conference report by establishing the Office of \n     Counterintelligence, which would be responsible for \n     establishing all counterintelligence policy for the \n     Department and for integrating such policies across \n     organizational lines. I would point out that the Senate-\n     passed DOE reorganization framework placed all responsibility \n     for counterintelligence in the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration.\n       Mr. President, let me again convey the importance of the \n     Defense Authorization Act to the men and women in uniform. \n     The soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, their families and \n     veterans are aware of the increased benefits in the \n     conference report and are looking to you to follow through on \n     your promises to them. I strongly encourage you to sign the \n     bill when it is sent to you.\n           Respectfully,\n     John Warner.\n                                  ____\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 1999.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I understand that Representative Spence \n     has proposed an amendment for the FY 2000 defense \n     authorization bill conference concerning the creation of a \n     National Nuclear Security Administration at the Department of \n     Energy. The Administration strongly opposes this language \n     because it does not provide sufficient authority to the \n     Secretary of Energy to assure proper policy development for, \n     and oversight of, the new organization at the Department of \n     Energy. The language jeopardizes the creation of sound \n     counterintelligence, intelligence, and security efforts, and \n     environmental, safety, and health compliance activities at \n     the new organization. If this legislation were presented to \n     the President, his senior advisors would recommend that it be \n     vetoed.\n            Sincerely,\n                                           Jacob J. Lew, Director.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will not take much time because there \nare so many people who want to speak to this bill and its many other \nramifications.\n  My assessment was that the President was concerned about the \nenvironmental provisions. We went through it very carefully. I believe \nthe President was satisfied that what we had done was intended to keep \nthis semiautonomous agency totally within the purview of every \nenvironmental law of this land.\n  The second issue, obviously, had to do with counterintelligence \nbecause the Department under Bill Richardson had gone to a great deal \nof effort to create a policymaking mechanism for counterintelligence \nand had appointed somebody to be in charge of it. The amendment in its \noriginal form did not account for that. It put all of the \ncounterintelligence within the new, semiautonomous agency.\n  That issue was raised with Chairman Rudman as he testified, and, as \nthe distinguished chairman of the full committee indicates, it was \nraised to the committee by Mr. Lew from the OMB. Perhaps the good point \nwas made. I think it could have gone either way. But I am certain that \neverybody involved in security will say it is all right the way it is.\n  Secretary Richardson made the point that there are some \ncounterintelligence issues that are broader and apply in different \nplaces within the Department than just in the nuclear weapons part. You \nshouldn't have two kinds of policies developed on counterintelligence. \nSo we said the policy will be developed in the Office of the Secretary \nand it will be implemented and carried out in toto for the nuclear part \nby the semiautonomous agency, and the Assistant Secretary, or \nadministrator--whichever we choose to call him--implements this \nprovision.\n\n  I believe those are the most important issues of which we spoke.\n  I think the President clearly understood that you could manage a \nnuclear weapons system without a Secretary of Energy. You could do it \nsimilar to NASA, with perhaps a board of directors, and he even \ncommented that certainly would not be illegal. But the point is, we \nwant to leave it in the Department. But when you leave it there, you \nhave to make it somewhat autonomous or you haven't changed anything. I \nthink by the time we were finished that was well understood.\n  I believe we have a good bill with reference to reforming this \nDepartment. I think within a couple of years you will see security in a \nmuch better shape. I think you will see ``accountability'' as a word of \nwhich you will not only speak but you will know who is accurate. And it \nis high time, in my opinion.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator, Mr. Warner, for involving me again \nhere tonight.\n  I think I have said enough. I yield the floor. I hope the Senate \npasses this tomorrow overwhelmingly.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thought it very important and as a \ncourtesy to the President that this be a part of the legislative \nhistory of this bill. Senator Domenici has given an excellent \nexplanation.\n  So this part of the Record contains all the information that is \npertinent, I ask unanimous consent that my letter to the attorneys \ngeneral, to which our distinguished colleague, Mr. Domenici, referred, \nlikewise be printed in the Record so that those studying this issue \nwill have in one place all of the pertinent material.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 14, 1999.\n     Hon. Michael O. Leavitt,\n     Chairman, National Governors' Association Hall of States,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christine O. Gregoire,\n     President, National Association of Attorneys General,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Governor and Madam Attorney General: We are aware that \n     concerns have been raised regarding the impact of Title XXXII \n     of S. 1059, the conference report for the National Defense \n     Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2000, on the safe \n     operation and cleanup of Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear \n     weapons sites. Title XXXII provides for the reorganization of \n     the DOE to strengthen its national security function, as \n     recommended by the House of Representatives, the Senate, and \n     the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB). \n     In so doing, the NDAA would establish the National Nuclear \n     Security Administration (NNSA), a semi-autonomous agency \n     within the Department.\n       However, as the purpose of this effort was focused on \n     enhancing national security and strengthening operational \n     management of the Department's nuclear weapons production \n     function, the conferees recognized the need to carefully \n     avoid statutory modifications that could inadvertently result \n     in changes or challenges to the existing environmental \n     cleanup efforts. As such, Title XXXII does not amend existing \n     environmental, safety and health laws or regulations and is \n     in no way intended to limit the states' established \n     regulatory roles pertaining to DOE operations and ongoing \n     cleanup activities. In fact, Title XXXII contains a number of \n     provisions specifically crafted to clearly establish this \n     principle in statute.\n\n\n    nnsa compliance with existing environmental regulations, order, \n   agreements, permits, court orders, or non-substantive requirements\n\n       Concern has been expressed that Title XXXII could result in \n     the exemption of the NNSA from compliance with existing \n     environmental regulations, orders, agreements, permits, court \n     orders, or non-substantive requirements. We believe these \n     concerns to be unfounded. First, Section 3261 expressly \n     requires that the newly created NNSA comply with all \n     applicable environmental, safety and health laws and \n     substantive requirements. The NNSA Administrator must develop \n     procedures for meeting these requirements at sites covered by \n     the NNSA, and the Secretary of Energy must ensure that \n     compliance with these important requirements is accomplished. \n     As such, the provision would not supersede, diminish or \n     otherwise impact existing authorities granted to the states \n     or the Environmental Protection Agency to monitor and enforce \n     cleanup at DOE sites.\n       The clear intent of Title XXXII is to require that the NNSA \n     comply with the same environmental laws and regulations to \n     the same extent as before the reorganization. This intent is \n     evidenced by Section 3296, which provides that all applicable \n     provisions of law and regulations (including those relating \n     to environment, safety and health) in effect prior to the \n     effective date of Title XXXII remain in force ``unless \n     otherwise provided in this title.'' However, nowhere in Title \n     XXXII is there language which provides or implies that any \n     environmental law, or regulation promulgated thereunder, is \n     either limited or superseded. Therefore, we clearly intend \n     that all existing regulations, orders, agreements, permits, \n     court orders, or non-substantive requirements that presently\n\n[[Page S11107]]\n\n     apply to the programs in question, continue to apply \n     subsequent to the enactment and effective date of Title \n     XXXII.\n       Concern has also been expressed that the creation of the \n     NNSA would somehow narrow or supersede existing waivers of \n     sovereign immunity or agreements DOE has signed with the \n     states. Title XXXII merely directs the reorganization of a \n     government agency and does not amend any existing provision \n     of law granting sovereign immunity or modify established \n     legal precedent interpreting the applicability or breadth of \n     such waivers of sovereign immunity. The intent of this \n     legislation is not to in any way supersede, diminish or set \n     aside existing waivers of sovereign immunity.\n\n\nnnsa responsibility for environment, safety and health and oversight by \n              the Office of Environment, Safety and Health\n\n       Concern has been expressed that the NNSA would be sheltered \n     from internal oversight by the Office of Environment, Safety \n     and Health. In keeping with the semi-autonomous nature of the \n     proposed NNSA, the legislation establishes new \n     relationships between the new NNSA and the existing DOE \n     secretariat. Principally, it vests the responsibility for \n     policy formulation for all activities of the NNSA with the \n     Secretary and devolves execution responsibilities to the \n     NNSA Administrator. However, there is clear recognition of \n     the need for the Secretary to maintain adequate authority \n     and staff support to discharge the policy making \n     responsibilities and conduct associated oversight. For \n     instance, Section 3203 establishes a new Section 213 in \n     the Department of Energy Organization Act which provides \n     that:\n       ``(b) The Secretary may direct officials of the Department \n     who are not within the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration to review the programs and activities of the \n     Administration and to make recommendations to the Secretary \n     regarding administration of those programs and activities, \n     including consistency with other similar programs and \n     activities of the Department.\n       (c) The Secretary shall have adequate staff to support the \n     Secretary in carrying out the Secretary's responsibilities \n     under this section.''\n       While some maintain that both of these provisions are \n     redundant restatements of the Secretary's inherent authority \n     as chief executive of his department, we recognized the \n     importance of being abundantly clear on this point, \n     particularly as it pertained to environmental, safety and \n     health matters. Therefore, we fully expect that the Secretary \n     will continue to rely on the Office of Environment, Safety \n     and Health or any future successor entity to support his \n     policy making and oversight obligations under the law.\n       To further clarify this point, the conferees also included \n     a provision in Section 3261(c) that states that ``Nothing in \n     this title shall diminish the authority of the Secretary of \n     Energy to ascertain and ensure that such compliance occurs.'' \n     This provision makes reference to the requirement that the \n     NNSA Administrator ensure compliance with ``all applicable \n     environmental, safety and health statutes and substantive \n     requirements.'' Once again, the conferees intended this \n     further language to make it abundantly clear that the \n     Secretary retains the authority to assign environmental \n     compliance oversight to the Office of Environment, Safety and \n     Health to support his responsibilities in this area.\n       Finally, concern has also been raised over the \n     interpretation of the assignment of environment safety and \n     health operations to the NNSA Administrator by Section 3212. \n     This provision establishes the scope of functional \n     responsibilities assigned to the NNSA Administrator and is \n     not intended to, and does not, supersede the assignment of \n     primacy for policy formulation responsibility to the \n     Secretary of Energy for environment, safety and health or any \n     other function.\n\n\n   effect of section 3213 on oversight by the office of environment, \n                           safety and health\n\n       Concern has also been raised that Section 3213 could be \n     interpreted in a manner that would preclude oversight by the \n     Office of Environment, Safety and Health. Section 3213 deals \n     exclusively with the question of who within the Department of \n     Energy holds direct authority, direction and control of NNSA \n     employees and contractor personnel. As such, this provision \n     establishes the operational and implementation chain of \n     command in keeping with the organizing principle of the \n     legislation to vest execution authority and responsibility \n     within the NNSA. However, neither this principle nor Section \n     3213 would in any way preclude the Secretary from continuing \n     to rely on the Office on Environment, Safety and Health for \n     providing him with oversight support for any program or \n     activity of the NNSA.\n\n\n nnsa responsibility for environmental restoration and waste management\n\n       Concern has also been raised that Title XXXII somehow would \n     extend to the NNSA responsibility for environmental \n     restoration and waste management. We consider this concern to \n     be unfounded and inaccurate. Contrary to some \n     interpretations, Section 3291(c) grants no authority to the \n     Secretary to move additional functions into the NNSA. Rather, \n     Section 3291(c) recognizes the possibility that some future \n     activity may present the need to migrate a particular \n     facility, program or activity out of the NNSA should it \n     evolve principally into an environmental cleanup activity. \n     Therefore, this provision would allow such activity only to \n     be transferred out of the NNSA.\n       Further, contrary to some expressed concerns, Title XXXII \n     would not permit control of ongoing cleanup activities being \n     carried out by the Office of Environmental Management to be \n     assumed or inherited by the NNSA, thus ensuring that DOE's \n     environmental responsibilities will not be overshadowed by \n     production requirements. Finally, as previously noted, \n     Section 3212, which assigns the functional responsibilities \n     of the NNSA Administrator, is not intended to, and does not, \n     establish responsibility to the NNSA Administrator for \n     environmental restoration and waste management.\n\n\n     oversight role of the defense nuclear facilities safety board\n\n       Concern has been raised that the external oversight role of \n     the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) will be \n     impaired by the conference report language. This concern is \n     without merit, since Title XXXII makes no change to the \n     existing authority or role of the DNFSB. While there was some \n     discussion during the conference of possibly expanding the \n     role of the DNFSB to enhance external environmental \n     and health oversight, this proposal was eventually dropped \n     resulting in no change to the existing authority of the \n     DNFSB.\n       We firmly believe that this legislation will result in much \n     needed reforms to better protect the most sensitive national \n     security at our nuclear weapons research and production \n     facilities and to correct associated long-standing \n     organizational and management problems within DOE. However, \n     we agree that these objectives should not weaken or undermine \n     the continuing effort to ensure adequate safeguards for \n     environmental, safety and health aspects of affected programs \n     and facilities. More specifically, we believe that these \n     objectives can be met without in any way limiting the \n     established role of the states in ongoing cleanup activities. \n     This legislation is fully consistent with our continuing \n     commitment to the aggressive cleanup of contaminated DOE \n     sites and protecting the safety and health of both site \n     personnel and the public at large.\n       We appreciate your willingness to share your concerns with \n     us and hope that this response will address them in keeping \n     with our mutual objectives. In this regard, we look forward \n     to continuing to work closely with you and your associations \n     to ensure that this legislation is implemented in a manner \n     that is consistent with the principles stated above and \n     strikes the intended careful balance between national \n     security and environmental, safety and health concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n     Floyd D. Spence,\n       Chairman, House Armed Services Committee.\n     John Warner,\n       Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                            Attorneys General,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 3, 1999.\n       Re Department of Energy Reorganization.\n     Hon.

Richard Gephardt,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senators Lott and Daschle; and Representatives Hastert \n     and Gephardt: We write to express our serious concerns with \n     certain provisions of the Department of Defense (``DOD''.) \n     Authorization bill as reported by the House/Senate conference \n     committee on August 4, 1999. Title XXXII of the bill would \n     create a new, semi-autonomous entity within the Department of \n     Energy (``DOE'') called the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration (``NNSA''). We recognize the need to ensure \n     national security at DOE, and acknowledge the strong \n     Congressional interest in restructuring DOE to address these \n     concerns. However, any such restructuring must not \n     subordinate the states' legitimate environment, safety, and \n     health concerns to weapons production and development. We \n     fear that the proposed bill will have this unintended \n     consequence. We urge you to oppose those provisions of Title \n     XXXII that would weaken the existing internal and external \n     oversight structure for DOE's environmental, safety and \n     health operations.\n       For over four decades, DOE and its predecessors operated \n     with no external (and little internal) oversight of \n     environment, safety and health. Over the past twelve years or \n     so, the disastrous consequences of this self-regulation have \n     become plain. DOE now oversees the largest environmental \n     cleanup program in the world. DOE has contaminated thousands \n     of acres of land, and billions of gallons of groundwater. \n     Much of this land and water will never be cleaned up. \n     Instead, states and the federal government will have to \n     ensure these contaminated areas remain isolated or contained \n     for hundreds or thousands of years. Achieving even this sad \n     legacy will cost $147 billion, according to DOE's most recent \n     estimates. As recent revelations about\n\n[[Page S11108]]\n\n     worker health and safety at DOE's Paducah, Kentucky, plant \n     further demonstrate, we should not return to the era of self-\n     regulation.\n       Congress and President Bush responded to these concerns in \n     1992 by passing the Federal Facility Compliance Act, which \n     clarified that states have regulatory authority over DOE's \n     hazardous waste management and cleanup. DOE also made \n     internal reforms. It created an internal oversight entity in \n     the Office of Environment, Safety, and Health. It also \n     created the Office of Environmental Management, whose mission \n     is to safely manage DOE's wastes, surplus facilities, and to \n     remediate its environmental contamination.\n       Title XXXII of the Defense Authorization bill would \n     undercut each of these reforms. It would impair State \n     regulatory authority, eliminate DOE's internal oversight of \n     environment, safety and health, and transfer responsibility \n     for waste management and environmental restoration to the \n     entity responsible for weapons production and development. \n     The following provisions of the bill are particularly \n     troubling:\n       Under well-established Supreme Court jurisprudence, section \n     3261 could be interpreted as a very narrow waiver of \n     sovereign immunity, leaving the NNSA exempt from state \n     environmental regulations, permits, orders, penalties, \n     agreements, and ``non-substantive requirements.''\n       Sections 3212(b)(8) and (9) make the NNSA responsible for \n     environment, safety and health operations, and section \n     3291(c) clarifies that this includes environmental \n     restoration and waste management. Under this arrangement, \n     environmental concerns would likely take a back seat to \n     production.\n       Together, sections 3202, 3213(a) and 3213(b) provide that \n     the NNSA's employees and contractors would not be subject to \n     oversight by the Office of Environment, Safety, and Health.\n       Section 3296, intended as a savings clause, will not \n     preserve application of existing laws and regulations because \n     of the introductory phrase ``unless otherwise provided in \n     this title.''\n       Against these provisions, section 3211's unenforceable \n     exhortation that the Administrator shall ensure the NNSA's \n     operations are carried out ``consistent with the principles \n     of protecting the environment and safeguarding the safety and \n     health of the public and of the workforce'' is of little \n     comfort.\n       Enhancing national security does not have to be \n     inconsistent with protecting environment, safety, and health. \n     But as set forth in Title XXXII, it is. Unfortunately, there \n     have been no hearings where states could comment on the \n     language of this bill. The provisions we are concerned about \n     surfaced in the conference committee. We urge you to oppose \n     the DOE reorganization provision, Title XXXII, as proposed in \n     the Defense Reauthorization bill. If Congress believes that \n     reorganization is necessary to resolve security issues at \n     DOE, such changes should be accomplished through the regular \n     legislative process, with hearings that provide an \n     opportunity for states and others who are concerned about the \n     environmental, safety and health consequences to have their \n     views heard before a final vote.\n           Sincerely,\n         Christine O.

Mr. President, I want to say for the Record that there \nare so many people who have worked hard on this legislation. I don't \nwant the Record to even imply that I was more responsible than others. \nMaybe I worked earlier than some. But Senator Kyl worked very hard. \nSenator Murkowski conducted some marvelous hearings on the subject. \nBoth the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Intelligence \nwere greatly involved and, in fact, participated in helping us with \nthis and supported it wholeheartedly.\n  The Senators on the floor from the Armed Services Committee, Senator \nBingaman and Senator Levin, contributed to some positive things on the \nfloor that were changed as a result of their concerns. I think \naltogether we have a bill that will work.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, again I thank Senator Domenici.\n  The Record should reflect the valuable contributions by the staff \nmembers who worked on this amendment: Alex Flint of Senator Domenici's \nstaff, John Roos of Senator Kyl's staff, Howard Useem of Senator \nMurkowski's staff, and Paul Longsworth of my staff, and the Armed \nServices Committee staff.\n\n\n                        Privileges Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent Clint Crosier, a fellow from \nSenator Smith's office, be granted floor privileges during the DOD \nauthorization debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I also ask unanimous consent that staff members of the \nCommittee on Armed Services on the list I send to the desk be extended \nprivileges of the floor during consideration of this conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this evening we consider the conference \nreport to accompany S. 1059, the National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 2000.\n  I am pleased to report for the first time in 15 years--I want to \nrepeat that and let it sink in, 15 years--the defense budget before the \nSenate represents a real increase above the normal allowance we make \nfor inflation. This is above inflation for defense spending.\n  I rejoice in that as all members of our committee do. I am hopeful \nthat all Members of the Senate, likewise, do. We authorize $288.8 \nbillion in defense funding for next year, which is $8.3 billion above \nthe President's budget request, and a 4.4-percent real increase in \nspending from last year.\n  I acknowledge the roles particularly of the Members of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff who appeared before the Armed Services Committee on two \noccasions. We have a longstanding tradition in our committee that when \nthese individuals are confirmed before our committee, we obtain from \nthem a commitment that at any time the committee desires to receive \ntheir personal, professional, military opinion on matters, and those \nissues could be contrary to the policies of the administration which \nthey proudly serve, they will be received.\n  These individuals testified to the needs of their respective services \nwhich were over and above the dollar figures, the budget allocations \nset by OMB and, indeed, the administration. That gave the foundation of \nevidence that enabled Members, first in committee, and then before this \nbody, in passing the bill to get the increased sums I have just \nreferenced--$8.3 billion above the President's budget request.\n  The President himself this year took an initiative to get additional \ndefense spending. To the credit of our former colleague, Senator Cohen, \nhe, likewise, was very supportive of the President and took the \ninitiative that led to the President increasing the defense budget. \nHowever, our committee was of the opinion, again, based largely on the \ntestimony of the Joint Chiefs, that we needed dollars above the \nPresident's figure and we obtained them.\n  First, a quick review of the precarious international situation. \nRemember, much of the budget consideration started with the problems in \nBosnia, the problems with reference to Kosovo. All during that \ntimeframe, the committee was holding hearings and working on its \nbudgets. Most recently, the crisis in East Timor. Incidentally, in \nconsultation with the President, I indicated I supported the action of \nsending U.S. troops as a part of the security force under the U.S. \nauspices to save the people of East Timor.\n  But I mention this is a very troubled world. It is a far different \none than when I first came to the Senate 21 years ago, when it was a \nbipolar world dominated by the Soviet Union, at that time, and the \nUnited States as the two superpowers. We didn't realize the degree of \nstability we had during that period of the two superpowers in a bipolar \nworld, but we appreciate it in today's world where we see so many \nethnic, religious, and racial tensions which have now come to the \nforefront and have exploded into strife in various areas of the world. \nRussia evolved from that sort of crisis. But it does not remain, of \ncourse, as a superpower.\n  Many nations, therefore, and the United Nations, have turned to the \nUnited States as the sole remaining superpower to solve new types of \nconflicts and tensions around the world. We are called upon to be--to \nuse a phrase which I dislike, but it is well ingrained in the media--\nthe world's policeman. We are not the world's policeman. Our \nPresident--in my judgment too many times, but nevertheless by and large \nI have supported him on most of the occasions, such as East Timor--has \ndirected our Armed Forces beyond our shores more times than any \nPresident in the history of the United States of America. All this to \nsay that is justification for the additional defense spending, \njustification for the very significant sum of money embraced in this \nbill.\n  It is fascinating to pause and go back and examine just what has \ntranspired in a very brief period of time in our history. We face and \nbear these new developments with a force that is overstretched around \nthe world and operating on a shoestring. Over the past decade, our \nmilitary manpower has been reduced by one-third, from 2.2 million men \nand women in uniform to now 1.4 million in uniform. At the same time, \nduring that decade, those very young, magnificently trained, dedicated, \ncommitted young men and women were involved in 50 military operations \nworldwide. At the same time that we came down in force structure, up \nrose the number of occasions in which the Commander in Chief--\nsuccessively, three Commanders in Chief--have deployed them throughout \nthe world.\n  By comparison, let's look at another chapter of history. From the end \nof the war in Vietnam, 1975, until 1989, U.S. military forces were \nengaged in only 20 military operations. What a sharp contrast, and it \nis reflected by the ever-increasing threat from weapons of mass \ndestruction; that is, weapons composed of fissile material, biological \nmaterial, and chemical materials.\n  All of the ethnic and religious and racial tensions that are breaking \nout all over the world--that is the reason the President has had to \nsend for our troops to meet these crises, but troops which are \ndiminishing overall in numbers. It is critical the funding and the \nauthorities contained in this conference report be quickly enacted into \nlaw so we can send a very clear message--we, the Congress of the United \nStates--send a very clear message to our troops: We are behind you. We \nrecognize that you are stretched. We recognize the hardships on your \nfamilies. We recognize the risks you are taking. And we, the Congress, \nhave responded by increasing the defense budget, by increasing the \nmoney for your salaries, increasing the money so that your salaries can \nbegin to move up--and I carefully say move up--towards salaries \ncommensurate with those in the private sector.\n  A sergeant in our military today with, say, 4 or 5 years of service \nand training in a specialty can command a much higher salary in the \nprivate sector. How well we know that because they are not staying. Our \nretention of those well-trained people is at levels below the needs of \nthe military. That is why, sergeant, we are raising your salary. That \nis why, captain, major, we are raising your salary. Because we know you \nare at that juncture in your career where you have to make a decision \nfor yourself--and your family, in most cases--as to whether to stay at \nthis current salary or go into the private sector where you can get a \n10, 15, 20, 30, 100 percent increase in salary. We recognize your \ncommitment to your country, your selflessness to serve your Nation, and \njoined with your family, we give you this recognition in this bill of a \nvery significant pay raise, together with certain retirement benefits \nwhich more nearly meet your long-term projected goals.\n  This is personnel reform. I thank Senator Lott, who initiated \ncorrespondence with the President of the United States just as soon as \nthis session of the Congress began and pointed out to the President the \nneed for certain personnel reforms. In weeks thereafter, he was joined \nby other Senators--Mr. McCain, Mr. Roberts--and the committee, in every \nrespect that we could, followed the goals those three individuals laid \ndown in devising this pay and benefits and retirement bill.\n  The result of this conference report is to aggressively close the gap \nbetween military and private sector wages by providing a 4.8-percent \npay\n\n[[Page S11110]]\n\nraise and ensuring military personnel will be compensated more \nequitably. We did not get it all the way up to where they can draw a \nline equal to the private sector, but we came a long way.\n  The military retirement system will be reformed by providing military \npersonnel with a choice. They will be allowed to choose to revert to \nthe previous military retirement system or accept a $30,000 bonus and \nremain under the Redux system. This may not be clear to all those who \nare not familiar with it, but I assure you this retirement system was \nderived by our committee and legislated by the Senate as a whole and \nadopted by the conference after the closest consultation with the \nsenior uniformed personnel, as well as all grades and ranks, to make \nsure we got it right this time. I am pleased to give my colleagues that \nassurance. We did get it right.\n\n  Military members will also be given the opportunity to participate in \nthe Federal Thrift Savings Program; again, an incentive for them to \nremain in the military.\n  During the course of our review, the committee found the single most \nfrequent reason departing service members cite is that of family \nseparation, occasioned most often by the back-to-back deployments of \nthe uniformed member who has family, be it a male or a female, to the \nvarious parts of the world to meet the requirements of 50 deployments \nin this past decade. That puts a strain on families. For us, those who \nhave the relative enjoyment of being with our families at all times, it \nis hard to understand. You are given orders: In 72 hours you are going \nto be aboard that plane or that ship and you have to leave your family \nand go abroad for, most often, an indefinite period of time.\n  Let every young wife and let every child put themselves in the place \nof a military family where your father, or, indeed, your mother as the \ncase may be, comes home and says: My orders read I must leave in 72 \nhours and I am not sure when I will be back. That is a tough lifestyle. \nBut these young people are accepting it. I hope as a consequence of \nthis bill, greater numbers will elect to retain their current positions \nand continue to advance and serve this country in their expertise.\n  In addition to enhancing the quality of life for military personnel, \nthis bill focuses on providing our Armed Forces the tools they need to \nmeet their commitments worldwide. For example, this year the bill \nprovides for $1.5 billion increased funding above the President's \nrequest for military readiness. This includes an additional $939 \nmillion to reduce equipment and infrastructure maintenance backlogs, \n$179 million for ammunition, and $112 million for service training \ncenters.\n  The conference report also stresses the problem of aging \ninfrastructure by fully funding $8.5 billion in military construction \nprojects, which is $3 billion above the administration's request. Much \nof this additional funding is targeted for housing and other projects \nthat will enhance the quality of life of the men and women in the Armed \nForces--just really meeting the basic requirements for a standard and a \nquality of life that they have earned many times over.\n  The conference report also contains additional information about the \nmodernization and specific provisions covering modernization and \nresearch and development funding to provide the requirement \ncapabilities for the future. We try to look out a decade. What are the \nlikely adversaries we will have 10 years from now, and what will be \ntheir military capabilities in terms of hardware? What is it the United \nStates needs, to begin now or to continue research and development on, \nso as to meet those threats 10 years out and meet and exceed the \ncapabilities of the military equipment likely to be in the possession \nof our adversaries a decade hence.\n  The F-22 is a clear example of that. Senator Stevens, with whom I was \nconsulting earlier this evening, is doing the very best he can to \nrestructure, with the House of Representatives, that program so we can \ncontinue to develop that vital aircraft. I say vital because this \nNation has adopted so many, if not all, of its military plans for \ncombating an enemy on the concept of air superiority.\n  We have had air superiority since the Korean war, in which I played a \nvery modest role as a communications officer in the First Marine Air \nWing. That was the last war--in Korea--in which we lost airmen as a \nconsequence of aerial combat. Our distinguished colleague, Senator \nGlenn, who retired last year, was very much involved in that. That is \nthe last time we experienced a threat in air-to-air combat from \nmilitary aircraft of any great significance.\n  There has been an isolated case here and there. I know at one point \nin time several planes took off during the Kosovo operation, but they \nwere quickly knocked down and sent back to their bases. The same thing \nhappens in Iraq today. Periodically, Saddam Hussein sends them up. They \nmake a U-turn and scatter back home very quickly. Again, the reason \nthey scatter back home quickly is the reason Milosevic was unsuccessful \nin his aircraft: Because we have air superiority. That is in air-to-\nair.\n  Where we must stay abreast in air superiority is in what we call \nground-to-air missiles. That is an entirely different threat and one \nthat, every day that goes by, other nations are getting capability to \nshoot from the ground into the air, at almost all the altitudes at \nwhich our aircraft operate, very dangerous missiles to knock down our \naircraft. It is for that reason we have to have the F-22 and other \nmodern aircraft which provide for our men to maintain air superiority.\n  The bill authorizes $55.7 billion in procurement funding, $2.7 \nbillion more than the President's request, and $36.3 billion in \nresearch and development spending, $1.9 billion more than the \nPresident's request. In considering where to add money, the conferees \nfocused on those items contained in the service chiefs' list of \ncritical unfunded requirements.\n  We did not just go straying off. We said to the chiefs: We recognize \nthe President set a budget target within which you had to do your \nbudgeting; but in the event the coequal branch of our Government--the \nlegislative branch, the Congress--comes along and makes a determination \nthat more money should be added to this budget, then where, in your \nprofessional judgment, should that money be added: In the Department of \nthe Army? The Department of the Navy? The Department of the Air Force? \nThat is what we used as guidance in adding moneys over and above the \nPresident's request to specific programs.\n  Our Nation is facing very real threats from the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction, international terrorism, information \nwarfare, and drug trafficking. These are the dangerous threats that \nkeep our Nation's leaders up at night and that require substantial \ninvestments to counter. To meet these challenges, the Emerging Threats \nSubcommittee--under the superb leadership of Senator Roberts--pursued a \nnumber of initiatives that were adopted by the conference including \nauthorizing 17 new National Guard RAID Teams to respond to terrorist \nattacks in the United States; initiating better oversight of DOD's \nprogram to combat terrorism; and establishing an Information Assurance \nInitiative to strengthen DOD's information security program.\n  Now let me discuss the provisions in the bill that would reorganize \nthe national security functions of the Department of Energy. A degree \nof controversy has arisen over these provisions and I wish to outline \nfor my colleagues what the conference report does and, specifically, \nwhat it does not do.\n  The conference report includes a subtitle that would restructure the \nDepartment of Energy by consolidating all of its national security \nfunctions under a single, semi-autonomous agency within DOE, known as \nthe National Nuclear Security Administration. This action represents \nthe first significant reorganization of DOE in over 20 years and is in \ndirect agreement with the June 1999 recommendation from the President's \nForeign Intelligence Advisory Board, which called for the creation of \n``a new semiautonomous Agency * * * whose Director will report directly \nto the Secretary of Energy.''\n  There have been countless other reports that have questioned the \nmanagement structure of the Department. But by far, the President's own \nForeign Intelligence Advisory Board had the most damming assessment. \nThis report\n\n[[Page S11111]]\n\nstates that ``the Department of Energy, when faced with a profound \npublic responsibility, has failed.'' The report goes on to say that \n``the Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has \nproven it is incapable of reforming itself''.\n  It has been asserted that the conference report could diminish the \nrole of the States in DOE cleanup actions and blur the authority of the \nSecretary of Energy to manage the national security function of the \nDepartment. Let me state clearly that each of these accusations are \nwholly untrue.\n  Language to maintain environmental protection was included that is \nidentical to the language in the amendment offered by Senators Levin, \nBingaman, and others in the Senate. This amendment was included in the \nDOE reorganization provision which overwhelmingly passed the Senate by \na vote of 96-1 as part of the Intelligence Authorization Act. This vote \non a very similar reform package as contained in the conference \nagreement demonstrated the clear intent of Congress that the current \nmanagement structure at the Department was broken and was in need of \nreform.\n\n  With regard to the authority of the Secretary of Energy, the \nconferees were very careful and could not have been clearer in \nretaining the authorities of the Secretary necessary to manage, direct, \nand oversee the activities of the new Administration. I and most of the \nother conferees believe this new DOE organizational framework will \ndramatically streamline the management of our Nation's nuclear weapons \nlabs, establish clear accountability, and ensure full compliance with \nthe Secretary of Energy's direction and all applicable environmental \nlaws.\n  Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, however, has indicated that this \nnew organizational framework would make it ``impossible for any \nSecretary of Energy to run the Department.'' Let me say, with all due \nrespect to my good friend Mr. Richardson, I disagree. I was a Secretary \nof a military department and know what is required to make an \norganization work. I believe that the organizational structure that is \ncreated in this conference report could be successfully managed by a \nstrong Secretary of Energy--and he should step up to this challenge.\n  In conclusion, I want to thank all the members and staff of the \nconference committee for their hard work and cooperation. This bill \nsends a strong signal to our men and women in uniform and their \nfamilies that Congress fully supports them as they perform their \nmissions around the world with professionalism and dedication. Many \norganizations including The Military Coalition and The National \nMilitary and Veterans Alliance, two consortiums of nationally prominent \nmilitary and veterans organizations representing millions of current \nand former members of the uniformed services, their families and \nsurvivors, strongly endorse enactment of this bill.\n  I am confident that enactment of this bill will enhance the quality \nof life for our service men and women and their families, strengthen \nthe modernization and readiness of our forces and begin to address \nnewly emerging threats to our security. I urge my colleagues to adopt \nthe recommendations of the conference committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from supporting organizations \nand a list of the staff members of the Armed Services Committee be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           The Military Coalition,\n\n\n                                  201 North Washington Street,\n\n                               Alexandria, Va, September 15, 1999.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Military Coalition, a consortium of \n     nationally prominent veterans organizations representing more \n     than five million members of the uniformed services plus \n     their family members and survivors, is grateful to you and \n     the Armed Service Committee for your leadership in crafting \n     the FY 2000 National Defense Authorization Act. The Coalition \n     strongly supports enactment of S. 1059.\n       S. 1059 contains numerous initiatives to improve retention \n     and the quality of life of members of the uniformed services \n     and their families, including pay raises and enhancements in \n     the post-1986 retirement system--both imperative to reverse \n     the serious degradation in personal readiness the services \n     are now experiencing. In addition, it addresses recruiting \n     shortfalls, spare parts shortages, training accounts and \n     deteriorating infrastructure.\n       Favorable floor action on the pay, retirement and quality \n     of life initiatives in S. 1059 will send a powerful signal to \n     the men and women in the uniformed services and their \n     families that this Nation fully appreciates the sacrifices \n     they are making and recognizes the vital role they play in \n     ensuring a strong national defense.\n       The Military Coalition has urged every members of the \n     Senate to vote in favor of this important legislation when if \n     comes to the floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           The Military Coalition.\n       Air Force Association.\n       Air Force Sergeants Association.\n       Army Aviation Assn. of America.\n       Assn. of Military Surgeons of the United States.\n       Assn. of the US Army.\n       Commissioned Officers Assn. of the US Public Health \n     Service, Inc.\n       CWO & WO Assn.

NMVA \n     appreciates the fine work of your Committee on this important \n     legislation which provides for a continued strong national \n     defense.\n       This legislation will improve pay and compensation, and \n     will improve the quality of life for military members and \n     their families. It is an excellent step to strengthen our \n     nation's defense and deserves prompt passage. A unanimous \n     vote would let our brave young men and women know that the \n     nation values their courage and dedication to duty.\n       We appreciate your past efforts on behalf of our men and \n     women in uniform and look forward to working with you to \n     safeguard our national security.

My purpose in writing is to \n     commend you for your leadership in crafting S.\n\n[[Page S11112]]\n\n     1059, the conference report on the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000.\n       More than any legislation in recent memory, this \n     legislation focuses on ``people'', providing substantial \n     enhancements to the quality of life of our men and women in \n     uniform. In addition, the conference report addresses the \n     critical issues of readiness and modernization, placing this \n     country's national defense capacity on a more solid footing \n     as we enter the next century.\n       COA deeply appreciates your efforts and your personal \n     resolve to ensure the highest standard of readiness for all \n     seven of our country's uniformed services.

John Warner,\n     Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the 70,000 members of the \n     Navy League of the United States, I want to thank you and the \n     members of the Senate Armed Services Committee for your \n     leadership and hard work regarding S. 1059, the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000.\n       As you know, S. 1059 contains several initiatives that are \n     critical to improving the quality of life and retention of \n     our highly trained men and women in uniform, particularly the \n     4.8 percent pay raise, and a restructuring and restoration of \n     the military retirement system. Additionally, the bill begins \n     to address the serious shortfalls in recruiting, spare parts, \n     training accounts and deteriorating infrastructure that is \n     confronting our armed forces.\n       Quick passage of S. 1059 will send a strong signal to our \n     service members and their families that Congress and our \n     Nation support and recognize the hard work and long hours \n     they endure to guarantee our safety and freedom.\n       The Navy League, as a civilian patriotic organization, is \n     dedicated to the support of America's sea services and \n     enthusiastically encourages every member of the Senate to \n     vote in favor of this bill when it comes up for final \n     consideration.\n       With best regards.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John R.

The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I commend my good friend from \nVirginia for his work on this bill and his leadership in the committee. \nIt is a bipartisan style of leadership, and it is very productive. I \ncommend him on it. It sets the kind of style which I hope will permeate \nthis body in all the things we do, but it is absolutely essential in \nthe national security area that we act in this way. He carries on a \ngreat tradition in doing so.\n  The conference report for the national defense for the fiscal year \n2000 is a good bill, with one problem, and that problem is the \nprovisions relating to the reorganization of the Department of Energy \nnuclear weapons complex. Because of the deficiencies in the DOE \nreorganization provisions, I declined to sign the conference report on \nthis bill, but, at the time, I stated I would decide how to vote on the \nbill after a more careful analysis and a public airing of the \nprovisions.\n  Back to the Department of Defense side of the bill because this is \nalmost two bills but one conference report. We have a Department of \nDefense authorization bill, in its more traditional style, addressing \nthe issues which we typically address, and we have this new kid on the \nblock, this Department of Energy reorganization part of this bill, \nwhich is the problematic part.\n  The Department of Defense portion of the bill is a good agreement. It \nwas reached through bipartisan and cooperative discussion among \nourselves in the Senate and with our House colleagues. This conference \nreport should go--and will go, in my judgment--a long way to meet the \npriorities established for our military by Secretary Cohen and the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff.\n  I very much agree with our good friend, Senator Warner, as to what he \nsaid about this part of the bill and the priorities it sets, how it \nspends the additional funds. In accordance with the fiscal year 2000 \nbudget resolution, the bill includes an $8.3 billion increase in budget \nauthority above the level provided in the President's budget. Unlike \nthe budget increases in past years, the added money in this bill will \nbe spent in a manner in which the Department of Defense indicates it \nhas the highest priorities.\n  That is a very important point. The chairman made the point in his \nremarks that, relative to the additional funds, we solicited from the \nDepartment what their highest priorities are and tried to reflect those \npriorities.\n  The bottom line is that this bill will go a long way to improve the \nquality of life for our men and women in uniform, it will improve the \nreadiness of our military, and it will continue the process of \nmodernizing our Armed Forces to meet the threats of the future.\n  Some of the add-ons, as I have indicated, the so-called increases, \nrepresent the highest-priority readiness items identified by the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, including an added $788 million for real property \nmaintenance, something we frequently neglect and delay but which is \nessential--real property maintenance is not a glamorous item, but it is \nvery important to quality of\n\n[[Page S11113]]\n\nlife and to readiness--$380 million was added for base operations; $172 \nmillion for ammunition; $112 million for training center support; $151 \nmillion for depot maintenance. These are items that too frequently get \nshortchanged. In each case, these items will significantly enhance the \nability of our Armed Forces to carry out their full range of missions.\n  As far as the members of the military are concerned, this is probably \nthe most important Defense Authorization Act in recent years because of \nthe improvements it will make in pay and benefits for the women and men \nin uniform.\n  The bill includes the triad of pay and retirement initiatives sought \nby Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs: A 4.8-percent military pay \nraise for fiscal year 2000, reform of the military pay table to \nincrease pay for midcareer NCOs and officers, and changes to the \nmilitary retirement system. These changes should go a long way in \naddressing recruiting and retention problems in the services. My \ngreatest disappointment in this area is that we were not able to enact \nthe GI bill improvements that were proposed by Senator Cleland this \nyear.\n  I think every Member of this body wants to do everything they can to \nensure the men and women in uniform receive fair compensation for the \nservice they provide to their country. Secretary Cohen and the Joint \nChiefs of Staff made a persuasive case that the military is facing real \nrecruiting and retention problems and that improvements in pay and \nbenefits in the conference report are a critical element of any plan to \naddress the recruiting and retention problems.\n  There are other important provisions in this bill as well. For \nexample, the bill reported by the Armed Services Committee provides \nfull funding for the DOD Cooperative Threat Reduction Program with \nRussia and other countries of the former Soviet Union, although it \nwould terminate work on the Russian chemical weapons destruction \nfacility. Unfortunately, two of the three companion programs at the \nDepartment of Energy, the initiative for proliferation prevention and \nthe nuclear cities initiatives, received less funding than requested by \nthe administration.\n  The bill also contains some unfortunate restrictions on those two \nprograms at the Department of Energy which are going to limit the \neffectiveness of these programs. Nonetheless, the Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program and those related Department of Energy programs are a \ncornerstone of our relationship with Russia, and although the DOE \nprograms were not funded at the level requested, nonetheless they are \nfunded at a significant level and these programs play an important role \nin our national security by reducing the threat of proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction from Russia and rogue nations with which \nRussia may form closer ties in the absence of those programs.\n  There were other disappointments as well. In addition to the \nreduction of the requests for the DOE programs that I mentioned, \nSenator Well-stone's amendment to provide some relief for a group of \nveterans who contracted serious illnesses after being exposed to \nradiation while participating in nuclear tests or while serving at \nHiroshima or Nagasaki after the war, adopted in the Senate, was not \naccepted in conference because when we got to conference, the House \nconferees said the amendment would increase the so-called mandatory or \nentitlement spending, and they had no jurisdiction on that issue. As a \nresult, they would not agree to include this provision in the \nconference report. That is a disappointment. It is a disappointment to \nme, and I think it will be a disappointment to those veterans who were \nso exposed.\n  But the conference report, again, has so many important provisions \nthat we should look at the whole DOD report and weigh that as a whole. \nWhen we do that, it seems to me the Department of Defense portion of \nthis bill makes a very large contribution to national security and the \neffective management of the Department of Defense--including other \nprovisions such as the provision establishing new procedures to protect \nthe military's access to essential frequency spectrum; such as the \nprovision requiring the Department to establish specific budget \nreporting procedures for all funds to combat terrorism, both at home \nand abroad; such as a series of provisions to improve the effectiveness \nand efficiency of health care provided to service men and women under \nthe TRICARE program; such as provisions promoting reform of the \nDepartment of Defense financial management systems; such as the \nprovisions promoting more effective management of the defense \nlaboratories and test and evaluation facilities; such as provisions \nextending the Department's small disadvantaged business goals and its \nmentor-protegee program for small disadvantaged businesses for 3 years.\n  As I indicated, this conference report is really two bills. It is a \nDOD authorization bill, but it is also a reorganization of the entire \nDepartment of Energy nuclear weapons complex. It does the latter in a \nway which is inconsistent with the bill that was passed by the Senate \nby a vote of 96-1 earlier this year, inconsistent in a number of \nimportant ways.\n  It goes beyond anything that has even been considered by the House of \nRepresentatives. While there is a broad consensus that we need to \naddress the management and accountability programs at DOE, particularly \nin the areas of security and counterintelligence, the provisions in \nthis bill could undermine Secretary Richardson's efforts to secure our \nnuclear secrets and make the Department even more difficult to manage \nthan it is today.\n  That is the question we struggle with and that I and a number of the \nmembers of our committee have struggled with, and I know Members of \nthis body are struggling with that as well--the final provisions that \nwere put in the conference report to try to analyze: What is the \ndifference, if any, between these provisions in the conference report \nand the Senate provisions which we adopted to implement the \nsemiautonomous agency recommendation of Senator Rudman?\n  So I wrote a letter to the Congressional Research Service requesting \nan independent assessment of the impact of the conference report on the \nability of the Secretary of Energy to manage the Department's nuclear \nweapons programs. The CRS memorandum prepared in response to my letter \nthis month raises serious questions about the impact of the Department \nof Energy reorganization provisions in this conference report.\n\n  The CRS concluded that the Secretary's authority over the new \nNational Nuclear Security Administration ``may be problematic in view \nof the overall scheme of the proposed legislation.'' For instance, the \nCRS memorandum raises the question about ``whether it is possible, or \ndesirable in practice, to split policy and operations in organizational \nterms''; and asks whether the practice of insulating administration \nstaff offices from departmental staff offices ``effectively vitiate[s] \nthe meaning of the earlier provisions assigning the Secretary full \nauthority and control over any function of the Administration and its \npersonnel.''\n  The CRS memorandum also points out the legislation would permit the \nadministrator of the new National Nuclear Security Agency to \n``establish Administration-specific policies, unless disapproved by the \nSecretary of Energy.'' And the CRS points out that ``This procedure \nreverses the general practice in the departments and to the extent that \nthe Secretary is not the issuing authority, a major tool of management \nand accountability is shifted to a subordinate office.''\n  If this legislation were interpreted, as the CRS indicates it could \nbe interpreted, to undermine the authority of the Secretary, it would \nhave the perverse effect of diffusing responsibility in the Department, \nleaving reporting channels even more ``convoluted, confusing, and \ncontradictory'' than those observed by the Rudman Commission.\n  I supported the Rudman recommendation and still do. The Rudman \nrecommendation recommends a semiautonomous entity inside the Department \nof Energy. But what the CRS report does is raise questions about \nwhether or not this language--which is different from the Senate \nlanguage which was overwhelmingly adopted--in this conference report \ngoes beyond semiautonomous.\n\n[[Page S11114]]\n\n  None of the models of a semiautonomous agency cited by the Rudman \nCommission in its report--the National Reconnaissance Office; the \nNational Security Agency; the Defense Advanced Research Projects \nAgency, or DARPA; or the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA--limit the authority of the Cabinet Secretary \nresponsible for the agency as much as these provisions seem to do.\n  However, the ambiguities in this bill may leave open another choice. \nWe are dealing with ambiguities in language. So we have to look at: Are \nthere other interpretations, other choices which may be available in \nlight of these ambiguities?\n  In particular, there is language which can be construed to give \nauthority to the Secretary which might allow him to run this agency, \ncalled the Department of Energy, in a way which will provide \naccountability in the Secretary because he is the one to whom we must \nlook to be accountable. We want him to be able to run the agency.\n  That is why it is called a semiautonomous entity in the Rudman \nreport. They do not recommend an autonomous entity. They recommend a \nsemiautonomous entity. They cite models, the ones I have just \nindicated, which allow the Secretary of the agency in question to run \nhis agency, including all parts of it, including the semiautonomous \nparts.\n  There is language in this conference report which remains which does \npoint towards the ability of the Secretary to run his entire agency, to \nbe accountable and responsible for it.\n\n  I want to just read some of that language.\n  For instance, the new administration--this new entity--is established \n``within the Department of Energy'', and is therefore subject to the \ndirection and control of the Secretary.\n  The Secretary of Energy, in this conference report--not the head of \nthe new entity, the under secretary, but the Secretary of Energy--is \nresponsible for ``developing the security, counterintelligence, and \nintelligence policies of the Department'' under section 214.\n  For instance, the Department's counterintelligence chief, not his \nsubordinate in the new administration, is ``responsible for \nestablishing policy for counterintelligence programs and activities at \nDepartment facilities in order to reduce the threat of disclosure or \nloss of classified and other sensitive information at such facilities'' \nunder section 215.\n  Another example of language pointing toward accountability in the \nSecretary--where we want it, ultimately, in this Department or any \nDepartment--is that the Secretary of Energy, not the new under \nsecretary but the Secretary of Energy himself, is given continuing \nresponsibility for the security and counterintelligence problems within \nthe Department's nuclear energy defense programs by sections 3150, \n3152, 3154, and 3164 of the bill.\n  Other language which may give some comfort to those of us who are \nconcerned about the diffusion of accountability in this new language--\nnot adopted by the Senate, not adopted by the House, but put into the \nconference report--other language which may hopefully give some comfort \nis that the Secretary of Energy, not the new under secretary, is given \nthe responsibility for appointing the Chief of Defense Nuclear \nCounterintelligence and the Chief of Defense Nuclear Security within \nthe new administration.\n  I think one can fairly argue that the authority to establish \nDepartment-wide policies carries with it the authority to ensure that \nsuch policies are carried out. On that basis and on the basis of these \nother provisions I have just quoted, this legislation could be \ninterpreted to give the Secretary of Energy continuing authority to \nmanage the Department, including the authority to direct and control \nthe new National Nuclear Security Administration.\n  So while it is unfortunate that this bill has confused reporting \nrelationships and blurred lines of authority, I believe a strong \nSecretary of Energy may be able to overcome these difficulties and \naddress the Department's problems in an effective manner. He should not \nhave to be confronted with these difficulties, but he may be able to \novercome them. We will need to continually reexamine these provisions \nand modify them as appropriate to ensure that the Secretary and the \nDepartment have the tools they need to ensure the security of our \nnuclear deterrent.\n  The National Association of Attorneys General has raised an important \nconcern about this legislation. In two letters dated September 3, 1999, \nto the President and the congressional leadership, the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General states that the DOE reorganization \nprovisions in this bill ``would weaken the existing internal and \nexternal oversight structure for DOE's environment, safety, and health \noperations.''\n  Here again, the Secretary of Energy may be able to overcome the \nambiguities in the bill and exercise strong independent oversight over \nthe new administration, ensuring that applicable laws, regulations, and \nagreements protecting health, safety, and the environment continue to \nbe enforced. This legislation then may be ratified by the courts \nconsistent with its intent--which we put in the Senate version of this \nbill--to make no change to existing substantive and procedural \nmechanisms for enforcing such laws, regulations, and agreements.\n  I wish these flawed DOE reorganization provisions had not been added \nin conference. As a matter of fact, adding extraneous material in this \nway is a dubious legislative practice that too often results in unsound \nlegislation. The concerns raised by attorneys general should serve as a \nreminder to all of us of the hazards of trying to legislate on complex \nissues in a conference committee convened to deliberate on unrelated \nmatters.\n  I am going to vote for this bill because I believe it is possible \nthat the DOE reorganization provisions can be interpreted in a manner \nthat will permit the sound management of the Department of Energy and \nbecause the provisions are a part of what is otherwise a good bill. If \nthe DOE reorganization mandated by this bill proves to create problems, \nwe will then have to consider solutions to those problems in the \nfuture. We are going to need to monitor this bill closely as it is \nimplemented.\n  We don't know if the President will or will not veto this bill. \nPerhaps the President indicated to my good friend from Virginia last \nnight at the meeting. But we do not have any indication as to whether \nor not the President will veto this bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will allow me to make clear \nfor the Record, while I addressed the President about the importance of \nthe bill as a courtesy to him, I never tried to elicit that response. \nBut I certainly left that meeting with the impression, No. 1, that the \nPresident has given a lot of study to the issues that my distinguished \ngood friend and colleague, Senator Levin, has raised tonight. He is \ncarefully briefed on it. His questions were very precise on it.\n  Senator Domenici and I provided responses which I hope were quite \ninformative to the President. But I in no way wish to indicate that he \nlikewise indicated what he would do.\n  I certainly have the impression from that meeting and from everything \nelse I gained that there is not as much fervor down at the White House \nfor a veto, and I am confident that Secretary Cohen likewise \ncontributed his views to the President on this. I am confident he urged \nthe President to sign. He is the principal Cabinet officer involved.\n  With regard to Secretary Richardson, he has always been, I think, \nwell received by the Members up here who have listened to his overtures \non this question. I spoke with him about 10 days ago in my office. I \ntold him at that time precisely what the Senator from Michigan just \nsaid--that I thought, to the extent there are ambiguities, together \nwith valuable legal counsel--and I also mentioned this to the President \nlast night--I am confident he can run this Department. If he has the \ndesire and the commitment to do so, he can operate this Department. The \nConstitution provides for separate branches of Government. The \nPresident has the administration of the executive branch. He delegates \ncertain responsibilities to his Cabinet officers. It was not the \nintention of the Congress to take away from the President's authority.\n\n  I am very pleased, if I may say to the President and to the Senator \nfrom\n\n[[Page S11115]]\n\nMichigan, that I learned tonight the Senator from Michigan will vote in \nfavor of this bill. I was terribly concerned that at the time he \ncouldn't sign the conference report. But he, too, has fought the good \nbattle in terms of his views about this reauthorization. I take those \nto heart.\n  Let us look at this in a positive light--that this Secretary will \ntake the reins and look at this statute. It challenges him to run a \nstrong Department. It is my expectation that he will do it and that in \na period of reasonable time he will have proven not only to his \nDepartment but to all of us in the executive branch and the legislative \nbranch that this can be done.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and my colleague, because I value our work \nand relationship. We came to the Senate together 21 years ago. We have \nbeen through many struggles. And for the foreseeable future we have \ncertainly another year to work together to devise a bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from Virginia. We are, indeed, not \nonly old colleagues but dear friends.\n  Mr. President, as I indicated, I will be voting for this bill \ntomorrow. I believe it is again possible that the reorganization \nprovisions of the Department of Energy can be interpreted in a manner \nthat will permit the Department to be managed soundly. It is my hope \nthat that will be the case.\n  If in fact the President decides to veto this matter--we do not know \nwhat he will do--then obviously I, for one, will be willing to consider \nany arguments and reasoning that might be proposed. But I have no \nreason to know that that is forthcoming. We just have no indication \nthat in fact a veto is or is not forthcoming. We simply have to do what \nwe, in our best judgment, believe is best. Of course, we are always \nwilling to consider any thoughts or reasoning of the President if and \nwhen a veto message is received.\n  Finally, I want to again thank our good chairman. He has put together \na bill with provisions in it that are going to make a real difference \nfor the men and women in our military. As the ranking member of this \ncommittee, I have worked very closely with him. Republicans and \nDemocrats on this committee don't always agree, but we surely agreed on \nthe end point, which is that the well-being of the men and women in our \nmilitary and the security of this country has to be first and foremost. \nIt is not a partisan issue. The constructive leadership which our \nchairman has always provided on so many issues has been part of a great \ntradition of the Armed Services Committee.\n  As he rightfully points out, our staffs are essential to that \ncontribution. We all strive to make a bipartisan contribution to the \nsecurity of this Nation. We succeed at times. I am sure we don't \nsucceed at other times, as hard as we try. But we would not succeed to \nthe extent we do but for the staffs who also work on a bipartisan \nbasis. Dave Lyles, Les Brownlee, and all of our staff under their \nleadership are essential to the successes that we have.\n\n  I, like the chairman, want to thank our subcommittee chairman and all \nthe members of our committee for their work during the past year, \nstarting with the subcommittee hearings this spring and the good work \nin this bill that is aimed at improving the quality of life for men and \nwomen in the military. Their readiness and their support will indeed \nhave that impact and will have that positive effect we so fervently \nwish for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague for \nthese many years. It is a personal privilege and a pleasure to work \nwith him. He represents so many of the values and traditions which make \nthis institution great. I know full well his dedication to the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces. I have never known a Senator who more \nconscientiously goes into every issue--I don't want to use the word \n``agonizes,'' but can he give me a better word?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wish I could.\n  Mr. WARNER. To explain the endless hours in which he and his staff go \nover the most minute details. Indeed, we owe a great debt of gratitude \nto our staff.\n  I would like to make one recommendation to my good friend from \nMichigan. You need a deputy director. I have Judith Ansley. If the \nSenator from Michigan had a magnificent deputy director like her to \nhelp him curtail the top hands--Les Brownlee and David Lyles--it would \nbe great, and I would see to it that the Senator got a little money \nfrom the budget for that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I was just going to say that sounds like an invitation to \na budget request, and tomorrow morning we will surely try to have one \non the chairman's desk.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have done our job.\n  I can't tell the Senator from Michigan the great respect that I have \nfor him. I know how difficult this provision on the Energy \nreorganization has been. It is on our bill for valid reasons. We have \nsomewhere between two-thirds and 70 percent of the funds that go into \nthat Department under our overview. We do careful overview on the \nweapons program.\n  But the fact that the Senator from Michigan has announced tonight \nthat he will support that bill is very important. I think it will be \nimportant to the President as he carefully deliberates such petitions \nas may be before him by the Secretary of Energy and others on this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I think we have concluded. I thank the Chair and the \nstaff of the Senate.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Conference \nReport on S. 1059, the National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal \nYear 2000. As the Chairman Emeritus of the Armed Services Committee, I \nknow the challenges faced by Chairman Warner in reaching a consensus \nbetween the House and the Senate on the National Defense Authorization \nBill. Therefore, I congratulate the Chairman on his leadership and his \ntenacity on behalf of our national security and the men and women who \nhave dedicated themselves to protecting our Nation. This is a superb \nbill that provides for a strong national defense, and, more \nimportantly, includes significant provisions to provide for the welfare \nof our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines and their families.\n  Mr. President, first and foremost, the Conference Report increases \nthe President's budget request by more than $8.0 billion. This increase \nis based on last September's testimony by our most senior military \nleaders who identified a need for an additional $18.5 billion to \nresolve the most critical readiness issues. Although the increase \nprovided for in the conference report is still short of the Chiefs' \nidentified needs, it, coupled with other improvements in the report, \nwill provide the necessary resources to resolve the most critical \nreadiness issues.\n  Following closely in importance to the readiness funding are the \nprovisions that improve the quality of life and welfare of our military \npersonnel. They include a 4.8 percent pay raise, reform of the military \npay tables, and annual military pay raises one-half percent above the \nannual increases in the Employment Cost Index. Additionally, the \nconference report makes major changes to the retirement system and \nallows both active and reserve component personnel to participate in \nthe same Thrift Savings Plan that is available to other federal \nemployees. These provisions are important steps toward increasing \nretention and resolving the current recruiting crisis.\n  Mr. President, the Nation owes its military personnel the best it can \nprovide. In these times between crisis, the Nation tends to forget \ntheir sacrifices and contributions to the Nation's security. During the \nSeptember 1998 hearing, General Shelton eloquently described the \nquality and service of our military personnel when he stated:\n\n       It is the quality of the men and women who serve that sets \n     the U.S. military apart from all potential adversaries. These \n     talented people are the ones who won the Cold War and ensured \n     our victory in Operation Desert Storm. These dedicated \n     professionals make it possible for the United States to \n     accomplish the many missions we are called on to perform \n     around the world every single day.\n\n  The conference report recognizes these contributions.\n  Mr. President, I am confident that everyone in this Chamber will \nagree that the security issues in the Department of Energy identified \nby the various congressional committees, the Cox Committee and the \nPresident's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, chaired by our former \ncolleague Senator Rudman, mandated measures to improve\n\n[[Page S11116]]\n\nthe management of the nuclear weapons complex. The Conference Report \ndirects the establishment of the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration, a semi-autonomous agency within the Department of \nEnergy. This agency would be responsible for nuclear weapons programs \nand the security, counterintelligence, and intelligence as they relate \nto the weapons programs. Contrary to what some allege, the agency would \nbe under the direct control of the Secretary of Energy and he would \nretain ultimate responsibility for what the Administration does or \nfails to do.\n  Mr. President, this is a prudent step that is long overdue. It will \nstreamline the bureaucracy and the process which ensures the \nreliability of our nuclear weapons. More importantly, it will provide \nthe security oversight that will preclude any further loss of sensitive \nnuclear information. This is a sound provision that will assist the \nSecretary of the Energy in carrying out his critical national security \nrole.\n  Mr. President, this is a good Conference Report that reflects the \ndedication and leadership of Chairman Warner, Senator Levin, Chairman \nSpence, Representative Skelton and all the conferees. It provides for \nthe critical national security needs of our Nation and especially for \nthe needs of the men and women who proudly wear the uniforms of our \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. I urge its adoption and strong \nsupport.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Defense \nauthorization conference report. The debate on this bill comes at time \nwhen our nation faces a host of new national security challenges, like \nthe growing missile threat, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, \nterrorism, potential information warfare attacks on our critical \ninfrastructure, and aggressive espionage directed at our nuclear \nlaboratories.\n  It also comes at a time when our armed forces are facing critical \nshortfalls in readiness and recruitment and retention. Our men and \nwomen in uniform are stretched to the limit, with deployments around \nthe globe to places such as Kosovo, Bosnia, East Timor, the Persian \nGulf, the Sinai Peninsula, South Korea, and the list goes on and on.\n  Senator Warner and his colleagues on the Armed Services Committee \nhave produced a good bill that begins to address some of these \nproblems.\n  First, the bill authorizes a total of $288.8 billion for DoD and the \nnational security programs at the Energy Department--$8.3 billion more \nthan the President's request. It also increases funding for readiness \nby $1.5 billion and procurement by $3 billion above the President's \nrequest.\n  The bill provides a 4.8% pay raise for our men and women in uniform, \nreforms the military pay tables, and improves the retirement system, \nwhich should help with recruitment and retention problems.\n  It authorizes $403 million over the President's request for missile \ndefense, $150 million more than requested for the protection of DoD's \ncomputer networks, and authorizes and fully funds 17 new National Guard \nrapid response teams to respond to terrorist attacks in the U.S.--12 \nmore than requested by the Administration.\n  And finally, this bill contains a series of provisions to reorganize \nthe Department of Energy in order to improve security and \ncounterintelligence. Over the past few months, we have all heard the \nsobering news about how our nation's security has been damaged by \nChina's theft of America's most sensitive secrets. Earlier this year, \nthe declassified version of the bipartisan Cox Committee report was \nreleased, which unanimously concluded that China stole classified \ninformation on every nuclear warhead currently in the U.S. arsenal, as \nwell as the neutron bomb--literally, the crown jewels of our nuclear \nstockpile.\n  An interagency group established by CIA Director Tenet, with \nrepresentatives from each of the U.S. intelligence agencies, also \nprepared a damage assessment, which unanimously concluded that ``China \nobtained through espionage classified U.S. nuclear weapons \ninformation,'' including ``design information on several modern U.S. \nnuclear reentry vehicles,'' and ``information on a variety of U.S. \nweapon design concepts and weaponization features.''\n  After the effects of China's espionage came to light, the President \nasked his Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, led by former Senator \nRudman, to look into the matter. The board released its findings in \nJune, calling for sweeping organizational reform of DOE to address what \nit described as ``the worst security record on secrecy'' that the panel \nmembers ``have ever encountered.''\n  The bipartisan panel cited as the root cause of DOE's poor security \nrecord ``organizational disarray, managerial neglect, and a culture of \narrogance. . . [which] conspired to create an espionage scandal waiting \nto happen.'' Terrible problems were uncovered during the panel's \ninvestigation. For example, employees at nuclear facilities compared \ntheir computer systems to automatic teller machines allowing top secret \nwithdrawals at our nation's expense.\n  The Rudman report pulled no punches, noting that, ``The Department of \nEnergy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven it is incapable \nof reforming itself. . . The long traditional and effective method of \nentrenched DOE and lab bureaucrats is to defeat security reform \ninitiatives by waiting them out.''\n  Although Energy Secretary Richardson announced several new \ninitiatives to change management and procedures at DOE, the \nPresidential panel's report states, ``we seriously doubt that his \ninitiatives will achieve lasting success,'' and notes, ``moreover, the \nRichardson initiatives simply do not go far enough.'' It is because of \nthese problems that the Presidential panel recommended that Congress \nact to reorganize the Department by statute, so that the bureaucracy \ncould not simply wait out another Secretary of Energy.\n  In response to the reports of security problems at our nuclear \nfacilities, Senator Domenici, Senator Murkowski, and I drafted \nlegislation to implement the recommendations of the Rudman panel. Our \nlegislation gathered all the parts of our nuclear weapons programs \nunder one semi-autonomous agency within DOE, with clear lines of \nauthority, responsibility, and accountability, with one person in \ncharge, called the Administrator, who will continue to report to the \nEnergy Secretary. Our legislation, which was offered as an amendment to \nthe intelligence authorization bill, was passed by the Senate on July \n21st by an overwhelming vote of 96 to 1. I want to thank Senator Warner \nfor working with us to include this legislation in the Defense \nAuthorization Conference Report.\n  A semiautonomous agency, created by statute, is the only way we are \ngoing to solve the problems with DOE's management of the nuclear \nweapons complex, that are long-standing, systemic, and go to the very \nheart of the way the Department is managed, structured, and organized. \nTo begin with, this semi-autonomous agency will establish a clear \nmission for the organization, by separating the management of the \nnuclear weapons programs at DOE from the rest of the Department that is \nresponsible for a broad range of unrelated tasks like setting energy \nefficiency standards for refrigerators. The provisions of the \nConference Report also establish a clear chain of command for our \nnuclear weapons programs and facilities to establish accountability--\nsomething that the Rudman report said was ``spread so thinly and \nerratically [at DOE] that it is now almost impossible to find.''\n  Since the conference report was filed in August, some opponents of \nDOE reorganization have charged that this legislation would exempt the \nnew semi-autonomous agency from environmental and safety laws and \nregulations--a charge which is simply false. Section 3261 of the bill, \nwhich I would note is identical to the language in the amendment passed \nby the Senate 96 to 1, states, ``The Administrator shall ensure that \nthe Administration complies with all applicable environmental, safety, \nand health statutes and substantive requirements.'' Furthermore, \nsection 3261 states, ``Nothing in this title shall diminish the \nauthority of the Secretary of Energy to ascertain and ensure that such \ncompliance occurs.''\n  I would also note, that section 3211, which establishes the mission \nof the new agency clearly states, ``In carrying out the mission of the \nAdministration,\n\n[[Page S11117]]\n\nthe Administrator shall ensure that all operations and activities of \nthe Administration are consistent with the principles of protecting the \nenvironment and safeguarding the safety and health of the public and of \nthe workforce of the Administration.''\n  Some critics have also falsely charged that this legislation would \nnarrow or supercede existing waiver of sovereign immunity agreements \nwith the states and undercut the Federal Facility and Compliance Act, \nwhich clarified that states have regulatory authority over hazardous \nwaste management and clean-up. Mr. President, I would point out that \nFederal Facility Compliance Agreements are based on waivers of \nsovereign immunity established under applicable federal environmental \nstatutes, which are not affected by this bill. As section 3296 makes \nclear, ``unless otherwise provided in this title, all provisions of law \nand regulations in effect immediately before the effective date of this \ntitle. . . shall continue to apply to the corresponding functions of \nthe Administration.''\n  It is well past time to correct the chronic security problems at our \nnuclear facilities. Earlier this year, four committee's in the Senate \nheld six hearings specifically on the legislation Senator Domenici, \nSenator Murkowski, and I proposed. The time has come to act. Great harm \nto our nation's security has already been done, and if we want to \nprevent further damage, we must act to reform the way we manage our \nnuclear weapons programs and facilities to create accountability and \nresponsibility. Our most fundamental duty as Senators is to protect the \nsafety and security of the American people. They deserve no less than \nour best in this regard. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of \nthis important bill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport on the Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2000. The \nconference report includes provisions to address the chronic security \nproblems at the Department of Energy nuclear weapons laboratories.\n  We need to make major organizational changes to the Department of \nEnergy in order to protect the national security--to keep our nuclear \nsecrets from falling into the wrong hands. There is no question that \nthe U.S. has suffered a major loss of our nuclear secrets. According to \nthe House Select Committee's report, the Chinese have succeeded in \nstealing critical information on all of our most advanced nuclear \nweapons. I repeat: The House report shows that we lost critical \ninformation on all of our advanced nuclear weapons! That is \nunacceptable!\n  The extensive Senate hearing record--in both open and closed meetings \nheld by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Armed Services \nCommittee, the Intelligence Committee and the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee--makes clear that we lost these secrets due to poor \nmanagement by the top levels of the Department of Energy--which led to \nlax security and a lack of accountability and responsibility.\n  Let me quote from the report of the President's foreign intelligence \nadvisory board--the Rudman report--titled ``Science at its best: \nSecurity at its worst.''\n\n       Organizational disarray, managerial neglect, and a culture \n     of arrogance--both at DOE headquarters and the labs \n     themselves--conspired to create an espionage scandal waiting \n     to happen.\n       The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy \n     that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself.\n       Accountability at DOE has been spread so thinly and \n     erratically that it is now almost impossible to find.\n       Never have the members of the Special Investigative Panel \n     witnessed a bureaucratic culture so thoroughly saturated with \n     cynicism and disregard for authority.\n       Never before has this panel found such a cavalier attitude \n     toward one of the most serious responsibilities in the \n     federal government--control of the design information \n     relating to nuclear weapons.\n       Never before has the panel found an agency with the \n     bureaucratic insolence to dispute, delay, and resist \n     implementation of a Presidential directive on security.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that additional excerpts from the Rudman \nreport be printed in the Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See Exhibit 1.]\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Despite this damming criticism by the President's own \nforeign intelligence advisory board to date not a single high level \nbureaucrat at DOE--or the FBI or the Justice Department, for that \nmatter--has been removed, demoted or disciplined over this massive \nfailure. Only a very few low-level DOE employees have suffered--\nincluding the person who first blew the whistle.\n  The problem is clear. The question is: Do we want this to continue, \nor are we going to fix the problem?\n  One thing we can not discuss in open session, is the extent of this \nproblem. We can say that this problem is much more extensive than has \nbeen reported. We can also say that it is a continuing problem. And we \ncan say that it is not just espionage by China, it is also espionage by \nother countries that we must stop.\n  The Administration is against fixing the problem; DOE Secretary \nRichardson is opposed to the provisions Conference Report. When this \nwas last debated in the Senate, Secretary Richardson sent two letters \nthreatening veto by the President--and he continues to voice his \nopposition to this legislation. However, the President's own \nindependent and nonpartisan Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board agrees \nwith our legislative solution--creating a semi-autonomous agency within \nDOE is the way to fix the problem.\n  Again, let me quote from the Rudman report:\n\n       The panel is convinced that real and lasting security and \n     counterintelligence reform at the weapons labs is simply \n     unworkable within DOE's current structure and culture.\n       To achieve the kind of protection that these sensitive labs \n     must have, they and their functions must have their own \n     autonomous operational structure free of all the other \n     obligations imposed by DOE management.\n\n  Under the current DOE organization structure everyone is in charge, \nbut no one is responsible--no one is accountable. This legislation \nchanges that. This legislation establishes accountability and \nresponsibility at the Department of Energy. It does so by establishing \na new semi-autonomous ``National Nuclear Security Administration'' \ninside the Department of Energy.\n  The Nuclear Security Administration will be a self-contained \norganization that will be fully in charge of all aspects of our nuclear \nweapons program--and fully accountable.\n  This new agency will be headed up by a new Under Secretary of Energy. \nThe new Under Secretary will be responsible for all aspects of our \nnuclear weapons program, including the DOE weapons labs. If there is a \nproblem in the future we will know who to point the finger at--a single \nagency with a single person heading it in charge of all aspects of the \nnuclear weapons program.\n  As further evidence for the need for this legislation, I would like \nto quote the testimony of Mr. Vic Reis, the former Assistant Secretary \nof Energy for Defense Programs, just before he was forced out by \nSecretary Richardson for disagreeing with the Secretary's position on \nthe need to create a semi-autonomous agency. Mr. Reis said:\n\n       You may recall at a previous hearing, Mr. Chairman, you \n     noticed me in the audience and you asked for my opinion as to \n     who, or what was to blame for the security issues at the \n     national laboratories. I responded that I didn't think you \n     would find any one individual to blame, but that the \n     organizational structure of the DOE was so flawed that \n     security lapses are almost inevitable.\n       The root cause of the difficulties at DOE is simply that \n     DOE has too many disparate missions to be managed effectively \n     as a coherent organization. The price of gasoline, \n     refrigerator standards, Quarks, nuclear cleanup and nuclear \n     weapons just don't come together naturally.\n       Because of all this multilayered cross-cutting, there is no \n     one accountable for the operation of any part of the \n     organization except the Secretary, and no Secretary has the \n     time to lead the whole thing effectively. By setting up a \n     semi-autonomous agency, many of these problems go away.\n\n  The way to stop espionage at the DOE laboratories then is to vote for \nthe conference report.\n  Before I yield the floor I want to mention one element of DOE's \ndefense programs that we do not reorganize, although it is made part of \nthe new National Nuclear Security Administration. That is the Naval \nNuclear Propulsion Program.\n  The Conference report language was very carefully and specifically \ncrafted\n\n[[Page S11118]]\n\nto ensure that the organization, responsibilities and authorities of \nthe Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program are not diminished or otherwise \ncompromised. The Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program, referred to as \n``Naval Reactors'' in the Department of Energy, has long been a model \nof excellence, efficiency and integrity. Naval Reactors has provided \nsafe, reliable, long-lived and militarily-effective nuclear propulsion \nplants for our Nation since U.S.S. Nautilus went to sea in 1955. These \nnuclear propulsion plants are found in our largest ships, the Nimitz \nclass nuclear aircraft carriers with over 5,500 personnel on board. \nThey are also found in one of our smallest ships, the NR-1 deep-\nsubmergence research and ocean engineering vehicle with a crew of only \nfive to ten. These nuclear propulsion plants also are crucial to the \nability of our Nation's exceptional ballistic missile and attack \nsubmarine fleets to perform their national security missions.\n  Under the conference report, Naval Reactors will continue to maintain \nclear, total responsibility and accountability for all aspects of Naval \nnuclear propulsion, including design, construction, operation, operator \ntraining, maintenance, refueling, and ultimate disposal, plus \nassociated radiological control, safety, environmental and health \nmatters, and program administration. The Program's structure will \ncontinue to include roles within both the Navy and the DOE, with direct \naccess to the Secretaries of Navy and Energy. The success of the \nProgram is due in part to its simple, enduring, and focused structure \nset forth in Public Law 98-525, which is not changed by the Conference \nReport.\n  Also of great importance are the Program's clear and simplified lines \nof authority, and the culture of excellence in technical work, as well \nas managerial, fiscal, and security matters. These too are unaffected \nby the Conference Report.\n  With fifty-one years of unparalleled success, Naval Reactors has \namassed a record that reflects the wisdom of its structure, policies, \nand practices. Naval nuclear propulsion plants have safely steamed over \n117 million miles--over 5,000 reactor-years of safe operations. \nMoreover, there has never been a naval reactor accident, or any release \nof radioactivity that has had a significant effect on the public or \nenvironment.\n  For these reasons, the Conference Report makes it clear that this \nexceptional national asset will in no way be hindered from maintaining \nits record of excellence. The language creating the new National \nNuclear Security Administration in the Department of Energy in no way \nchanges the management or operations of Naval Reactors. I am confident \nNaval Reactors will remain a technical organization unequaled in \naccomplishment throughout the world, and a crown jewel in our Nation's \nsecurity.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Seclected excerpts from the President's Foreign \n     Intelligence Advisory Board report: Science at its Best; \n     Security at its Worst: A Report on Security Problems at the \n     U.S. Department of Energy.\n\n\n                           findings (pp. 1-6)\n\n       As the repository of America's most advanced know-how in \n     nuclear and related armaments and the home of some of \n     America's finest scientific minds, these labs have been and \n     will continue to be a major target of foreign intelligence \n     services, friendly as well as hostile. p.1\n       More than 25 years worth or reports, studies and formal \n     inquiries--by executive branch agencies, Congress, \n     independent panels, and even DOE itself--have identified a \n     multitude of chronic security and counterintelligence \n     problems at all of the weapons labs. p.2\n       --Critical security flaws . . . have been cited for \n     immediate attention and resolution . . . over and over and \n     over . . . ad nauseam.\n       The open-source information alone on the weapons \n     laboratories overwhelmingly supports a troubling conclusion: \n     their security and counterintelligence operations have been \n     seriously hobbled and relegated to low-priority status for \n     decades. p.2\n       --The DOE and its weapons labs have been Pollyannaish. The \n     predominant attitude toward security and counterintelligence \n     among many DOE and lab managers has ranged from half-hearted, \n     grudging accommodation to smug disregard. Thus the panel is \n     convinced that the potential for major leaks and thefts of \n     sensitive information and material has been substantial.\n       Organizational disarray, managerial neglect, and a culture \n     of arrogance--both at DOE headquarters and the labs \n     themselves--conspired to create an espionage scandal waiting \n     to happen. pp.2-3\n       Among the defects this panel found:\n       Inefficient personnel clearance programs.\n       Loosely controlled and casually monitored programs for \n     thousands of unauthorized foreign scientists and assignees.\n       Feckless systems for control of classified documents, which \n     periodically resulted in thousands of documents being \n     declared lost.\n       Counterintelligence programs with part-time CI officers, \n     who often operated with little experience, minimal budgets, \n     and employed little more than crude ``awareness'' briefings \n     of foreign threats and perfunctory and sporadic debriefings \n     of scientists. . .\n       A lab security management reporting system that led \n     everywhere but to responsible authority.\n       Computer security methods that were naive at best and \n     dangerously irresponsible at worst.\n       --DOE has had a dysfunctional management structure and \n     culture that only occasionally gave proper credence to the \n     need for rigorous security and counterintelligence programs \n     at the weapons labs. For starters, there has been a \n     persisting lack of real leadership and effective management \n     at DOE.\n       The nature of the intelligence-gathering methods used by \n     the People's Republic of China poses a special challenge to \n     the U.S. in general and the weapons labs in particular. p.3\n       Despite widely publicized assertions of wholesale losses of \n     nuclear weapons technology from specific laboratories to \n     particular nations, the factual record in the majority of \n     cases regarding the DOE weapons laboratories supports \n     plausible inferences--but not irrefutable proof--about the \n     source and scope of espionage and the channels through which \n     recipient nations received information. pp.3-4\n       --The actual damage done to U.S. security interests is, at \n     the least, currently unknown; at worst, it may be unknowable.\n       The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy \n     that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself. p.4\n       --Accountability at DOE has been spread so thinly and \n     erratically that it is now almost impossible to find.\n       Reorganization is clearly warranted to resolve that many \n     specific problems with security and counterintelligence in \n     the weapons laboratories, but also to address the lack of \n     accountability that has become endemic throughout the entire \n     Department. p.4\n       --Convoluted, confusing, and often contradictory reporting \n     channels make the relationship between DOE headquarters and \n     the labs, in particular, tense, internecine, and chaotic.\n       The criteria for the selection of Energy Secretaries have \n     been inconsistent in the past. Regardless of the outcome of \n     ongoing or contemplated reforms, the minimum qualifications \n     for an Energy Secretary should include experience in not only \n     energy and scientific issues, but national security and \n     intelligence issues as well. p. 5\n       DOE cannot be fixed with a single legislative act: \n     management must follow mandate. The research functions of the \n     labs are vital to the nation's long term interest, and \n     instituting effective gates between weapons and nonweapons \n     research functions will require both disinterested scientific \n     expertise, judicious decision making, and considerable \n     political finesse. p. 5\n       --Thus both Congress and the Executive Branch . . . should \n     be prepared to monitor the progress of the Department's \n     reforms for years to come.\n       The Foreign Visitor's and Assignments Program has been and \n     should continue to be a valuable contribution to the \n     scientific and technological progress of the nation. p. 5\n       --That said, DOE clearly requires measures to ensure that \n     legitimate use of the research laboratories for scientific \n     collaboration is not an open door to foreign espionage \n     agents.\n       In commenting on security issues at DOE, we believe that \n     both Congressional and Executive branch leaders have resorted \n     to simplification and hyperbole in the past few months. The \n     panel found neither the dramatic damage assessments nor the \n     categorical reassurances of the Department's advocates to be \n     wholly substantiated. pp. 5-6\n       --However, the Board is extremely skeptical that any reform \n     effort, no matter how well-intentioned, well-designed, and \n     effectively applied, will gain more than a toehold at DOE, \n     given its labyrinthine management structure, fractious and \n     arrogant culture, and the fast-approaching reality of another \n     transition in DOE leadership. Thus we believe that he has \n     overstated the case when he asserts, as he did several weeks \n     ago, that ``Americans can be reassured: our nation's nuclear \n     secrets are, today, safe and secure.''\n       Fundamental change in DOE's institutional culture--\n     including the ingrained attitudes toward security among \n     personnel of the weapons laboratories--will be just as \n     important as organizational redesign. p. 6\n       --Never have the members of the Special Investigative Panel \n     witnessed a bureaucratic culture so thoroughly saturated with \n     cynicism and disregard for authority. Never before has this \n     panel found such a cavalier attitude toward one of the most \n     serious responsibilities in the federal government--control \n     of the design information relating to nuclear weapons. \n     Particularly egregious have been the failures to enforce \n     cyber-security measures to protect and control important \n     nuclear weapons design information. Never before has the \n     panel found an agency with the bureaucratic insolence to \n     dispute, delay, and resist implementation of a Presidential \n     directive on security, as DOE's bureaucracy tried to do with \n     the Presidential Decision Directive No. 61 in February 1998.\n\n[[Page S11119]]\n\n       The best nuclear weapons expertise in the U.S. government \n     resides at the national weapons labs, and this asset should \n     be better used by the intelligence community. p. 6\n\n\n                       reorganization--pp. 43-52\n\n       The panel is convinced that real and lasting security and \n     counterintelligence reform at the weapons labs is simply \n     unworkable within DOE's current structure and culture. To \n     achieve the kind of protection that these sensitive labs must \n     have, they and their functions must have their own autonomous \n     operational structure free of all the other obligations \n     imposed by DOE management. We strongly believe that this \n     cleaving can be best achieved by constituting a new \n     government agency that is far more mission-focused and \n     bureaucratically streamlined than its antecedent, and devoted \n     principally to nuclear weapons and national security matters. \n     p. 46\n       The agency can be constructed in one of two ways. It could \n     remain an element of DOE but become semi-autonomous--by that \n     we mean strictly segregated from the rest of the Department. \n     This would be accomplished by having the agency director \n     report only to the Secretary of Energy. The agency \n     directorship also could be ``dual-hatted'' as an Under \n     Secretary, thereby investing it with extra bureaucratic clout \n     both inside and outside the Department. p. 46\n       Regardless of the mold in which this agency is cast, it \n     must have staffing and support functions that are autonomous \n     from the remaining operations at DOE. p. 46\n       To ensure its long-term success, this new agency must be \n     established by statute. p. 47\n       Whichever solution Congress enacts, we do feel strongly \n     that the new agency never should be subordinated to the \n     Defense Department. p. 47\n       Specifically, we recommend that the Congress pass and the \n     President sign legislation that: pp. 47-49\n       --Creates a new, semi-autonomous Agency for Nuclear \n     Stewardship (ANS), whose Director will report directly to the \n     Secretary of Energy.\n       --Streamlines the ANS/Weapons Lab management structure by \n     abolishing ties between the weapons labs and all DOE \n     regional, field and site offices, and all contractor \n     intermediaries.\n       --Mandates that the Director/ANS be appointed by the \n     President with the consent of the Senate and, ideally, have \n     an extensive background in national security, organizational \n     management, and appropriate technical fields.\n       --Stems the historical ``revolving door'' and management \n     expertise problems at DOE. . . .\n       --Ensures effective administration of safeguards, security, \n     and counterintelligence at all the weapons labs and plants by \n     creating a coherent security/CI structure within the new \n     agency.\n       --Abolishes the Office of Energy Intelligence.\n       --Shifts the balance of analytic billets . . . to bolster \n     intelligence community technical expertise on nuclear \n     matters.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President I rise to add my voice to the support of \nthe Defense authorization bill that we soon vote on.\n  It has been my honor this year to serve as the Chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee's new subcommittee on Emerging Threats and \nCapabilities. The chairman wisely established this subcommittee to \nprovide a focus on the Department of Defense's efforts to counter new \nand emerging threats to vital national security interests.\n  This subcommittee has oversight over such threats as the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, international terrorism \ndirected at U.S. targets both at home and abroad, information warfare, \nand narco-trafficking. In addition, the subcommittee has budgetary \noversight of the defense science and technology program--which will \nprovide for the development of the technology necessary for the U.S. \nmilitary to meet the challenges of the 21st century.\n  A key element of the subcommittee's responsibilities is the changing \nrole of the U.S. military in the new threat environment, with an \nexamination of emerging operational concepts and non-traditional \nmilitary operations. In this connection, the subcommittee has oversight \nof the procurement and R programs of the Special Operations Command.\n  I would like to briefly highlight the initiatives included in this \nbill to address emerging threats and the future capabilities of our \narmed forces:\n  Protection of our homeland and our critical information \ninfrastructure are two of the most serious challenges facing our Nation \ntoday. In the area of Counter-Terrorism, the bill includes full funding \nfor the five Rapid Assessment and Initial Detection (RAID) teams \nrequested by the administration, and an increase of $107 million to \nprovide a total of 17 additional RAID teams in fiscal year 2000. We \nrequired the Department to establish specific budget reporting \nprocedures for its combating terrorism program. This will give the \nprogram the focus and visibility it deserves while providing Congress \nwith the information it requires to conduct thorough oversight over the \nDepartment's efforts to combat the threat of terrorism attack both \ninside and outside the U.S.\n  The bill includes a $150 million Information Assurance Initiative to \nstrengthen the defense information assurance program, enhance oversight \nand improve organizational structure. This initiative will also provide \na testbed to plan and conduct simulations, exercises and experiments \nagainst information warfare threats, and allow the Department to \ninteract with civil and commercial organizations. The provision \nencourages the Secretary of Defense to strike an appropriate balance in \naddressing threats to the defense information infrastructure while at \nthe same time recognizing that DOD has a role to play in protecting \ncritical infrastructures outside the DOD.\n  In the area of nonproliferation, we have authorized full funding for \nthe Cooperative Threat Reduction Program to accelerate the \ndismantlement of the former Soviet Union strategic offensive arms that \nthreaten the U.S. And for the DoE programs--Initiatives for \nProliferation Prevention and the Nuclear Cities Initiative--we have \nauthorized an increase of $5.0 million over the FY99 funding levels and \nhave recommended several initiatives to enhance the overall management \nof these programs.\n  We have included in the bill a legislative package to strengthen the \ndefense science and technology program. This legislation will ensure \nthat the science and technology program is threat-based and that \ninvestments are tied to future warfighting needs. The legislation is \nalso aimed at promoting innovation in laboratories and improving the \nefficiency of these RDT operations.\n  Other budgetary highlights include: a $271 million increase to the \ndefense science and technology budget request; an additional $10.0 \nmillion for Joint Experimentation exercises; $14.0 million in targeted \nincreases in the Chemical and Biological Defense Program to advance \nresearch in chemical and biological agent detector technologies and \nprocurement; and an additional $164.7 million to meet unfunded \nrequirements of the Special Operations Forces.\n  Although I have highlighted some of the key successes of the Emerging \nThreats and Capabilities subcommittee, I am very proud of the total \npackage we are voting on today. I think we have done an excellent first \nstep in helping the men and women in the military receive fair \ncompensation for their sacrifice for this nation.\n  I thank the Chairman for his vital and impressive leadership this \nyear, along with the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, and the \nmajority staff. I urge my colleagues to support the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President I rise today to signal my \nstrong support for the fiscal year 2000 Defense Authorization Act and \nconference report. I would also like to publicly thank Chairman Warner \nfor his leadership, wisdom, and commitment to doing what is right for \nAmerica as chairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, and chairman of the \nStrategic Forces Subcommittee, I have a strong interest in the state of \nour Armed Forces, and the needs of its people.\n  Under the present administration, the Defense budget has declined by \n40 percent since the end of the cold war, and total personnel strength \nhas been cut by 30 percent. At this same time, this administration has \nalso increased the military's deployment rate by 300 percent.\n  There are very few businesses in this country who could survive a 40 \npercent budget cut, and 30 percent personnel cut while still meeting a \n300 percent increase in production. But that's what we have asked of \nour men and women in uniform--and they have delivered every single \ntime. The time is long overdue for us to give something back--to stop \nthe hemmorrhaging--to give them the money the need, the equipment they \nneed, the resources\n\n[[Page S11120]]\n\nthey need, and most importantly the people they need. We still have a \nlong way to go, but this authorization bill is the first step in the \nright direction--the first of many I will continue to fight for.\n  I am extremely proud of the pay package contained in this bill. It \ncontains the largest pay raise since 1982 and will stop the erosion of \na double-digit pay gap that's been growing for 20 years. Restoring \npreviously reduced retirement benefits to their original levels shows a \ncommitment to our veteran's long-term security and the value of a \ncareer of honorable service. These two provisions are critical to \nsolving our recruiting and retention crisis.\n  As chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, I am also extremely \nproud of the strategic provisions in this bill.\n  In written testimony before the Armed Services Committee in February \nof this year, the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lt. Gen. \nHughes, testified in his written statement,\n\n       Weapons of mass destruction and theater missile delivery \n     means has become the greatest direct threat to US forces \n     deployed and engaged worldwide.\n\n  With that critical focus I am proud to announce that this bill \nincludes an increase of $212 million over the President's budget \nrequest for the patriot PAC-3 theater missile defense system, and an \nincrease of $90 million over the President's budget for the Navy \ntheater wide missile defense program.\n  Gen. Dick Myers, Commander of U.S. Space Command, testified before my \nsubcommittee in March that the space-based infrared system [SBIRS] was \nSpace Command's No. 1 priority due to its critical role in missile \nwarning and national missile defense. This bill contains an increase of \n$92 million to speed the deployment of the SBIRS constellation and \ndirectly increase the security of our Nation.\n  As the next decade unfolds, the United States is becoming \nincreasingly reliant on space to meet our national security needs, as \nwell as our daily economic needs. This bill also provides for an \nincrease of $25 million to develop the space maneuver vehicle which \nwill significantly reduce the cost and increase the speed at which we \ncan launch payloads into space. And an increase of $15 million for the \nAir Force and Army's space control technology programs which will be \ncritical to ensuring our freedom of access to space in the next decade.\n  This bill also includes a provision establishing a commission to \nassess U.S. national security space organization and management, to \naddress the critical need to truly focus on spacepower and its role in \nnational security.\n  In response to a thorough review and examination of security problems \nat the Department of Energy's nuclear labs, this conference report also \nincludes legislation to consolidate all national security functions \nunder a single, semi-autonomous agency known as the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration. As demonstrated by the Cox Commission report, \nand the President's own Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, this \nreorganization is crucial to our national security and safeguarding our \nnuclear labs, and has my strongest support.\n  There are many other provisions in this bill that are imperative for \nour troops, and our nation, but I don't have time to discuss them all. \nBut the bottom line is this: our troops deserve the best, and the \nAmerican people deserve the best.\n  This bill represents a huge victory for our troops, but it's only the \nfirst step on a tough road to correcting our long-term readiness \nproblems. The Clinton administration has cut military spending every \nyear since he took office--and turned a deaf ear to the critical \nproblems it has caused. Year after year the administration denied there \nwere any problems and refused to increase spending. Only now that we're \nstarting to come apart at the seams have they admitted there's a \nproblem, and the Joint Chiefs told us in testimony that the \nadministration's plan for fixing it was still $40 billion short. We \nhave added an extra $8 billion in this budget, the first increase in \ndefense spending in more than a decade, but there's still a long way to \ngo. I am committed to our troops and to halting this erosion, and this \nbill is the start.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support this bill, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Warner again for his leadership on \nthis critical issue, and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the fiscal year \n2000 Defense authorization conference report.\n  The bill emerges in the turnmoil of a post-cold-war world--one \ndemanding a U.S. military that can face transnational developments such \nas weapons proliferation, regional tyrants such as Saddam Hussein or \nSlobodan Milosevic, and emerging powers such as China.\n  As a result, the authorization cycle of the last few months allowed \nCongress to bring the Pentagon's budget into alignment with the \nchanging Armed Services on which the nation will rely to deter a broad \nspectrum of global threats to U.S. national security.\n  I caution my colleagues not to confuse the unpredictable nature of \nthese threats with the disappearance of serious global challenges to \nthe security of the United States and its key allies.\n  The former menace of imperial communism has yielded to a less \ndetectable, but still destructive, gallery of aggressors: the cyber-\nterrorist, the rogue dictator, the narcotics lord, and violent \ndissidents throughout the world with ideological resentments against \nthe culture and prosperity of the West.\n  A brief tour of the global horizon furthermore alerts us to the \nongoing requirement for a robust and flexible national defense.\n  The burned and bloodied streets of East Timor warn the United States \nthat the world's fourth most-populous country, guarding the sea lanes \nbetween the Pacific and Indian Oceans, faces an anxious period of \npolitical and military strife.\n  Saddam Hussein still hopes to strangle the Arab-Israeli peace process \nand hold the oil reserves of the Persian Gulf hostage to his lust for \nwarfare.\n  China wants to build a nuclear and naval force to counter the United \nStates and Japan as a major power among the trading states of Western \nAsia.\n  The North Koreans and the Iranians quietly try to siphon weapons of \nmass destruction out of a chaotic Russia. India and Pakistan have \nintensified their grim nuclear standoff, and the rumbling Balkans \nundermine stability and economic development from the Caucuses to the \nMediterranean Basin.\n  The Senate, therefore, should embrace a Defense authorization \nconference report that increases the President's request by more than \nsix billion dollars to a total of $288.8 billion. Almost one-half of \nthe eight billion dollar increase goes towards procurement--the \nkeystone of force modernization--and keeps the Pentagon on schedule to \nlevel this account at $60 billion next year, as Secretary Cohen \nproposed in February 1998.\n  Beyond the numbers in the budget, however, this bill takes care \nof the needs of our Service people. The Conference Report, Mr. \nPresident, recognizes the human dimension of military readiness by \napproving an across-the-board 4.8% pay increase for uniformed \npersonnel-the largest since 1982. It also equalizes retirement \nbenefits, extends bonuses for second and third-term re-enlistments, and \ngives troops the same chance that civilians have to achieve financial \nsecurity by making thrift saving plans available, for the first time \never, to the Total Force.\n\n  This legislation furthermore takes the bold step of re-organizing the \nEnergy Department of fight the emerging threat of nuclear proliferation \nthrough reformed intelligence and security systems. Our statutory \neffort on this front reflected the chilling fact that the Department, \nas it exists, cannot adequately safeguard the secrets that give nuclear \narsenals their range and mobility.\n  An alarming flood of evidence produced by two distinguished panels \nthis year, the Cox and Rudman Commissions, uncovered a fractured and \napathetic DoE bureaucracy that failed over the course of twenty years \nto protect the design plans for America's most sophisticated warheads \nagainst foreign espionage. As a result, the conference report mandated \nthe creation of a new semi-autonomous organization within the Energy \nDepartment,\n\n[[Page S11121]]\n\naccountable directly to the Secretary, that will streamline reporting \nprocedures and tighten security at the country's national weapons \nlaboratories.\n  In addition, as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Seapower \nSubcommittee, I was honored to join my colleagues in forging an FY 2000 \nbudget authorization that enhances the nation's naval power projection, \nforce protection, and strategic lift capabilities. I want to thank \nSenator Kennedy, the ranking minority member of the Subcommittee, along \nwith the panel's other members, Senators John McCain, Bob Smith, Jeff \nSessions, Chuck Robb, and Jack Reed, for both their hard work on this \nyear's bill and their support of me as the Chairman.\n  The conference report approves the President's request for \nauthorization of six new construction ships, including $2.681 billion \nfor three DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, $1.508 billion for two \nLPD-17 San Antonio-class amphibious ships, and $440 million for one \nADC(X), the first of a class of auxiliary refrigeration and ammunition \nsupply ships.\n  It also authorizes the President's advance procurement request of \n$748.5 million for two SSN-774 Virginia-Class attack submarines, and \n$751.5 million for the CVN-77, the last Nimitz-class aircraft carrier.\n  These budget levels will enable the Navy to set the stage for a \nplanned increase in annual ship construction rate from six per year \ntoday to eight per year between FY 2001 and FY 2004 and nine per year \nbeginning by FY 2005. As the Assistant Service Secretary for Research, \nDevelopment, and Acquisition, Dr. Lee Buchanan, testified to the \nSubcommittee on March 24, 1999, a yearly production rate of between \neight and ten vessels is essential to the maintenance of a Fleet within \nthe range of 300 ships over the next 35 years.\n  Beyond the procurement priorities of today, the subcommittee \nsupported the Navy's revolutionary research efforts to shape a 21st \ncentury fleet of greater speed, precision, and maneuverability for \nlittoral operations near coastal waters. According to the Navy's \nofficial definition, littoral engagements requires forces to deploy \n``close enough to influence events on shore if necessary.''\n  This post-Soviet mission connects our force structure to our security \ninterests since by 2010, 80 percent of the world's population will live \nwithin 300 miles of the shorelines known as the littorals. And as our \nmaritime Service, Mr. President, the Navy operates as the first and \nmost significant force of relief and response in the littoral \nwaterways.\n  In the realm of ship research, development, testing, and evaluation, \nthe conference report approves $270 million for the DD-21 next-\ngeneration land attack destroyer, $205 million to advance the post-\nNimitz aircraft carrier program known as CVN(X), and $116 million for \nSSN-774 Virginia-class attack submarines. These initiatives will help \nthe fleet in meeting one of its core force structure goals for the \nyears ahead: the deployment of ships with intensified firepower and \nlower life-cycle costs.\n  The sailors and marines of tomorrow, Mr. President, will also require \nworldwide mobility to bring American power to the shores of conflict or \ninstability. Towards this end, our bill extends the Pentagon's core \ntactical and strategic lift programs, including the C-17 airlifter and \nthe MV-22 Osprey helicopter.\n  The seapower portion of the conference report includes a number of \nlegislative provisions allowing the Pentagon to take advantage of the \nmost cost-effective acquisition strategies to sustain a fleet of at \nleast 300 ships--the bare minimum, according to the testimony of senior \nofficials before the Seapower Subcommittee this year, that the Navy \nneeds to meet its forward-deployed operational requirements.\n  These legislative provisions extend the multi-year procurement \nauthority to include fiscal years 2002 and 2003 in the DDG-51 \nproduction program, and authorize advance procurement and construction \nfunding for both a new LHD-8 amphibious assault ship and an additional \nlarge, medium-speed roll on/roll off ship.\n  We also authorize the Secretary of the Navy to enter into auxiliary \nship leases for 20 or more years. This initiative should give service \nleaders more flexibility to invest resources into complex war fighting \nships by relying more on qualified commercial ship owners to build and \nmaintain the supply fleet.\n  Finally, Mr. President, long-range fleet planning will prompt the \nnaval leadership to concentrate on developing a broad force structure \nto execute the National Security Strategy. For this reason, the \nconference report directs the Department of Defense to submit a report \nnext February detailing the Navy's shipbuilding schedule and needed \nmaritime capabilities through fiscal year 2030.\n  In summary, the fiscal year 2000 Defense authorization conference \nreport address the key acquisition, research, hardware, and operational \nchallenges that will provide the nation with a flexible and responsive \n21st century fleet. I urge my colleagues to uphold a valuable tradition \nof the United States Senate by voting on a strong bipartisan basis in \nfavor of this landmark legislation.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. The final version of S. 1059 also contains a provision, \nsponsored by the distinguished chairman and myself, requiring the \nPresident to certify whether the new Strategic Concept of NATO--the \nlatest alliance blueprint for future operations adopted at the recent \nNATO summit here in Washington--contains new commitments and \nobligations for the United States. This body's experience with U.S. \ndeployments to the Balkans bears out the fact that you better force the \nadministration to be candid when it comes to the potential and actual \nuse of American troops, particularly in regards to objectives, \nstrategy, and timetable. It follows, therefore, you better formally \nrequire this administration to be candid about the defense planning and \ndefense budget implications of the new Strategic Concept of NATO. I \nthink the chairman and I have tried to do that with our provision and I \nlook forward to the President's certification, due thirty days from the \ndate S. 1059 becomes law.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, a number of significant developments have \noccurred since the passage of last year's authorization conference \nreport--some good, some less so. The best news is that this year's \ndefense budget reverses a precipitous decline in defense spending.\n  For the first time in 15 years, we have finally passed an increase in \ndefense spending, in real terms.\n  We have also included a 4.8 percent pay raise for our overburdened \ntroops. These steps are long overdue, and we have been blocked at many \nturns by the Administration.\n  As many of our colleagues know, our forces are deployed in farflung \nplaces, many with little national interest or military requirement at \nstake. Yet, unfortunately, we have also had a hemorrhaging in the \nranks, due to deep cuts from the Administration.\n  The numbers are staggering. In just the last six years, the following \nare among the forces which have been eliminated from the U.S. \ninventory: 709,000 regular service soldiers, 293,000 reserve troops, 8 \nstanding Army divisions, 20 Air Force wings with 2,000 combat aircraft, \n232 strategic bombers, 13 strategic ballistic missile submarines with \n3,114 nuclear warheads on 232 missiles, 500 land-based intercontinental \nballistic missiles with 1,950 warheads, 4 aircraft carriers, and 121 \ncombat ships and submarines along with their support bases and \nshipyards.\n  When Bill Clinton took office in 1993, the United States devoted 4.5 \npercent of its gross domestic product (GDP) to national defense.\n  Today, defense outlays account for just 3 percent of GDP--their \nlowest level since the end of World War II.\n  By Inauguration Day 2001, defense spending is projected to have \nplummeted to 2.8 percent of GDP.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill. It has a number of important \ncomponents to it, most of all the overall spending hike and pay raise. \nAs the Chairman of the Readiness and Management Support Subcommittee \nInfrastructure, we were able to address a number of important issues \nthis year.\n  Milcon: We authorized $8.49 billion for milcon, $3.06 billion above \nthe Administration's request, with a strong emphasis on family housing \nand decaying infrastructure.\n  Range Withdrawal: we have allowed critical readiness training to \noccur for\n\n[[Page S11122]]\n\nthe next 25 years on some of our critical ranges in the West.\n  Spectrum: the spectrum was protected from a corporate takeover, \nallowing crucial bandwidth to be maintained by the military.\n  At the same time, this bill simply does not go far enough. Under no \nproposed budget currently on the table is there a substantial increase \nin defense spending, like we need. In a budget approaching $2 trillion, \nwe ought to be able to find the less than $100 billion it would take to \ntruly restore our readiness.\n  It is time to reverse these trends. It is time to take prudent steps \nto rebuild our defenses to protect our people, our values and our \ncountry. I look forward to working toward that goal as a major priority \nin the year ahead.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks concerning the \nspecifics of the conference report, I want to congratulate Chairman \nWarner and Senator Levin, for all their hard work on this bill. I \nbelieve we have a strong bill which makes dramatic improvements for our \nmilitary men and women.\n  Also, I want to say that I feel honored to be a part of the Armed \nServices Committee. It is not too often that a first year member of the \ncommittee becomes a Subcommittee Chair. It has been a learning \nexperience but one that I have enjoyed as much as any time during my \nyears in office.\n  We rightly began the year with S.4, the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, \nand Marines Bill of Rights and this has been our guide which brought us \nto this point. And, I am proud of the many achievements in this \nconference report.\n  Specifically, the Personnel Subcommittee held four hearings in \npreparation of this important bill. Through these hearings, we explored \nrecruiting, retention, pay and compensation, military and civilian \npersonnel management and the military health care system.\n  During these hearings, particular emphasis was put on readiness, the \nretention of highly trained people and the inability of the military \nservices to achieve their recruiting goals.\n  General Shelton and the Service Chiefs urged the President and the \nCongress to support a military pay raise that would begin to address \ninequities between military pay and civilian wages, and to resolve the \ninequity of the ``Redux'' retirement system.\n  This conference report will provide military personnel a four-point-\neight percent pay raise on January 1, 2000, and will require that, for \nthe next six years, military pay raises be based on the annual increase \nin the Employment Cost Index plus one-half a percent.\n  The bill restructures the military pay tables to recognize the value \nof promotions and to weight the pay raise toward mid-career NCOs and \nofficers where retention is most critical.\n  The Joint Chiefs testified that there is a pay gap between military \nand private sector wages of 14 percent. This bill moves aggressively to \nclose this gap and ensure military personnel are compensated in an \nequitable manner.\n  The conference report includes over $250 million specifically to \nreduce the out-of-pocket housing expense for military personnel and \ntheir families.\n  The conference report provides military personnel who entered the \nservice after July 31, 1986 the option to revert to the previous \nmilitary retirement system that provided at 50 percent multiplier to \ntheir base pay averaged over their highest three years and includes \nfull cost-of-living adjustments; or, to accept a $30,000 bonus and \nremain under the ``Redux'' retirement system.\n  The Joint Chiefs testified that the ``Redux'' retirement system is \nresponsible for an increasing number of mid-career military personnel \ndeciding to leave the service. The conference report will offer these \nhighly trained personnel an attractive incentive to continue to serve a \nfull career.\n  We have authorized a Thrift Savings Plan that will allow service \nmembers to save up to five percent of their base pay, before taxes, and \nwill permit them to directly deposit their enlistment and re-enlistment \nbonuses, up to the limits established by the IRS, into their Thrift \nSavings Plan.\n  The bill authorizes Service Secretaries to offer to match the Thrift \nSavings Plan contributions of those service members serving in critical \nspecialities for a period of six years in return for a six year service \ncommitment. This is a powerful tool to assist the services in retaining \nkey personnel in the most critical specialities.\n  In addition to the pay increase, the re-engineering of the military \nretirement system and the Thrift Savings Plan, we have taken dramatic \nsteps to assist military recruiters and re-enlistment NCOs by \nauthorizing new and increased bonuses and incentives to attract high \nquality young men and women to join the military services and to stay \nonce they become trained and experienced professionals.\n  We targeted these incentives and bonuses at those critical \nspecialities which the services are having difficulty filling.\n  The Committee has found that the single most frequent reason \ndeparting service members cite when asked why they decided to leave the \nmilitary is excessive time on deployment--too much time away from home \nand family.\n  We are all well aware that the Clinton administration has deployed \nmilitary personnel more than at any previous time in our history.\n  The conference report includes a provision that will require the \nmilitary services to manage the deployment of military personnel within \nstrict time lines. The provision does provide the Secretary of Defense \nboard waiver authority to ensure that military readiness or national \nsecurity will not be compromised. However, during normal operations, \nthe services will be required to minimize the impact of deployments and \ntrack the details that separate a service member from his or her \nfamily. This provision will be an important step toward retaining the \ntrained and experienced personnel the services are now losing at an \nalarming rate.\n\n  I am sure each Senator has received complaints from constituents \nregarding the TRICARE health care system. The original Senate bill and \nthe conference report take important steps towards improving the \nTRICARE health care system of the military services.\n  The conference report directs a totally revamped pharmacy benefit, \nimproves access to care and claims processing, reduces the \nadministrative burden on beneficiaries, enhances the dental benefits, \nand requires the establishment of a beneficiary advocate to assist \nservice members, retirees and their families who are experiencing \ndifficulty with the TRICARE system.\n  While this conference report has taken a number of important steps \ntoward resolving the most frequent complaints against TRICARE, during \nthe next year the Chairman and I intend to continue to pursue ways to \nfurther improve and streamline the military health care system.\n  I have described just a few of the many personnel related provisions \nin this conference report. As we are all aware, recruiting and \nretention in the military services is suffering. We simply cannot allow \nthe best military force in the world wither away.\n  As I and other Members of the Senate have visited military bases here \nin the United States, in Bosnia and in other deployment areas, we have \nfound that our young service men and women are doing a tremendous job, \nunder adverse conditions in many cases.\n  We should move quickly to pass this conference report in order to \npermit military personnel and their families to make the decision to \ncontinue to serve and will assist the military services in recruiting \nthe high quality force we have worked so hard to achieve.\n  There are many other issues outside of the personnel area that I wish \nI could touch on but there is just not enough time. However, I would \nlike to mention one in particular and that concerns Rocky Flats.\n  The conference Report has four very important provisions which will \nhelp ensure that the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site will \nclose safely and efficiently by the year 2006.\n  First, the bill authorizes $1.1 billion for all closure projects, \nwith Rocky Flats receiving an extra $15 million above the President's \nrequest to help ensure closure by 2006. Second, there is a three year \npilot program (FY 2000-2002) authorizing the Secretary of Energy to \nallocate up to $15 million of prior year unobligated balances in the \ndefense environmental management account for accelerated cleanup at \nRocky Flats. This provision could provide $45 million extra for Rocky \nFlats\n\n[[Page S11123]]\n\nthrough the year 2002. Third, we are requiring the Secretary of Energy \nto provide a proposed schedule for the shipment of waste from Rocky \nFlats to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico, including in \nthe schedule a timetable for obtaining shipping containers. And fourth, \nthe Comptroller General (GAO) must report on the progress of the \nclosure of Rocky Flats by 2006.\n  Again, I want to state that I am proud of this Conference Report and \nwhat it provides for our military.\n  In conclusion, I want to recognize and thank the Staff Director of \nthe Personnel Subcommittee Charlie Abell. He is a tremendous asset to \nme and my staff, the Armed Services Committee, and this Senate. Also, I \nwant to let Senator Cleland know how much I enjoy having him as my \npartner and ranking member of the Subcommittee. He is an American hero \nwhose commitment in improving the lives of our military personnel is to \nbe commended. And lastly, I want to thank the Chairman for this time to \nspeak and I want to thank him for his commitment to the bill and to our \nbrave and honorable men and women in uniform.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I commend Armed Services Committee \nChairman Senator John Warner and Ranking Member Senator Carl Levin for \nbringing this important bill to the floor. With the passage of this \nbill, we will begin to seriously address our military readiness \nproblems. It is a good start. This bill includes many of the provisions \nof S.4, one of the first bills introduced in the Congress back in \nJanuary and passed February 24, 1999. With the military having its \nworst recruiting year since 1979, the Congress needs to send a strong \nmessage of support to those who serve. The bill does just that by: \nIncreasing pay for our service members by 4.8 percent, increasing and \ncreating special incentive pays, improving retirement benefits, and \nimproving benefits and management of the military health care program.\n  In am particularly pleased this bill includes two provisions I \noffered. The first concerns military health care and the second the \ncurrent high operations tempo of our forces.\n  In February we emphatically recognized our commitment to these \ndedicated men and women when we passed 100-0 my Military Health Care \nImprovement Amendment to S.4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and \nMarine's Bill of Rights.\n  The message is loud and clear from my constituents: The military care \nbenefit is no longer much of a benefit. I have no doubt my colleagues \nin the Senate have also heard equally valid complaints about access to \ncare, unpaid bills, inadequate provider networks, and difficulties with \nclaims. The promise seemed fairly simple--in return for military \nservice and sacrifice, the government would provide health care to \nactive duty members and their families, even after they retire. But of \ncourse it's more complicated than that. In the past 10 years, the \nmilitary has downsized by over one third and the military health care \nsystem has downsized with it. While hospitals and clinics have closed, \nthe number of personnel that rely on the system hasn't really changed. \nToday, our armed forces have more married service members with families \nthan even before. In addition, those who have served and are now \nretired were promised quality health care as well. The system these \nindividuals and families have been given to meet their needs is called \n``TRICARE.'' TRICARE is not health care coverage, but a health care \ndelivery system that provides varying levels of benefits depending \nlargely on where a member of the military or a retiree lives. \nUnfortunately, what we find in practice is that the TRICARE program \noften provides spotty coverage.\n  The point I want to make clear is that regardless of the \ncomplications, the promise remains and we must deliver on the promise. \nWhen we passed my amendment 100-0, we sent a signal that we care and \nthat we will be vigilant in pursuing this issue. Our purpose is not to \nthrow out the TRICARE system but to fix the problems and improve the \nhealth care benefits under the TRICARE program. I am happy to report \nthat the Authorization bill before us today addresses all the issues \nthat were in my amendment to improve access to health care and \nmanagement under the TRICARE program. These include: Minimizing the \nauthorization and certification requirements imposed on beneficiaries, \nreducing claims processing time and providing incentives for electronic \nprocessing, improve TRICARE management and eliminate bureaucratic red \ntape, authorize reimbursement at higher rates where required to attract \nand retain qualified providers, compare health care coverage available \nunder TRICARE to plans offered under the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program (FEHBP), allow reimbursement from third-party payers \nto military hospitals based on reasonable charges, and reporting to \nCongress on each of these initiatives.\n\n  One of the promises that we made to our forces is to provide quality \nmedical care to those who serve and their families. General Dennis \nReimer, the former Chief of Staff of the Army, spoke at the most recent \nconference on military health care. General Reimer provided a soldiers' \nperspective of how important health care is to those who serve. He \nsaid, ``this is about readiness and this is about quality of life \nlinked together. We must ensure that we provide those young men and \nwomen who sacrifice and serve our country so well, and ask for so very \nlittle, the quality medical care that is the top priority for them . . \n. we must help them or else we're not going to be able to recruit this \nhigh quality force.''\n  During the past year I visited our troops in the Balkans and toured \nevery single military installation in Texas. The visits provided \nmarvelous snapshots of our armed forces today and the many challenges \nthey face. At each stop I met with our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \ntheir leaders and discussed their concerns. Health care for them and \ntheir families was at the top of their list. We have some truly \nwonderful young people serving in the armed forces who are very \npatriotic and ask very little of us in return. But frankly, we haven't \ndone enough for them. I am pleased that the Senate Leadership and the \nSenate Armed Services Committee have made this a top priority this \nyear.\n  Mr. President, the health care provisions in this bill will go a long \nway toward breaking down the bureaucracy that exists in the current \nsystem. I know that there is no single solution or quick fix to this \nproblem, but we must begin now to ensure we honor our commitments. This \nis a critical issue to recruiting and retaining qualified people in the \nmilitary--which is critical to the security of our country.\n  My second provision addresses another issue, which we passed as part \nof our Defense Authorization Bill. Pay and benefits increases are an \nimportant beginning, but we cannot ignore the high operations tempo and \nits impact on our readiness. Recently the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies completed a survey of over 11,000 military \npersonnel from the Army and Coast Guard on the subject of military \nculture in the 21st Century. I participated as an advisor on this study \nand was just briefed on some of the key findings.\n  The really good news is that those surveyed told us: They were proud \nto serve, they believe the military is important in the world and the \njobs they do are important to the mission, they have a deep personal \ncommitment to serve, they believe the military is right to expect high \nstandards of personal conduct off-duty, and they are prepared to lay \ntheir lives on the line.\n  Those responses are indicative of the kind of wonderful young people \nwe have serving today in out armed forces, and we have a duty and an \nobligation to provide them with the equipment and the training and the \nquality of life they deserve.\n  But they also told us they felt strongly that: Their pay is \ninadequate, their unites have morale problems, units are often \n``surprised'' by unexpected missions, they are ``stressed out'' from \nthe frequent deployments, and they often don't have the resources they \nneed to do their jobs.\n  These responses from soldiers in the field should not come as a \nsurprise to anyone here. We know our troops are dedicated and committed \nand we also know they are stretched too thin. Secretary Cohen admitted \nas much last Spring in testimony before the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee when he said ``we have to few people and too\n\n[[Page S11124]]\n\nmany missions.'' That fact is beginning to show in wear and tear on our \nforces and equipment.\n  There are too many deployments that never seem to end. We have troops \ncoming home from a short tour in Korea and heading straight to Bosnia. \nAt Fort Bliss recently one sergeant told of coming off a one year tour \nin Korea and then spending three short deployments of 5 months, 3 \nmonths and one month in Saudi Arabia . . . all in less than two years \nand she is now scheduled to return to Korea for another one-year tour. \nFortunately this young sergeant was single and was not leaving a spouse \nand children behind, but for others these frequent deployments mean \nthey must choose between the army and their family. The military has a \nsaying--``you enlist a soldier--you reenlist a family.'' We are having \na retention crisis because the families aren't reenlisting. And no \nwonder. They are jerked from one place to another because we are trying \nto do it all.\n\n  We will soon begin the fifth year of our supposedly ``one-year'' \nmission in Bosnia. U.S. troops have just spent their eighth summer in \nthe deserts of southwest-Asia, we have troops in Kosovo and now East \nTimor. Thankfully, the mission to Haiti will soon end.\n  But these frequent deployments are having a devastating impact on our \nmilitary readiness and jeopardizing our ability to respond where our \nnational security interests may be threatened in Southwest Asia or the \nKoran peninsula.\n  We are seeing the effects of this over deployment on our equipment as \nwell as on our forces. We hear of Air Force planes sitting idle for \nlack of spare parts. Navy ships that deploy without full crews. The \nArmy and Marine Corps are forced to cannibalize equipment to field \nfront-line units. These are not isolated incidents, these problems \npoint to a larger readiness crisis affecting our military forces.\n  the recent Center for Strategic and International Studies' survey \ntells us that our military is comprised of dedicated and committed \nyoung men and women who tell us they are willing to lay down their \nlives for their country. We in the Congress must ensure that the \nmissions on which they are asked to serve are important national \nsecurity interests and represent the best use of our forces.\n  To begin to help us meet this responsibility, my provision included \nin this bill says it is a sense of Congress that the readiness of our \nmilitary forces to execute the national security strategy is being \neroded from a combination of declining defense budgets and expanded \nmissions. It says to the President that we must have a report that \nprioritizes ongoing global missions. It must distinguish low-priority \nmissions from high-priority missions. That is the basis to effectively \nmanage our commitments, shift our resources, consolidate missions, and \nend low-priority missions.\n  It is time to assess where we are in the world and why, and to ask \nthe President to prioritize all of these missions. Then Congress can \nwork with the President to determine if we need to ramp up our military \npersonnel strength or ramp down the number of deployments that we have \naround the world. The testimony of Secretary Cohen and the other Chiefs \nmatches what I have seen and heard myself from our dedicated troops. \nThe answer is one or the other, because the current situation is \noverextending our armed forces.\n  I am pleased to support this bill and acknowledge the effort and hard \nwork of the members of the Armed Services Committee and their staff in \nbringing this bill to the floor. It is my hope that this bill will \nrepresent a turning point in arresting the decline of our military \nreadiness.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \noverwhelming passage of the conference report to accompany S. 1059, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000. I would like \nto express my sincere appreciation and thanks to Chairman Warner and \nranking Member Levin for their efforts in crafting this important \nlegislation.\n  This bill authorizes for the military the funds they need to \nadequately defend our country and protect our vital interests \nworldwide, $288.8 billion, which is $8.3 billion more than the \nPresident's inadequate request. After years of declining budgets and \nincreased deployments, this legislation provides the military with \ntheir first funding increase since the end of the Cold War.\n  This bill carefully addresses a variety of important issues, from pay \nraises for our soldiers to restructuring the nation's nuclear \nlaboratories in order to prevent any further espionage at our nation's \nnuclear laboratories.\n  While the Clinton Administration has over-extended and under-funded \nour military and has provided inexplicably slow and ineffective \nresponses to Chinese spying, this Committee and the Congress as a whole \nhas stepped up to face these challenges, and protect our national \ninterests.\n  I would now like to take the opportunity to highlight some of the \nimportant provisions championed by the three subcommittees I serve on.\n  Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support.--Before I had even \njoined the Armed Services Committee in January of this year, tangible \nevidence of a debilitating readiness crisis had emerged, a crisis that \nthreatened the well being of America's armed forces.\n  On September 28th of last year, General Shelton confessed:\n\n       I must admit up front that our forces are showing \n     increasing signs of serious wear. Anecdotal and now \n     measurable evidence indicates that our current readiness is \n     fraying and that the long term health of the Total Force is \n     in jeopardy.\n\n  I would note that General Shelton is not a soldier prone to \nhyperbole.\n  For their excellent work to combat the ``fraying of readiness'' \ndescribed by General Shelton, Senators Inhofe and Robb, respectively \nthe Chairman and Ranking member of the Readiness and Management Support \nSubcommittee, deserve congratulations for the excellent work they have \ndone in this area.\n  They have added more than $1.46 billion to the primary readiness \naccounts including funds for ammunition, training, base operations and \nessential infrastructure repairs including $380 million for base \noperations, $788 million for real property maintenance, and $172.9 \nmillion for training and war reserve ammunition.\n  In the area of military construction, the Subcommittee adopted \nsignificant changes to the law on economic development conveyances of \nbase closure properties. Rural communities that have suffered through \nthe closure of a military installation will no longer have to pay the \ngovernment for the privilege of redeveloping their economies.\n  The Readiness Subcommittee also correctly rejected the President's \nirresponsible budgetary maneuvering which would have incrementally \nfunded military construction projects.\n  Subcommittee on Strategic Forces.--The Subcommittee on Strategic \nForces, capably led by Chairman Smith of New Hampshire and Senator \nLandrieu of Louisiana, worked hard to ensure that American soldiers \ndeployed overseas and American citizens asleep in their beds will be a \nlittle safer from the threat of ballistic missile attack.\n  The Subcommittee authorized an increase of $212 million for the \nPatriot PAC-3 anti-ballistic missile system to complete research and \ndevelopment and begin production soon.\n  If I can take a minute, I would like to repeat the last portion of \nthat sentence and proudly brag about a product built by hundreds \nhardworking employees in my home state of Arkansas. The Patriot PAC-3 \nwas the first dedicated, hit-to-kill, Theater Missile Defense (TMD) \nsystem that has successfully destroyed a target in a test.\n  But I digress. The Subcommittee authorized an additional $112 million \nfor upgrades to the B-2 bomber system, which I would note for the \nbenefit of the program's detractors, performed brilliantly during \nOperation Allied Force.\n  The Subcommittee also included a provision regarding DOD's theater \nmissile defense upper-tier strategy, which would require that the Navy \nUpper Tier and THAAD systems be managed and funded as separate \nprograms. The Administration must be reminded that it has repeatedly \ntestified before this Committee that these programs are not \ninterchangeable. They are complementary, both urgently needed, and must \nbe treated as such.\n\n[[Page S11125]]\n\n  But perhaps most importantly, it is within the Strategic Forces \nSubcommittee that the Armed Services Committee took the several \nimportant legislative actions to address the criminally lax security at \nour nation's nuclear laboratories. Lax security that allowed the \nPeople's Republic of China to steal the secrets produced by billions of \ndollars and four decades worth of taxpayer funded nuclear research.\n  Among the provisions recommended by the Subcommittee: The \nestablishment of a semi-autonomous National Nuclear Security \nAdministration within DOE under which all national security functions \nwill be consolidated. Create a new Under Secretary of Energy to head \nthe new Administration.\n  Created a new counterintelligence office reporting directly to the \nSecretary. Established clear lines of management authority for national \nsecurity missions of the department. Protected the authority of the \nSecretary to ensure full compliance with all applicable environmental \nlaws.\n  As millions of Americans woke up this year to be repeatedly \nconfronted by the shocking truth of the Clinton Administration's \ncasual, almost lackadaisical response to the systematic theft of highly \nclassified nuclear secrets as reported in the Cox Committee's unanimous \nreport, I hope they will find at least a little comfort in the \nknowledge that this Committee was ready to step forward, accept a \nchallenge and shoulder the responsibility for our nation's nuclear \nsecurity that this Administration repeatedly forfeited.\n  Subcommittee on AirLand Forces: Subcommittee Chairman Rick Santorum \nand Ranking Member Joseph Lieberman also rolled up their sleeves, \ntackling the difficult readiness and modernization challenges posed by \nyears of Clinton Administration neglect.\n  Most significantly, the Subcommittee fully authorized the budget \nrequest for the development and procurement of the F-22 Raptor \naircraft. This aircraft is absolutely essential if Air Force is to \ncontinue its proud record of air-dominance over far away battlefields. \nAmerica's military should never be forced by its Congress to fight a \nfair fight. When this nation must bear arms to protect its interests, \nit should always be aiming for a lopsided victory.\n  Also focusing on unfunded requirements identified by each of the \nservices, the AirLand Forces Subcommittee made a number of changes to \nthe President's request, addressing, among others, Army aviation \nshortfalls and night vision equipment shortfalls.\n  To conclude, I would like to again thank Chairman Warner, and his \ndedicated, tireless staff, for their leadership and dedicated service.\n  Mr. President, I urge each of my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation which contains many provisions which are vital to our \nnation's military. And I urge the President to sign this legislation \ninto law as soon as he receives it. This bill will make needed \nimprovements in the areas of military readiness, quality of life and \nmodernization, and I hope the U.S. Senate will send a strong, \nbipartisan message in support of our men and women in uniform.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise this evening in support of \nChairman Warner and the Senate Armed Services Committee Department of \nDefense Authorization bill S. 1059, which will be voted on tomorrow \nmorning. This is a bill I strongly encourage my colleagues to support. \nIt sends a powerful message to military men and women worldwide, that \nthis body respects what they do for America each and every day, as they \ncarry out a hundred different operations, in as many nations. We heard \ntheir voices and have done something positive in improving their \nquality of life and that of their families. We believe they deserve the \nbest equipment American technology can produce.\n  The statements made by our Service Chiefs on our state of military \nreadiness provided an azimuth for the committee back in January, and \nsome 70+ hearings later we have a product which provides a funding \nlevel for new budget authority of $288.8 Billion, which is $8.3 Billion \nabove the President's budget request.\n  The crisis in the Balkans followed this plea for more funding and \nChairman Warner responded with over 15 hearings on Kosovo and related \nactivities. We learned of the shortfalls in our planning, and were \nproud to learn of the exploits of our men and women in uniform who have \nnever let us down. We are, however, left to ponder the problems \ninherent in coalition warfare, and the direction of the new strategic \nconcept in NATO.\n  Chinese Espionage too took us in yet another direction and the \ncommittee has responded with a real change in organization of the \nDepartment of Energy so that we do not fall once again into sloppy \nsecurity awareness. This was truly a vexing problem that no doubt will \nhaunt this nation for years to come. I hope the President will not \nhesitate in accepting these considered changes. This is a tough issue \nthat warrants a firm solution.\n  Mr. President, this bill is just part of the work that lies ahead as \nwe restore America's Defense to the status it deserves. I feel we are \ncommitted, on the Senate Armed Services Committee, to investigating the \nproblems associated with: Cyber/Information warfare; WMD Proliferation; \nChemical and Biological weapons; Organized Crime and Narco-terrorism.\n  Our troops are doing a great job the world over! They are truly the \nbest led and trained in the world, and they deserve the best equipment, \nthe best support and the most funding we can provide them.\n  To this end, I am please that Chairman Warner accepted my amendment \nto this bill which calls for the Secretary of Defense to make the \npositions of the Chiefs of the Reserves and the two National Guard \nDirectors hold three star rank. This bill mandates, it seems to me, \nthat these key leaders, who do so much every day to help us keep the \npeace world-wide, must hold three star rank. I hope they soon will.\n  I again congratulate Chairman Warner on bringing us so far in what \ncertainly seems a short period of time. S. 1059 is a great bill. It \nneeds all our support. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                         band 9/10 transmitters\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a brief \ncolloquy with our distinguished Chairman concerning the conference \nreport that accompanies the fiscal year 2000 National Defense \nAuthorization Act. It has come to my attention that page 526 of House \nReport 106-301 notes that the conferees to the bill agreed to authorize \nan increase of $25.0 million for the procurement of additional band 9/\n10 transmitters for the EA-6B tactical jamming aircraft. In reality, \nduring conference negotiations, conferees agreed to authorize an \nadditional $25.0 million for the procurement of modified band 9/10 \ntransmitters.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I was dismayed to learn that the \nSenate\n\n[[Page S11126]]\n\nInterior Appropriations budget has zeroed out funding to the State of \nCalifornia for its share of the Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve \nSettlement. By right, the State should receive $36 million this year. \nThis is the money that California gives to retired teachers whose \npensions have been most seriously eroded by inflation.\n  Here is the brief history of the issue: In 1996, Congress authorized \nthe sale of Elk Hills Naval Reserve. However, a portion of the property \nconsisted of more than 1300 acres of school lands owned by the state of \nCalifornia. Until the California's land claims were resolved, the sale \ncould not go forward. Ultimately the Federal Government reached an \nagreement with California in which the state released its claim in \nexchange for installment payments over a seven-year period.\n  The settlement allowed the federal government to sell the reserve for \n$3.65 billion. California kept its part of the bargain. Now the Federal \ngovernment must meet its obligations. Last year the first installment \nof the $36 million was paid. But six years of installments remain.\n  Actually, the money needed to compensate the state had been waiting \nin escrow.\n  The House has properly allocated $36 million in the House Interior \nAppropriations Bill.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will also recognize the importance of \nkeeping the Federal government's end of the bargain. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to ensure that the House appropriation of \n$36 million be upheld in Conference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11126-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11126-S11127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE WILDERNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 35th \nanniversary of the Wilderness Act. Specifically, I would like to speak \nabout the invaluable contribution of New Mexico Senator Clinton P. \nAnderson in steering the wilderness legislation through Congress and \nsecuring final passage. I also will describe how the Gila Wilderness in \nNew Mexico came to be created, the first such designation in the world, \nforty years prior to enactment of the Wilderness Act. Finally, in my \nremarks today, I will mention a related bill that I recently \nintroduced, S. 864, the ``Earth Day'' Act.\n  On September 3, 1964, President Johnson signed the Wilderness Act \ninto law creating the national wilderness preservation system. In order \nto assure that some lands will be protected in their natural condition, \nCongress declared a policy of securing for present and future \ngenerations of Americans ``the benefits of an enduring resource of \nwilderness.'' Certain provisions of the Wilderness Act are unique among \nthe U.S. Code because they read more like poetry than the fodder of \nlegislators and lawyers. For example, the Act defines wilderness as \n``an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by \nman, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.''\n  Why celebrate the anniversary of the Wilderness Act? Since its \nenactment, the national wilderness preservation system has grown from 9 \nmillion acres to 104 million acres--I believe these figures reflect the \npopularity of and support for wilderness. There are many compelling \nreasons for preserving wilderness. Wilderness areas protect watersheds \nand soils, serve as wildlife and plant habitat, and give humans \nthe opportunity to experience solitude in nature. I think Clinton \nAnderson best described the meaning of wilderness in this eloquent \nstatement:\n\n       Conservation is to a democratic government by free men as \n     the roots of a tree are to its leaves. We must be willing \n     wisely to nurture and use our resources if we are going to \n     keep visible the inner strengths of democracy.\n       For as we have and hold dear our practices of conservation, \n     we say to the other peoples of the world that ours is not an \n     exploitative society--solely materialistic in outlook. We \n     take a positive position--conservation means that we have \n     faith that our way of life will go on and we are surely \n     building for those who we know will follow  . . .\n       There is a spiritual value to conservation and wilderness \n     typifies this. Wilderness is a demonstration by our people \n     that we can put aside a portion of this which we have as a \n     tribute to the Maker and say--this we will leave as we found \n     it.\n       Wilderness is an anchor to windward. Knowing it is there, \n     we can also know that we are still a rich nation, tending to \n     our resources as we should--not a people in despair \n     scratching every last nook and cranny of our land for a board \n     of lumber, a barrel of oil, or a tank of water.\n\n  Senator Anderson's words are particularly meaningful because of his \nrole as the tenacious and determined leader in Congress who secured \npassage of the Wilderness Act as many years ago. In fact, former Forest \nService Chief Richard McArdle stated that, ``Without Clinton Anderson \nthere would have been no Wilderness Law.''\n  In his first substantive act as the new Chairman of the Committee on \nInterior and Insular Affairs, on January 5, 1961, Clinton Anderson \nintroduced a bill to establish and maintain a national wilderness \nsystem. Although similar wilderness bills had been introduced in \nprevious Congresses, it was Senator Anderson's bill that was first \nreported by the Committee and, later that year, the first to pass the \nSenate. The vote on his bill was decisive, 78 to 8. Senator Frank \nChurch wrote to Senator Anderson that:\n\n       The fact that you were chief sponsor of the bill was in \n     large measure responsible for the big endorsement it received \n     on final passage.\n\n  Unfortunately, the House was not yet ready to seriously consider a \nwilderness bill and the 87th Congress adjourned without enactment of \nthe Wilderness Act.\n  In 1963, Senator Anderson introduced the Wilderness bill once again. \nSuccessfully steering the bill through Committee consideration, the \nfull Senate overwhelmingly passed the bill three months into the term \nof the 88th Congress. He then crafted the legislative trade that \nultimately resulted in House passage of the wilderness bill--key House \nmembers wanted legislation creating the Public Land Law Review \nCommission. Both pieces of legislation were signed in 1964.\n  Upon signing the Wilderness Act into law, President Johnson gave \nSenator Anderson special commendation by stating that he had been ``in \nthe forefront of conservation legislation since he first came to the \nHouse in 1941.''\n  In recalling the 35th anniversary of the passage of the Wilderness \nAct, it is fitting to observe that this year is also the 75th \nanniversary of Federal wilderness protection.\n  On June 3, 1924, the Forest Service designated 755,000 acres of \nnational forest land in New Mexico as the Gila Wilderness. This \nunprecedented act took place forty years prior to passage of the \nWilderness Act and was the first such designation in the world. It all \nbegan through the foresight and leadership of a young Forest Service \nmanager in New Mexico named Aldo Leopold. He had worked for the Forest \nService in the Southwest in a variety of different positions, including \nas a Ranger on the Gila National Forest.\n  Leopold felt that preservation had been neglected on the national \nforests. He foresaw the importance of preserving the biological \ndiversity and natural systems giving way to development.\n  Leopold once wrote that ``a thing is right when it tends to preserve \nthe integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community.''\n  He argued against the proposed expansion of a road system into the \nback country of the Gila National Forest and proposed instead that a \nlarge area be left roadless and preserved for wilderness recreation.\n  Today the Gila Wilderness is inhabited by bear, deer, elk, beaver, \nbobcat, mountain lion, antelope, and wild turkey. It is a favorite \ndestination for hikers, backpackers, and anglers who enjoy its 19 miles \nof fishing streams.\n  The Gila Wilderness contains the cliff dwellings of the ancient \nMogollon civilization as well as the campsites and battlegrounds of the \nApache and the U.S. Cavalry. In fact, John Murray wrote in his book, \n``The Gila Wilderness: A Hiking Guide,'' that ``no other wilderness \narea in the Southwest so much embodies and reflects this national \nhistory and natural philosophy as does the Gila.'' He went on to note \nthat ``many of the important events in the development of the region, \nfrom the first expedition of Coronado in 1541 to the more recent raids \nof Geronimo, occurred either directly in the Gila Wilderness Area or in \nthe immediate vicinity.''\n  Leopold would go on to become one of America's greatest naturalists. \nHis accomplishments include publication of ``A Sand County Almanac,'' \none of the most influential books ever written\n\n[[Page S11127]]\n\nabout the relationship of people to their lands and waters.\n  Our nation continues to need opportunities to reflect on the \nimportance of preserving our national world. The celebration of Earth \nDay each year on April 22nd is an effective way to remind us of the \nsignificance of the environment and of accomplishments such as the \nWilderness Act. S. 864, the ``Earth Day Act'', is a bill that I \nintroduced last April along with Senator Chafee. It has since gained \nnine additional bipartisan cosponsors. The purpose of S. 864 is to \nofficially and permanently designate April 22nd as Earth Day.\n  The first Earth Day was 29 years ago, in 1970, and was first \nconceived of by our former colleague, Senator Gaylord Nelson. That \nfirst Earth Day involved some 20 million Americans. Since then, Earth \nDay has focused the attention of the country and the world on the \nimportance of preserving and maintaining our environment. I believe the \nnation owes a great debt of gratitude to Senator Neslon for his \nleadership in creating Earth Day, and that we should recognize the \nimportance it has assumed in our nation's life.\n  It is my sincere hope the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold \nhearings on S. 864, and that the Senate will pass the bill by the end \nof this year. It is my goal to have the President sign S. 864 into law \nby the time Earth Day 2000 arrives. I invite all of my colleagues to \ncosponsor this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11127-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GOVERNMENT LAND PURCHASES\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Gorton and \nSenator Byrd for all their hard work on the Appropriations Interior \nSubcommittee for bringing this bill to the floor.\n  In 1994, I authored the Desert Protection Act, which created two new \nnational parks, Joshua Tree and Death Valley along with the Mojave \nNational Preserve and 100 wilderness areas; thereby promising to \nprotect more than 6 million acres of desert property. However, these \nparks and wilderness areas still contain hundreds of thousands of acres \nof private inholdings.\n  Earlier this year, the Wildlands Conservancy, a California non-\nprofit, negotiated a one-time deal whereby nearly 500,000 acres of \nthese inholdings, many of which are owned by the Catellus Corporation \nwould be purchased by matching $36 million in funds from the Federal \nLand and Water Conservation Fund with $26 million in private donations.\n  Catellus, the Wildlands Conservancy, and the U.S. Bureau of Land \nManagement subsequently signed a letter of intent to sell to the \nFederal Government up to 437,000 acres of California desert owned by \nCatellus. An additional 20,000 acres of property owned by others within \nJoshua Tree National Park would be bought and preserved.\n  All told, up to 483,000 acres of private inholdings in the California \nDesert will be acquired, ensuring public access to over 4 million acres \nof Federal national parks and wilderness areas in the California \nDesert.\n  The location of these particular inholdings are significant because \nthis area serves as the gateway for both private landowners and for \npeople who wish to use the public portions of the preserve. Acquiring \nthis checkerboard of inholdings is the only to assure public access for \nthe lands provided for in the California Desert Protection Act.\n  If the government does not purchase these lands the Historic Mojave \nRoad and the East Mojave Heritage Trail are likely to be closed and it \nis also possible that there will be no more public access to large \nportions of the Mojave!\n  Government acquisition of these lands will protect endangered species \nhabitat, keep the fragile Desert ecosystem intact, and improve \nrecreation opportunities and access for millions of Americans.\n  This proposal enjoys overwhelming support from community activists, \nconservationists, private industry, elected officials, Democrats, \nRepublicans, and everyone who recognizes what a great deal this is for \nthe U.S. Government. In fact, even most opponents of the California \nDesert Protection Act support this appropriation because of the issue \nof public access. If these lands are not purchased by the government, \n1,500 miles of roads will be closed off to hunters, recreationists and \nthe general public.\n  This Interior Appropriations bill contains a line item of $15.1 \nmillion for the phase 1 purchase of these lands. Presently, there is no \nallocation in the House Interior Appropriations bill to fulfill the \nFederal Government's end of the bargain. These purchases have been held \nhostage in the House as a result of an unrelated U.S. Army expansion. \nAlthough this military issue does not directly affect any of the \nCatellus land holdings, it is preventing the appropriation of the \nnecessary funding to execute these land purchases.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Conference \ncommittee to ensure that the government follow through on its \ncommitment to purchase these lands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11127-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          1999 NATIONAL MINORITY MANUFACTURER FIRM OF THE YEAR\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an outstanding \nOklahoman, John Lopez, whose achievements have just earned him a major \naward--his firm, Lopez Foods, has been selected by the U.S. Department \nof Commerce as the 1999 National Minority Manufacturer Firm of the \nYear.\n  John spent several years honing his business skills as an independent \nowner-operator of four thriving McDonald's restaurants. Seven years \nago, he sold his restaurants and purchased controlling interest in the \ncompany that now bears his name. John is Chairman and CEO of Lopez \nFoods, an Oklahoma City meat producer that is among the select few beef \nand pork suppliers for McDonald's 25,000 restaurants.\n  John took a struggling company and turned it into a vital force in \nOklahoma's economy. He has had tempting offers to relocate to other \nstates but has remained steadfastly loyal to Oklahoma and his workers. \nLeveraging his understanding of McDonald's standards and management \nphilosophy, he has continually expanded and modernized his operation, \nbringing it to the forefront in food safety, worker conditions, and \ndiversity. Today, a $160 million business with over 300 employees, \nLopez Foods is ranked third among all U.S. Hispanic-owned manufacturing \ncompanies.\n  A long time champion of minority employment opportunities, he has \nstrengthened his diversity program, such that minorities now make up \nnearly 55 percent of his workforce. John was selected by the National \nHispanic Employees' Association as its 1997 Entrepreneur of the Year.\n  John also actively supports charitable endeavors that give back to \nthe community, notably the Ronald McDonald House Charities. The United \nWay and the Jim Thorpe Rehabilitation Foundation benefit from his \nsupport as well.\n  Mr. President, the Commerce Department's award is a fitting tribute \nto a dynamic Oklahoman who continues to make a difference for our state \nand our nation. Congratulations to John Lopez, community leader, \ncompassionate citizen, and founder and head of the National Minority \nManufacturer Firm of the Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11127-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \ntreaties which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11127-4", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11127-S11128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO UNITA--\n                   MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 58\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the\n\n[[Page S11128]]\n\nanniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the \nFederal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that \nthe emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In \naccordance with this provision, I have sent the enclosed notice, \nstating that the emergency declared with respect to the National Union \nfor the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) is to continue in effect \nbeyond September 26, 1999, to the Federal Register for publication.\n  The circumstances that led to the declaration on September 26, 1993, \nof a national emergency have not been resolved. The actions and \npolicies of UNITA pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to \nthe foreign policy of the United States. United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolutions 864 (1993), 1127 (1997), 1173 (1998), and 1176 \n(1998) continue to oblige all member states to maintain sanctions. \nDiscontinuation of the sanctions would have a prejudicial effect on the \nprospect for peace in Angola. For these reasons, I have determined that \nit is necessary to maintain in force the broad authorities necessary to \napply economic pressure on UNITA to reduce its ability to pursue its \nmilitary campaigns.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, September 21, 1999.\n\n\n        notice--continuation of emergency with respect to unita\n\n  On September 26, 1993, by Executive Order 12865, I declared a \nnational emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to \nthe foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and \npolicies of the National Union of the Total Independence of Angola \n(UNITA), prohibiting the sale or supply by United States persons or \nfrom the United States, or using U.S. registered vessels or aircraft, \nor arms, related materiel of all types, petroleum, and petroleum \nproducts to the territory of Angola, other than through designated \npoints of entry. The order also prohibits the sale or supply of such \ncommodities to UNITA. On December 12, 1997, in order to take additional \nsteps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive \nOrder 12865, I issued Executive Order 13069, closing all UNITA offices \nin the United States and imposing additional sanctions with regard to \nthe sale or supply of aircraft or aircraft parts, the granting of take-\noff, landing and overflight permission, and the provision of certain \naircraft-related services. On August 18, 1998, in order to take further \nsteps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive \nOrder 12865, I issued Executive Order 13098, blocking all property and \ninterests in property of UNITA and designated UNITA officials and adult \nmembers of their immediate families, prohibiting the importation of \ncertain diamonds exported from Angola, and imposing additional \nsanctions with regard to the sale or supply of equipment used in \nmining, motorized vehicles, watercraft, spare parts for motorized \nvehicles or watercraft, mining services, and ground or waterborne \ntransportation services.\n  Because of our continuing international obligations and because of \nthe prejudicial effect that discontinuation of the sanctions would have \non prospects for peace in Angola, the national emergency declared on \nSeptember 26, 1993, and the measures adopted pursuant thereto to deal \nwith that emergency, must continue in effect beyond September 26, 1999. \nTherefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National \nEmergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national \nemergency with respect to UNITA.\n  This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and \ntransmitted to the Congress.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to establish a program of formula grants to the \nStates for programs to provide pregnant women with alternatives to \nabortion, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                 THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN'S RESOURCES ACT\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat offers compassionate choices for women facing unplanned \npregnancies. This bill, the Women and Children's Resources Act, \nestablishes an $85 million formula grant program to provide pregnant \nwomen with alternatives to abortion.\n  The Women and Children's Resources Act (WCRA) is modeled after a \nsuccessful program in Pennsylvania, Project Women In Need (WIN). This \nprogram was created under the Administration of former Governor Robert \nCasey and implemented during the current Administration of Governor Tom \nRidge. Project WIN has filled a critical void for women seeking support \nduring this confusing and uncertain time. The centers often receive 500 \ncalls per week.\n  This legislation is designed to meet the needs of women facing one of \nthe most important decisions of their lives. WCRA is intended to link \nwomen to a network of supportive organizations who are ready and \nwilling to offer assistance in the form of pregnancy testing, adoption \ninformation, prenatal and postpartum health care, maternity and baby \nclothing, food, diapers and information on childbirth and parenting. \nWomen can also receive referrals for housing, education, and vocational \ntraining. This bill seeks to provide compassionate choices to women; it \nis an effort to reach out to women and let them know they do not have \nto face this decision alone.\n  The bill directs federal funding to states through a formula based on \nthe number of out-of-wedlock births and abortions in a state as \ncompared to this sum for the nation. Upon receipt of this grant, states \nwill select their prime contractors from the private sector to \nadminister the program. The prime contractor will distribute Women and \nChildren's Resources Grants to crisis pregnancy centers, maternity \nhomes, and adoption services on a fee-for-service basis. Faith-based \nproviders may also participate in the program, but they may not \nproselytize. Further, state-wide toll-free referral systems and other \nmethods of advertisement will be established to make these services \nreadily available to pregnant women and their children. Low-income \nwomen will be given priority for these services.\n  Because WCRA seeks to offer alternatives to abortion, contractors and \nsubcontractors which receive funding under this bill cannot promote, \nrefer, or counsel for abortion. Further, these entities must be \nphysically and financially separate from any entity which promotes, \nrefers, or counsels for abortion.\n  Mr. President, not every woman facing an unplanned pregnancy knows \nthat supportive services exist. Many believe that the future they had \nplanned is no longer achievable. They feel alone and abandoned. Often, \nthey mistakenly believe that abortion is their only real choice. For \nthis reason, WCRA offers compassionate, life-affirming choices and \nsupport. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation \nappear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1605\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Women and Children's \n     Resources Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Women confronted with unplanned or crisis pregnancy \n     often are left with the impression that abortion is the only \n     choice that they have in dealing with their difficult \n     circumstances.\n       (2) Women often lack accurate information, supportive \n     counseling and other assistance regarding adoption and \n     parenting alternatives to abortion.\n       (3) Organizations that provide accurate information, \n     supportive counseling and other assistance regarding adoption \n     and parenting alternatives to abortion often lack sufficient \n     resources to reach women in need of their services and to \n     provide for their needs.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is--\n       (1) to promote childbirth as a viable and positive \n     alternative to abortion and to empower those facing unplanned \n     or crisis pregnancies to choose childbirth rather than \n     abortion;\n       (2) to carry out paragraph (1) by supporting entities and \n     projects that provide information, counseling, and support \n     services that assist women to choose childbirth and to make \n     informed decisions regarding the choice of adoption or \n     parenting with respect to their children; and\n       (3) to maximize the effectiveness of this Act by providing \n     funds only to those entities and projects that have a stated \n     policy of actively promoting childbirth instead of abortion \n     and that have experience in providing alternative-to-abortion \n     services.\n\n     SEC. 3. FORMULA GRANTS TO STATES FOR ALTERNATIVE-TO-ABORTION \n                   SERVICES PROGRAMS.\n\n       In the case of each State that in accordance with section 6 \n     submits to the Secretary of Health and Human Services an \n     application for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall make a \n     grant to the State for the year for carrying out the purposes \n     authorized in section 4(a) (subject to amounts being \n     appropriated under section 11 for the year). The grant shall \n     consist of the allotment determined for the State under \n     section 7.\n\n     SEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION OF STATE PROGRAMS TO \n                   PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE-TO-ABORTION SERVICES; \n                   ADMINISTRATION OF PROGRAMS THROUGH CONTRACTS \n                   WITH ENTITIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Grant funds provided under this Act may be \n     expended only for purposes of the establishment and operation \n     of a State program (carried out pursuant to contracts under \n     subsection (c)) designed to provide alternative-to-abortion \n     services (as defined in section 9) to eligible individuals as \n     described in subsection (b).\n       (b) Eligible Individuals.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), an individual is \n     an eligible individual for purposes of subsection (a) if--\n       (A) the individual is pregnant (or has reasonable grounds \n     to believe she may be pregnant);\n       (B) the individual (male or female) is the parent or legal \n     guardian of an infant under 12 months of age; or\n       (C) the individual is the spouse or other partner of an \n     individual described in subparagraph (A) or (B).\n       (2) Priority for low-income individuals.--Grant funds \n     provided under this Act shall be awarded only to States that \n     submit a grant application that assures that the State \n     program--\n       (A) will give priority to serving eligible individuals who \n     are from low-income families; and\n       (B) will not impose a charge on any eligible individual \n     from a low-income family except to the extent that payment \n     will be made by a third party (including a government agency) \n     that is authorized or is under legal obligation to pay such \n     charge.\n       (c) Administration of Programs Through Contracts With \n     Experienced Entities and\n\n[[Page S11132]]\n\n     Service Providers.--Grant funds provided under this Act shall \n     be awarded only to States that submit a grant application \n     that assures that the State program will be established and \n     operated in accordance with the following:\n       (1) Establishment and operation of program.--\n       (A) Prime contractor.--The State shall enter into a \n     contract with a nonprofit private entity that, under the \n     contract, shall be designated as the ``prime contractor'' and \n     shall have the principal responsibility for administering the \n     State program, including subcontracting with service \n     providers.\n       (B) Subcontracts with service providers.--The prime \n     contractor shall enter into subcontracts with service \n     providers for reimbursement of alternative-to-abortion \n     services provided to eligible individuals on a fee-for-\n     service basis, as provided in paragraph (2)(C)(ii).\n       (C) Expenditures of grant.--The prime contractor shall be \n     authorized to expend funds to administer the State program, \n     reimburse service providers, and to provide additional \n     supportive services to assist such providers in providing \n     alternative-to-abortion services to eligible individuals \n     consistent with the purposes of this Act, including providing \n     for a toll-free referral system, advertising of alternative-\n     to-abortion services, purchase of educational materials, and \n     grants for new sites and new project development.\n       (D) Requirement for prime contractors.--An entity may not \n     become a prime contractor unless, consistent with the overall \n     purpose of this Act, it has a stated policy of actively \n     promoting childbirth instead of abortion.\n       (E) Additional requirements for prime contractors.--An \n     entity may not become a prime contractor unless--\n       (i) for the 5-year period preceding the date on which the \n     entity applies to receive the contract, it has been engaged \n     primarily in the provision of core services or it has \n     operated a project that provides such services;\n       (ii) it already serves as a prime contractor pursuant to a \n     State appropriation designed to fund alternative-to-abortion \n     services;

A bill to provide annual payments to the States and counties \nfrom National Forest System lands managed by the Forest Service, and \nthe revested Oregon and California Railroad and reconveyed Coos Bay \nWagon Road grant lands managed predominately by the Bureau of Land \nManagement, for use by the counties in which the lands are situated for \nthe benefit of the public schools, roads, emergency and other public \npurposes; to encourage and provide new mechanism for cooperation \nbetween counties and the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land \nManagement to make necessary investments in federal lands, and reaffirm \nthe positive connection between Federal Lands counties and Federal \nLands; and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n       secure rural schools and community self-determination act\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it is time for Congress to enact a \nnew program that combines secure funding for county services with a \nfresh approach to the management of federal lands in rural communities. \nUnder our legislation counties will be connected to federal lands not \njust through the cutting of timber but also through important\n\n[[Page S11134]]\n\nroad maintenance projects, watershed improvements and programs that \npromote tourism and recreation.\n  Since 1908, natural resource dependent communities have received \nfederal funds for schools, roads and basic services based on the level \nof federal timber programs. The Forest Service cuts timber and the \ncounties receive revenue. This has long constituted the traditional \nrelationship between the counties and federal land management.\n  Now, as a result of changes in natural resource policies causing \ndeclines in timber production, many of our rural communities are \nfinding it almost impossible to fund essential programs for school \nchildren, infrastructure and other needs.\n  There is a crisis in rural, timber-dependent America that must be \naddressed now. This crisis can be addressed now and in the future by \nproviding secure, consistent funding to counties, and by encouraging a \nnew cooperative relationship between these communities and federal land \nmanagers.\n  Congress must promptly enact a new program that combines traditional \nfunding for county services with creative new policies that provide \nreal connections between rural communities and the federal lands they \ncherish.\n  Senator Craig and I have been discussing how this might be \naccomplished because we realize that no pending proposal addressing the \ncounty payment issue has won the support of both the Congress and the \nClinton administration.\n  In an effort to break this gridlock, we have developed the Secure \nRural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act bill.\n  Our proposal would work as follows:\n  Counties will receive a consistent payment amount each year totaling \n75% of the average of the top three federal land revenue years for \ntheir area between 1985 and the present, tied to the Consumer Price \nIndex for rural areas. That consistent payment amount will be a \ncombination of traditional 25% payments from the Forest Service and 50% \npayments from the Bureau of Land Management plus money from the general \ntreasury where the traditional revenue stream does not rise to the \nlevel of the necessary consistent payment amount.\n  Counties would receive an additional 25% of the average amount \ndescribed above from the general treasury to use for projects \nrecommended by local community advisory committees and approved by the \nForest Service or the Bureau of Land Management. These projects could \ninclude watershed restoration, road maintenance, or timber harvest, \namong other opportunities, as long as the project is in compliance with \nall applicable forest plans and environmental laws.\n  The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management would be required to \ncertify that a local consensus of environmental, industry, and other \nstakeholders exists, as well as approve the proposed project as \nenvironmentally sound. If consensus proposals cannot be developed in a \nparticular county, then the money would be made available to counties \nthat have developed such proposals. It bears repeating that all \nprojects would have to comply with all environmental laws and \nregulations, as well as all applicable forest plans.\n  We believe that this bill has the potential to break the impasse on \nthe county payment issue on Capitol Hill. But even more important, it \nrepresents an opportunity to forge a new charter for federal/county \ngovernment cooperation, to encourage local citizens to seek consensus-\nbased solution for resource conflicts, and to make critical investments \nin the stewardship of our federal lands.\n  This proposal will not please the proponents favoring pure decoupling \nof payments from timber harvest. It will also be opposed by those who \nare prepared to hobble the Forest Service or the Bureau of Land \nManagement if they feel the timber harvest levels are not high enough. \nOur objective is to break the gridlock on federal support of counties, \nwhile bringing the nature of the relationship between the federal land \nmanagers and public land dependent communities into the twenty-first \ncentury. This bill provides a foundation to help rural counties through \ntheir immediate crisis, and down a path that will make sense in the \nnext century.\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues from \nOregon, Senator Wyden and Senator Smith of Oregon to introduce the \nSecure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act of 1999.\n  Perhaps as much as any other state, our counties have suffered as \nfederal forest lands have been beset with conflict, and as the receipts \npromised to counties for educational purposes have decreased \ndramatically. Senator Wyden's counties are also suffering, as are other \ncounties throughout the West and the country as a whole. Today, we wish \nto propose a solution to this problem.\n  When the National Forests were withdrawn from the Public Domain at \nthe turn of the century, they were established with a basic commitment \nto local governments. Gifford Pinchot and other visionary \nconservationists of that day persuaded often-skeptical Federal and \nlocal government officials that retention of lands by the Federal \nGovernment, the creation of forest reserves, and the sustainable \nmanagement of these forests would be good for local people, good for \nlocal governments, good for the country, and good for the environment.\n  Pinchot and his peers based these assurances on the proposition that \nthe proceeds from the sustainable management and sale of the fiber, \nforage, and other resources from these reserved Federal lands would be \nshared between the local and Federal Governments. Consequently, \ncooperative management between local governments and Federal land \nmanagers--both the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management--\nhas been a hallmark of good intergovernmental cooperation in many of \nour states, including Oregon and Idaho. In many cases, local \ngovernments have incurred costs from increased police, search and \nrescue, and fire protection associated with federally owned lands.\n  Our Federal forests have been crucial to the education of our \nchildren. Receipts from the sale of Federal timber and other \ncommodities have been a vital component of county school and road \nbudgets. In many cases, these funds have supported school lunches, \nspecial education, and a variety of assistance measures for \ndisadvantaged children. In a very real sense, the bounty of our forests \nhas allowed us to give a hand to our most needy rural children, \nincluding Native Americans and Hispanics. So this should be the one \nfederal program through which concerns for the ``environment and \neducation'' can be fulfilled by the same thoughtful actions.\n  However, we live in a different time, and federal forest management \npolicies have become a source of considerable controversy. Timber sales \nhave been reduced. Revenues both to the Federal treasury and the \ncounties have decreased precipitously. Consequently, our rural school \nsystems are in crisis.\n  Unfortunately, rather than coming together to forge a solution to \nthese problems, the extremes on both sides of the equation are moving \nfurther apart. And they are placing our school children in the center \nof the controversy. One group seems to want to hold our school children \nhostage--to use the diminishing receipts and the deteriorating school \nsystems as leverage to advantage their side of the forest management \ndebate, favoring increased timber harvests. The other extreme would \nmake our rural school children orphans--sending them out into the \nwilderness with no secure financial support in order to expedite the \nachievement of their goal of eliminating federal timber sales.\n  Senator Wyden and I reject both of these extremes. We reject the \nnotion that we cannot provide the school systems with additional \nsupport, without increasing timber harvesting. At the same time, we \nreject the proposition that we should completely ``decouple'' the \nsupport for rural schools from any responsibility on the part of the \nfederal land management agencies, thereby totally separating local \nconcerns from federal land management.\n  Gifford Pinchot articulately outlined the responsibility that the \nFederal Government generally, and the Forest Service and BLM \nspecifically, assumed when the Federal forests were withdrawn from \ndisposal or later retained in Federal ownership. In its simplest terms, \nthis is a responsibility to provide local governments with a source of\n\n[[Page S11135]]\n\nrevenue that they are otherwise denied as a consequence of their \ninability to tax federal lands. That responsibility is still as \nrelevant today as it was at the turn of the century or during the \nDepression. It is still relevant today, irrespective of what options we \nchoose for how to manage our Federal forests.\n  Indeed, the most telling flaw in the proposal to decouple county \npayments from timber receipts is the notion that this responsibility--\nwilling assumed by the Forest Service at the turn of the century and \nBLM during the Depression--should be transformed into either the sole \nresponsibility of the federal taxpayer, or no one's responsibility as \nit becomes another entitlement program which the Federal Government and \ntaxpayers feel free to eliminate or reduce as their needs dictate.\n  Our proposal starts by establishing a set payment amount with which \nthe counties can provide support for rural school systems. This set \npayment is based upon an average of representative years of timber \nreceipts. In this respect, this proposal is similar to that offered by \nthe Clinton Administration, and to H.R. 2389 being considered in the \nHouse.\n  But here is where the similarity stops. We would not establish a \nseparate appropriations line--which in all likelihood would be \nunderfunded like the existing Payment in Lieu of Taxes System. Nor \nwould we impose the responsibility to meet this payment on the Forest \nService's or the BLM's annual budget.\n  Instead, we provide the Forest Service and the BLM with the authority \nto use any available receipts to meet these payments, and--only if \nthese receipts fall short--to make up the difference from unobligated \nfunds in the General Treasury. The intent here is to retain an \nobligation on the part of the Forest Service and the BLM, but to \nprovide some flexibility in meeting this obligation.\n  Based upon our experience with the Quincy Library Group, the \nApplegate Partnership, and elsewhere, we have come to conclude that the \nbest, recent decisions concerning federal resource management have \nenjoyed significant, local input. That is why our proposal contains a \nunique element--Senator Wyden's idea, actually--to foster both local \nconsensus and federal accountability around the management of federal \nlands.\n  Only 75 percent of the money to be given to the counties is provided \nfor the traditional school and road programs. The remaining 25 percent \nwould be provided to the counties for federal land management \ninvestments. The counties may fund either commercial or noncommercial \nprojects on the federal lands at the recommendation of local advisory \ngroups, and with the agreement of federal land managers. Projects must \ncomply with all environmental laws and regulations, and must be \nconsistent with the applicable land management plan. Any proceeds from \nrevenue generating projects will be split equally between the affected \ncounty and the federal land management agency. The county share will go \nto supporting schools and roads, while the federal share will go to \ninfrastructure maintenance or ecosystem restoration. Any funds left-\nover because of a lack of local agreement will be reallocated to \ncounties where agreement on resource stewardship priorities has been \nreached.\n  This proposal is as value-neutral concerning the resource debate as \nwe could make it.

We are in \nfavor of people of goodwill reasoning together to improve the quality \nof their lives and the quality of our environment. We cannot legislate \nan end to conflict. But we can use the legislative process to create an \nenvironment in which people are motivated to resolve their differences. \nThat is what we think this bill does.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \n        Roberts, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Hagel);\n  S. 1609. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrevise the update factor used in making payments to PPS hospitals under \nthe Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             the american hospital preservation act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nmy colleagues Senators Abraham, Bennett, Roberts, Burns, and Hagel, the \nAmerican Hospital Preservation Act of 1999.\n  Mr. President, the single biggest Medicare dollar issue facing \nhospitals today is a recently enacted reduction in the annual inflation \nadjustment for inpatient hospital payments. Prior to 1997, Medicare \nprovided an annual inflation adjustment for the PPS (prospective \npayment system) payments it makes to hospitals, according to the \npatient's diagnosis. The inflation update is calculated using the \nprojected increase in the hospital market basket indicator (MBI), which \nis just a way to calculate the overall inflation rate for hospital \ncosts.\n  To achieve savings in the Medicare program, the 1997 balanced budget \nagreement between Congress and the President included a tightening of \nthe MBI to ensure after-inflation savings in Medicare.\n  The bill I am introducing today will ease that tightening somewhat to \nreflect the savings we've made beyond our original estimate. \nSpecifically, the bill will restore .5 percent of those scheduled \nreductions in the MBI for FY '00 through '02.\n  This restoration will bring inpatient reimbursement rates closer in \nline to actual health care inflation, which is necessary given the \nsignificant reductions in government and private health insurance plans \nthat providers are increasingly experiencing. The bill will also serve \nto help hospitals and other institutional providers to adjust to new \noutpatient payment systems as well as greater than anticipated costs \nstemming from Y2K compliance, prescription drugs, and blood supplies. \nY2K compliance alone is estimated to cost hospitals between $7 billion \nand $8 billion. To make matters worse, the Health Care Finance \nAdministration (HCFA) has been making cuts in its payments to hospitals \nand other Medicare providers that are even beyond the savings Congress \noriginally called for.\n  My bill will provide a temporary shot in the arm to hospitals already \nhard hit by overall Medicare provider reimbursement cuts, and \nparticularly cuts in outpatient services. As hospitals learn to adjust \nto the new reimbursement system for outpatient services, continuing to \nreceive inflation adjustments might just mean the difference between \ndisaster and survival.\n  This bill also reflects the recommendation made by the Medicare \nPayment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) to provide the \\1/2\\ percent \nrestoration to the inpatient MBI.\n  This legislation is particularly justified considering that, far from \nthe $115 billion originally envisioned to be saved through FY '02, the \nMedicare system is now projected to be in about $200 billion better \nshape than anticipated. Savings in Medicare from hospitals alone are \nestimated to be $20 billion more than first estimated.\n  Mr. President, rural hospitals, and all hospitals for that matter, \noperate on very slim margins yet manage to bring cutting-edge medical \ncare to the communities they serve. But changes in Medicare payments to \nhospitals have put many institutions in a bind. Others are fighting for \ntheir lives.\n  Rural communities across Texas have felt the impact of hospital \nclosures for more than a decade now. When a rural hospital closes, \nlocal residents lose access to routine, preventative care, not to \nmention emergency services that can save life and limb. Doctors and \nother highly trained professionals move away. Then people must drive a \nhundred miles or more in some cases to get the care city dwellers take \nfor granted. Local economies suffer when jobs are lost. Existing \nbusinesses may have to move, and new businesses won't locate in places \nwhere health care is unavailable. Hospital closure can be a death-kneel \nfor struggling towns.\n\n  Other rescue efforts are moving forward to preserve the ability of \nour nation's hospitals and other Medicare providers to provide adequate \nhealth care to their patients. I am cosponsoring a number of bills that \nhave been introduced to strengthen hospitals' financial position. one \nwould limit hospitals' losses under the new outpatient reimbursement \nsystem; another would\n\n[[Page S11136]]\n\nincrease the reimbursements made to rural hospitals for seniors in \nMedicare Choice-Plus (managed care) plans.\n  Finally, my successful effort to ensure that states' tobacco \nsettlement funds stay in our state and out of the clutches of the \nfederal government has meant that many hospitals across the country are \nreceiving a financial boost. As a result, hospitals across Texas and \nhealth care systems across the country are in line to receive the \nlion's share of $246 billion in state tobacco settlement payments over \nthe next 25 years and beyond.\n  America's hospitals aren't out of the woods yet, but first aid is on \nthe way.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I urge my colleagues to support and \npass the American Hospital Preservation Act of 1999.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1609\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``American Hospital \n     Preservation Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

In particular, Senator \nTorricelli and I are negotiating with the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee on the details of the credit card disclosure \namendment.\n\n[[Page S11163]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              GRASSLEY (AND TORRICELLI) AMENDMENT NO. 1732\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Torricelli) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the bill, S. 625, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 6, line 12, insert ``11 or'' after ``chapter''.\n       On page 6, line 24, insert ``11 or'' after ``chapter''.\n       On page 12, lines 21 and 22, strike ``was not substantially \n     justified'' and insert ``was frivolous''.\n       On page 14, strike lines 8 through 14 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(C)(i) No judge, United States trustee, panel trustee, \n     bankruptcy administrator, or other party in interest shall \n     bring a motion under section 707(b)(2) if the debtor and the \n     debtor's spouse combined, as of the date of the order for \n     relief, have current monthly total income equal to or less \n     than the national or applicable State median household \n     monthly income calculated (subject to clause (ii)) on a \n     semiannual basis of a household of equal size.\n       ``(ii) For a household of more than 4 individuals, the \n     median income shall be that of a household of 4 individuals, \n     plus $583 for each additional member of that household.''.\n       On page 14, in the matter between lines 18 and 19, insert \n     ``11 or'' after ``chapter''.\n       On page 14, after the matter between lines 18 and 19, \n     insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 103.

CROUNSE\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe life of George P. Crounse, who passed away on August 22, 1999. His \ndeath marked the end of a five-decade career of entrepreneurship, \ncommunity building, and philanthropy in Paducah, Kentucky.\n  A native of Minneapolis, Minnesota, George worked for the Tennessee \nValley Authority and then Arrow Transportation Company, an Alabama \nfirm. George served his country in the U.S. Navy during World War II, \nand came to Paducah in 1945, to work for Igert Towing. George realized \nthe potential of his new hometown as a crossroads of the nation's major \nriver ways, and Crounse Corporation began operations in 1949, when its \nfirst towboat, The Alice, began operation on the Ohio River. This was \nthe beginning of George's dream to have his own company.\n  Crounse Corporation continued to grow over the years, and expanded \noperations to other parts of the inland waterway system. From that \nsingle boat, the Alice, grew one of the nation's largest towing \ncompanies which presently operates 25 towboats and 750 barges. Even \nmore amazing, the only time George borrowed money for his operation was \nthe $60,000 he borrowed to help construct that first boat. Aside from \nthat initial loan, the Crounse Corporation balance sheets never showed \ndebt. George continued to run the company as its chairman until only a \nfew weeks prior to his death.\n  George led not only his own company to prosperity, but helped \nestablish Paducah as a major center for river shipping, bringing \neconomic growth and jobs to the area. His business acumen also was \nhighly sought out in other areas such as banking. George was a firm \nbeliever in the principle of giving back to the community that had been \nso good to him, his family, and business. Entities such as the Paducah \nPublic Library, Tilghman High School, and the new River Heritage Museum \nbenefitted from George's generosity and guidance. We will probably \nnever know the true extent of George's work to better the lives of all \nthose in his community, and that's just the way George, a humble and \nmodest man, would have wanted it.\n  George Crounse perhaps will best be remembered as a dogged advocate \nfor education. In 1968, as a board member of Paducah Junior College, he \nhelped bring the school into the statewide network of the University of \nKentucky Community College System. George made sure that PJC retained \nownership\n\n[[Page S11172]]\n\nof the property and buildings, making it the only community college in \nKentucky controlled by the local community. When it appeared that the \narea was handicapped by the lack of an engineering school to serve \ncollege students in the area, George worked to establish an extension \nof the UK engineering school in Paducah. In fact, George and his wife, \nEleanor, gave $4 million to help build a suitable facility to house the \nprogram. Though George was reluctant, the building was named Crounse \nHall to acknowledge his leadership and generosity in bringing the dream \nto reality.\n  George's passing leaves a great void is left in Western Kentucky. His \nwas truly a life well lived. I offer condolences to his wife of many \nyears, Eleanor, and the entire Crounse family. I ask that my colleagues \njoin me in honoring the achievements and contributions of this \noutstanding Kentuckian, and that an article from the Paducah Sun be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n                   Crounse's Legacy One of Generosity\n\n                            (By Joe Walker)\n\n       People who knew barge company mogul George P. Crounse Sr. \n     remember him for his ceaseless giving to the Paducah area and \n     helping mold it into a hub of the nation's river industry.\n       ``I was honored to be able to tell people that George \n     Crounse was my friend,'' said Paducah Community College \n     President Len O'Hara. ``He was a wise, visionary and generous \n     man. There's no doubt that he did more to shape the face of \n     the college--both Paducah Community College and Paducah \n     Junior College--than any other individual.''\n       Mr. Crounse, 86, died at 8:24 p.m. Sunday at Western \n     Baptist Hospital. Friends may call at Roth Funeral Chapel \n     from 5 to 8 p.m. today.\n       Memorial services will be at 11 a.m. Wednesday at First \n     Presbyterian Church, where he was a member. The Rev. Lynn \n     Shurley will officiate. Burial will be private.\n       He was founder and past chairman of Crounse Corp., which he \n     built from a single, leased boat to one of the nation's \n     largest barge lines. He started the firm in 1948 after having \n     worked with the Tennessee Valley Authority and seen how its \n     dams improved navigation on the Tennessee River. He also knew \n     Paducah was ideally situated near the confluence of two major \n     rivers.\n       ``I had learned earlier that the Tennessee (river) is a \n     side street,'' be once wrote, ``and the Ohio and Mississippi \n     are the main highways.''\n       About a month ago, in failing health, Mr. Crounse became \n     chairman emeritus of the firm, making way for President Bill \n     Dibert to take over as chairman. Mr. Crounse's son, Avery, a \n     noted filmmaker, assumed the role of vice chairman.\n       My father was the first to show us to always plan for the \n     inevitable,'' said Avery Crounse, who returned to Paducah to \n     help run the business while continuing to make films. ``We've \n     often said that no one will fill his shoes, but several of us \n     will try to do that.''\n       The same is true for Paducah, which will miss Mr. Crounse \n     immeasurably, said O'Hara. ``People don't have any idea how \n     much he's given to this community, not only with his mind, \n     but also contributions of money.''\n       In 1968, as a member of the Paducah Junior College Board of \n     Trustees, Mr. Crounse fashioned the legal structure that \n     brought the school into the University of Kentucky community \n     college system while maintaining local ownership.\n       ``He made sure PJC retained ownership of the property and \n     buildings, so the community still owns the college,'' O'Hara \n     said. ``It's the only one in the nation that is locally \n     owned.''\n       Mr. Crounse, who told O'Hara repeatedly that higher \n     education was Paducah's greatest need, and his wife, Eleanor, \n     gave $4 million toward the PCC engineering school. But O'Hara \n     said Mr. Crounse was reluctant to publicize the gift or have \n     the school named after him and his wife.\n       ``I told my staff this morning that I'm so happy to have \n     been able to get it finished and for it to become a community \n     icon before his passing,'' O'Hara said.\n       Because of Mr. Counse's modesty, Paducahans will never know \n     the real extent of his beneficence, O'Hara said.\n       ``The (public) library owes a great deal to George Crounse. \n     Paducah Tilghman High School does, too, and a lot of other \n     less visible charities,'' he said. ``He was very quiet about \n     it and didn't want his named passed around, but he was always \n     there.''\n       In the 1960s, Mr. Crounse used his business savvy to boost \n     the growth of Peoples First Corp., which became a large, \n     regional banking firm before merging with Union Planters last \n     year Aubrey Lippert, head of Union Planters' Paducah \n     operation, was executive vice president when Mr. Crounse \n     was a Peoples board member.\n       ``He was probably one of the best thinkers I've seen in \n     being able to put together business plans and concepts and \n     then methodically talk through how you would execute them,'' \n     Lippert said. ``He was always very quiet, but as we used to \n     say around our board table, when Mr. Crounse speaks, you need \n     to listen because he always has his thoughts in order.''\n       Lippert said Mr. Crounse's generosity began when he came to \n     Paducah in 1948 and continued throughout his life.\n       ``He was a fine family man, had a great family and I have \n     great admiration for Eleanor,'' Lippert said. ``He was the \n     kind of citizen that you would love to have as many of as you \n     could possibly have in the community. We'll sure miss George \n     Crounse.''\n       A native of Minneapolis, Mr. Crounse worked for TVA and \n     later Arrow Transportation, a river towing company in \n     Sheffield, Ala. After serving in the U.S. Navy in World War \n     II, he joined Igert Towing in late 1945 and moved to Paducah. \n     All along, he had a desire to form his own company.\n       That happened three years later when Mr. Crounse put down \n     $40,000 in cash and borrowed $60,000, which he said gave him \n     $88,000 to build his first towboat and $12,000 for working \n     capital. He rented a towboat to get started.\n       In 1949, Mr. Crounse finished construction. The Alice, \n     named after his aunt, and immediately starting towing \n     chemical barges on the Ohio River. Steady growth of the \n     company led to purchasing barges in 1951 and finishing a \n     second towboat. The Louise, in 1952. By then, coal was the \n     main cargo.\n       John Cathey remembers working on The Alice and becoming \n     pilot of The Louise, named after Mr. Crounse's mother. As the \n     firm added towboats, Mr. Crounse ran out of family names and \n     began naming vessels after the wives of employees like \n     Cathey's wife, Hazel.\n       ``That was a real honor at that time,'' Cathey said. ``He \n     was a really smart man, and he had a good relationship with \n     all the employees. There were times when people came in off \n     the boats and were troubled, and he'd talk to them.''\n       Cathey saw the firm grow gradually, expanding to the Green \n     River in 1956 and buying Clifton Towing Co. in 1959. Renamed \n     Southern Barge Line Corp., the Clifton operation remained a \n     subsidiary until 1980.\n       In June 1965, Crounse Corp., moved from a converted \n     residence into its current headquarters at 2626 Broadway. In \n     1969, Mr. Crounse completed another major expansion by \n     opening a branch in Maysville in eastern Kentucky to serve \n     the upper Ohio River.\n       Cathey remained with Crounse Corp. for nearly 30 years, \n     retiring as senior vice president.

ERVIN III\n\n Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise to honor the life of a \nremarkable North Carolinian. Judge Sam Ervin III died last Saturday, \nSeptember 18, 1999 at the age of 73. His passing has left a void--his \nfamily and friends have lost a wonderful, caring man, North Carolina \nhas lost one of its finest citizens, and our nation has lost an \nhonorable and respected jurist.\n  Judge Ervin devoted his life to public service. Born March 2, 1926 in \nMorganton, North Carolina to the late Senator Sam Ervin, Jr. and \nMargaret Bruce Ervin, Judge Ervin studied at Davidson College. He \ninterrupted his undergraduate education for two years to serve in the \nU.S. Army during World War II. After attending Harvard Law School, he \nreturned to the Army, attaining the rank of colonel while serving in \nthe Judge Advocate General's Corps. In 1952, Judge Ervin returned to \npractice law in Morganton, where he would remain for the better part of \nthe rest of his life. Judge Ervin served in the North Carolina General \nAssembly between 1965 and 1967, when Governor Dan Moore appointed Judge \nErvin to the North Carolina Superior Court bench.\n  Judge Ervin was considered among the ablest Superior Court Judges of \nhis time. Lawyers trusted that Judge Ervin would afford all litigants a \nfull and impartial hearing and would ground his decision in the law. He \nwas often selected by the Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme \nCourt to preside over controversial trials from which local judges \nrecused themselves.\n\n[[Page S11173]]\n\n  After thirteen years as a trial judge, Judge Ervin was sworn in on \nMay 25, 1980 as a judge on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals of the \nUnited States. When he was elevated to the chief judgeship of the \nFourth Circuit in 1989, he became only the second North Carolinian to \noccupy this important position. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, Jr. \nonce described Judge Ervin as ``the very model of what a judge, \nespecially the presiding judge of a great court, should be.''\n  Judge Ervin left his mark in hundreds of decisions. He always was \nfair and principled. He approached cases with a deep understanding of \nthe law, but never forgetting the common sense he developed growing up \nin Morganton. Just last year, he participated in two important \ndecisions affecting elections in North Carolina. In the middle of the \nelection year, the district court issued an opinion striking down North \nCarolina's campaign finance statute. Judge Ervin issued a stay on the \ndecision until the election season ended to prevent the election from \ndevolving into confusion. Similarly, he participated in a decision to \nkeep the primary election on May 5, 1998 for all offices except for the \nU.S. House, which was subject to a redistricting lawsuit, to minimize \ndisruption for the other candidates and the electorate.\n  Judge Ervin had the courage to stand up for his beliefs, which he \nalways did in his typical gracious manner. In February 1997, as a \nwitness in a congressional hearing about proposed legislation to reduce \nthe number of judgeships on the Fourth Circuit, he politely took issue \nwith the Chairman of the hearing. He believed that the court's ability \nto render swift and certain justice would be enhanced by the filling of \ntwo long vacant positions, not by eliminating them. He stated that the \ndegree of delegation by circuit court judges was greater than ideal and \nthat he would like to be able to devote greater personal attention to \nthe matters that came before him.\n  Because he was such a remarkable person and a dedicated jurist, he \nearned the lifelong admiration of dozens of young people who clerked \nfor him over the years. He also earned the respect of his peers in the \nlegal profession, as well as many honors over the years. Just this \nyear, the North Carolina Bar Association accorded him its Liberty Bell \nAward for ``strengthening the American system of freedom under law'' \nand the North Carolina Academy of Trial Lawyers presented him its \nOutstanding Appellate Judge Award.\n  The Judge cherished his family, which is nothing they do not already \nknow. What he knew about the important, everlasting things in life, he \nsaid that he learned from his parents, his wife Elisabeth, his two \nsons, Jim and Robert, and his two daughters, Betsy and Margaret. I send \nmy heartfelt condolences to Elisabeth and their children. Please know \nthat you are in my prayers.\n  In his commencement speech at Campbell University this past spring, \nhe told the graduates, ``[I]f you seek truth, if you keep faith, and \nhave courage, life will release you from the little things and give you \npeace of mind and heart.'' Judge Ervin left this world released of the \nlittle things with peace of mind and peace of heart because throughout \nhis life, he never stopped searching for truth, he kept faith in God, \nand he repeatedly demonstrated courage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11173-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO AMY ISAACS\n\n   Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise in recognition of the \n30th anniversary of Amy Isaacs' association with Americans for \nDemocratic Action (ADA), the nation's oldest independent liberal \nadvocacy organization dedicated to individual liberty and building \neconomic and social justice at home and abroad.\n  Ms. Isaacs has been a driving force within the organization, shaping \nits agenda for three decades, working on a broad range of issues \naffecting domestic, foreign, economic, social and environmental policy. \nShe began her career at ADA as an intern in 1969 and has moved up \nthrough the ranks serving ably as Director of Organization, Executive \nAssistant to the Director, Deputy National Director and currently, as \nADA National Director. On the domestic front, she has focused the \norganization's attention on such pressing issues as preserving social \nsecurity, fighting for full civil rights and quality health care for \nall, and working to pass campaign finance reform legislation.\n  Throughout her life Ms. Isaacs has worked tirelessly at home and \nabroad to raise awareness of the injustice of all forms of \ndiscrimination. She is a graduate of the American University in \nWashington, DC, attended classes at the University of Cologne in \nGermany and was a delegate to the Young Leaders Conference for the \nAmerican Council on Germany. She also served as a member to a \nbipartisan observer delegation to the Liberal International Party \nCongress in Stockholm, Sweden.\n  Ms. Isaacs has been a true champion for social and economic justice. \nPursuing these ideals comes as naturally to Amy as breathing. She is a \ngifted and wonderfully compassionate and committed human being and I am \npleased to congratulate her on her thirty years of service to the \nADA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11173-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE MARRIAGE OF PATRICK JOHN McGONIGLE AND JENNIFER BRAVO\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. \nJack Warner, the former Chairman and CEO of Gulf States Paper \nCorporation. I recognize him for the contributions that he and his \nwife, Elizabeth, have made to Tuscaloosa and the surrounding community.\n  A man of strong character and a wealth of old-fashioned common sense, \nJack Warner has persevered and triumphed no matter what the challenge; \nthrough wars, labor strikes, and tough financial and personal \ncircumstances. Through it all, he has remained steadfast in his beliefs \nand a pioneer from which others might draw inspiration. He has made \ntough business decisions over the years, and through it all has kept \nGulf States Paper privately owned, a challenging endeavor when so many \nother companies have felt the pressure to go public. His gritty \ndetermination has led to financial success, which has helped him to \npursue his many philanthropic interests and also allowed him to give \nback to the Tuscaloosa community.\n  It was through many obstacles and achievements that Jack Warner \ndeveloped the strong character and firm convictions that are with him \ntoday. A graduate of Culver Military Academy in Culver, Indiana in \n1936, he moved on to college at Washington & Lee University to pursue a \ndegree in business administration. Following graduation, he promptly \nenlisted in the U.S. Army to perform what he saw as his duty to serve \nthe country. As a commissioned officer with the Mars Task Force in the \nBurma theater of operations, he served the United States in exemplary \nfashion. Assigned in the Army's last horse-mounted unit, his calvary \noutfit was sent to India to pack supplies along the Burma trail. Once \nthere, Jack Warner's unit was confronted with difficulties and \nobstacles which would have taken the spirit out of most men. Jack \npersevered, however, and his regiment ended up making a significant \ncontribution to the War effort. This short episode in the life of Mr. \nWarner encapsulates his great spirit and will. He has always \ndemonstrated persistence through adversity, and a commitment to get the \njob done right.\n  Perhaps it is this quality which has led to the astonishing success \nof Jack\n\n[[Page S11174]]\n\nWarner's business endeavors. During his tenure as President and \nChairman of the Board of Gulf States Paper Corporation, the company \nexperienced enormous growth. The business which has become synonymous \nwith his name today enjoys a very healthy portfolio. This success has \npaved the way for many other business ventures and activities for Jack. \nHe is the past director of the American Paper Institute, the past \nchairman and three-term president of the Alabama Chamber of Commerce, \nthe past two-term president of the Greater Tuscaloosa Chamber of \nCommerce, a Director of the First Alabama Bank of Tuscaloosa, a past \ndirector of the Alabama Great Southern Railroad Company, a past \ndirector of the First National Bank of Tuscaloosa, just to name a few. \nHe is truly a fixture in the Tuscaloosa business community.\n  Jack Warner has not taken his tremendous business success for \ngranted. In fact, he has used his position in the community to become \nactively involved in the growth and development of Tuscaloosa. Through \nhis efforts, he has made a tremendous impact on Tuscaloosa and the \nsurrounding area. His numerous civic activities attest to his \nunyielding commitment towards improving the community in which he \nlives. A few of his current civic activities include membership in the \nMount Vernon Advisory Committee, the Decorative Arts Trust Board of \nGovernors, active Director of the University Club of Tuscaloosa, \nCommodore of the North River Yacht Club, as well as Elder in the First \nPresbyterian Church of Tuscaloosa. His former activities include a term \nas the Chairman of the Alabama Council on Economic Education, President \nof the YMCA of Metropolitan Tuscaloosa, President of the Druid City \nHospital Foundation, as well as a member of the National Board of the \nSmithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. He has received numerous \nhonors and awards for his efforts, including the Distinguished \nAchievement Award from the President's Cabinet at the University of \nAlabama, the Frances G. Summersell Award from the University of \nAlabama, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Alabama State Council \non the Arts, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Greater Tuscaloosa \nChamber of Commerce, the Lifetime Preservation Achievement Award from \nthe Tuscaloosa County Preservation Society, and induction into the \nAlabama Business Hall of Fame.\n  Jack Warner has truly been an integral part in all aspects of the \nTuscaloosa community. It is with great pleasure that I recognize his \nefforts and rise in tribute to all that he has done for Tuscaloosa and \nthe state of Alabama. His commitment and sense of civic duty is greatly \nappreciated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11174-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A TRIBUTE TO LENNY ZAKIM\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one \nof the most inspirational and unifying individuals I have had the \nprivilege of knowing and working with. Today, in Boston, people from \nall over Massachusetts are gathering to recognize and celebrate Lenny \nZakim, Executive Director of the New England Regional Office of the \nAnti-Defamation League, and I rise today to join them in honoring this \nimportant friend. This evening's ceremony, though, has a purpose far \ndeeper and broader than his notable leadership at the ADL. Tonight is a \nreflection of the love that has flowed from this man to the people of \nBoston, and now, it's flowing back to him as he confronts his own \npersonal challenges.\n  For over 20 years, Lenny Zakim has courageously traveled the world, \nbringing a message of tolerance and respect. Through hundreds of \nmeetings, conferences and visits to the countless places of worship, \nLenny has turned racial and cultural divides into bonds amongst people \nand built bridges between communities. Mr. President, one of this \ncountry's greatest inspirational figures, Helen Keller, said in 1890, \n``We could never learn to be brave and patient if there was only joy in \nthe world,'' and I believe that this quote captures the values and \ngoals that have guided Lenny Zakim's life. What Helen Keller was saying \nis that our true nature only surfaces when we are confronted with \nadversity, and, time and time again, Lenny has turned ignorance into \nenlightenment, crisis into opportunity, and hostility into support.\n  Groundbreaking collaborations with the Ten Point Coalition and \nCardinal Bernard Law illuminate the often-overlooked common ground that \nwe quietly cherish but celebrate together far too infrequently. His \npublic meditations on subjects such as the Middle East, relationships \nbetween African Americans and Jews, and Judeo-Christian values in a \nmodern world elevate our public dialogue and focus our attention on \nsome of the most compelling issues of the day. On issues global he has \nworked with Hosni Mubarak, Menachem Begin, Yitzak Shamir, and Shimon \nPeres. I am fortunate to share his vision of a Middle East with a \nsustainable peace, a vision that he sculpted and shared with my \npredecessor, Paul Tsongas.\n  Beyond the global dimension of his work, perhaps his most expansive \nand wisest endeavors have been those with children and young adults. He \nis one of the founders of A World of Difference, an anti-bias education \nproject that has had over 350,000 teachers participate in lessons that \nbring the lessons of tolerance and cooperation to classrooms for \nthousands of children every day. He also started Team Harmony, the \nnation's largest annual, interracial gathering of youth. Every year, \nthousands of young adults from Greater Boston come together and pledge \nto bigotry and celebrate their support of diversity and inclusion. \nThese two programs will allow Lenny's vision of a peaceful and \nrespectful world to reach far beyond those that he meets directly. I \nhave witnessed firsthand how A World of Difference and Team Harmony \nwill help build a better world for all our citizens.\n  Tonight's event will bring together Lenny's hundreds of friends and \nsupporters to raise funds for the completion of the Zakim Center for \nIntegrated Therapies at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Collectively, \nwe thank Lenny for all of his work, and most importantly for what he \nhas brought out in all of us and our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11174-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11174-S11175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  INSTALLATION OF WILLIAM M. HOUSTON AS PRESIDENT OF THE INDEPENDENT \n                      INSURANCE AGENTS OF AMERICA\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to commend a fellow \nColoradan, William M. Houston of Denver, who will be installed as \nPresident of the nation's largest insurance association--the \nIndependent Insurance Agents of America (IIAA)--later this month in Las \nVegas. Bill is branch manager of Riedman Insurance Corporation, an \nindependent insurance agency located in Denver.\n  Bill began his volunteer service within the insurance industry at the \nlocal and state levels. He served on numerous committees of both the \nIndependent Insurance Agents of Denver and the Independent Insurance \nAgents of Colorado, including serving as president of both \norganizations. In 1976, Bill was awarded the Local Board President of \nthe Year Award and in 1987 was honored as Colorado Insuror of the year. \nBill was elected to IIAA's Executive committee in October 1994 and was \nhonored by his peers when they named him President-Elect of the \nAssociation last fall.\n  While on this Association leadership panel; he was worked to \nstrengthen the competitive standing of independent insurance agents by \nhelping to provide the tools they need to run more successful \nbusinesses. Over the years, Mr. Houston has been active on several IIAA \ncommittees, and has represented the state of Colorado as its \nrepresentative to IIAA's National Board of State Directors for six \nyears.\n  Aside from his professional volunteer work, Bill also has \ndistinguished himself as an active and concerned member of his \ncommunity. He is past president of both the Gyro Club and the \nUniversity Club of Denver, and Trustee (Director) of the National \nSports Center for the Disabled in Winter Park, Colorado.\n  Currently, Bill serves on the Board of Directors for the Denver \nRotary Club and as an elder in the Wellshire Presbyterian Church. Bill \nalso proudly served his country in the U.S. Marine Corps, initially as \na first lieutenant on active duty and as a captain in the Marine Corps \nReserves.\n  I am proud of my fellow Coloradan's accomplishments and bid him a \nsuccessful year as president of the Independent Insurance Agents of \nAmerica.\n\n[[Page S11175]]\n\nAs his past accomplishments show, Bill will serve his fellow agents \nwith distinction and strong leadership as he leads IIAA into the new \nmillennium. I wish him and his lovely wife, Jane, all the best as IIAA \nPresident and First Lady.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11175-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF WOMEN'S ADVOCATES\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. I speak today in recognition of the 25th \nanniversary of Women's Advocates, Inc., our Nation's first battered \nwomen's shelter, located in St. Paul, MN.\n  It is with gratitude and with pride that I recognize the unyielding \ndedication of the staff, the volunteers and the supporters of Women's \nAdvocates. It was in 1974 that the doors of this shelter first opened \nto women and their children seeking respite from domestic violence. At \na time when it took great courage and strength, women stood together to \nsay that violence in our homes must end. Today, having provided \nadvocacy, shelter and support services to over 25,000 women and \nchildren, and having spent countless hours teaching our school children \nand community members about the impact of domestic violence, Women's \nAdvocates stands as a pillar of grace and triumph in the great state of \nMinnesota.\n  So today we hail Executive Director, Lisbet Wolf, and the courageous \nwomen at Women's Advocates, who 25 years ago, gave women and children's \nsafety a permanent place in our nation's history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11175-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, Friday, September 17th was National \nPOW/MIA Recognition Day. On this day, we remember, give tribute to, and \nstand in solidarity with the loved ones and families of the thousands \nof Soldiers, Sailors, Marines and Airmen who became Prisoners of War \nand Missing in Action.\n  These Americans swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution \nand carried that promise through to great sacrifice for their nation. \nWhile thousands died, many others endured years in starved, tortured, \nisolated misery before regaining their freedom. Their perseverance, \nintegrity and heroism are shining examples of the core values on which \nthis nation was founded and became great.\n  As a former Navy officer, I feel strongly that the United States \nGovernment must fulfill its commitments to the men and women who serve \nin the Armed Forces. One of these commitments is ensuring the return of \nPOWs and MIAs at the end of hostilities. The vigorous pursuit of this \ncommitment must continue through on-site investigations being \nundertaken in Indochina and through a fuller examination of records in \nthe United States, Russia, and Southeast Asia.\n  Through much diligence and hard work, and gradually improving \nrelations with various nations since 1973, 529 American servicemen, \nformerly listed as unaccounted-for, have been recovered, identified and \nreturned to their families. However, 2054 Americans remain unaccounted-\nfor from the war in Southeast Asia, with 1,530 in Vietnam. We have \nfocused, and rightly so, many of our efforts on Southeast Asia, but we \nmust also honor those who were held prisoner and who are missing in \naction in other remote parts of the globe. More than 80,000 Americans \nremain missing and unaccounted for from World War I, World War II and \nthe Korean conflict, and countless others from the Cold War.\n  Since the end of the Cold War, I have visited Russia and other states \nof the former Soviet Union on several occasions. During meetings with \nhigh level Russian government personnel and members of the Russian \nmilitary. I have made it clear that Russian cooperation in these areas \nis a necessity.\n  I am hopeful that American efforts will lead to information and/or \nevidence of the fates of U.S. servicemen still missing from conflicts \nduring the Cold War. I likewise encourage my colleagues who interact \nwith officials of Laos, Cambodia, Korea, Vietnam and others to press \nfor the same commitment from those officials.\n  Headway is being made, but there is still a long way to go before we \nhave the fullest possible accounting of all POW/MIA personnel. Our \ngreat and free Nation owes eternal gratitude to all POW/MIAs and their \nfamilies for their supreme sacrifice, but we in the Senate shall not \nrest until all are accounted for. I urge you the administration, the \nDepartments of Defense and State, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the \nNational Security Agency to redouble our efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11175-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BOYS OF SUMMER\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nthe achievements of the Toms River East Little League baseball team, \nwho overcame great odds to return their team to the National Little \nLeague final for the second year in a row.\n  The Toms River squad, known as the ``Beast of the East'', were Little \nLeague world champions in 1998. This year, they sought to be only the \nsecond American team ever in the fifty-three year history of the Little \nLeague World Series to repeat as world champions. Unlike professional \nsports, where champions often repeat using much the same lineup from \none year to the next, Toms River attempted to repeat as champions using \nalmost an entirely new roster, with ten of the twelve players new to \nthe team for the 1999 season. Although they fell one game short of \nreturning to the Little League World Series, the fact that Toms River \nadvanced to the national final in 1999 is an impressive accomplishment \nin its own right.\n  In the aftermath of their exciting run last year, I had the \nopportunity to meet many of the players and parents involved with the \nteam. I was impressed not only by the skill, poise, and manners with \nwhich the team conducted itself on and off the field, but also by the \nway that the entire community of Toms River rallied around the team. \nThe true character of the squad was demonstrated this year, when even \nin defeat, they displayed the good sportsmanship and class that is a \nhallmark of the Toms River community.\n  Truly, these ``boys of summer'' have given us another August to \nremember with their fine play and tremendous love of the game.

He has a genuine zest for life. Sherm's energy has \nhelped him found and run one of the countries top 20 fastest-growing \nprivate companies, UniDial Communications, Inc. Sherm founded UniDial \njust six years ago with six employees and, in that short time, has \nturned UniDial into a 600-employee operation and an unbelievable \nsuccess story.\n  Some of the most successful businessmen become great because they see \nan untapped market and make it theirs--and that is what Sherm has done \nwith the communications industry in UniDial. Intuitively picking up on \nemerging opportunities in the communications field after the telephone \nindustry was deregulated, Sherm dove into the business head first. He \nstarted by investing in other telecommunications companies, and then \nfounded the now-booming UniDial in 1993.\n  As well as being a great businessman, Sherm has always been a good \nfriend and family man. He boasts a terrific wife, two wonderful \nchildren, and two (soon-to-be-three) much-doted-upon grandchildren. \nSherm, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, I express my heartfelt \nadmiration for your accomplishments, congratulate you on your success, \nand wish you the best in your future endeavors. Thank you for creating \nhundreds of jobs for your fellow Kentuckians, and for making such a \nsignificant contribution to our state's economies and communities.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a copy of an article that ran in the \nLouisville\n\n[[Page S11176]]\n\nVoice-Tribune on August 25, 1999, be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  The article follows.\n\n                          Making a Big Splash\n\n                          (By Susan McDonald)\n\n       Sherman Henderson says a lot of people have trouble \n     understanding what he does for a living, but he must do it \n     pretty well.\n       UniDial Communications Inc., the company he founded with \n     half a dozen employees only six years ago, is now among the \n     20 fastest-growing private companies in the country, \n     according to Inc. magazine. That's not bad for a company \n     Henderson conceived over breakfast one August morning at a \n     local Denny's restaurant.\n       UniDial is now poised for still more growth. The company, \n     which built its business primarily as a reseller of long-\n     distance telephone service and other communications products, \n     is expanding to meet the growing demand for technology, \n     Henderson said. UniDial recently announced plans to build its \n     own nationwide telecommunications network, called xios, to \n     offer integrated data, voice, Internet and other telecom \n     services. Its new 75,000-square-foot building at Eastpoint \n     Business Center will soon be followed by more new facilities.\n       But although UniDial has become a familiar name, its \n     business remains a mystery to many, Henderson said.\n       ``It's hard for people to understand what we do,'' he said. \n     ``We're a communications company. We communicate, and we have \n     all kinds of vehicles to do it with, whether it's a fax \n     machine, a voice over a hard line, data transmission, \n     videoconferencing, conference calls, or whatever.''\n\n\n                          Embracing technology\n\n       Henderson and Unidial have capitalized on people's hunger \n     for more communication and information, he said. Although \n     Americans are inundated with mail, voice messages, and e-\n     mail, they want more, said Henderson who can quote a wealth \n     of facts, figures and statistics about the fast pace of \n     technology and the factors that drive it.\n       Still, Henderson, who is in his 50s, said it's difficult \n     for members of his generation to keep up with the quick pace \n     of technological advancements.\n       ``My generation has two problems,'' he said. ``We're not \n     educated in the field of technology because we didn't grow up \n     with it. The second strike against our generation is our \n     habits. We don't embrace technology because we all have gray \n     hair. To keep up is tremendously tough, even for me, and I'm \n     in the business.''\n       Henderson does keep up, though, making extensive use of the \n     Internet to conduct business, make travel arrangements, shop \n     and more.\n       ``I do a lot of fun things, like seeing where the Rolling \n     Stones are playing next, or where is Elton John playing, or \n     get information about golf courses,'' he said.\n\n\n                       from diapers to high tech\n\n       Henderson's experience in the telecommunications industry \n     isn't much older than UniDial itself. Before starting the \n     company, his varied business experience included real estate \n     development, sales and marketing, and a stint at Proctor & \n     Gamble, where he ``was the original Pampers guy,'' he said.\n       ``I was one of the three guys on the team that actually \n     developed the product back in the 1960s,'' Henderson said. \n     ``Actually, we didn't create a product. We created an \n     industry because there was no disposal diaper at that time.''\n       Henderson began to see the opportunities that emerged after \n     deregulation of the telephone industry, and he owned other \n     telecom companies before starting UniDial in 1993. He has \n     since become a national leader in the industry and is \n     currently chairman of the Telecommunications Resellers \n     Association, a 700-member trade organization for businesses \n     reselling long distance and other services.\n       Although UniDial is continuing to grow in national \n     prominence, Henderson, a native of Louisville, said he is \n     most proud that the company is a home-grown product.\n       ``The neat thing about this company is that it was founded \n     here and it was built here,'' he said. ``It was built by \n     Louisville employees, and it's turned into a nationwide \n     deal.''\n       And although the company could operate from anywhere , its \n     headquarters will stay in Louisville, he said.\n       ``The opportunity we have as a company is to lead Kentucky \n     and this part of the country into a development stage for all \n     these young kids who are coming out of school,'' said \n     Henderson. ``We want them to stay here and help us build what \n     is going to be the future, and the future is in technology \n     and media.''\n\n\n                            energy to spare\n\n       Henderson's energy seems boundless, manifesting itself in \n     foot-tapping and leg-waggling when he is forced to sit down. \n     During a recent meeting with a group of local business \n     leaders, ``They were astounded by my energy,'' Henderson \n     said. ``They said, `You know, Sherm, you're not a young puppy \n     anymore,' and it's true, but energy comes from your \n     environment and from the environment that you allow in your \n     mind.''\n       Henderson finds outlets for that energy in golf, spending \n     time with his wife, two children and two grandchildren (with \n     another on the way), and promoting his beloved Florida State \n     University Seminoles. Since attending the school on a \n     swimming scholarship, Henderson has remained active in alumni \n     activities, including a recently completed stint as chairman \n     of the Florida State Seminole Boosters. Football coach Bobby \n     Bowden is a golf partner and someone from whom Henderson said \n     he has learned a great deal.\n       ``He's a winner, and you learn from winners,'' Henderson \n     said. ``If you keep pushing for whatever your objective is, \n     if you get 80 to 85 percent of that, you win.''\n       Judging from UniDial's dramatic success, Henderson has \n     learned some secrets of winning. He gets to know the \n     company's nearly 600 employees at monthly small-group \n     lunches, gives managers plenty of autonomy, and tells \n     colleagues not to be afraid to make mistakes and ``use both \n     ends of the pencil,'' he said. He has also developed a simple \n     personal philosophy to help him keep things in perspective.\n       ``I wake up every day and say this to myself: God first, \n     family second, and the rest will happen.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/21/senate-section/article/S11176-1", "month":

(a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The survival of American culture is dependent upon the \n     survival of the sacred institution of marriage.\n       (2) The decennial census is required by section 2 of \n     article 1 of the Constitution of the United States, and has \n     been conducted in every decade since 1790.\n       (3) The decennial census has included marital status among \n     the information sought from every American household since \n     1880.\n       (4) The 2000 decennial census will mark the first decennial \n     census since 1880 in which marital status will not be a \n     question included on the census questionnaire distributed to \n     the majority of American households.\n       (5) The United States Census Bureau has removed marital \n     status from the short form census questionnaire to be \n     distributed to the majority of American households in the \n     2000 decennial census and placed that category of information \n     on the long form census questionnaire to be distributed only \n     to a sample of the population in that decennial census.\n       (6) Every year more than $100,000,000,000 in Federal funds \n     are allocated based on the data collected by the Census \n     Bureau.\n       (7) Recorded data on marital status provides a basic \n     foundation for the development of Federal policy.\n       (8) Census data showing an exact account of the numbers of \n     persons who are married, single, or divorced provides \n     critical information which serves as an indicator on the \n     prevalence of marriage in society.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the United States Census Bureau--\n       (1) has wrongfully decided not to include marital status on \n     the census questionnaire to be distributed to the majority of \n     Americans for the 2000 decennial census; and\n       (2) should include marital status on the short form census \n     questionnaire to be distributed to the majority of American \n     households for the 2000 decennial census.\n       Sec. 344. It is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary \n     should expeditiously amend title 14, chapter II, part 250, \n     Code of Federal Regulations, so as to double the applicable \n     penalties for involuntary denied boardings and allow those \n     passengers that are involuntarily denied boarding the option \n     of obtaining a prompt cash refund for the full value of their \n     airline ticket.\n       Sec. 345.
