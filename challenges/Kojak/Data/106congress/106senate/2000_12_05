What a career he has had and what an \nexample he sets for all of us: A soldier, a patriot, a teacher, a \npolitical leader, a man of good will, and a gentle man. We appreciate \nhis presence every day and hope he has a very happy day today and many \nmore to come.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his kind \nremarks. He has done a great job. I don't know of anyone who has done \nbetter. We are proud of him. I want him to know it. We are proud of the \nSenate and all it has accomplished, and we expect to do even more as \nthe days go by.\n  Mr. LOTT.

He is a wonderful example for all of us.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my congratulations \nto Senator Thurmond on his 98th birthday. Few people are lucky enough \nto reach this milestone in their lives, but fewer still, if any, can \nclaim a life as rich and colorful as Strom Thurmond's. He is what the \nlawyers call ``sui generis''--one of a kind, unique. Last year, a \nmonument to Senator Thurmond was dedicated on the grounds of the South \nCarolina Statehouse. It was a deserving tribute, but hardly necessary \nto mark his many contributions to our State and Nation. He is, after \nall, a living political icon. Generations of South Carolinians refer to \nhim affectionately as ``Strom'' and his birthday is a celebration of \nservice to our State. I know the people of South Carolina join me and \nPeatsy in sending Senator Thurmond our best wishes for a wonderful day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/05/senate-section/article/S11547-7", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11547-S11548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

When we \nreconvene, the Senate may continue morning business. However, it is \npossible the Senate will have one or as many as four votes this \nafternoon. I don't want to lock it in at this point, but it is possible \nwe could have a recorded vote at 2:15 on the continuing resolution that \nwould be for 2 days. We also could have one or more votes this \nafternoon on or in relation to cloture on the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 2415, the bankruptcy legislation.\n\n[[Page S11548]]\n\n  I see the distinguished assistant Democratic leader here. He may want \nto comment on that. I emphasize that we do expect at least a couple, \nmaybe as many as four, votes this afternoon.\n  I welcome back all Senators of the 106th Congress. I hope this \nsession can come to an early conclusion. It would be very important at \nthis time, considering all that is going on. If we show we can act \nquickly on the remaining appropriations bills and dispose of the tax \nand Medicare issues, that will be very positive for our country. I look \nforward to working with the chairman and senior member of the \nAppropriations Committee to see if we can get that worked out and see \nif there is any way that maybe we can complete it by Thursday night \nwhen this continuing resolution will expire. We will get more \ninformation to all Senators later this afternoon, after consultation \nwith the Democratic leaders.\n  I yield to Senator Reid.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Byrd would like 15 minutes prior to \nthe CR vote, to be divided between him and Senator Stevens, to talk \nabout that.\n  During our party conferences, we will find out if we need the two \nextra votes on bankruptcy. It is my understanding what the leader wants \nis to have a vote on cloture on bankruptcy. If we have to go through \nthe drill, we will have to have a couple votes before we get to that. I \nwill talk to the people in the Democratic Conference at 12:30 today and \nreport back to the leader as quickly as I can.\n  I am happy to hear the majority leader talking about moving forward \nwhere we left off before the lame duck session started. There has been \na tremendous amount of work that has gone into those appropriation \nbills, the balanced budget problem we have, the add-ons, and the other \nthings the leader has indicated we will try to move, rather than have a \nCR. I hope we do that. We await the direction of the majority in the \nnext few days so we can go home and have a good Christmas.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Reid. We will have further announcements \nafter consultation with the leadership on both sides of the aisle.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/05/senate-section/article/S11548-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to express how much I am \ngoing to miss our colleague, Connie Mack, who retires at the end of \nthis Congress, after three terms in the House of Representatives and \ntwo terms in the Senate.\n  My colleague, the first Republican in the history of the State of \nFlorida ever to be reelected to the U.S. Senate, is a valued part of \nour party's leadership team. He has managed simultaneously to \naccomplish great things for the conservative cause while also \nincreasing the level of civility in this body.\n  One is tempted to call Connie Mack Reaganesque in the way that he \ncombines an agreeable disposition with rock-solid principles. As \nchairman of the Joint Economic Committee, and as a member of the \nBanking and Finance Committees, he led the successful effort in 1995 to \ncut congressional spending by 9 percent--the largest cut in 40 years. \nConnie is one of the people who has led Congress in forcing the Federal \nGovernment to put its financial house in order.\n  He has also left his mark in the areas of medical research and \nprotecting the pristine environment in his home State of Florida. And \nhe has been a warm, amiable gentleman in all seasons and all \nsituations.\n  I served with Connie Mack in the House of Representatives to which he \nwas elected in 1982. That was a pivotal time in our politics, as he has \npointed out. America had made a clean break at that time from decades \nof ever-increasing governmental interference in the economy. He entered \nCongress as a small businessman, a banker, who understood that the \nengine of America's greatness is its private sector. Then-Congressman \nMack took Ronald Reagan's political banner as his own. As Connie has \nwritten, ``It can be summed up in one word: freedom.'' President Reagan \ninspired him into public service, and he has eloquently defended \nconservatism's most deeply held principles: limited government, \nstanding up for democratic allies around the world, lowering the tax \nburden that Americans bear, taming the bureaucracy and the special \ninterests, and returning to citizens control over their own lives.\n  We agreed on public policy questions, Senator Mack and I. But having \nsaid that, I also know that my colleagues who opposed him on issues \nadmire and like him every bit as much as I do. Connie Mack is that kind \nof person.\n  Senator Mack said on the floor of the Senate recently--it was on an \nimportant foreign policy matter--that ``we must speak the truth and \nstand on principle.'' That is what he has done daily. That is the \nvirtuous example he has set. It is what has made him such a good public \nservant for Florida and America.\n  Mr. President, I know we will all miss our colleague, Connie Mack.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/05/senate-section/article/S11548-4", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JOHN ASHCROFT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about the wonderful \nwork that my colleague, John Ashcroft, has done in the Senate during \nthe last 6 years. Our colleague from Missouri has racked up an enviable \nlist of accomplishments in his time in the Senate.\n  As you know, he was responsible for the ``charitable choice'' \nprovision in the landmark 1996 welfare reform law, a provision that \nallows faith-based organizations to compete for Government resources to \nhelp poor families. These organizations had previously been shut out of \nthe process. The Ashcroft provision gained such strong, bipartisan \nsupport that he has expanded it so that faith-based groups can now \nparticipate in Federal substance abuse treatment programs. Senator \nAshcroft has truly helped America find better ways to attack the \nproblems we face in our communities.\n  He also led the way on another major public policy improvement in the \narea of Social Security. Social Security, as we know, has had surpluses \nroutinely raided to finance deficit spending of the Federal Government. \nJohn was a key Member of Congress who drew attention to, and halted, \nthis practice so that these moneys are now used to pay benefits and \nonly to pay benefits. He introduced the first lockbox proposal in the \nSenate. And, at his urging, budget procedures were changed so that the \nobjectionable practice of diverting Social Security funds to pay for \nother Government operations could literally be ruled out of order.\n  I want to conclude by saying what an honor it has been to serve with \na man of such intellect, compassion, and notable integrity as John \nAshcroft. He has distinguished himself as a Missouri Senator, its \nGovernor, its auditor, and its attorney general. One thing is certain: \nwe have not seen the last of John Ashcroft. I trust that what lies \nahead for someone of his caliber is further and even greater service to \nhis State and to his country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/05/senate-section/article/S11548-5", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11548-S11549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to add a few accolades \nto those that have already been expressed on the 98th birthday of our \nvery distinguished and able colleague, Senator Thurmond.\n  Senator Thurmond and I have worked together in this Chamber for 42 \nyears. I say this with a considerable amount of pleasure. I have always \nfound Senator Thurmond to be straightforward, courageous--he is \nabsolutely fearless--and always considerate of the viewpoints of \nothers. We were here during the great civil rights debates of the \n1960s. We have seen colleagues come and go. We have shared viewpoints \non many of the great issues that have been debated upon this stage in \nthe years that have gone by: The Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting \nRights Act of 1965, the Panama Canal Treaties in the late 1970s--the \nmany issues that have deeply affected our country and the people of our \ncountry.\n  While Senator Thurmond and I belong to different political parties, I \nthink we have attempted to see through the fog of political debate, and \nwe have attempted to speak and act in the best interests of the country \nas a whole. We have often risen above the political fray.\n  Senator Thurmond has always been very courteous to me. I can remember \nthose years, now long ago, when Senator Thurmond lost his wife. He was \na Democrat in those years, and I remember coming into the Senate \nChamber on that morning after. Senator Thurmond sat there in the back \nrow behind me that morning. I walked up to him, shook his hand, and \ntold him of my sorrow at his loss.\n  I can remember when Senator Thurmond lost his daughter. I went to \nSouth Carolina to be with him in that time of trial and tribulation and \nsorrow. I saw the great outpouring of affection and love by his \nconstituents in South Carolina.\n  I remember, too, the day in which there was a memorial service \nconducted for my grandson, Michael, who was tragically killed at the \nage of 17. I recall that at that memorial service there were two other \nSenators present--Senator Randolph, my colleague at that time in the \nSenate, and Senator Thurmond. My colleague today, Senator Rockefeller, \nwas there, but he was at that time the Governor of the State of West \nVirginia.\n  I shall never forget when Strom Thurmond came to my side at that \nmoment of great sorrow when I gave up my grandson. Senator Thurmond has \nalways been a Senator who sympathizes with the sorrows, the sadness, \nand the joys of his colleagues.\n  I went out here some distance from the Capitol a few years ago to \nattend the funeral service of a relative of one of my staff members. \nThis relative was a black man. Who came to that funeral service? Me. I \nwas there because it was a relative of one of my staff members. Senator \nThurmond was there. He came there to show his sympathy and his concern \nto those bereaved people.\n  I marveled at his presence on that occasion. It made me wonder, how \nmany funerals of persons of other races, of other parties, and of other \ncreeds does this man attend around this city?\n  Let me just say today that it has also been not just a pleasure to \nserve with Senator Thurmond but it has been an honor. I salute him on \nthis his 98th birthday.\n  Abraham lived to be 175. Isaac lived to be 180. Jacob lived to be \n147. Joshua lived to be 110. Joseph lived to be 110. Moses lived to be \n120. Strom Thurmond is only 98. I thank the good Lord that I can be \nhere today to share with him this birthday of his.\n  Let me close by remembering a few lines, if I might, that were \nwritten by a poet.\n\n       Count your garden by the flowers,\n       Never by the leaves that fall.\n       Count your days by the sunny hours,\n       Not remembering clouds at all.\n       Count your nights by stars, not shadows.\n       Count your life by smiles, not tears.\n\n  On this beautiful December afternoon, Senator Thurmond:\n\n       Count your age by friends, not years.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to thank the able Senator from \nWest Virginia for his kind remarks. He is a man of character, a man of \nability, a man of dedication, a man for whom all of us have high \nrespect.\n  He has done a fine job here in the Senate. Although we are in \ndifferent parties, we have so much in common. I have enjoyed being here \nwith him, and I thank him for his great service to his State and to our \nNation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I understand Senator Harkin wishes to make a \nfew remarks before the Senate recesses and before the meetings of the \ntwo parties. I hope someone will indicate to Senator Harkin that the \nfloor is now available, if he would come at this time.\n  I understand he is on his way. If the Chair would just momentarily \ndesist from using the gavel.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from West Virginia yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I yield, if I have the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from West \nVirginia for his kind remarks in behalf of the birthday of our \ncolleague from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond. Those were excellent \nremarks and tribute to a man with whom we have been proud to serve.\n  I would like to note, because the Senator is such a historian, that \nsomeone handed me a little piece of history which might be instructive \nto us in the days ahead.\n  The year was 1881, when a special session of the Senate convened on \nMarch 4, 1881. The session was called for the exclusive purpose of \nhandling Cabinet and agency nominations for the new administration of \nPresident James Garfield. Republicans and Democrats were split evenly \n37-37, with 2 independent Senators. Under normal circumstances, this \nshort session should have lasted about 11 days. Due to intense \npartisanship, it resulted in deadlock. It ran for 11 weeks.\n  I hope that is a lesson to those of us who are trying to find a \nreasonable way to resolve our new challenge in the new Congress; that \nthere are ways to do it so we can avoid that kind of deadlock and that \nkind of delay.\n  I see the Senator from Iowa present.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, If the Senator will yield, the two \nindependent Senators on that occasion came from the State of Illinois. \nOne was David Davis, a former Member of the Supreme Court. The other \nwas William Mahone who hailed from the great State of Virginia, the \nmother of Presidents.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/05/senate-section/article/S11549-3", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11549-S11550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HEALTH AND EDUCATION APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Senator Stevens, Senator Byrd, Senator Specter, and I, \nalong with Congressmen Bill Young, Congressman David Obey, and \nCongressman John Porter, worked for months to craft this agreement.\n  Chairman Stevens and Chairman Young had been charged by their \nleadership to lead these negotiations to closure so that we could pass \nthis very\n\n[[Page S11550]]\n\nimportant bill. That is exactly what they did. At times when \nnegotiations got heated, both sides hung in there, and in the end we \ncame up with a compromise. Neither side liked everything that was in \nit, but it was a true compromise.\n  Less than 12 hours after we reached agreement, the faction within the \nHouse leadership led by Congressman DeLay and Congressman Armey decided \nto renege on our bipartisan conference. We were baffled by this sudden \ndecision. We spent many late hours giving and taking, compromising, and \nnegotiating. We came to an honorable, mutually satisfactory agreement.\n  As I said, no one was 100-percent happy with it. For example, I was \nextremely displeased that, at the insistence of Republicans, an \nimportant regulation protecting workers from workplace injuries--such \nas carpal-tunnel syndrome--was delayed yet again; despite the fact that \nlast year's conference report contained explicit language, it would be \ndelayed further.\n  Each year, over 600,000 American workers suffer disabling, work-\nrelated, musculoskeletal disorders that cost employers $15 billion to \n$20 billion a year in compensation. It may cost our economy as much as \n$60 billion total a year.\n  I was especially disappointed in the delay because this ergonomic \nprovision, as a nonpartisan proposal, initiated under Labor Secretary \nElizabeth Dole in the Bush administration 9 years ago.\n  While I was displeased with certain aspects of the bill, I was \nsatisfied that the bill contained important provisions to improve the \neducation of our kids, provide health care for working women, and \nsafeguards for Social Security and Medicare. Those provisions are far \ntoo important to be destroyed by last-minute partisan politics.\n  There is a 21-percent overall increase in education funding in this \nbill and 35-percent more funding for class size reduction. This means \n12,000 new teachers across America will be making a difference for \n648,000 children.\n  There is school modernization funding that will generate \napproximately $9 billion for school repairs; $250 million to increase \naccountability to turn around failing schools; a 40-percent increase in \nIDEA grants, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act grants, to \nStates; the largest increase ever in Pell grants, so that college is \naffordable to working families and their kids; 70,000 more kids will \nget Head Start under this bill; an additional $817 million for child \ncare to serve 220,000 more children; another almost $.5 billion for \nafterschool care for 850,000 kids.\n  In the health care area, there will be 1.4 million more patient \nvisits to community health centers under this bill with an additional \n$150 million; an additional $18 million for breast and cervical cancer \nscreening; an additional $1.7 billion for NIH funding, the largest \never; home heating, an additional $300 million for the Low-Income \nHeating Energy Assistance Program.\n  In the end, each side won some battles and each side lost, but we \nended up with a fair and honorable agreement that was in the best \ninterests of our Nation. That is what bipartisan compromise is all \nabout.\n  Some are suggesting we just adopt a full year's continuing \nresolution. Not only would that be an abdication of our responsibility, \nbut it would be exactly the wrong start to the next 2 years of a \npossibly evenly divided Senate and closely divided House. It would toss \nout one of the best examples of bipartisan cooperation that we have had \nthis year, the bipartisan cooperation to enact the Labor-Health-\nEducation appropriations bill.\n\n  Even worse, Mr. President, a full year's continuing resolution would \nbe a step backwards for the education of our kids and making health \ncare available to all Americans. It would wipe out all the gains I have \njust mentioned that are included in the bill. We would be kissing \ngoodbye all these important advances in class size reduction, Head \nStart, breast and cervical cancer treatment, and many others.\n  Among other things, a full year's continuing resolution would cut NIH \nresearch by 47 percent, denying funding to 4,500 new research project \ngrants this year. This chart indicates that.\n  If we pass a 1-year continuing resolution, here is what will happen: \nUnder the current bill on which we had bipartisan agreement, we will be \nable to fund 9,500 new research projects at NIH. If we have a 1-year \ncontinuing resolution at last year's level, we will have only 5,000.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour has arrived for the party conferences \nto meet. The discussion on this issue will continue.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized at 2:15 for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent divides time at that \ntime, so I object.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized at 2:15 to \nfinish my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I have to object. We have divided the time at \n2:15 on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/05/senate-section/article/S11550-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will be 15 minutes equally divided.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is a continuing resolution to give \nus until the close of business Thursday to complete the activities of \nthis Congress. That is a large order, but I think it can be done if all \nMembers of the House and Senate will cooperate.\n  We have in conference the major bill, the Health and Human Services \nbill, which we were prepared to act upon, but there were four basic \ndifferences in the conference that we could not resolve with the White \nHouse before the election. We are working on that. I can report to the \nSenate that our majority leader has just given us information about the \nmeeting that he and other leaders had with the President last evening. \nI can tell you from my perspective, based on the report of the majority \nleader, I believe it is possible to finish by Thursday night if there \nis a will in both the House and Senate to do so.\n  It is my judgment--I am sure we are going to hear from the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia that he shares this opinion--\nthat the work of this Congress should be finished by this Congress. We \nput a lot of time and effort into these bills that are still pending in \nconference. I do believe it is possible for us to finish if all Members \nwill cooperate with us.\n  The President has consented to making some reductions in the amounts \nproposed in these bills before the election. We are working on that \nwith the staff of the House now in the appropriations process. I \nbelieve we will be able to report back sometime before the close of \nbusiness today if the progress has led us to the point where we could \nfile, or ask the House to file, a conference report tonight so it could \nbe taken up by the House tomorrow.\n\n[[Page S11551]]\n\n  Again, I will be pleased to report later. For now, it is my urging \nthat Members of the Senate work with us to try to finish the business \nof this Congress, including the passage of all of the remaining \nappropriations bills, by the time given in this continuing resolution, \nwhich is the close of business Thursday.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a \nquorum, the time not to be charged until the Senator from West Virginia \nclaims his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Currently, there are 5 minutes 14 seconds remaining on this side and \n7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining on your side.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has now before it the latest in a series of \ncontinuing resolutions in order to keep the operations of the Federal \nGovernment going for another 48 hours. This will be the 17th continuing \nresolution for the fiscal year which began on October 1 of this year--\nthe 17th continuing resolution for the fiscal year. This is the largest \nnumber of continuing resolutions that has ever been required in order \nto enable Congress to complete its work on the 13 annual appropriations \nbills.\n  As Senators are aware, we have yet to complete action on 4 of the 13 \nfiscal year 2001 appropriations bills; namely, the Commerce-Justice-\nState-Judiciary, Labor-HHS, legislative branch, and Treasury-General \nGovernment appropriations bills. We are now into the third month of \nfiscal year 2001, and we have yet to get our work done on these very \ncritical appropriations bills.\n  It seems to me that the best way to set the tone for the 107th \nCongress, which will begin on January 3, 2001, would be to finish the \nwork of the 106th Congress immediately. The time has long since passed \nfor us to end partisan bickering over issues in these various \nappropriations bills. Why should it take so long to reach a compromise \non the remaining issues? What in the world is keeping us from \ncompleting action on these appropriations bills 2 months after the new \nfiscal year has begun?\n  We have been aware of those issues for months. Most of these issues \ndo not involve appropriations at all. Rather, they involve legislative \nriders which have nothing to do with the operation of the Federal \nGovernment as far as funding levels are concerned. Of course, \nlegislative riders are not new. The Wilmot Proviso was such a rider \nback in the days when slavery was being discussed.\n  These issues involve ergonomics, immigration, tobacco lawsuits, et \ncetera, matters that properly belong in the jurisdiction of other \ncommittees. We should not continue to tie up appropriations bills for a \nfiscal year that began more than 2 months ago--haggling over issues \nsuch as these.\n  The partisanship should end right now, right here this week, on these \nremaining appropriations bills. We should not permit ourselves to delay \naction on these matters until the next Congress or the next \nadministration. The time has come for this 106th Congress to complete \nits work now; clean the slate so that the 107th Congress and the new \nadministration can begin with a fresh start.\n  We have a tremendous opportunity here. We can demonstrate to the \nAmerican people and to the world that even though the Presidential \nelection is still in the courts, the people's branch--the people's \nbranch--is here, the people's branch is functioning, and the people's \nbranch intends to get our work done. We can demonstrate to the Nation \nand we can demonstrate to the world that there is stability in this \nGovernment even though the next President's name and the next \nPresident's party are yet not known.\n  The way we wind up this year's business can be a constructive \nharbinger for the way we approach next year's business with a new \nPresident and a closely divided Senate and House. We can start now to \nreassure the American people that we can stop the bickering, stop the \nwrangling, and begin to behave as adults instead of as 4-year-olds.\n\n  We can show the new Senators of both parties how to reach across the \naisle for the good of the Nation. Comity and compromise will have to be \nthe watchwords in the new year, and we can begin practicing that new \ntone right now.\n  I hope we can pass these four remaining appropriations bills over \nwhich the distinguished chairman, over which the staffs, over which the \nMembers of both parties, both sides of the aisle, have spent hours and \nhours and days in efforts to complete the work, and I hope we can go \nhome to ponder our new responsibilities. Repeatedly passing 48-hour \ncontinuing resolutions, or 24-hour continuing resolutions, and \ncontinuing to try to play for some partisan advantage sets exactly the \nwrong tone for next year's changed circumstances.\n  Senators, let us employ our intellects and our considerable talents \nfor the good of the Nation. Let us do our duty and fund the Government, \nas we were expected to be doing. There is no advantage to putting off \nthis work, no advantage whatsoever to putting it off any longer. There \nis only the very possible danger of poisoning the well from which we \nall must drink in a new and very different reality setting next year.\n  So I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together \nwith Chairman Stevens and myself and with the leadership in seeing to \nit that we work together in a spirit of honest compromise to wrap up \nthe remaining matters on the last four appropriations bills and get \nthem to the President's desk for his signature this week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I join with Senator Byrd on most of the \ncomments he made. I am constrained to point out that I did argue with \nthe White House at length not to put us through the process of having \n1-day CRs. It is true this is the 17th one, but the bulk of them were \nfor 1 or 2 days. And it takes us 2 days to pass one resolution, 1 day \nin the House and 1 day over here. As a consequence, we haven't been \nable to get anything done because we have been busy passing continuing \nresolutions, so we work the next day on another continuing resolution.\n  I share the frustration of the Senator from West Virginia with this \nprocess. The Senator is absolutely right; we are going into another \nyear in just a matter of days, a time when this body will be split, 50 \nvotes on each side of the aisle. In our Appropriations Committee, we \nwork basically on a bipartisan basis. What we are asking is for the \nSenate and the House to work together now in these next 2 days and let \nus wind up this business. The State-Justice-Commerce bill is finished, \nfor all intents and purposes. The Treasury-Postal and legislative bill, \nthat was ready to be signed--and it wasn't signed because of a \ndisagreement over the Health and Human Services bill--we were told \nwould have been signed. So as a practical matter, we have one bill that \nis really in controversy, and that is the Health and Human Services \nbill.\n  As I reported to the Senate before the Senator returned, I tell my \ngood friend, Senator Byrd, our leaders reported that the President has \nindicated a willingness to agree to some changes in that bill to meet \nthe objections that were raised to the version of the bill prior to the \nelection. I think we can do that today.\n  Unfortunately, once again we are in a situation where both Houses are \ninvolved in elections for the coming Congress. We will be involved \ntomorrow in indoctrination of new Senators for the next Congress. I am \ntold that if we don't finish by Thursday, we will have to finish by \nSaturday, which means we will have to spend all day Thursday working on \nanother continuing resolution to be able to stay until Saturday. This \nfoolishness has to stop, if we are going to wind down this Congress and \nfinish the business of this Congress in this calendar year. I think we \ncan.\n  We are waiting now, Senator Byrd and I, to get together with Members \nof the House. Both Houses are involved in meetings for organization of \nthe next Congress. I plead with Members to help us wind this down. We \nare within literally just two or three issues to be resolved on the \nHealth and Human Services bill, and I think we can put them\n\n[[Page S11552]]\n\nall together. I hope we will bring one resolution before the House and \nthe Senate to approve all three bills. That can be done by Thursday \nnight if there is goodwill here and the comity Senator Byrd has asked \nthe Senate to show at this time.\n  For myself, I look forward to the challenge of working with a 50-50 \nbalance in the Senate. It is going to be a great challenge for all of \nus, and it is going to be an opportunity for us to demonstrate to the \nAmerican public that the Senate is still the basic portion of our \nGovernment that deals with resolution of conflicts. This is supposed to \nbe a debating society, a debating body. I think it will be for 2 years \nto come. We are going to be doing our business right here on the floor, \nto a great extent. With the help of the Senate, we will finish this \nbill.\n\n  Does the Senator wish any more time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I think we are all aware of the monstrous hoax that has \nbeen pulled upon the American people, the hoax that this year was the \nopening year of the 21st century. This year is the closing year of the \n20th century. That is according to the old math as well as the new \nmath. I hope it won't be said that the Senate dabbled and dabbled and \nwaited until the 21st century, which begins on January 1, to complete \nthe appropriations bills of the 20th century. Let's be about our work.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator makes a good point. I will \nnot argue with the Senator about which century it is. I do believe that \nnext year is the first year of the next century. I join him in that.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of any time I may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on the \nthird reading of the joint resolution.\n  The joint resolution was ordered to a third reading and was read the \nthird time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Shall the joint resolution pass? The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes of the 5 minutes on \nour side to Senator Biden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will be reading from these charts some of \nthe provisions of current law for women and children. We developed \nthese child support provisions with Senators Torricelli, Durbin, and \nDodd on the Democrat side. We have worked very hard to accommodate both \nsides.\n  For women and children, we give child support first priority status--\nup from seventh in line--meaning they will be paid ahead of the \nlawyers.\n  We make staying current on child support a condition of discharge.\n  We make debt discharge in bankruptcy conditional upon full payment of \npast due child support and alimony.\n  We make domestic support obligations automatically nondischargeable, \nwithout the costs of litigation.\n  We prevent bankruptcy from holding up child custody, visitation, and \ndomestic violence cases.\n  We help avoid administrative roadblocks to get kids the support they \nneed.\n  Those are some of the things we are doing for women and children in \nthis bankruptcy bill.\n  There are more improvements over current law for women and children.\n  We make payment of child support arrears a condition of plan \nconfirmation.\n  We provide better notice and more information for easier child \nsupport collection.\n  We provide help in tracking down deadbeats.\n  We allow for claims against deadbeat parents' property.\n  We allow for payment of child support with interest by those with \nmeans.\n  We facilitate wage withholding to collect child support from deadbeat \nparents.\n  We make great strides against deadbeats.\n  Pro-consumer provisions:\n  New disclosures by creditors and more judicial oversight of \nreaffirmation agreements, to protect them from being pressured into \nonerous agreements;\n  A debtor's bill of rights, to prevent bankruptcy mills from preying \nupon those who are uninformed of their rights;\n  New consumer protections under the Truth in Lending Act, such as \nrequired disclosures regarding minimum monthly payments and \nintroductory rates for credit cards.\n  We provide penalties on creditors who refuse to renegotiate \nreasonable payment schedules outside of bankruptcy.\n  We have penalties on creditors who fail to properly credit plan \npayments in bankruptcy.\n  We have credit counseling programs, to help avoid the cycle of \nindebtedness.\n  We provide protection for educational savings accounts.\n  We give equal protection for retirement savings in bankruptcy.\n  This is a very good bankruptcy bill. We have worked hard to bring \nboth sides together. It is something that is absolutely needed in this \ncountry.\n  I hope our colleagues will support us today in this motion to \nreconsider.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time in favor of Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I understand that I have possibly up to 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will not use all of the time.\n  We will hear from our friend from Massachusetts and others on this \nfloor about how this has harmed women and children in support payments. \nThat is simply, flat out not true. We have improved the position of \nwomen. We have improved the position of children. We have improved the \nposition of people who do not have much money.\n  We have included a safe harbor provision, saying that unless you meet \na certain minimum income level, you don't even get considered in this \nprocess.\n  This is a good bill subject to a lot of exaggeration.\n  My good friend from New York had a very good provision which I \nsupported relating to abortion clinics and bombs.\n\n[[Page S11553]]\n\nThere can't be any intimidation of any kind.\n  You cannot declare bankruptcy in this country under present \nbankruptcy law if you engage in activities which under the FACE Act are \nprohibited.\n  There is no court in the Nation that has said that. People are trying \nto get out of bankruptcy. They are trying to be discharged. But the \ncourts have not discharged them and will not discharge them.\n  I would like to see the Schumer amendment become law. But, in fact, \nit is not necessary to protect the very people we want to protect and \nto hold responsible those who engage in that kind of activity under the \nFACE Act.\n  I hope reason will overcome passion. I hope the truth will overcome \nexaggeration. But I have been in this institution 28 years and who \nknows?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, being able to file chapter 7 bankruptcy \nis a major safety net for middle-class, low-income families.\n  I have heard my colleagues on the other side speak, but the truth is \nthat every single civil rights organization, labor organization, \nconsumer organization, and women's organization opposes this piece of \nlegislation. It goes too far. It is too harsh. It is significantly \nworse from a bill that we once passed that indeed was much better.\n  I have a letter signed by 116 law professors who have said this bill \nis too harsh and should be defeated.\n  Finally, colleagues, this bill came to the Senate in a State \nDepartment embassy conference report which was gutted. This whole \nprocess is absolutely outrageous, and Senators who care about this \nlegislative process and this institution should vote against cloture.\n  I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is fair in a time such as this to ask \nwho the beneficiaries of this legislation are going to be and who is \ngoing to lose.\n  As the Senator from Minnesota pointed out, there is not one single \norganization that advocates for children that supports this \nlegislation. There isn't a single organization that advocates for women \nthat supports this piece of legislation. There is not one organization \nthat represents working men and women that supports this legislation. \nThere is not one group representing consumers that supports this \nlegislation.\n  It fails the basic and fundamental test of fairness.\n  There are over 116 bankruptcy experts from around the country, \nrepresenting all different views on this, legislation who have \nbasically underscored what I have said. This is written in their \nletter. They say:\n\n       We write yet again to bring the same message:\n       The problems with the bankruptcy bill have not been \n     resolved, particularly those provisions that adversely affect \n     women and children.\n\n  Then it continues on page 2.\n\n       Granting women and children a first priority for bankruptcy \n     distribution permits them to stand first in line to collect \n     nothing.\n\n  That is what this is really all about.\n  I hope that at this period in our election process we are not going \nto be out there trying to shortchange hard-working families, the \nchildren and women in our society, and the consumers of this Nation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to Senator Schumer and \n1 minute to Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, let me make it clear that without the \nSchumer amendment this bill does not help women. It would be the \nleading dagger in keeping a woman's right to choose.\n  If women support this, why do 16 of the leading women's groups sign a \nletter saying vote against the bill without the Schumer amendment. Why \nwould we allow those who committed such crimes as posting the Nuremberg \nfiles and virtually urging people to harm doctors to escape under the \ncloak of bankruptcy?\n  We will go back to the days when 80 percent of the clinics are closed \nin America and a woman's right to choose is gone.\n  Whatever you feel about the particulars of the bankruptcy bill--and I \nagree with the Senator from Massachusetts about that--whether you are \npro-choice or pro-life, people ought not take the law into their own \nhands and then hide behind the cloak of bankruptcy.\n  Members must vote no on this bill until the Schumer amendment is \nadded back. It passed 80-20 originally on this floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This bankruptcy bill has been a mangy stray dog that \nwon't get off the back porch.\n  Let me tell you what is wrong with the bill. Does it improve the \nposition of women and children? Sure, but it also improves the position \nof credit card companies, competing with the women and children for \nlimited funds.\n  Does it close the homestead loophole? A little bit, but it allows \nthose who are wealthy to find their way around their legal obligation \nin bankrupcy.\n  I have coauthored, cosponsored, and voted for bankruptcy reform when \nit was bipartisan and balanced. This bill is not. This bill was written \nby a conference committee dominated by one party. It is being shoved \ndown our throats. It is time to shove that old dog off the back porch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture on the conference report to H.R. \n2415.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the conference \n     report to accompany H.R. 2415, a bill to enhance security of \n     United States missions and personnel overseas, to authorize \n     appropriations for the Department of State for fiscal year \n     2000, and for other purposes:\n         Trent Lott, Chuck Grassley, Jeff Sessions, Richard \n           Shelby, Fred Thompson, Mike Crapo, Phil Gramm, Jon Kyl, \n           Jim Bunning, Wayne Allard, Thad Cochran, Craig Thomas, \n           Connie Mack, Bill Frist, Bob Smith of New Hampshire, \n           and Frank Murkowski.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to continue to address the key \npending piece of legislation that has not been enacted this year. It \nhas been passed by both the House and Senate. In the conference \ncommittee, we finished our work. But it is sort of hanging in limbo. \nThat is the funding bill for Education, Health and Human Services, \nother important programs such as the National Institutes of Health, \nand, of course, the low-income heating energy assistance program which \nis so vital to many of our low-income and elderly citizens who live in \nthe northeastern part of the United States and in a lot of the other \nnorthern parts of America.\n  That bill right now is in limbo. We passed the appropriations bill in \nthe Senate; the House passed the bill. Then ensued about 4 months of \nvery tough negotiations between the House and the Senate, culminating \nin a marathon session that took place one weekend before we left, a \ncouple weeks before the election, in which we agreed. When I say \n``we,'' I mean Chairman Stevens of the Appropriations Committee; \nSenator Byrd, our ranking member on the full Appropriations Committee; \nSenator Specter, who is the chairman of the education appropriations \nsubcommittee; and me. I am the ranking member on the subcommittee. On \nthe House side, we had Chairman Young of Florida, the chairman of the \nfull Appropriations Committee; we had Congressman Porter, who is \nchairman of the subcommittee on that side; Congressman Obey, ranking \nmember on the subcommittee, and also ranking member of the full \nAppropriations Committee. We all agreed.\n  It was a Sunday, and we were there until 2 a.m. on Monday morning. We \nfinally agreed. The negotiations were heated. Many times we were hung \nup on certain things, but in the end we came up with a good compromise.\n  That was Monday morning. That was right before we left for the \nelection. Less than 12 hours later, a faction within the House \nRepublican leadership, led by Congressman DeLay and Congressman Armey, \ndecided to renege on that bipartisan compromise. We were all baffled by \nthis sudden decision. We spent many late hours compromising, \nnegotiating, giving and taking.\n  I think we came to an honorable, mutually satisfactory agreement. \nAgain, no one was 100-percent happy with it. For example, I was \nextremely displeased that an important regulation protecting workers \nfrom workplace injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome was delayed yet \nagain, for the third year in a row, despite the fact that last year's \nconference report contained explicit language stating it would not be \ndelayed any further. Well, Republicans insisted we try to delay this \nyet again.\n  Each year, over 600,000 American workers suffer disabling, work-\nrelated, musculoskeletal disorders. This costs employers $15 billion to \n$20 billion a year in compensation. It may cost our economy upwards of \n$60 billion annually. I was especially disappointed because this so-\ncalled ergonomics provision was a nonpartisan proposal initiated under \nLabor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, a Republican, in the Bush \nadministration 9 years ago.\n  Yet while I was displeased with this particular aspect of the bill, I \nwas satisfied that the bill contained important provisions to improve \neducation for our kids, improve health care for women and the elderly, \nfund needed research at the NIH, and safeguard Social Security and \nMedicare--provisions that are far too important to be destroyed by \nlast-minute partisan politics.\n  In this bill, we had the highest increase ever in funding for \neducation, with 35 percent more funding for class size reduction. It \nmeant 12,000 new teachers would be hired across America. That is what \nwas in the bill. There was school modernization funding that would \ngenerate about $9 billion in needed school repairs to some of our older \nschools; $250 million to increase accountability to turn around failing \nschools; a 40-percent increase in grants to States for the education of \nkids with disabilities and special needs; the largest increase we ever \ngave for IDEA, from $4.9 billion to $6.9 billion; the largest increase \never for Pell grants, to make college more affordable to working \nfamilies. That is what was in this bill--the largest increase ever for \nPell grants; the biggest increase for grants to States for educating \nkids with disabilities; school modernization, the first time ever, \nwhich would have funded about $9 billion in needed school repairs; 35-\npercent funding for class size reduction, the most ever. That is just \nin education.\n  In child care, again, was a record amount of money, an additional \n$817 million that would have covered 220,000 more children in America \nto have child care; afterschool care, $546 million in this bill, so \nthat 850,000 children in America could have some form of afterschool \ncare.\n  Health care. We added money so that 1.5 million more patient visits \ncould take place at our community health centers around America. We put \nin an additional $18 million for breast and cervical cancer treatment \nand screening, an additional $1.7 million for NIH research--the highest \nlevel we have ever given, the biggest increase ever for funding at the \nNIH.\n  I mentioned earlier a record amount for LIHEAP, the Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program, so that the elderly and low income in the \nnortheastern parts of our country can get the heat they need this \nwinter.\n  That is what is in the bill. It addresses the educational needs of \nour country, child care, health care, medical research, and, as I said, \nthings such as home heating for the elderly and low income.\n  Well, each side won some battles; each side lost some. Isn't that \nwhat compromise is about? Isn't that what bipartisanship is about, \nwhere I don't get my way all the time and you don't get your way all \nthe time? Maybe I will get some of what I want and maybe you will get \nsome of what you want. That is what bipartisanship is about. We hear \nall this talk about bipartisanship. It looks as if next year the Senate \nis going to be right down the middle, 50-50, for the first time ever. \nIf there is ever a time that we need bipartisanship, where we have to \nmentally understand that we Democrats don't get our way all the time \nand you Republicans don't get your way all the time but we work these \nthings out, it is now. That is what we did on this appropriations bill.\n  As I said, it took us almost 5 months of tough negotiations, with \nstrong feelings about this. Finally, we shook hands and we all signed \nour names to it and we walked out of the room. Then, two Republicans on \nthe House side, Mr. DeLay and Mr. Armey, turned thumbs down on it after \nwe had done our work to reach a bipartisan agreement.\n  Well, if we are going to set the stage for working closer together \nnext year, I suggest we start here and now with the appropriations bill \nfor education. We have a bipartisan bill. Republicans and Democrats who \nworked on it for 5 months know all the line items that are in it. We \nall agree that some are progressive, some are conservative, and there \nare moderates--almost the entire spectrum of the political ideology was \ninvolved in this bill. Yet we all agree, except Mr. DeLay and Mr. Armey \non the House side.\n  Why should two people in a position of power be able to tell the \nentire Congress and, in fact, the entire country that we are not going \nto have this bipartisan agreement that we reached, on which we worked \nso hard? Two people say that we are not going to have it.\n  Congressman Young, with whom I served in the House, has been a \ndistinguished House Member for a long time. He and I don't agree \nphilosophically on a lot of things, but we worked it out. Along with \nCongressman Obey, Senator Stevens, and Senator Byrd, we worked these \nthings out.\n  So I hope we can tell the American people on the crucial issues of \neducation, health care, and child care, yes, we got the message from \nthis election. Let's work in a bipartisan way, just as we did on this \nbill, and let's send this\n\n[[Page S11555]]\n\nbill down to the President for his signature.\n  Some are now suggesting, I hear, that we adopt a full year's \ncontinuing resolution, that we disband all of the work we did on this \nbill and just go to a full year's continuing resolution. Not only would \nthat be an abdication of our responsibility and send exactly the wrong \nmessage, but it would be exactly the wrong start for the next 2 years \nof an evenly divided Senate and a closely divided House. As I said, it \nwould throw out one of the best examples of bipartisan cooperation that \nwe were able to muster this year. Even worse, a full year's continuing \nresolution would be a step backward for the education of our kids and \nthe health care available to all Americans. If we had a continuing \nresolution, it would wipe out all the gains I spoke of, including class \nsize reduction, Head Start, and breast and cervical cancer treatment \nand screening.\n  I have a chart which shows one of the things that would happen if we \ndo not adopt the appropriations bill on education and health.\n  As I said, we have the largest increase ever for NIH funding. Why did \nwe do that? We did that because this Congress a few years ago voted \noverwhelmingly that we were going to double the funding in 5 years for \nthe NIH. Republicans voted for it and Democrats voted for it.\n  Both Senator Specter and I took that charge. We have been adding that \nmoney to double that. This year we have a $1.7 billion increase for NIH \nfunding to get it up to double.\n  That increase means that under the current bill about which I am \nspeaking we will be able to fund 9,500 new research project grants over \nand above what we have had in the past.\n  If we have just a continuing resolution, we will be able to fund only \n5,000, and 4,500 new research grants will not be funded next year if we \ndon't get this bill to the President and have just a continuing \nresolution.\n  What does that mean? It means things such as Alzheimer's disease, \nchild cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, childhood diabetes, HIV, \nParkinson's disease, cerebral palsy--I have a whole list. I will not \nread the whole list--all of the things that we are very close to making \nbreakthroughs on--spinal cord injury is another one--and are very close \nto making tremendous breakthroughs with the new tools that we have--the \nhuman genome project is being finished; stem cell research is being \ndone. We are close to making tremendous breakthroughs. Who knows? One \nof these 4,500 grants that wouldn't be funded could be the one key that \nunlocked the door to which we could find interventions and a cure for \nParkinson's disease. It could be one of those 4,500. But it won't be \nfunded if we don't pass this bill. That is what is at stake.\n  These are the things that won't be funded: Research to develop drugs \nto prevent Alzheimer's disease, clinical trial efforts on childhood \ncancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, childhood diabetes, and HIV. \nThey are just a few of the things that would be cut back. A full year's \ncontinuing resolution would cut NIH research by 47 percent. Forty-five \nhundred new research project grants would not be funded.\n  I wanted to take this time because this is our first day back. We \nwere back once since the election, but this is the first time we have \nbeen back to really get some legislative work done.\n  The Christmas season is about upon us. People will be anxious to get \nout of here and get home to spend time with their families and \nconstituents. But we can't shortchange the American people.\n  Are we going to shortchange our kids? Are we going to say to the \nteachers across America that we are not going to reduce class size? Are \nwe going to say to our property taxpayers around the country that we \nare not going to help them rebuild their crumbling schools; that they \nwill have to take it out of their property taxes?\n  Are we going to say to families hard pressed, who need school care \nfor their kids and who may live in a place where they really need some \nafterschool care, that we are not going to fund that either?\n  What about a working family that has a few kids and one of them is \ndoing well in school and wants to go on to college but they can't \nafford it? They need a Pell grant. Yet we are not going to give the \nadditional money for the Pell grants.\n  What about our school systems that are hard pressed around this \nNation because more and more of the burden of educating kids with \nspecial needs is falling upon our local property taxpayers and they are \nfinding it more and more difficult to meet their constitutional \nrequirements of equal education for kids with disabilities but they \naren't able to fund it because the property taxpayers are overburdened \nas it is?\n  We have a 40-percent increase in this bill to help our local schools \nmake sure they can meet their constitutional obligation to educate kids \nwith disabilities. We have a continuing resolution, and there that \ngoes.\n  I think the election is very clear. People in America want us to \noperate in a bipartisan fashion. This is the opportunity for us to show \nthem that we mean it.\n  We have a bipartisan bill passed by the Senate, passed by the House, \nworked out in conference committee, and agreed to by Republicans and by \nDemocrats. Are we going to say that two people in the majority party in \nthe House are able to say they don't like it? Is that what \nbipartisanship is going to be about around here--that we can all work \nin a bipartisan fashion but when it gets to the higher echelon of \nleadership in the House, they don't like it and they can operate by \nthemselves? Is that what bipartisanship means? I don't think that is \nwhat the American people think bipartisanship means.\n  I believe the American people believe bipartisanship is exactly what \nwe did on the education bill. We worked hard on it and lost. We \nnegotiated. We sat and we sat and we talked and talked. We left and \ncame back.\n  We finally worked it out--not to my satisfaction, not to the \nsatisfaction, I am sure, of Senator Specter, and not to the \nsatisfaction, I am sure, of any one of us.\n  We all had different ideas of what should be in it, but we all gave a \nlittle bit. In giving a little bit, we were able to get a bipartisan \nbill.\n  I say to my friends on the Republican side--I shouldn't say it here; \nwe had agreement in the Senate. I would be preaching to the choir. But \nI say to my Republican friends on the House side that if you really \nwant to show the American people that we can work in a bipartisan \nspirit, this is the chance to show it--with the education bill.\n  What a great Christmas gift this would be to the hard-working \nfamilies of America, to our kids, and to the teachers. What a great \nChristmas gift this would be to millions of Americans who are suffering \nfrom debilitating illnesses such as Parkinson's, spinal cord injuries, \ndiabetes, AIDS, and cancer. What a great Christmas gift it would be to \nthem to say we are not going to back down and that we are going to fund \nthe National Institutes of Health; we are going to put the money into \nthis basic research to find the cures that we know are there.\n  I think that is the Christmas present Congress ought to give to the \nAmerican people.\n  I am hopeful that before this week is out cooler heads will prevail \nand that we will take this bipartisan bill on education and health and \nsend it down to the President, who has indicated that he would indeed \nsign it. That would be the best Christmas present we could give to the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/05/senate-section/article/S11555-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11555-S11557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PARK RINARD MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I should like to take a few moments today to honor the \nlife of a great Iowan and a great American--a man who dedicated many \nyears of his life in service to the people of Iowa and our nation--our \nfriend Park Rinard.\n  It's been said that on the day John F. Kennedy died, a tailor in New \nYork put a sign on the door of his shop that read, ``Closed Due to a \nDeath in the Family.''\n  Well, that's how I felt when I heard that Park had passed away, like \nwe had had a death in our family.\n  Unfortunately, I was unable to attend Park's funeral. It was held \nduring the week before election day, and I had\n\n[[Page S11556]]\n\ncommitted to campaign for Al Gore and other Democratic candidates in \nIowa.\n  I felt awful that I would be missing the service, and I thought about \ntaking the day off to attend it.\n  But then it occurred to me--by hitting the road and working to get \ngood Iowa Democrats elected, I was paying my respects just the way Park \nwould have wanted.\n  Park Rinard was a legend in Iowa Democratic politics. He began his \npolitical career back in 1957 as an aide to Governor Herschel Loveless.\n  He then befriended a rough-hewn, young, Iowa truck driver who had a \nbeef with the state's trucking policies. Park persuaded this \ndisgruntled fellow--a man by the name of Harold Hughes--to join the \nDemocratic party and run for office. The rest, as they say, is history, \nand Hughes later referred to Park as his tutor in government.\n  Park went on to advise Senator John Culver, Congressman Neal Smith, \nand many others who have made their mark on our Nation.\n  Mr. President, when I think back on Park's career, I'm reminded of \nsomething that Adlai Stevenson once said: ``Every age needs men who \nwill redeem the time by living with a vision of things that are to \nbe.'' That's a perfect description of Park Rinard.\n  Like my hero, Hubert Humphrey, Park believed that ``. . . the moral \ntest of government is how that government treats those who are in the \ndawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the \nelderly; and those who are in the shadows of life--the sick, the needy \n. . .'' And Park had a vision of government big enough and bold enough \nto encompass all of them.\n  He envisioned a government that trusted citizens--that believed in \ntheir strength and capacity to learn, work and serve a government that \nwould invest in people and leave the potential of no citizen untapped. \nThrough his work with Governor Hughes, Park transformed that vision \ninto the wave of progressive legislation that characterized the \n``Golden Age'' of Iowa politics.\n  During these years, Park helped establish Iowa's community college \nsystem, create the Iowa Civil Rights Commission, and appoint the first \nblack state judge in Iowa. He worked to grant home rule for cities, \nincrease spending for schools, and abolish the death penalty. And he \nsuccessfully convinced Governor Hughes to oppose the Vietnam war. These \nachievements were Park's proudest legacies, and some of his most \nenduring.\n  But Park also had a vision for America--a vision which he spent the \nremainder of his career fighting for in Congress. He believed deeply in \nexpanding women's rights, and he was a strong supporter of the equal \nrights amendment long before it penetrated the popular consciousness. \nHe also spoke passionately about ending discrimination against gay \nAmericans, long before many others.\n  But make no mistake about it, Park wasn't a knee-jerk liberal, not by \na long shot. He just believed in a fundamental, basic, golden rule kind \nof fairness. That was his moral compass, and he steadfastly followed \nwhere it led. It is therefore unsurprising that Park had such disdain \nfor polls and focus groups. For Park, politics wasn't about pandering \nand spin, it was about leadership and telling the truth.\n  And tell the truth he did. No matter whom he was speaking with, Park \nRinard did not mince words. He was once asked by a hostile audience how \nhis boss could even consider supporting food stamps for union strikers. \nPark simply replied, ``hungry people are hungry people.''\n  A gifted speechwriter, Park wielded the written word as forcefully as \nthe spoken. He spent hours pecking away at his old manual typewriter, \nmassaging policy into poetry often finishing a speech at the last \npossible moment, sometimes just minutes before his boss was scheduled \nto deliver it.\n  Park never hesitated to use his gift for strong language to stand up \nto his bosses--some of whom were nearly twice his size--when he thought \nthey were wrong.\n  Park once told a fellow staffer, ``Remember, you might work for one \nparticular Senator, but your paycheck is from the Senate of the United \nStates, and every employee of the Senate works for the people of \nAmerica.'' That was Park's ultimate loyalty--to the people his bosses \nserved. When Park stood up to his bosses, he was standing up for the \nAmerican people.\n  And perhaps most extraordinary in this city that's seen its share of \negos and ambition is that Park worked his magic entirely behind the \nscenes, happy to slip through back doors and pound out details in back \nrooms. Park felt that, as Ralph Waldo Emerson once noted, ``There is no \nlimit to what can be accomplished if it doesn't matter who gets the \ncredit.'' He never cared who got the applause and the pat on the back \nfor his own hard work. He just cared about doing right.\n  Park was fundamentally humble. He spent a lot of time among giants--\nGovernors, Presidential candidates, great political leaders--but his \nego never swelled to match. Park believed, as the saying goes, that \n``you don't have to be who's who to know what's what.''\n  He was as comfortable lending a hand to a lost tourist, saying a kind \nword to a new intern, or shooting the breeze with a cafeteria employee \nas he was chewing out a Senator whom he felt had gone awry. There were \nno small people with Park Rinard.\n  All people mattered to Park--and his family mattered most of all. He \nwas a devoted husband to his wife Phyllis, a proud father to his \nchildren Judy, David and Grant, and a doting grandfather to his \ngrandson David Bayard. Their generosity in sharing him is appreciated \nby all of us enriched by his life.\n  The poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow once wrote that ``Lives of great \nmen all remind us we can make our lives sublime, and, departing, leave \nbehind us footprints on the sands of time.'' Park was a great man. And \nhe left lasting footprints on the political landscape of Iowa and \nAmerica.\n  Today, in part because of the foundation he laid, Iowa leads the \nnation in education and literacy, and it's ranked as one of the top ten \nstates to raise a child. And today, because of the dialogues he helped \nbegin, the idea of banning discrimination against women and minorities \nor passing hate crimes laws no longer seems novel, but natural.\n  These are Park Rinard's footprints--echoes from a golden time in our \nhistory when this slight, softspoken man made it his mission to create \na more humane world for the most vulnerable among us.\n  With his words and ideas, both written and spoken, Park Rinard \nappealed to the best in those he worked for and stood for nothing less.\n  We are lucky that so many great men and women heeded his call and \nmade good on his dreams.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \neulogy read by Senator John Culver at Park Rinard's funeral.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Eulogy for Park Rinard\n\n                 (By John C. Culver, November 3, 2000)\n\n       I am very honored that the family has asked me to say a few \n     words today in memory of Park and in celebration of his \n     remarkable life. He dearly loved his wife Phyllis for fifty-\n     five years and deeply revered her knowledge of and passion \n     for the arts. He took great pride in daughter Judy's work at \n     the National Geographic and Smithsonian as a writer, and, of \n     course, his grandson David Bayard. Son Jeff's career at the \n     Library of Congress and the Smithsonian gave him enormous \n     satisfaction. Park and Phyllis' devotion to their son Grant \n     during his life was inspiring to all.\n       On behalf of everyone here, I want to sincerely thank the \n     Rinard family for sharing Park who so greatly enriched each \n     of our lives.\n       Senator Harold Hughes once described Park Rinard as ``a \n     quiet, peaceful man with a core of steel and a ``heart of \n     gold.'' He also said, ``Park was the toughest man he ever \n     met.''\n       When he worked for us Harold Hughes and I were both over \n     6'2\" tall and unfortunately usually over 250 lbs. It was also \n     falsely rumored that on occasion we could be somewhat \n     intimidating. Harold and I had one other thing in common. We \n     were both scared to death of Park--who was only half our \n     size. I am convinced that what we respected was Parks' \n     integrity and what we feared was that we would fail to live \n     up to his expectations.\n       Park believed that being a good politician required one to \n     lead and educate public opinion and not just to reflect it. \n     Park always said that one of his primary responsibilities was \n     to tell the elected officials he served what they didn't want \n     to hear. Theoretically I agreed with him. However, there were \n     times, I have to confess, that I found his zeal\n\n[[Page S11557]]\n\n     in carrying out this duty a bit excessive. But certainly his \n     good judgment and candor served me well as I know it did \n     Hershel Loveless, Harold Hughes, Bonnie Campbell, Neal Smith \n     and countless others both in and out of public office.\n       As many of you know, Park had been secretary, friend, and \n     companion to Iowa artist Grant Wood, who reportedly Latinized \n     his name and called him Parkus. Several original Wood \n     paintings graced Park's small office in Capitol Hill.\n       Among the many roles Park played for Wood was to model for \n     some of his paintings. Apparently, on one occasion, he \n     actually posed as George Washington. Now Park was a wonderful \n     man and Grant Wood was a brilliant artist. But somehow that \n     particular collaboration never survived to replace Gilbert \n     Stuart's famous portrait of the Nation's first President.\n       Park was responsible for the transformation of Grant Wood \n     from a shy individual, who avoided public speaking, into the \n     national spokesman for Regionalism as a significant American \n     Art Movement. When Grant Wood died, Park was there. He \n     promised Wood that he would look after Grant's sister, Nan, \n     which he did for the rest of her life. Nan's last \n     conversation with Park was when he called to tell her that \n     the U.S. Postmaster General had approved use of a Grant Wood \n     painting for a postage stamp. The image of the stamp was \n     Young Corn and Park said, ``The painting represented Iowa as \n     a state that nurtures its young people that they may grow to \n     their full potential.''\n       Park was a beloved figure because he treated everyone--\n     regardless of their status in life--with genuine warmth and \n     kindness. Once in a while, I couldn't find him, and someone \n     would track him down in the Senate office basement, where he \n     was providing personal counseling to one of the cafeteria \n     workers. His son Jeff reminded him that his supportive \n     advice, was often, ``Don't lose your nerve.''\n       Over the years, Park befriended an elderly women named Ann, \n     who operated a small newsstand where he would buy his \n     newspapers each evening. One day Ann was upset because she \n     had not received her New York Times delivery. Park was \n     distressed because this would be a significant economic blow \n     to her modest income. A group of wealthy N.Y. businessmen \n     were coming that day to Washington to attend a conference \n     Hughes was sponsoring on Vietnam. Park immediately called \n     them and ordered them to bring a large bundle of New York \n     Times newspapers with them. Thanks to Park, Ann did not lose \n     a single sale that day!\n       Park loved to play tennis and he enjoyed cooking but his \n     real passion was his garden. He was particularly proud of his \n     blueberries and would bring boxes of them into the office and \n     the staff would eat them out of paper cups on their desks \n     during the day. One day Ed Campbell got a call from the \n     Fairfax Hospital that Park would be late to work because he \n     had been in an automobile accident. Ed rushed to the hospital \n     where he found Park with a gash over his eye. Park explained \n     that a newspaper flew onto his windshield and blinded him and \n     his car hit a telephone pole. Ed said, ``Park's only concern \n     was that he could not deliver his prized blueberries and \n     tomatoes to the office as they were now splattered all over \n     the interior of his car.''\n       One of the worst-kept secrets in the 1960's was that Park \n     was Governor Hughes' right hand man, even through he held no \n     official portfolio in state government, and was actually \n     working with the Iowa League of Municipalities. Park operated \n     not from a desk at the state House but downtown from a booth \n     in King Ying Low's restaurant. The establishment didn't have \n     a liquor license. Whenever I occasionally joined Park there \n     for lunch, the proprietor, Park's close Chinese American \n     friend, Louie Lejon, would inquire, ``Mr. Rinard, your \n     usual?'' Park would respond, ``That would be fine.'' I \n     noticed that Park's ``usual'' somehow never smelled quite \n     like the tea the rest of us were drinking out of our tea \n     cups. When Park agreed to join me in the Senate, I inherited \n     what was undoubtedly the largest Asian immigration caseload \n     in the U.S. Congress. There must have been at least 550 \n     Chinese immigrants certified to work in King Ying Low's Des \n     Moines restaurant during my Senate term alone.\n       Park Rinard was the intellectual god-father of Iowa's \n     progressive agenda for a half-century, and those years with \n     Governor Hughes were really the ``Golden Age.'' It was a time \n     when: Community colleges were established; the Iowa Civil \n     Rights Commission created; home rule for cities granted; \n     state spending for schools, prisons, and welfare increased; \n     the first black state judge appointed; and the death penalty \n     abolished.\n       It is worthy of note that Iowa's State Government has not \n     taken the life of even one person since Park involved himself \n     in Iowa politics.\n       Decades later Park remained at the forefront of enlightened \n     political thinking. He strongly advocated an Equal Rights \n     Amendment to the Constitution for women. He surprised younger \n     members of my Senate staff over 20 years ago by accurately \n     predicting that the next significant civil rights challenge \n     would be to overcome discrimination against gay Americans.\n       Bonnie Campbell once remarked that Park was so completely \n     centered and certain in his liberalism that he knew instantly \n     the proper position on an issue because of his ``fundamental \n     sense of fairness,'' while the rest of us had to at least \n     think about it.\n       Growing up in Northern Iowa over four score years ago Park \n     acquired values he would never abandon: common sense, \n     cooperation, love of the land, sincerity, compassion, \n     civility and justice.\n       These values formed the underpinning of his political \n     philosophy: phrases like ``the milk of human kindness,'' \n     ``the least of these'' and describing something as being \n     ``clear as the noon whistle at Ida Grove.'' These phrases all \n     slipped easily into his own speech patterns and the language \n     he crafted for those in public life.\n       Many of us here today recall Park, smoking his pipe, while \n     hunched over his ancient Olympia typewriter pecking out those \n     many speeches. Park was a most gifted writer. However, unlike \n     Federal Express he was reluctant to guarantee a precise \n     arrival time for the finished speech draft. On more than one \n     occasion, this led to serious staff anxiety and a near \n     nervous breakdown for the person expected to deliver the \n     prepared remarks at a particular event.\n       In 1968 at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago \n     Harold Hughes was to place Eugene McCarthy's name in \n     nomination. Park was in a Des Moines Hotel room where he was \n     supposed to be writing Hughes' speech. Ed Campbell called \n     Park and told him to put the speech on a plane. This was a \n     time, of course, which predated the era of fax machines and \n     e-mail. As zero hour approached, Hughes asked Ed ``Where the \n     hell is the speech?'' Ed called Park. Park said ``he was \n     working on it and would send it by Western Union.'' Ed \n     frantically got a room beneath the podium and with a \n     technician arranged to have the speech pages put on a \n     teleprompter as they arrived over the wire. Hughes was called \n     to the Convention podium with no text and had to ad lib his \n     opening before the first page arrived and was put on the \n     teleprompter. Hughes literally gave the speech in Chicago \n     while Park wrote it in Des Moines. At what appeared to be the \n     conclusion Hughes turned to Ed and, putting his hand over the \n     mike, asked in a stage whisper, ``Is that the end?'' It was, \n     and Gene McCarthy's name was thereby officially placed in \n     nomination as the Democratic Party candidate for President of \n     the United States.\n       I know Park was not pleased with the condition of American \n     Politics in recent years where mechanics have overwhelmed the \n     issues. Park thought the dialogue had grown sterile and he \n     had little interest in pollsters and consultants. However, he \n     had an abiding faith in democracy and believed that \n     politicians who speak to the best in their constituencies \n     will draw it out. He did his best to make sure that we office \n     holders did just that.\n       Whatever Governor Herschel Loveless, Governor and Senator \n     Harold Hughes, Attorney General Bonnie Campbell, Congressman \n     Neal Smith and I were able to collectively contribute in our \n     public service careers was, in no small park, made possible \n     because of Park Rinard. Park was truly an ``Iowa Original.'' \n     He uniquely sensed the soul of the state he selflessly served \n     and loved for a life time. His legacy will endure for \n     generations and Iowans will enjoy more opportunities and have \n     a better life because of Park Rinard. What greater reward \n     does life afford?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/05/senate-section/article/S11557-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11557-S11558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATOR RICHARD BRYAN\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Senator Dick Bryan  is one of few people \nwho has served in this Chamber who has literally devoted nearly his \nentire life to serving the people of his state and nation.\n  Senator Bryan's distinguished career started the day he took the oath \nof office as president of his 8th grade class at John S. Park \nElementary School. It continued when he took office as president of his \nsophomore and senior classes at Las Vegas High School and student body \npresident at the University of Nevada-Reno.\n  After graduating from law school, he served as deputy district \nattorney in Clark County and was then appointed as Clark County's first \npublic defender at age 28. He did two terms in the Nevada State \nAssembly. Two terms in the Nevada State Senate. A term as Attorney \nGeneral. Two terms as Nevada Governor. And he's now done two terms in \nthe United States Senate.\n  He is the only Nevadan ever to have served as his state's Attorney \nGeneral, Governor, and United States Senator.\n  He's also one of few, if any, Senators who've managed to pull an \nextraordinary triple play and serve on the three major fiscal \ncommittees--Finance, Commerce, and Banking.\n  And he's used these positions to fight harder than just about anyone \nelse here to protect American consumers.\n  As former member of the Consumer Affairs Subcommittee, he passed an \namendment requiring the installation of passenger side air bags in all \ncars sold in America. Over the years, this piece of legislation has \nsaved hundreds of lives.\n  Senator Bryan was also one of the early leaders on privacy issues in \nthis\n\n[[Page S11558]]\n\nCongress. He led the charge to enact the Children's Online Privacy \nProtection Act--the first ever federal Internet privacy protection \nlegislation. He has also been leading the fight to add new privacy \nregulations into the banking industry.\n  In addition, Senator Bryan authored laws to reduce telemarketing \nfraud and to give consumers new rights in combating errors on personal \ncredit reports. He passed the PMI legislation which protects people \nfrom having to pay hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars to private \nmortgage insurance lenders once they have enough equity in their homes. \nAnd he was one of the lead sponsors of Airline Passenger Bill of \nRights.\n  Along with Senator McCain, he passed important boxing reform bills to \nprotect the health and safety of boxers and to maintain the integrity \nof the sport.\n  And finally, he has worked tirelessly to protect his constituents \nfrom nuclear waste dumping in Nevada.\n  The one consolation I take when I think about him retiring from the \nSenate is that he'll finally get to spend more time with his terrific \nwife, Bonnie. I'm hopeful that the two of them will set aside some time \nto come out and visit me in Iowa, especially since Senator Bryan \nactually has roots in my home state. His father, Oscar Bryan, was born \nin Des Moines. And Senator Bryan's uncle by marriage, Keith More, \npracticed law in Harlan, Iowa for years. Keith's brother, Jack More, \nwas chair of the Democratic State Party in Iowa and headed up Truman's \nefforts in 1948.\n  But, no matter what his current plans are, I have a sneaking \nsuspicion that Senator Bryan isn't going to stop serving his State and \nhis country for a long time to come. He has done it honorably since he \nwas a boy, and he still has a tremendous amount to offer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/05/senate-section/article/S11558-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SENATOR DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Senator Moynihan has a keen \nintellect and a kind heart, and his distinguished career is a testament \nto the power of this combination.\n  Senator Moynihan began serving this country just one year after he \ngraduated from high school. He enrolled in the United States Navy from \n1944-1947 and served in the Naval Reserve for 20 years.\n  After receiving his BA, MA and PhD, he went on to serve in the \nadministrations of Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford. In \nfact, he is the only person in American history to have ever served in \nthe Cabinet or subcabinet of four successive presidential \nadministrations.\n  He served as U.S. Ambassador to India from 1973-1975, U.S. \nRepresentative to the United Nations from 1975-1976, and he represented \nthe United States as President of the United National Security Council \nin 1976.\n  He has authored or edited 18 books on topics ranging from the Reagan \nera to the American family to poverty to ethnicity to the practice of \ngovernment. And he has received 62 honorary degrees.\n  Senator Moynihan's list of legislative accomplishments is no less \nimpressive. He produced the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act of 1991 and the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury which provided money and incentives for States to build mass \ntransit systems.\n  He has done outstanding work on cleaning up our environment through \nhis legislation to clean up nuclear waste and toxic sites and to \ncontrol acid rain.\n  He has also been a leader in transforming our social welfare system. \nHis 1988 Family Support Act began the process of changing the AFDC \nprogram from an income security program to one which helps individuals \nsecure employment. He has also sponsored a bill to improve the Social \nSecurity Administration and to keep Social Security solvent for the \nfuture.\n  And if you take a walk around this city--or any number of other \nAmerican cities for that matter--you won't get far before you see a \nbuilding that Senator Moynihan helped to build or preserve. From the \nOld Patent Office which now hosts two Smithsonian museums, to the Old \nPost Office, to the Old Pension Building, which is now the National \nBuilding Museum, and many more.\n  The Senate will sorely miss its resident scholar. Senator Moynihan \ncombined a mind for philosophy, an eye for beauty, and a heart for \nservice.

Mr. President, I would like to take a minute to call my \ncolleagues' attention to a conference which is convening this week here \nin Washington, DC. The Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America is \nsponsoring its National Leadership Forum XI from December 6-8, 2000. \nThe National Leadership Forum is the largest meeting of grassroots and \nprofessional community coalition leaders in the country. CADCA expects \napproximately 1500 participants to participate in the Forum this year \nto network and learn about the most innovative programs, products and \nservices working to reduce youth substance abuse in communities across \nthe country.\n  As the chairman of the Treasury and General Government Subcommittee, \nI have a keen interest in these programs which receive support through \nthe Drug Free Communities Act under the Treasury subcommittee's \njurisdiction. The Drug Free Communities Act has seen some great \nsuccesses. This program is funded at $40 million for fiscal year 2001, \nwhich is $5 million more than the administration requested. This \nprogram provides small grants to non-profit organizations that are \ntrying to curb the impact of drugs in our communities.\n  One good example is in my own state of Colorado. The Drug Free \nCommunity\n\n[[Page S11559]]\n\ngrant recipient is called Grand Futures. This non-profit organization \nhas implemented a program that attempts to directly influence the \nsocial behaviors that tend to lead to drug use. The basic premise is, \nif you can influence those activities that lead to or are related to \ndrug use, you can impact the incidence of drug use itself.\n  Grand Futures, which receives funding under the Drug Free Communities \nAct, conducts tobacco and alcohol stings. In addition, Grand Futures \nalso works with local businesses regarding employee alcohol consumption \nduring working hours and conducts outreach efforts regarding patrons' \ndrinking and driving behavior.\n  As a result of their work, Grand, Moffat and Routt counties in \nColorado, the area which Grand Futures administers, has shown a \nsignificant drop in adult and juvenile violations of the state's liquor \nlaws. For that same time and location, this area also experienced a \ncorresponding decrease in adult and juvenile drug violations.\n  I think you can see that if we focus on the contributing factors of \ndrug use, we can have an impact. Also, it demonstrates that when you \nallow the state and local organizations to tackle an issue and provide \nthem the resources to do so, each in its own way, they can be more \nsuccessful in their grassroots efforts than a large Federal program \nwould be. People like those working at Grand Futures live in the \ncommunity, and they understand the local environment and the potential \nconstraints that an outsider may not. This can be something as simple \nas knowing what the local past time is for teens.\n  The Drug Free Communities Act demonstrates that groups like Grand \nFutures are well suited to tackle the drug problem with locally-based \nsolutions tailored to address the community's unique situation. I would \nencourage my colleagues to look into their Drug Free Communities Act \nrecipients in their own state. I think that they will find dedicated, \nhard-working organizations that are achieving success and deserve their \nsupport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/05/senate-section/article/S11559-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING WILLIAM V.

We \nhave racked up more miles on Amtrak between Wilmington and Washington \nthan probably anyone in history! On our train rides, we would often \ntalk about how we could best work together on a project for Delaware. \nAnd we would discuss pressing legislative business. But we'd also talk \nabout family and children and grandchildren.\n  Bill Roth has served Delawareans with great distinction for 34 years. \nSince 1970, he has served in the Senate, and before that, four years in \nthe U.S. House of Representatives. Bill Roth is a living legend in \nDelaware. In a sentence--he is the longest-serving elected official in \nthe history of Delaware.\n  And he has made his name known across this country, and throughout \nthe world.\n  Think about the men and women who have served in the United States \nSenate--the true giants. Only a handful have programs or laws named \nafter them and for which they will forever be known. Bill Roth is one \nof those giants. He has not one, but two historic laws that bear his \nname--the Roth-Kemp tax cut of the 1980s, and of course, the Roth \nI.R.A.\n  On foreign affairs, Senator Roth is an internationalist. He has met \nwith and is respected by more world leaders than most U.S. Presidents. \nThere is no doubt in my mind that without Bill Roth, we would not have \nNATO enlargement or Normal Permanent Trade Relations with China. He is \nthe former President of the North Atlantic Assembly--which is a \nparliamentary arm of NATO--and served as co-chair with me of the Senate \nNATO Observer Group. As a staunch believer in strong security alliances \nin not only Europe, but also Asia, he helped lead the effort for NATO \nenlargement and currently serves on the boards for the Center for \nStrategic and International Studies and the Board of the Pan-Pacific \nAssociation. He also is active in the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum.\n  Beside the international and financial arenas, Senator Roth has made \nhis mark on environmental issues as well. He is a recipient of the \nWilderness Society's prestigious ``Ansel Adams'' Award for his work to \nprotect pristine lands, such as the coastal plain of Alaska--fighting \nmany in his own party who want to open up that national treasure to oil \nexploration.\n  The breadth of Bill Roth's contributions to this nation seem to be \nwithout limits. He understands how government works and when it doesn't \nserve the public the way it should, he's stepped forward to fix things. \nWhether it's general government restructuring, overhauling the IRS to \nend taxpayer abuses, or reforming the welfare system, he has left his \nmark. And when Amtrak needed critical support to advance to high speed \nrail, he championed the act to commit more than $2 billion for capital \nimprovements.\n  With all his distinguished awards and landmark legislation, Bill Roth \nalso is part of the so-called ``Greatest Generation,'' serving our \ncountry in World War II. He rose to the rank of captain and earned the \nBronze Star for his service in the Pacific.\n  Like his war service, there is much Senator Roth does in Delaware for \nwhich he never seeks headlines nor credit. Every year, for the past 30 \nyears, he has hosted and organized a Youth Conference for high school \nstudents throughout the State. This is an enormous undertaking to \ncoordinate--involving high school principals, teachers, students and \nwell-known keynote speakers. He has done it all solely for the kids. I \nam certain many of those students over the years are now serving as \nleaders in our businesses, non-profit organizations, and some even hold \npublic office now themselves.\n  I realize it's rare, and somewhat awkward, for one member of this \nbody to stand up and so publicly honor his fellow, distinguished \nSenator. But Bill Roth deserves that and much more. Senator Roth has \nbeen a friend, partner and confidant to me over the years.\n  Delawareans also will miss the pleasant, extremely competent and \ncaring service of Senator Roth's staff. From veterans to members of the \nbusiness community--from seniors to school students--from the fire \nservice to the armed forces--from the City of Wilmington to the beach \ncommunities--Senator Roth and his staff were highly regarded for their \nfriendly, responsive and highly-professional constituent services.\n  And I know that beyond all his legislative accomplishments, Senator \nRoth is most proud of his wife of 35 years--The Honorable Jane Richards \nRoth--his son Bud who is an attorney in Delaware--his daughter, Katy \nwho is a physician--and his two grandsons, Bobby and Charlie.\n  This body is losing more than a powerful Committee chairman, who used \nthat power wisely, judicially and compassionately. The United States \nSenate is losing a genuine gentleman. He has served the citizens of \nDelaware with honor and integrity for nearly 34 years. Our State, our \ncountry and the United States Senate are so much better for his \nservice.\n  The British statesman and philosopher, Edmund Burke, said in a speech \nat Bristol:\n\n       The worthy gentleman who has been snatched from us at the \n     moment of the election, and in the middle of the contest, \n     whilst his desires were as warm and his hopes as eager as \n     ours, has feelingly told us what shadows we are, and what \n     shadows we pursue.\n\n  Senator Roth's shadow will stay with this body for years to come as \nwe pursue the principles he stood for.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/05/senate-section/article/S11559-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11559-S11561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       FATIGUE MANAGEMENT IS KEY TO IMPROVED HIGHWAY TRUCK SAFETY\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, highway safety, especially concerning long-\nhaul\n\n[[Page S11560]]\n\ntrucks tends to be a contentious issue. It is generally understood that \nthe long-haul truck driver faces a tedious and fatiguing task. Anyone \ntrying to get to Florida from Minnesota in one day knows that. \nGovernment regulations on commercial truck drivers set parameters on \nhours of operation in the hope necessary rest can be achieved, thus \npreventing tired drivers from undertaking their critical duty. How can \na government mandate for rest produce results?\n  Anyone in the business knows that the Administration's proposed \nregulations governing truck drivers have gone from bad to worse. We \nrecently passed legislation delaying the implementation of a new \nproposed regulation. However, there is a solution. But first, some \nbackground.\n  Prescriptive Hours of Service regulations, HOS, have been unchanged \nfor more than sixty years. After ten hours driving, a driver may not \ndrive for eight hours. A driver may not drive more than seventy hours \nin eight days. Supposedly the non-driving time is intended to provide \nopportunity for sleep and other necessary activities. However, long-\nhaul drivers may end a ten-hour driving period at a time of day when \ntheir physiological alerting system, or body clock, will not permit \nsleep. At the end of the non-driving period they may be tired but may \nlegally drive. In many instances, they must drive fatigued in order to \nmake timely delivery. There is consensus in the scientific community \nthat any system of prescriptive hours of service regulation will result \nin drivers occasionally being prohibited from driving when they are \nalert and compelled to drive when they are tired.\n  It has come to my attention that a logical and creative alternative \nis at hand. One that offers the promise of not only improved highway \ntruck safety, but improvement in the life-styles of the participants--\nthe truck drivers--and in the efficiencies of the companies who employ \nthem. The alternative is in managing fatigue.\n  The problem of operator inattention related to sleep deprivation has \nbeen the subject of medical, scientific and regulatory inquiry for many \nyears. It is the consensus of the medical and scientific communities \nthat the time has come to apply the knowledge gained by applying it in \nreal operational conditions.\n  That possibility is upon us. Thanks in part to the efforts of one of \nmy constituents, Mr. Donald G. Oren, President of Dart Transit Company \nof Eagan, Minnesota, a feasibility test has been successfully \nconcluded. This is an exciting development.\n  Recently, the Safety Research Center, Bethesda, Maryland, under the \ndirection of its President, Tony McMahon, together with Stanford \nUniversity's Sleep Disorders Clinic and Research Center undertook a \nscientific experiment. William C. Dement, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of \nPsychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Stanford University School of \nMedicine, and the director of the Stanford Sleep Disorders Clinic and \nResearch Center, a long-time student of and author on sleep disorders, \ndeveloped a two-phase approach to developing a solution to driver \nfatigue. The first is to test and treat individuals for sleep disorders \nand the second is to teach them how to manage fatigue.\n\n  Doctors and scientists researching sleep have found that drowsiness \nresults from sleep debt, which is cumulative. There are only two ways \nto build up a sleep debt: inadequate amounts of sleep and excessively \nfrequent interruption of sleep as occurs in the obstructive sleep apnea \nsyndrome and the restless legs syndrome. According to the December 1996 \nDriver Fatigue and Alertness Study commissioned by the Federal Highway \nAdministration, the two most important factors in driver fatigue are \ntime of day and the amount and quality of sleep received.\n  At the Stanford Sleep Center, drivers from two trucking companies \nwere screened, treated for sleep disorders and trained in how to \nrecognize sleep debt and fatigue and what to do about it. On October \n18, 2000, Dr. Dement announced the results of that feasibility study \ninvolving nine drivers from Dart Transit, of Eagan, Minnesota, and Star \nTransport, of Morton, Illinois. The drivers spent two separate sessions \nof three days each at the sleep research facility at Stanford. Dr. \nDement's findings are that effective training will cause behavior \nchange and fatigue avoidance.\n  The next step is to develop a pilot program, which the Federal Motor \nCarrier Safety Administration, FMCSA, will be asked to undertake. FMCSA \npossesses the authority to conduct such a pilot program. It will be \nconducted under strictly controlled exemptions to hours of service \nregulations.\n  I am told that Clyde Hart, Acting Administrator of FMCSA, believes \nthe idea has merit and is willing to entertain a pilot program \nproposal. The program will be undertaken by the Safety Research Center, \nBethesda, Maryland, and the Stanford Sleep Research Center. It will \nbegin with approximately 40 drivers each from Dart and Star. Screened, \ntreated and trained, they would be exempted from the hours of service \nregulations (but not total hours that can be driven) to provide maximum \nflexibility to the trained drivers in managing their time. These \ndrivers would be compared to a control group operating under current \nhours of service regulations. Assuming that the operations generate \npositive data, the program would be expanded to other companies. \nProgress would be evaluated on an ongoing basis and at the end of the \nthree-year program it should be apparent that fatigue management should \nbe a regulatory alternative to current hours of service regulation.\n  This is a most welcome and exciting development. To bear out this \nconclusion, I ask unanimous consent that two items be included in the \nRecord: Dr. Dement's remarks to the media and a recent article from \nTraffic World.\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n  Remarks by William C. Dement, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Stanford \n              University Sleep Disorders & Research Center\n\n\n join the safe team: the point of the lance for a safer and more alert \n                                america\n\n       At a press conference on Capitol Hill in January 1993, I \n     had the privilege of reporting the results of the two-year \n     study of Sleep in America by the National Commission on Sleep \n     Disorders Research. The Commission had determined that there \n     were two gigantic problems in our society, pervasive and \n     severe sleep deprivation in every component of society, and a \n     pandemic of undiagnosed and untreated or misdiagnosed and \n     mistreated sleep disorders. The Commission also emphasized \n     vigorously that the root cause of these problems was a total \n     lack of effective public and professional awareness about \n     sleep. Indeed, one of the most urgent recommendations of the \n     Commission to the U.S. Congress was to launch an effective \n     and broad based national awareness campaign. Sadly, this did \n     not happen for several reasons including the budget deficit.\n       During the period of the Commission study and in many of \n     the years since, I have learned that attempting to alleviate \n     the societal problems relating to sleep has a special \n     difficulty. The absence of prior exposure to sleep education \n     allows inappropriate skepticism about the facts of sleep, \n     retention of erroneous mythologies about sleep, and extreme \n     difficulty in mobilizing an adequately large community of \n     advocates.\n       In the aftermath of the failure to launch an effective \n     National Awareness Campaign, we have persisted in attempting \n     to develop an alternative strategy. The main thrust has been \n     to identify a much smaller community, which, if adequately \n     educated and trained, might be a catalyst for a larger \n     societal change. Efforts have been made by me and others to \n     educate primary care physicians, high school students, \n     airline personnel, railroad personnel, and a variety of other \n     specific groups such as Olympic athletes, shift workers, and \n     so on. None of the efforts to date have been adequately \n     successful, particularly as a catalyst.\n       All of this is by way of introducing what I will report in \n     today's conference. I believe we have the absolutely best \n     group from every point of view. This is not entirely new \n     because this group has been the focus of much attention in \n     recent years, a fair amount of it entirely unwonted. The \n     group in question is long haul truck drivers. We are here to \n     announce the success of a feasibility trial and the intention \n     to submit a fatigue management pilot program to the \n     administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \n     Administration. In summarizing the continuing lack of \n     effective education and awareness in America about sleep in \n     1993, I said that 100 or so sleep disorders centers are \n     islands of awareness in a vast sea of ignorance; too small in \n     number and too dispersed to constitute a catalytic \n     educational force. That situation is only slightly changed \n     today. There are more islands, but the vast sea of ignorance \n     remains.\n       As exemplified on the October 16, 2000, cover of US News \n     and World Report in an article titled, ``Sleepless in \n     America,'' our nation is carrying the largest sleep debt in \n     history. Nearly every citizen has a bigger or\n\n[[Page S11561]]\n\n     smaller sleep debt. The question is why don't they know it. \n     The reasons are as follows.\n       Most people don't know their personal sleep requirement.\n       Most people know nothing about sleep debt.\n       Most people don't understand the function of their \n     circadian system (biological clock).\n       Most people don't know the significance of being tired all \n     the time.\n       Most people know nothing about sleep disorders.\n       An extremely important principle is that there are two ways \n     and only two ways to build up a sleep debt; inadequate \n     amounts of sleep and excessively frequent interruption of \n     sleep as occurs in the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and \n     the restless legs syndrome.\n       Sleep scientists have known these facts for more than two \n     decades and have tried and tried to bring them effectively to \n     the attention of key communities. One would think that \n     learning these things would be a core part of many \n     professional training programs, and if nowhere else, \n     certainly in the transportation industry. Airline personnel \n     need to know the principles of fatigue management, railroad \n     personnel, maritime personnel, and the vast community of \n     automobile drivers, but we have learned in our feasibility \n     trial and I am now convinced, that the highest priority for \n     intensive professional training regarding fatigue management \n     should be long haul truck drivers. Of course, all drivers \n     must have the ability to maintain attentive alertness while \n     driving. However, the highest educational priority should be \n     bestowed upon the community of long haul truck drivers who \n     sit astride 40 tons of highly evolved and intricate \n     machinery. In other modes of transportation, attentiveness \n     every second is not required.\n       Thus, we propose a special program that involves (a) \n     training to behavioral change and commitment and (b) \n     screening for sleep disorders and ease of access for \n     definitive diagnosis and effective treatment. Long haul \n     drivers who are successful in completing this program will be \n     transformed by sleep debt reduction and improved personal \n     health, and they will become disciples seeking to recruit \n     their fellow truckers.\n       Today, instead of what we are proposing, we have \n     prescriptive hours of service which guarantee that there will \n     be times when a driver must stop driving although he or she \n     is fully alert. This may not be dangerous, but it is \n     certainly frustrating. Unfortunately, the Hours of Service \n     regulations also guarantee that there will be times when \n     dangerously fatigued truck drivers can keep driving, \n     sometimes for many hours. A typical scenario is that a driver \n     must stop at a time when clock dependent alerting will not \n     allow sleep. At the end of this period with very little rest, \n     the driver is very tired but can now go for another 10 hours. \n     If he chose instead to sleep, the rest period would be \n     extended to 16 hours and his productivity would be greatly \n     reduced.\n       Personally, I have wanted to carry out this type of \n     intensive training with targeted personnel for more than 10 \n     years. In 1990 and 91, we completed a study of 200 drivers \n     and found that 75% of them had obstructive sleep apnea and \n     that in interviews of more than 600, 82% said the signal to \n     stop driving was ``falling asleep.'' Now, two visionary \n     companies, Dart and Star, have stepped forward and have \n     supported such a program with their own resources. We have \n     completed a feasibility study with nine drivers and in my \n     more than 30 years as an educator, this was one of the best \n     teaching experiences we have ever had. Initially, I was \n     uncertain that we could accomplish the desired result in this \n     community. I insisted on an adequate opportunity, which \n     consisted of an initial three full days of education and \n     training together with sleep disorders screening, diagnosis, \n     and most importantly, treatment. Then three full days of \n     additional education, review, and evaluation one month later. \n     In brief, at the second session we learned that the prior \n     training and screening had been successful beyond our wildest \n     dreams. The fatigue of this group was greatly reduced; the \n     success of CPAP treatment had a double impact because spouses \n     experienced great relief. Finally, I believe that our initial \n     group of drivers is now completely safe, feel much better, \n     and have substantially improved cardiovascular health. They \n     are the vanguard of a new breed of long haul trucker, and on \n     their own initiative, they have named themselves ``The SAFE \n     TEAM'' which stands for Sleep and Fatigue Experienced \n     Truckers Educating America's Motorcarriers. I also believe \n     that long-haul truckers will be the vanguard of educating our \n     entire society.\n       We are ready and eager to go forward with a formal pilot \n     project and will seek approval of the Office of Federal Motor \n     Carrier Safety Administration. We will put in place \n     technology to monitor SAFE TEAM drivers and to insure that \n     waiver of hours of service and the essential flexibility is \n     not abused. I see no likelihood of the latter because of the \n     commitment of these drivers to safety, but political issues \n     make it necessary.\n       The intense interaction of the Stanford group which \n     includes SleepQuest and the School of Sleep Medicine as \n     partners in the Stanford University Center of Excellence, the \n     Safety Research Institute, and above all, the pioneering \n     group of drivers revealed and clarified what will surely \n     become the theme of the pilot project and beyond. Fatigue \n     management education is the missing piece in the training of \n     professional drivers. This is why the sleep training was \n     embraced by the drivers and their companies and why we can \n     predict that it will eventually be enthusiastically embraced \n     throughout the entire long haul trucking industry.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From Traffic World, Oct. 30, 2000]\n\n                       Enlightened Self-Interest\n\n                          (By Frank N. Wilmer)\n\n\n  pilot program would teach fatigue management, permit drivers to set \n                       their own work-rest cycles\n\n       When the shipment absolutely positively has to be there on \n     time, perhaps the truck driver should take a nap. That's the \n     opinion of Stanford University sleep scientist William Dement \n     and safety consultant and former Federal Highway \n     Administration chief counsel Anthony McMahon. They say \n     drivers properly trained in fatigue management are more \n     productive, more alert and safer. They also make more \n     informed decisions on when to drive and when to rest than \n     bureaucrats who prescribe a one-size-fits-all model.\n       Dement and McMahon intend to ask the Federal Motor Carrier \n     Safety Administration to authorize a three-year pilot program \n     under which prescriptive hours-of-service regulations would \n     be scrapped temporarily in favor of enlightened self-interest \n     by up to 80 drivers who successfully complete Dement's \n     fatigue-management course. Where federal regulations now \n     mandate a relatively inflexible driving schedule, the Dement-\n     McMahon proposal would permit drivers to determine, within \n     limits, when they are alert and able to drive safely.\n       The drivers' dispatchers as well as members of the drivers' \n     families also would receive fatigue management training and \n     drive time behind the wheel would be monitored \n     electronically. McMahon said the pilot program, whose details \n     would be fleshed out in collaboration with the FMCSA, likely \n     would limit drivers to the same maximum 70 hours of driving \n     time within eight consecutive days as now exist. But drivers \n     would have greater flexibility to devise how they accumulate \n     those 70 hours of driving time.\n       The proposed pilot program would involve Dart Transit of \n     Eagan, Minn., which utilizes owner-operators, and Star \n     Transport of Moton, Ill., which employs its own drivers. Dart \n     CEO Glenn Werry and Star CEO Donald Oren have pledged to pay \n     the costs of the pilot program, said McMahon.\n       ``The experience at Stanford proves to me we can create a \n     cadre of drivers who understand how sleep really works and \n     will use new knowledge to drive more safely, reduce the \n     dangers to themselves and others and improve their quality of \n     life on and off the road,'' said Dement, a medical doctor who \n     also holds a Ph.D. in neurophysiology.\n       The Dement-McMahon proposal is the first entrepreneurial \n     approach to what has become a furious battle between the \n     FMCSA and the trucking industry on how to revise arguably \n     outdated safety regulations that prescribe the maximum number \n     of hours commercial drivers may be behind the wheel.\n       An April FMCSA reform proposal would limit daily driving \n     time to 12 hours, mandate 10 continuous hours of daily rest, \n     prescribe up to four workday breaks totaling two hours and \n     prohibit drivers from being behind the wheel for up to 56 \n     consecutive hours each seven-day period even if it stranded \n     them at truck stops.\n       The American Trucking Associations, which estimates the \n     FMCSA's proposed hours-of-service revision could increase \n     universities cloning the training program, said Dement.\n       Dart's Oren, who already sent some drivers through Dement's \n     fatigue management course, said they previously ``didn't \n     worry'' about how they spent their time before getting behind \n     the wheel, but now ensure they do not have alertness-\n     depriving ``sleep debt'' before driving. ``It has become a \n     way of life for them.'' said Oren.\n       FMCSA Acting Deputy Administrator Clyde Hart and ATA \n     President Walter McCormick each told Traffic World they \n     hadn't seen the proposal and thus could not comment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/05/senate-section/article/S11561-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11561-S11562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

No priority can or should be higher as the agency crafts these \nnew regulations. I hope this responds to any concerns my colleagues may \nhave about the provisions of the bill.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator and agree without reservation that the \npurpose of this legislation is to increase safety on the highways. No \none in the small business community supports allowing defective auto \nparts or automobiles to be allowed on the road. After all, small \nbusinesses, their employees, and their owners are some of the drivers \nof the vehicles that would be identified under this law, and they are \nthe other drivers on the road with these vehicles. They care as much as \nanyone else about highway safety. Without question, the safety of our \nroadways is one of our highest priorities.\n  I would just like to add one clarification. When the Department of \nTransportation promulgates the regulations required by this act, it is \nrequired under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act \n(SBREFA) to determine whether the regulations will have ``a significant \neconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' If the \nregulations rise to that level, the Department is required to conduct \nan initial regulatory flexibility analysis and a final regulatory \nflexibility analysis as described in SBREFA so that the impacts on \nsmall businesses can be identified and better understood. None of the \nrequirements under SBREFA are intended to, or have been shown to, \ninterfere in any way with an agency's regulatory objectives. In this \ncase they would not impede, in any way, the Department of \nTransportation's ability to provide the maximum safety improvement on \nthe highways as mandated under the TREAD Act.\n  This is the current law and is consistent with the provision in the \nTREAD Act which prohibits the Department of Transportation from issuing \nunnecessarily burdensome regulations. I just want to make it clear that \nwe will be watching closely to make sure that the Department of \nTransportation adheres to the mandates of SBREFA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/05/senate-section/article/S11562-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11562-S11563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S OFFICE OF SCIENCE\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to address the importance \nof the Department of Energy's Office of Science, the nation's leading \nsource for fundamental research in the physical sciences for the areas \nof physics, chemistry, and materials science, and a significant \ncontributor to the biological sciences. Besides funding the individual \nresearcher, the Office of Science leads our nation in providing \nspecialized large user R facilities. A partial list of such \nfacilities would include the Stanford Linear Accelerator, the Center \nfor the Microanalysis of Materials at the University of Illinois, The \nLos Alamos Neutron Science Center, the High Flux Isotope Reactor at Oak \nRidge, the high energy accelerators at the Fermilab and the National \nSynchrotron Light Source at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. These \nuser facilities are national treasures. One cannot over emphasize their \nimportance. They are used by not only university researchers from all \n50 states but by industry in both the biological and physical sciences. \nIn 1999, there were 5500 users on just the large light sources alone to \ninvestigate new structures of matter in both the biological and \nphysical sciences. In the last four years, the number of biological \nresearchers using these facilities has risen by a factor of four and \nnow accounts for 40 percent of all users. Each of these 5500 \ninvestigations on just the light sources alone generates new \nintellectual property--a dominant export in the 21st century global \neconomy. In short, these facilities provide the critical basic R that \nindustry cannot and will not fund directly, R that is crucial to \nmaintaining the tremendous technological engine of growth that fuels \nour economy today.\n  I would like to point out that in the 106th Congress there was a \nlarge and successful bipartisan campaign in both the House and Senate \nto support the Office of Science's budget request for Fiscal Year 2001. \nHowever, the Office of Science's 2001 budget request only met the level \nof its 1990 budget as adjusted in year 2000 dollars. In comparison the \noverall federal R budget for the life sciences has increased by 45 \npercent in the same period. The trends in the neglect of funding for \nthe Office of Science are deeply disturbing and are now beginning to \ninfluence the basic indicators of intellectual property generation. If \none tracks the submissions by U.S. researchers in some of our most \nprestigious physics journals you'll find that in 1990 the United States \ncommanded the lead of submissions at about 50 percent worldwide. In \n1999 the submission rate has dropped to about 25 percent worldwide. The \nmomentum at a national level in the physical sciences is one of \ndecline. We should be disturbed by this trend--the physical sciences \nare the foundation of the microchip industry, the telecommunications \nindustry, the transportation industry and the petrochemical industry. \nWe are talking about what fuels our engine of U.S. economic growth--\nhigh technology and maintaining a commanding lead in a 21st century \nglobal economy.\n  As the 107th Congress gets ready to start, we must pay more attention \nto the Office of Science and the role that it plays as a generator of a \nhigh tech workforce, intellectual property and economic growth. The \nOffice can play an important role in large multi-user facilities for \nthe development of nanomaterials by developing techniques that can \nliterally position groups of atoms to develop a whole new generation of \nmicrochip and structural materials. Leadership in such materials \nresearch will help maintain our world dominance in the \ntelecommunications and transportation industries. Yesterday a \nbipartisan group of this body sent to the President a letter supporting \na significant increase in the budget of the Office of Science in fiscal \nyear 2002. This letter follows up on the support that these members \nexpressed earlier this year during the appropriation process and \npresages a commitment of bipartisan support for the Office of Science \nin the 107th Congress. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this \nletter be printed in the Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n\n[[Page S11563]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Regardless of the final outcome of the Presidential \nelection, it is my hope that both sides of the aisle will be able to \ncome together next year on a strategy for the continued technological \nand economic competitiveness of the United States. I hope that support \nfor the work funded by the Office of Science will be the cornerstone of \nthat strategy.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Thank you for joining us in providing \n     strong support for the Department of Energy's Office of \n     Science in this year's appropriation process. Together we \n     have made great progress in advancing recognition of these \n     critical scientific programs. Yet there remains much more \n     that can be accomplished. Continued growth for these programs \n     on par with that proposed for the National Institutes of \n     Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF) is vital \n     to continued advances in the fields DOE supports and to the \n     training of future scientists and engineers to continue the \n     tremendous advances that America brings to basic science and \n     to the marketplace.\n       You are aware that the Department of Energy (DOE) is the \n     leading source of federal support for the physical sciences \n     in the nation. In the life sciences, the DOE initiated the \n     Human Genome Program and co-manages this enormously important \n     and promising effort with the National Institutes of Health. \n     It also plays a leading role in supporting other biological \n     sciences, environmental sciences, physics, chemistry, \n     materials science, computer science, mathematics, and \n     engineering. As a consequence, the DOE is responsible for a \n     significant portion of federal R funding for scientists and \n     students at our colleges and universities.\n       One of the primary responsibilities of DOE's Office of \n     Science is to support large-scale specialized user facilities \n     and large teams of scientists focused on national scientific \n     priorities. This makes the Office of Science unique among, \n     and complementary to, the scientific programs of other \n     federal science agencies, including NIH and NSF. Each year \n     over 15,000 sponsored scientists and students from academe, \n     industry, and government--many funded by agencies other than \n     the DOE--conduct cutting edge experiments at the Department's \n     research facilities. DOE's investments in major facilities, \n     smaller-scale user facilities, and in university-based \n     laboratories not only sets it apart from other federal \n     science agencies, but helps ensure that the nation maintains \n     its world leadership across a broad range of scientific \n     disciplines.\n       Economic experts maintain that today's unprecedented \n     economic growth would not have been realized but for the \n     substantial research investments by the public and private \n     sectors over the past several decades. To maintain the \n     tremendous advances that America brings to basic scientific \n     research and into the marketplace, we need to continue to \n     provide strong support for basic research across the \n     scientific disciplines. Sound science policy also demands a \n     balance between support of individual investigator driven \n     science--such as that conducted by the NIH and NSF--and the \n     maintenance and operation of major facilities, smaller \n     specialized facilities, university based research facilities, \n     and scientific teams such as those supported by DOE's Office \n     of Science.\n       The appropriation of $3.19 billion for FY 2001 is only a \n     start at addressing these challenges. Annual increases \n     similar to NIH and NSF are needed and merited by the \n     important and unique work being conducted by the DOE Office \n     of Science. They would also build on the spirit of the \n     Senate's passage of the Federal Research Investment Act (S. \n     296) which calls for doubling investment in civilian research \n     and development efforts.\n       Support for increases in funding for the DOE Office of \n     Science is critical if we are to attract and retain the best \n     minds, support the construction and operation of modern \n     scientific facilities, and continue to capitalize on the \n     scientific vision that has been the trademark of the Office \n     of Science for so many years. The budget request for FY 2002 \n     is the logical place to continue this effort. We trust you \n     agree and look forward to strengthening our scientific and \n     technological capabilities in FY 2002 and beyond.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jeff Bingaman, Blanche L.

Mr. President, one of the most important issues we \nconsider here in the U.S. Senate is how to balance our economic needs \nwith our responsibility to conserve our natural resources.\n  I believe we can strike the right balance. With that hope, I'd like \nto talk about America's fisheries. In the Pacific Northwest, fishing is \nmore than just a way of life. It is an important part of our economy \nand contributes to our region's culture.\n  Unfortunately, that way of life is becoming more difficult. Many \nfishing families are struggling because some fish stocks are at very \nlow levels. For example, the West Coast salmon and groundfish and the \nBering Sea/Aleutian Islands crab fisheries have declined dramatically \nin recent years. Washington's fishing families contribute to our \neconomy and feed consumers both here and abroad, but too often they \nwork within a system that threatens their safety and their livelihood. \nI've met with harvesters and processors from my region, and I've \nvisited small towns in Washington state that depend on fisheries. The \nproblems they face aren't limited to Washington state. They can also be \nseen in Alaska and other states.\n  In an effort to recover decreasing numbers of fish in our waters, \nfisheries managers have developed complex management systems to limit \nfishing. In some cases, our current policies encourage fishers to catch \nas many fish as possible over a limited period of time. This creates a \ndangerous and inefficient ``race for fish'', which requires fishermen \nto venture out in bad weather. In fact, one of the most dangerous \noccupations for young people today is to work in the Bering Sea/\nAleutian Island crab fishery. The ``race for fish'' is one way to \nmanage fisheries in which too many fishermen are competing for too few \nfish. However, there are alternatives to this management approach.\n  I'm proud that there is a growing interest in an innovative \nmanagement tool called individual fishing quotas. This creative \napproach uses the marketplace to encourage a safer, more productive, \nand more sustainable fishing industry. In some cases, it would be a \nsignificant improvement over the status quo.\n  Individual fishing quotas or IFQs would bring some regularity to what \nare currently short-lived, intense fishing seasons. Under this system, \neach participant in a fishery would be allocated a percentage of that \nseason's total fish catch. Because they are guaranteed a certain amount \nof fish, fishermen wouldn't have to ``race for fish.'' They could \nstretch their fishing out over longer, more balanced fishing seasons.\n  I believe that individual fishing quotas can help fisherman, \nfisheries, conservation, and consumers. IFQs can help fishing families \nbecause boats won't need to go out in dangerous weather. In addition, \nbecause of the slower pace, fishermen would be less likely to lose \nfishing gear, a common problem in some fisheries. This new system can \nhelp fisheries because fishermen will be able to sell or lease quota. \nThat means there will be fewer boats, which can mean cleaner, more \nefficient fisheries.\n  In addition, IFQs can improve conservation. In some cases when the \nfishery slows down, fishermen take better care of their catch and are \nmore careful with bycatch. Let's look at just one example of how the \nspeed of the current system hurts conservation. Currently, some North \nPacific crabs that are too small to be caught legally end up trapped in \ncrab pots. Under the race for fish, these pots are harvested so quickly \nthat undersized crabs don't have time to escape. Under a slower \nfishery, those small crabs would have time to crawl out of the crab \npots and grow to maturity, thereby helping to sustain the fishery into \nthe future.\n  For consumers, IFQs mean they can enjoy fresh fish later in the \nseasons. For example, fresh halibut is now available more often as a \nresult of a fish quota program put in place to manage halibut \nharvesting. Clearly, individual fishing quotas can be an effective \nmanagement tool and can solve a lot of the problems facing fisheries \ntoday.\n  I'm pleased that many of my colleagues have expressed interest in \nIFQs. In fact, a number of members would like to see a national policy \non IFQs developed. Since 1996, I've supported fish quotas and a \nnational policy, and I reiterate my support again today.\n  But in the meantime, there are important steps we can take. When \nCongress reauthorized the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act in 1996, Congress placed a\n\n[[Page S11564]]\n\nfour-year moratorium on new individual fishing quota programs. The \nmoratorium on new quota programs expired on September 30, 2000. Now \nthat this ban has expired, we should allow fishery management councils \nto develop additional fish quota programs. Councils should have the \nfreedom to develop and implement these programs. I am not advocating \nthat Councils be required to implement them, because individual fishing \nquota programs must be developed on a fishery-by-fishery basis. I do \nthink, however, that individual quota programs should be available as \none of the many management tools Councils may draw upon. I must add \nthat all eight Councils have asked for this freedom and have asked for \nCongress to lift the moratorium.\n  However, I know that some members want to extend the moratorium. They \ndon't want to allow some fisheries to go ahead with IFQs until there is \na national policy in place. I understand and appreciate this \nperspective. I also recognize members of the environmental community \nwould be more comfortable with such programs if a national policy were \nalready in place. As I said, I support a national policy on these \nprograms, and I look forward to working with my colleagues next year to \ndevelop one.\n\n  However, I would like to point out that all fishery management plans, \nincluding those that rely on quota programs, are required to meet the \nnational standards already in the Act. Let me offer a few examples of \nthese standards. Any fish quota program would have to meet National \nStandard 4, which prohibits conservation and management measures from \ndiscriminating between residents of different states. This standard \nalso mandates that fishing privileges be allocated fairly and \nequitably, that they are calculated to promote conservation, and that \nthey are carried out so that no entity shall have an excessive share. \nAny fish quota program would also have to meet National Standard 8, \nwhich requires such measures to take into account the importance of \nfishery resources to fishing communities. They would also have to meet \nNational Standard 9, which requires measures to minimize bycatch, and \nNational Standard 10, which addresses safety.\n  In addition, the Act requires all individual fishing quota programs \napproved on or after October 1, 2000, to meet several additional \ncriteria. For example, these programs must be subject to review based \non any future national policy and such revision may require \nreallocation of quota. These programs must also be effectively managed \nand enforced, which may require reliance on observers and/or cost-\nrecovery fees. In addition, these criteria address the most contentious \naspect of individual quota programs: the initial allocation of quota. \nThe Act requires programs to ensure a fair initial allocation of quota, \nto prevent excessive control over quota, and to include a mechanism for \nentry-level fishermen, small vessel owners and crew members to access \nquota. I think all of these examples illustrate that some elements \nintegral to a national policy on individual fishing quota programs are \nalready included in the Act. I believe we are much closer to having a \nnational policy in place than some people may believe.\n  Unfortunately, it appears likely that the moratorium will be \nextended. Therefore, I ask my colleagues to consider several caveats to \nthis extension. First, I ask that the moratorium be extended for only 8 \nmonths. This will take the moratorium off the appropriations cycle. \nPlacing the moratorium on the yearly appropriations cycle creates a \nprecedent that is easy to repeat every year. Taking the moratorium off \nthe appropriations cycle will increase the urgency for Congress to \ndevelop a national policy within the months ahead.\n  Second, I ask for an exception to the moratorium for fixed-gear \nsablefish along the West Coast. This fishery is ready for fishermen to \nbe allowed to consolidate permits, which is technically considered an \nIFQ. In fact, the fishery has been ready to do so since 1994. We should \nnot make these fishermen wait any longer. They deserve to be freed from \na 9-day race for fish, and fishermen who want to get out of the fishery \nshould be compensated for their investments. I ask for your support for \nthis exception.\n  Third, I support asking NMFS to gather input from the eight regional \nCouncils on a national policy for individual fishing quotas. It is \nappropriate and important for Congress to have this input before we \nfinalize a national policy on quota programs.\n  Most important, however, I ask for the commitment of my colleagues to \ndeal with this issue next year, during the first session of the 107th \nCongress. It is not fair to punish those few fisheries that are ready \nto move forward with quota programs just because other fisheries are \nnot. We have already had four years to resolve these issues, to no \navail. If my colleagues believe this issue must be addressed within the \nbroader context of Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management \nAct reauthorization, I understand and I hope they will consider this \nSenator ready and willing to move forward with that challenge. I \nsupport Senator Snowe's and Senator Kerry's efforts to hold more \nhearings on reauthorization, and I offer to help them in any way I can \nto ensure it happens.\n  Let's commit ourselves to have a productive, comprehensive dialogue \non a national policy. Let's commit to reaching a consensus that will \nallow our Councils and fisheries to pursue this innovative, effective \nsolution that can work for fishing families, fisheries, conservation \nand consumers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/05/senate-section/article/S11564-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11564-S11565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RELIEF NEEDED FROM RISING PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to review where we stand, \nnear the conclusion of the 106th Congress, on the subject of \nprescription drugs. Few issues have caught the public's attention more \nthan this one, and few are more deserving of our attention.\n  We live at a time when we can clearly discern remarkable benefits \nfrom all manner of drugs. It is nothing short of miraculous when we \nconsider the relative ease and success of today's treatment of common \ndisorders, as compared with that of only two or three generations ago.\n  When World War II began, for example, penicillin and other similar \nantibiotics were known only to a small number of scientists. At the \nconclusion of the War in 1945, penicillin was widely available, used \nnot only for battle wounds but for infectious diseases in the general \npublic as well. Patients with high blood pressure or high cholesterol \nlevels were, at best, only partially and inadequately treated in the \n1940's and 1950's. Now success is the rule, rather than the exception. \nCalvin Coolidge's son died in 1924 as a result of a blister and a skin \ninfection after playing tennis at the White House. An infection like \nthat today would be treated as simple, outpatient therapy.\n  While these examples are noteworthy and provide us with a valuable \nperspective of times gone by, the hard, cold fact is that many of these \nmodern miracles are still out of the reach of too many American \ncitizens. They simply cannot afford the drugs that might so often prove \nlifesaving, because of either no insurance or lack of drug coverage \nwithin their insurance.\n  Why is this? Because, astronomical prices have come hand-in-hand with \nthe great improvements in drug therapy. Spending for prescription drugs \nin the United States doubled between 1990 and 1998. In each of the five \nyears between 1993 and 1998, prescription drug spending increased by an \naverage of 12.4 percent. In 1999, the increase was 19 percent. We could \ngo into all the reasons, but the fact remains that prescription drug \nprices are high and getting higher.\n  Many millions of Americans, both Medicare age and younger have either \ninadequate or no prescription drug insurance at all. A by-product of no \ncoverage is that these patients wind up paying the highest rates of \nanyone--an average of 15 percent more than those with insurance. Many \nof these uninsureds, including the seniors often called The Greatest \nGeneration'' are not filling prescriptions because of their cost--\nchoosing between food and medicine. Or they split pills in half to make \nthem go farther. This is shameful. These are very real every day \nproblems that beg for help.\n  So, given the fact of these well documented problems, what is the \ntrack record of this Congress in helping the citizens in my home state \nof South Dakota and the citizens of the United\n\n[[Page S11565]]\n\nStates? What do I tell my constituents back in Sioux Falls, or Custer, \nor Milbank when they ask me why nothing has been done to help them? I \nwish I could tell them that help is on the way. I wish I could tell \nthem that the majority leadership heard their voices and scheduled the \nhearings and called for the votes. But, that just is not the case.\n  Early in this Congress, I introduced, along with Senator Kennedy, the \nPrescription Drug Fairness for Seniors of Act of 1999''. This bill \nwould provide Medicare beneficiaries access to prescription drugs at \nthe same low prices that drug manufacturers offer their most favored \ncustomers, such as large insurance companies, HMO's, and the Federal \nGovernment. Without cost to the taxpayers, my proposal could save \nseniors approximately 40 percent on their drug bills, yet we did not \nsee a vote on this floor.\n  Similarly, in May of this year, I introduced the Generic \nPharmaceutical Access and Choice for Consumers Act''. This bill \nencourages the broader use of generics in Federal health programs, a \nstraight-forward common sense approach, yet we did not see a vote on \nthis floor.\n  Other measures that could have made a tremendous difference to \nmillions of Americans also languished. This Congress should have passed \na voluntary universal Medicare drug benefit plan. It did not.\n  This Congress should have addressed rising drug prices. It did not.\n  This Congress should have passed a truly strong and effective drug \nreimportation plan. It did not.\n  This Congress should have passed a generic drug access plan. It did \nnot.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by stating that these problems will \nnot go away. Nor will my commitment for their resolution on behalf of \nthe people of South Dakota and Americans across this country. The hope \nthat this Congress will seriously address prescription drug costs and \nprovide comprehensive Medicare drug coverage yet this year is all but \nan aspiration at this point. That being said, in a few months we will \ncommence the 107th Congress. I will continue to do all that I can to \nwork with my colleagues and urge the earliest possible discussions \nregarding prescription drugs in committee rooms and on the floor of the \nSenate. I believe this is the wish of most of the members in this body, \nas well as the wish and hope of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/05/senate-section/article/S11565-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nRECOGNITION OF RHODE B.

Mr. President, in October, the Special Committee \non Aging joined Green Thumb to recognize the enormous contributions \nthat this year's Green Thumb ``Prime Time Award'' recipients are making \nto their community and our country.\n  The Senior Community Service Employment Program is one of the best \nkept secrets in the country. This program is an innovative and cost-\neffective federal initiative that allows our nation's seniors to remain \nproductive and independent by contributing their talent and services to \ntheir communities.\n  Some of Arkansas' finest employment programs for seniors are \nsponsored by Green Thumb, and I am pleased to recognize Arkansas' 2000 \nPrime Time Award recipient, Rhode B. (R.B.) Causey, Sr.\n  R.B., now 96 years old, grew up in a family of 13 children and sold \nbusiness supplies and office machines during the Depression. These \nexperiences, coupled with his ingenuity, persistence, and strong work \nethic, prepared R.B. to branch out on his own in 1952 and open a \nbusiness supply company. Today, R.B. and his son own and operate the \nR.B.

JUDY ENGLAND-JOSEPH\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Ms. Judy \nEngland-Joseph who retired from the General Accounting Office, GAO, \nthis past March. Her departure from federal service is a great loss to \nthe federal government as well as to all offices in the Senate. Judy \nwas a superlative federal employee with a record of honesty and \nintegrity as well as a commitment to a job well done.\n  Ms. England-Joseph had been with GAO since 1975 working on a number \nof important federal issues in the fields of personnel and \ncompensation, human resources, and energy, to name a few. However, I \nthink most of my colleagues would agree that Judy's most outstanding \ncontributions came as the Director of Housing and Community Development \nIssues at GAO. As Director, she had the primary responsibility for \noverseeing for the Congress the audit and evaluation of all programs \nand activities at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the \nSmall Business Administration, and the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency, including those concerning housing, community and economic \ndevelopment, and federal disaster responsibilities.\n  As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and \nIndependent Agencies and the Committee on Small Business, I found Judy \nto be an invaluable resource for objective and timely information that \nwas critical to fulfilling my responsibilities. Judy not only testified \nnumerous times before my appropriations subcommittee and the Committee \non Small Business, but also personally met with me and my staff to \ndiscuss pressing issues and provide us with the critical information \nneeded to make policy decisions. Judy was more than a resource to my \ncommittees; I also viewed her as a teammate and partner who shared my \ngoal of making government truly accountable and as efficient as \npossible.\n  To say that we miss Judy would be an understatement. Judy epitomized \npublic service. Her energy was boundless, her knowledge of policy \nissues was rarely matched, and her commitment to doing the right thing \nunderlined her approach to her job and responsibilities.\n  I am honored to have worked with Judy and commend her for the years \nof service she provided to the Congress and the American \nTaxpayer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/05/senate-section/article/S11565-3", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11565-S11566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DAVID BROWER\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I note with sadness the \npassing of David Brower, a great conservationist who died last month at \nhis home in Berkeley, California. David Brower worked for more than \nhalf a century to preserve and protect the American landscape he loved \nso well. He served our nation in war and peacetime as a soldier, \nwriter, and activist, and enriched the lives of many Americans.\n  Born in Berkeley in 1912, young David Brower learned to appreciate \nnature by guiding his blind mother on walks through the Berkeley hills. \nIn the 1930s, he worked at Yosemite National Park and became a skilled \nmountaineer. During World War II he trained troops in climbing \ntechniques, wrote the Army's alpine manual, and fought in northern \nItaly.\n  After the war he returned to California and volunteered at the Sierra \nClub, which was then a hiking organization with little involvement in \npublic policy. After writing the first Sierra Club Manual, he became \nthe club's first executive director in 1952. Under his leadership, the \nclub's membership grew from 7,000 to 70,000 as it became the nation's \nleading environmental organization. After leading the Sierra Club for \n17 years, Mr. Brower went on to found the Friends of the Earth and the \nEarth Island Institute, and he helped to establish the League of \nConservation Voters.\n\n[[Page S11566]]\n\n  During the 1950s and 1960s, Mr. Brower led the Sierra Club's \nsuccessful efforts to block the construction of dams in Grand Canyon \nNational Park and Dinosaur National Monument. He often said, half \njokingly, that ``All I have been able to do in my career is to slow the \nrate at which things get worse.''\n  But in fact he made things better. David Brower was instrumental in \nthe creation of Redwoods National Park, North Cascades National Park, \nand Cape Cod National Seashore as well as the passage of the Wilderness \nAct and establishment of the National Wilderness Preservation System.\n  Our Nation has lost a giant, but we must try to walk in his \nfootsteps. David Brower's life and legacy will live as long as we \ncontinue to preserve, protect, and enjoy America's natural \ntreasures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/05/senate-section/article/S11566-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OUTSTANDING IDAHOAN\n\n Mr. CRAIG.

A bill to require the Federal Election Commission to study \nvoting procedures in Federal elections, award Voting Improvement Grants \nto States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n\n\n                    voting study and improvement act\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, in the era of the Internet, in the era \nof the microchip, at the dawn of the twenty-first century, I am \nconcerned that the most prosperous, productive and inventive nation in \nthe world conducts its elections for its highest offices in some areas \nin ways that are outdated, slow, inaccurate, and inaccessible to many.\n  That is why, Mr. President, I rise as an original sponsor of the \n``Voting Study and Improvement Act,'' which I am proud to introduce \ntoday with my colleague Chuck Schumer of New York.\n  The long national nightmare that the 2000 Presidential election has \nbecome has taught us, Republican and Democrat alike, that we need to \nimprove the\n\n[[Page S11576]]\n\ninstruments of voting and the means of electing our federal office \nholders.\n  Both rural and urban areas have unique difficulties not only with \naccessibility to voting, but also in funding improvements in their \nvoting systems. A rural State like Kansas has problems with voting that \nare different than those faced by a State such as New York. Our \nlegislation recognizes these differences, and will allow each State to \nimplement the changes they believe are best for them. What is the best \nsystem for voting in Kansas may not be the best system for voting in \nNew York. What is the best system for voting in some parts of Kansas \nmay not be the best system for voting in another part of Kansas.\n  That is why Chuck Schumer and I can agree to sponsor this legislation \ntogether today, and that is why we agree that something must be done. I \nam pleased to rise with Chuck Schumer today to introduce the Voting \nStudy and Improvement Act.\n  This is the first bipartisan attempt to provide grant money to States \nto implement alternate means and instruments of voting that provide \nswifter and more accurate results, and are less susceptible to partisan \ninterference and differences of opinion\n  Let me be clear: unlike some legislation that has been introduced in \nthis regard, this is not a federal mandate of election standards. We \nprovide the means to States to implement the changes that they deem are \nmost fitting for their unique needs.\n  In addition, unlike some other legislation that is being proposed in \nthis area, we do not create a new federal agency or bureaucracy. We use \nthe existing expertise and personnel of the Federal Election Commission \nto study possible improvements to our current voting system, and make \nrecommendations for changes.\n  Given the magnitude of controversy surrounding the 2000 Presidential \nelection, it is tempting to create a new agency with new powers to \nsolve these problems. Given these problems, it is also tempting to \ncreate a federalized system of voting for federal elections. However, \nSenator Chuck Schumer and I believe these decisions are best left to \nthe individual States to decide. States are as different as my home \nState of Kansas is from Chuck's home State of New York, and they are \nthe ones who can best decide how to improve their own voting systems.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join Senator Schumer and myself in \nsupporting this common-sense, bipartisan legislation, and help bring \nour nation's elections into the twenty-first century.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Kerry, \n        Mr. Shelby, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Grams, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. \n        Inouye):\n  S. 3274. A bill to expand homeownership in the United States, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n      american homeownership and economic opportunity act of 2000\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Senate version \nof the American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000, \nwhich is now at the desk. It is S. 3274.\n  I am pleased that this legislation is cosponsored by both the \nchairman and ranking member of the Banking Committee, Senators Phil \nGramm and Paul Sarbanes, as well as the ranking member of the Housing \nsubcommittee, Senator John Kerry.\n  This legislation reflects a bipartisan and bicameral agreement on the \nhousing legislation that should be enacted before the close of this \nCongress. Also joining as cosponsors are Senators Richard Shelby, Rick \nSantorum, Rod Grams, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, and Daniel Inouye.\n  This legislation is the product of negotiations that have taken place \nbetween the House and Senate over the past several months. It has been \nintroduced in the House of Representatives today, and if all goes well, \nit will be approved by both Houses and delivered to the President \nwithin the next several days.\n  In addition to housing provisions, this legislation also includes a \nnumber of regulatory relief provisions, banking and housing reporting \nrequirements, and several items related to the Federal Reserve. An \nexplanation of each provision is included in the section-by-section \nthat follows my comments.\n  This legislation includes important home ownership, rural housing, \nelderly housing, disabled housing, and housing affordability barrier \nremoval provisions. This bill also includes the Manufactured Housing \nImprovement Act championed by Senator Shelby, provisions dealing with \nNative American housing sponsored by my Colorado colleague, Senator Ben \nNighthorse Campbell, and Native Hawaiian provisions sponsored by \nSenator Daniel Inouye.\n  This legislation also includes the Private Mortgage Insurance \nTechnical Corrections and Clarification Act which clarifies a number of \nprovisions enacted by the 105th Congress to address the issue of \nprivate mortgage insurance cancellation and termination.\n  Nearly 2 years ago, I became chairman of the Banking Committee's \nSubcommittee on Housing and Transportation. My priority during this \ntime has been congressional oversight of the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development. During the 106th Congress, our subcommittee held 19 \nhearings. Twelve of these hearings dealt specifically with HUD \noversight. I have also made a point to develop a legislative agenda \nthat focuses on innovative approaches to increase the supply of \naffordable housing.\n  Our subcommittee held a number of hearings to review legislative \nproposals on affordable housing, manufactured housing, homelessness, \nelderly and disabled housing, and the Federal Housing Administration \nmortgage insurance program.\n  While we have not been able to do everything we would like in the \n106th Congress, I am pleased that this legislative package I am \nintroducing today reflects significant progress on a number of housing \ninitiatives.\n  On July 26, 2000, I introduced the Local Housing Opportunities Act, \nS. 2968, which reflects a long-term approach to empower communities and \nindividuals by consolidating and reforming HUD programs.\n  While there is much that remains to be done on this legislation, I am \npleased that a number of the provisions included in S. 2968 have been \nenacted or are included in today's introduced legislation.\n\n  An extension of the simplified FHA downpayment calculation was \nincluded in the fiscal year 2001 VA-HUD appropriations bill, and \ntoday's legislation permits Section 8 funds to be used for home \nownership downpayment assistance. It allows for the use of Section 8 \nassistance in grandfamily housing assistance with HOME funds, provides \nassistance for self-help housing providers, and includes several \nimprovements in the rural housing programs at the Department of \nAgriculture.\n  I also note that tax legislation is currently pending that includes \nsignificant increases in the caps of both the low-income housing tax \ncredit and private activity bond programs. If we do not get this \nlegislation enacted this year, I will continue to work hard with my \ncolleagues to get this done in the 107th Congress.\n  Early in this session of Congress, the Subcommittee on Housing and \nTransportation set out to modernize the standards for manufactured \nhousing. On October 5, 1999, the subcommittee held a comprehensive \nhearing on the proposed manufactured housing legislation. This \nlegislation worked its way through the Senate in 1999 under the \nleadership of Senator Shelby. The House included similar legislation in \na broader housing bill, and we have now reached agreement between the \ntwo Chambers on the compromise legislation.\n  This is a tremendous achievement that will contribute significantly \nto an increase in the amount of affordable housing in our communities. \nI know from my work in Colorado that this will have a positive impact \non the affordable housing shortage in my State.\n  Today's legislation includes several provisions to encourage the \nremoval of regulatory barriers to affordable housing. While this is \nlargely a State and local issue, there are steps that can be taken at \nthe Federal level to help ensure that government at all levels does not \nput excessive fees, permits, and regulations in place that drive up the \ncost of housing. In many cases these barriers move housing beyond the \nmeans of working families. I know this is an important issue for \nhomebuilders in Colorado and throughout the Nation.\n\n[[Page S11577]]\n\n  As chairman, I will continue to work with local government and \nhousing advocacy organizations during the 107th Congress to discourage \nand remove regulatory barriers to affordable housing.\n  It has been my pleasure to work with Senator Rick Santorum on a \nnumber of important provisions to improve the Section 202 and Section \n811 programs. Today's legislation reflects a compromise we have \nnegotiated on proposals designed to expand housing opportunities for \nthe elderly and persons with disabilities. These provisions reauthorize \nboth programs through fiscal year 2003, permit the refinancing of \nprogram loans, permit for-profit limited partnerships, mixed funding \nsources, and certain commercial activities designed to increase the \nviability of elderly and disabled housing programs. The legislation \nalso authorizes service coordinators and congregate services for \nelderly and disabled housing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section \ndescription of the bill, along with the full text of the bill, be \nprinted in the Record. And I thank all my colleagues who have helped to \nput this legislative package together.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3274\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n       \n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       (B) developing effective partnerships with governmental and \n     private entities to accomplish the objectives referred to in \n     subparagraph (A);\n       (2) the United States has a special responsibility for the \n     welfare of the Native peoples of the United States, including \n     Native Hawaiians;\n       (3) pursuant to the provisions of the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108 et seq.), the United \n     States set aside 200,000 acres of land in the Federal \n     territory that later became the State of Hawaii in order to \n     establish a homeland for the native people of Hawaii--Native \n     Hawaiians;\n       (4) despite the intent of Congress in 1920 to address the \n     housing needs of Native Hawaiians through the enactment of \n     the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108 et \n     seq.), Native Hawaiians eligible to reside on the Hawaiian \n     home lands have been foreclosed from participating in Federal \n     housing assistance programs available to all other eligible \n     families in the United States;\n       (5) although Federal housing assistance programs have been \n     administered on a racially neutral basis in the State of \n     Hawaii, Native Hawaiians continue to have the greatest unmet \n     need for housing and the highest rates of overcrowding in the \n     United States;\n       (6) among the Native American population of the United \n     States, Native Hawaiians experience the highest percentage of \n     housing problems in the United States, as the percentage--\n       (A) of housing problems in the Native Hawaiian population \n     is 49 percent, as compared to--\n       (i) 44 percent for American Indian and Alaska Native \n     households in Indian country;

Subject to \n     amounts appropriated, creates an Indian Lands Title Report \n     Commission to develop recommended approaches to improving how \n     the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) conducts title reviews in \n     connection with the sale of Indian lands. Receipt of a \n     certificate from BIA is a prerequisite to any sales \n     transaction on Indian lands, and the current procedure is \n     overly burdensome and presents a regulatory barrier to \n     increasing homeownership on Indian lands.\n       The Commission is composed of 12 members with knowledge of \n     Indian land title issues (4 appointed by the President, 4 by \n     the President from recommendations made by the Chairman of \n     the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \n     Committee, and 4 by President from recommendations made by \n     the Chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Financial \n     Services).

The Secretary may make \n     exceptions to, or modifications of, program requirements as \n     necessary and appropriate to meet the unique situation and \n     housing needs of Native Hawaiians.

These recommendations would be published in the \n     Federal Register for notice and comment prior to final \n     adoption by the Secretary. The committee shall be composed of \n     21 voting members, appointed by the Secretary, based on \n     recommendations of administering organizations, who shall be \n     qualified individuals (7 producers of manufactured housing, 7 \n     users of manufactured housing, and 7 general interest groups \n     and/or public officials), and one additional non-voting \n     member to represent the Secretary on the consensus committee. \n     The committee would function in accordance with the American \n     National Standards Institute (ANSI) procedures for the \n     development and coordination of American National \n     Standards.\n       If the Secretary fails to take final action on a proposed \n     revised standard, the Secretary shall appear before the \n     housing and appropriation subcommittees and committees of the \n     House of Representatives and the Senate and state the reason \n     for failure.\n\n[[Page S11604]]\n\n       Further, if the Secretary does not appear in person as \n     required, the Secretary will be prohibited from expending \n     funds collected under authority of this title in any amount \n     greater than that collected and expended in the fiscal year \n     preceding enactment of the Manufactured Housing Improvement \n     Act of 2000.\n       The revisions to section 604 would also clarify the scope \n     of federal preemption to ensure that disparate state or local \n     requirements do not affect the uniformity and comprehensive \n     nature of the federal standards. At the same time, the bill \n     would reinforce the proposition that installation standards \n     and regulations remain under the exclusive authority of each \n     state.\n       Section 605. Abolishment of the National Manufactured Home \n     Advisory Council; manufactured home installation. Section 605 \n     of existing law (P.L. 93-383) would be repealed, abolishing \n     the National Manufactured Home Advisory Council, which is \n     replaced by the consensus committee formed under Section --\n     04. A new section 605 is added, entitled ``Section 605. \n     Manufactured Home Installation,'' which give states five \n     years to adopt an installation program. During this five-year \n     period, the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development (HUD) and the Consensus Committee are charged \n     with constructing a ``model'' manufactured housing \n     installation program. In states that choose not to adopt an \n     installation program, HUD may contract with an appropriate \n     agent in those states to implement the ``model'' installation \n     program.\n       Section 606. Public information. Amends current \n     requirements governing cost information of any new standards \n     submitted by manufacturers to the Secretary by requiring the \n     Secretary to submit such cost information to the consensus \n     committee for evaluation.\n       Section 607. Research, Testing, Development, and Training. \n     Requires HUD Secretary to conduct research, testing, \n     development and training necessary to carry out the purposes \n     of facilitating manufactured housing, including encouraging \n     GSE's to develop and implement secondary market \n     securitization programs for FHA manufactured home loans, and \n     reviewing the programs for FHA manufactured home loans and \n     developing any changes to such programs to promote the \n     affordability of manufactured homes.\n       Section 608. Prohibited Acts. Requires continued compliance \n     with the requirements for the installation program required \n     by Section 605 in any State that has not adopted and \n     implemented a State installation program.\n       Section 609. Fees. Amends current section 620 by allowing \n     the Secretary to use industry label fees for the \n     administration of the consensus committee, hiring additional \n     program staff, for additional travel funding, funding of a \n     non-career administrator to oversee the program, and for \n     HUD's efforts to promote the availability and affordability \n     of manufactured housing. Prohibits the use of label fees to \n     fund any activity not expressly authorized by the act, unless \n     already engaged in by the Secretary, makes expenditure of \n     label fees subject to annual Congressional appropriations \n     review. Requires HUD to be accountable for any fee \n     increase by requiring notice and comment rulemaking.\n       Section 610. Dispute Resolution. In order to address \n     problems that may arise with manufactured homes, Section 610 \n     gives the states five years to adopt a dispute resolution \n     program for the timely resolution of disputes between \n     manufacturers, retailers, and installers regarding the \n     responsibility for the correction or repair of defects in \n     manufactured homes that are reported during the one year \n     period beginning on the date of installation. This also \n     requires state issuance of appropriate orders for the \n     correction or repair of defects in the manufactured homes \n     that are reported during the 1-year period beginning on the \n     date of installation under the dispute resolution program. In \n     states that choose not to adopt their own dispute resolution \n     program, HUD may contract with an appropriate agent in those \n     states to implement a dispute resolution program.\n       Section 611. Elimination of annual report requirement. \n     Eliminates existing annual reporting by the Secretary to \n     Congress on manufactured housing standards.\n       Section 612. Effective date. Effective date of the \n     legislation is the date of enactment, except that \n     interpretive bulletins or orders published as a proposed rule \n     prior to the date of enactment shall be unaffected.\n       Section 613. Savings provision. Existing manufactured \n     housing standards are maintained in effect until the \n     effective date of the Federal manufactured home construction \n     and safety standards pursuant to the amendments made by this \n     act.\n\n                 TITLE VII--RURAL HOUSING HOMEOWNERSHIP\n\n       Section 701. Guarantees for refinancing of rural housing \n     loans. Amends Section 502(h) of the Housing Act of 1949 to \n     allow borrowers of Rural Housing Service single-family loans \n     to refinance an existing direct or guarantee loan with a new \n     guarantee loan, provided the interest rate is at least equal \n     or lower than the current interest rate being refinanced; the \n     same home is used as security; the principle is equal or \n     lower than the refinanced amount plus closing costs, discount \n     points not exceeding 2 basis points and, an origination fee \n     prescribed by the Agriculture Secretary [HR 3834 (Andrews) \n     Homeowners Financing Protection Act (passed the House under \n     suspension on September 19, 2000).]\n       Section 702. Promissory note requirement under housing \n     repair loan program. Increases amount of promissory note \n     (instead of use of liens on property) amounts from $2,500 to \n     $7,500 (adjusted from late 1970's amount to account for home \n     repairs, e.g. roofing, heating systems, windows, etc.) \n     without going through the formal loan process.\n       Section 703. Limited partnership eligibility for farm labor \n     housing loans. Technical amendment that clarifies that \n     limited partnerships are eligible for loans under Section 514 \n     (Farm Labor Housing) in cases where the general partner is a \n     nonprofit entity.\n       Section 704. Project accounting records and practices. Sets \n     forth accounting and record keeping requirements, including \n     maintaining accounting records in accordance with generally \n     accepted accounting principles for all projects that receive \n     funds under this program; retaining records available for \n     inspection by the USDA Secretary for not less than six years, \n     and other requirements.\n       Section 705. Definition of rural area. Extends designation \n     of rural areas, for purposes of the Rural Housing Service \n     housing programs, for a narrow category of communities until \n     the 2010 census.\n       Section 706. Operating assistance for migrant farmworkers \n     projects. Allows Section 521 operating assistance for farm \n     labor housing complexes where ``mixed'' migrant and annual \n     workers will live.\n       Section 707. Multifamily rental housing loan guarantee \n     program. Allows Native Americans to become eligible borrowers \n     under the multifamily loan guarantee program; authorizes a \n     ``balloon payment'' as a financing option; allow fees from \n     lenders to be used to help offset program costs; and repeals \n     existing prohibition against the transfer of property title \n     from the lender to the federal government as well as the \n     prohibition against the transfer of liability from one \n     borrower to another.\n       Section 708. Enforcement provisions. Provides criminal \n     penalties and civil sanctions for violations of program \n     requirements.\n       Section 709. Amendments to title 18 of the United States \n     Code. Amends Title 18 of the U.S. Code--Money Laundering--to \n     strengthen enforcement and prosecution of program fraud and \n     abuse.\n\n         TITLE VIII--HOUSING FOR ELDERLY AND DISABLED FAMILIES\n\n       Section 801. Short Title. This title may be cited as the \n     ``Affordable Housing for Seniors and Families Act.''\n       Section 802. Regulations. Provides that the Secretary of \n     HUD shall issue regulations implementing the provisions of \n     this title only after notice and opportunity for public \n     comment.\n       Section 803. Effective Date. Provides that the provisions \n     of the title are effective upon enactment unless such \n     provisions specifically provide for effectiveness or \n     applicability upon another date certain.\n\n  Subtitle A--Refinancing for Section 202 Supportive Housing for the \n                                Elderly\n\n       Section 811. Prepayment and refinancing. Requires the \n     Secretary to approve prepayment of mortgages for Section 202 \n     properties if the sponsor (owner) continues the low-income \n     use restrictions. Requires that upon refinancing, the \n     Secretary make available at least 50% of annual savings \n     resulting from reduced Section 8 or other rental housing \n     assistance in a manner that is advantageous to tenants, \n     which may include increasing supportive services, \n     rehabilitation, modernization, and retrofitting of \n     structures, and other specified purposes.\n       This allows sponsors to build equity in their project that \n     can be used to refinance at lower interest rates. The \n     refinancing may result in lower project based Section 8 if \n     the sponsor elects lower debt service in addition to the \n     lower interest rate. The savings can then be used for \n     improvements to the facility or services for residents.\n\nSubtitle B--Authorization of Appropriations for Supportive Housing for \n               the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities\n\n       Section 821. Supportive housing for elderly persons. \n     Authorizes such sums for the existing program of supportive \n     housing for the elderly (section 202 housing) for FY 01 and \n     ``such sums as may be necessary'' for FY 02, and FY 03.\n       Section 822. Supportive housing for persons with \n     disabilities. Authorizes such sums for the existing program \n     of supportive housing for the disabled (section 811 housing) \n     for FY 01 and ``such sums as may be necessary'' for FY 02, \n     and FY 03.\n       Section 823. Service coordinators and congregate services \n     for elderly and disabled housing. Authorizes such sums for \n     grants for service coordinators, who link residents with \n     supportive or medical services in the community, for certain \n     federally assisted multifamily housing projects for FY 01 and \n     ``such sums as may be necessary'' for FY 02, and FY 03.\n\nSubtitle C--Expanding Housing Opportunities for the Elderly and Persons \n                           with Disabilities\n\n                    Part 1--Housing for the Elderly\n\n       Section 831. Eligibility of for-profit limited \n     partnerships. Allows 202 sponsors to form limited \n     partnerships with for-profits, but the nonprofits must be the \n     controlling partner. Through this partnership, the sponsors \n     could compete for the low income housing tax credit. With \n     this change, owners could build bigger developments and \n     achieve scale economies. The units financed under Section\n\n[[Page S11605]]\n\n     202 would be governed by those rules, and the tax credit \n     units would be governed under those rules. States would still \n     be making the decision who gets the LIHTC, and the limited \n     partnerships would have to compete like everybody else.\n       Section 832. Mixed funding sources. Allows private non-\n     profit housing providers to use all sources of financing, \n     including Federal funds, for amenities, relevant design \n     features and construction of affordable housing for seniors.\n       Section 833. Authority to acquire structures. Removes \n     limitation allowing private non-profit housing providers to \n     acquire only RTC-held properties. RTC went out of business. \n     This provision allows 202 projects to acquire properties.\n       Section 834. Use of project reserves. Project reserves, a \n     set-aside account funded through rent receipts for repairs to \n     the building's structure or infrastructure over the years \n     (roof, elevator, etc.), may be used to reduce the number of \n     dwelling units in the 202 project. The use of these funds is \n     subject to the Secretary's approval to ensure the use is \n     designed to retrofit obsolete or unmarketable units.\n       During the cost containment phase of the Section 202 \n     program, many efficiencies were built. In many cases, it is \n     preferable to convert efficiencies to 1 or 2 bedroom \n     apartments. In other instances, the project may want to \n     reduce units to make room for a clinic or community space.\n       Section 835. Commercial activities. Makes clear that \n     commercial facilities may be located and operated in Section \n     202 projects, as long as the business is not subsidized with \n     202 funds. These facilities can benefit residents and bring \n     some additional revenue (rent) to the project.\n\n             Part 2--Housing for Persons With Disabilities\n\n       Section 841. Eligibility of for-profit limited \n     partnerships. Provides that for-profit limited partnerships \n     are eligible to participate in the 811 program established \n     under this Act. The nonprofit will be the controlling \n     partner, and the limited partnership may compete for the \n     LIHTC.\n       Section 842. Mixed funding sources. Allows private non-\n     profit housing providers to use all sources of financing, \n     including Federal funds, for amenities, relevant design \n     features and construction of affordable housing for the \n     disabled.\n       Section 843. Tenant-based assistance for persons with \n     disabilities. Provides that tenant-based rental assistance \n     provided under Section 811 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National \n     Affordable Housing Act may be provided by a private nonprofit \n     organization as well as by a public housing agency as under \n     current law.\n       Section 844. Use of project reserves. Project reserves may \n     be used to reduce the number of dwelling units in an 811 \n     project to retrofit obsolete or unmarketable units. Allows \n     flexibility to design the project in a way that makes it more \n     comfortable & appealing for the residents.\n       Section 845. Commercial Activities. Clarifies that \n     commercial facilities may be located and operated in Section \n     811 projects, as long as the business is not subsidized with \n     811 funds.\n\n                        Part 3--Other Provisions\n\n       Section 851. Service coordinators. Allows service \n     coordinators to assist low-income elderly or disabled \n     families living in the vicinity of an eligible federally \n     assisted project. Requires HUD and HHS to develop standards \n     for service coordinators in federally assisted housing to \n     educate seniors about telemarketing fraud and facilitating \n     prosecution of such fraud. This change will make the \n     project a focal point of the community, address the \n     isolation many seniors feel particularly in rural areas--\n     and help seniors protect themselves against fraud.\n\n          Subtitle D--Preservation of Affordable Housing Stock\n\n       Section 861. Section 236 Assistance. Allows owners of \n     uninsured Section 236 projects to retain excess income. This \n     money is needed for repairs to the aging projects. The FY 00 \n     VA-HUD bill allowed uninsured Section 236 owners to retain \n     excess income (which results when 30% of somebody's income \n     exceeds the base rent established by HUD), but the authority \n     had to be approved on an annual basis through the \n     appropriations process. This provision puts the uninsured \n     236s on equal footing with the FHA insured projects, which \n     are already allowed to retain excess income.\n       To the extent a project owner has remitted excess income \n     charges to HUD since the date of enactment of the FY 1999 \n     appropriations Act, the Department may return to the relevant \n     project owner any such excess charges remitted. This would \n     put these owners on an equal footing with those owners who \n     had retained these excess charges and whom HUD has, through \n     notice, permitted to retain such excess income.\n\n               TITLE IX--OTHER RELATED HOUSING PROVISIONS\n\n       Section 901. Extension of Loan Term for Manufactured Home \n     Lots. Extends the loan terms for manufactured home lots \n     financed by insured financial institutions from 15 years, 32 \n     days to 20 years, 32 days.\n       Section 902. Use of Section 8 Vouchers for Opt--Outs. \n     Amends the VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations \n     Act of FY 2001 by changing the effective date when Section 8 \n     vouchers may be used in situations where owners opt out of \n     the program from 1996 to 1994.\n       Section 903. Maximum payment standard for enhanced \n     vouchers. Amends the VA, HUD and Independent Agencies \n     Appropriations Act of FY 2001 to require that HUD may not \n     limit the value of enhanced vouchers as provided under the \n     statute if such limit would adversely affect the assisted \n     families to which enhanced vouchers are provided.\n       Section 904. Use of section 8 assistance by ``grand-\n     families'' to rent dwelling units in assisted projects. \n     Allows HOME funds (in rental units otherwise not eligible for \n     HOME funds) to be used for facilities with units with low-\n     income families having a grandparent residing with a \n     grandchild, or in some cases, where great- and great-great \n     grandchildren are residing in the unit, with neither of the \n     child's parents residing in the household.\n\n               TITLE X--FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD PROVISIONS\n\n       Section 1001. Federal Reserve Board Buildings. Allows the \n     Federal Reserve Board to have more than one building.\n       Section 1002. Positions of Board of Governors of Federal \n     Reserve System on the Executive Schedule. Raises the pay of \n     the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board from Level II of \n     the Executive Schedule to Level I (approx. $14,800) and the \n     Board Members from Level III to Level II (approx. $10,500).\n       Section 1003. Amendments to the Federal Reserve Act. \n     Provides a new reporting requirement to replace the expired \n     provisions relating to the semi-annual ``Humphrey-Hawkins'' \n     reports requirements. Section 1002 requires the Chairman of \n     the Federal Reserve Board to appear before Congress at semi-\n     annual hearings to discuss monetary policy as well as \n     economic developments and prospects for the future. The \n     Chairman will appear before the House Banking Committee \n     around February 20 of even numbered years and July 20 of odd \n     numbered years, and before the Senate Banking Committee on \n     February 20 of odd numbered years and July 20 of even \n     numbered years. Either Committee may request the Chairman to \n     appear after his scheduled appearance before the other.\n       Requires the Federal Reserve Board to submit, concurrent \n     with each semi-annual hearing, a written report to both \n     Committees discussing the same subjects, taking into account \n     developments in employment, unemployment, production, \n     investment, real income, productivity, exchange rates, \n     international trade and payments, and prices.\n\n              TITLE XI--BANKING AND HOUSING AGENCY REPORTS\n\n       Section 1101. Short title. The title is cited as the \n     ``Federal Reporting Act of 2000.''\n       Section 1102. Preservation of certain reporting \n     requirements.

Coordination of Reporting Requirements. \n     Subsection (a) requires the FDIC's annual report to include \n     the agency's annual consumer affairs report.\n       Subsection (b) requires the annual report of the Federal \n     Reserve Board of Governor to include the Fed's annual report \n     of activities under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the \n     Board's annual consumer affairs report, the annual report on \n     administration of the Truth in Lending Act, and the Fed's \n     annual report on policy actions of the Federal Open Market \n     Committee and the Board.\n       Subsection (c) requires the OCC annual report to include \n     the agency's annual consumer affairs report.\n       Subsection (d) requires the Exim Bank's annual report on \n     export financing competition to include the tied aid report, \n     and makes the latter an annual rather than semi-annual \n     report.\n       Subsection (e) requires HUD's annual report to include the \n     Department's two annual reports required under the Civil \n     Rights Act relating to progress in eliminating housing \n     discrimination and data on applicants and participants in HUD \n     programs, the Department's annual and biennial reports on \n     lead based paint, the Department's annual report on all HUD \n     programs and operations, and HUD's annual report on housing \n     programs related to Indians and Alaskan Natives.\n       Subsection (f) requires the annual report of the Federal \n     Housing Administration to include the annual report on early \n     defaults on FHA-insured loans and the annual report on the \n     actuarial soundness of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund.\n       Subsection (g) amends the International Financial \n     Institutions Act to change Treasury's report on promoting \n     human rights through international financial institutions \n     from a quarterly report to an annual report.\n       Section 1104. Elimination of certain reporting \n     requirements. Provides for the repeal of certain Export-\n     Import Bank reports. One is a report from the President \n     requesting legislation if the amount of direct loan authority \n     or guarantee authority available to the Export-Import Bank \n     for the fiscal year involved exceeds the amount necessary. \n     This report is being repealed because it is a corollary to \n     the President's annual report on sufficiency of Exim \n     authority which expired pursuant to the sunset. There are \n     four ``sub-reports'' to Exim's annual report that are also to \n     be repealed: (1) a report on specific Exim's programs and \n     activities to promote nonnuclear renewable energy resources \n     and description of Exim's actions to assist small business \n     which is being repealed because this information is already \n     included in other reports; (2) a report on Exim's actions \n     on maintaining ``key linkage industries'' which is \n     unnecessary because Exim's annual report covers exports \n     for various industries; (3) a report on Exim's measures to \n     supplement financing for agricultural commodities which \n     was enacted 20 years ago but which is no longer needed \n     with Exim continuing to be involved in this area; and (4) \n     a report on Exim's programs on the export of services \n     which is also covered in the annual report since it is \n     part of Exim's activities.\n       This section also provides for the repeal of a semi-annual \n     FDIC report on the agency's efforts to maximize the efficient \n     use of private sector contractors to manage assets held by \n     the agency. There is little need for the report today since \n     assets have declined significantly since 1991. The 1999 \n     report showed the agency had only about 3% of the assets in \n     liquidation it had 7 years earlier.\n\n[[Page S11607]]\n\n                 TITLE XII--FINANCIAL REGULATORY RELIEF\n\n       Section 1200. Short Title. This title may be cited as the \n     ``Financial Regulatory Relief and Economic Efficiency Act of \n     2000.\n       Section 1201. Repeal of Savings Association Liquidity \n     Provision. Repeals unnecessary provisions relating to savings \n     association liquidity requirements.\n       Section 1202. Non-controlling Investments by Savings \n     Association Holding Companies. Allows a savings and loan \n     holding company to acquire a five to twenty-five percent non-\n     controlling interest of another SLHC or savings association, \n     subject to the approval of the Director of the OTS.\n       Section 1203. Repeal of Deposit Broker Notification and \n     Record Keeping Requirement. Repeals requirement that brokers \n     file a written notice with the FDIC before soliciting or \n     placing deposits with an insured depository institution.\n       Section 1204. Expedited Procedures for Certain \n     Reorganizations. Simplified procedures for a national bank \n     reorganizing into a bank holding company.\n       Section 1205. National Bank Directors. Permits national \n     banks to elect directors to terms of up to 3 years on a \n     staggered basis. Permits Comptroller to remove the limitation \n     on the number of board members.\n       Section 1206. Amendment to Bank Consolidation and Merger \n     Act. Permits national bank, upon approval of Comptroller, to \n     merge or consolidate with its subsidiaries or nonbank \n     affiliates--with no increase in powers for the national bank.\n       Section 1207. Loans on or Purchases by Institutions of \n     their own Stock. Repeals prohibition on a bank owning or \n     holding its stock, but retains prohibition on making loans or \n     discounts on the security of its own stock.\n       Section 1208. Purchased Mortgage Servicing Rights. \n     Authorizes the appropriate Federal banking agencies to \n     jointly simplify capital calculations by not requiring banks \n     or thrifts to distinguish between types of mortgage servicing \n     rights. This would allow regulators to value marketable \n     mortgages servicing assets in capital determinations up to \n     100% of their fair market value rather than the current \n     level which is limited to 90% of fair market value.\n\n          Subtitle B--Streamlining Activities of Institutions\n\n       Section 1211. Call Report Simplification. Provides for the \n     modernization of the call report filing and disclosure \n     system.\n\n                Subtitle C--Streamlining Agency Actions\n\n       Section 1221. Elimination of Duplicative Disclosure of Fair \n     Market Value of Assets and Liabilities. Clarifies that \n     banking agencies need no longer pursue further development of \n     the supplemental disclosure method. Even so, Section 36 of \n     FDIA and its supporting regulations provide agencies with \n     discretion to seek additional information in regulatory \n     reports and annual reports regarding fair market value.\n       Section 1222. Payment of Interest in Receiverships With \n     Surplus Funds. Gives the FDIC the authority to establish a \n     uniform interest rate with regard to receiverships.\n       Section 1223. Repeal of Reporting Requirements on \n     Differences in Accounting Standards. Amends the requirement \n     for each agency to produce an Annual Report on ``Agency \n     Differences in Reporting Capital Ratios and Related \n     Standards.'' Instead, this provision directs the Federal \n     banking agencies to jointly produce one report.\n       Section 1224. Extension of Time. Extends deadline for new \n     FHLB capital rules from 12 months to 18 months.\n\n                   Subtitle D--Technical Corrections\n\n       Section 1231. Technical Correction Relating to Deposit \n     Insurance Funds. Makes technical correction to FDIA.\n       Section 1232. Rules for Continuation of Deposit Insurance \n     for Member Banks Converting Charters. Makes technical changes \n     with regard to a cross-reference cite.\n       Section 1233. Amends to the Revised Statutes of the United \n     States.\n       1233(a) Provides that the Comptroller may waive the U.S. \n     citizenship requirement for up to a minority of a national \n     bank's directors. The Economic Growth and Regulatory \n     Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) inadvertently deleted the \n     long-standing authority of the Comptroller to waive the \n     citizenship requirement for up to a minority of directors of \n     national banks that are subsidiaries of affiliates of foreign \n     banks.\n       1233(b) Updates Section 11 to reflect that national banks \n     no longer issue national currency, while maintaining the \n     provision that prohibits the Comptroller from owning interest \n     in the national banks they regulate.\n       1233(c) Repeals Section 5138 of the Revised Statutes (first \n     enacted in 1864), which imposes minimum capital requirements \n     for national banks. This minimum capital requirement (ranging \n     from $50,000 to $200,000) is obsolete, since Congress granted \n     the Federal banking agencies the regulatory authority to \n     establish minimum capital requirements in 1983.\n       Section 1234. Conforming Changes to the International \n     Banking Act of 1978. Allows branches and agencies of foreign \n     banks that satisfy the asset test imposed on domestic banks \n     to be examined on an 18-month cycle instead of the 12-month \n     cycle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/05/senate-section/article/S11607-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 s. 664\n\n  At the request of Mr. L.
