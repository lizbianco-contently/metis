Mr. President, this past Saturday we watched a very \ninteresting spectacle. It was an athletic contest. There were no \narguments with referees. There was no vile language. There were no lewd \ngestures. There were no demands by the participants for more money. \nThere were no pleas from any of the players that they didn't get a fair \nopportunity to play, that they should have had more opportunities to \nshoot for a goal. It appeared to be a real team effort, a team effort \nby daughters and mothers.\n  We watched a great athletic contest between the United States and \nChina for the World Cup soccer championship. The U.S. women's soccer \nteam won on penalty kicks. There could not have been a more exciting \ngame.\n  I have had the opportunity to watch many soccer games, as my youngest \nboy played on three national championship soccer teams at the \nUniversity of Virginia. It is a great sport. Certainly the sport was \nexemplified in the work of these women last Saturday. Throughout the \ntournament, the U.S. team emphasized what it means to play as a team. \nThis was a team effort. It was team spirit that helped them win on \nSaturday.\n  There were really no standouts, even though there are great athletes \non both sides. The final penalty kick was by Brandi Chastain, but she \nwas just one of the players that day. Briana Scurry made her most \ncrucial save against China's third penalty kicker, Liu Ying, by diving \nto her left based particularly on instinct. Kristine Lilly saved what \nlooked to be China's winning shot with a header while standing at the \ngoal line in the first overtime. Mia Hamm, who\n\n[[Page S8206]]\n\nis a superstar, the Michael Jordan of women's athletics, led the \nattack. While she failed to score, she kept pressure on the Chinese for \nmost all of the game. Michelle Akers, at 33 the oldest team member, a \nwoman who suffers from Epstein-Barr, or chronic fatigue syndrome, \nplayed as if she would never be fatigued until the last minute of \nregulation play. She literally was carried off the field, succumbing to \ndehydration and exhaustion. She was certainly a stalwart of this team \neffort.\n  This team has captured America's heart. A crowd of over 90,000 people \nwatched that game. Cumulative attendance for the U.S. team's 6 \nvictories was 412,486, an average of almost 70,000 a game. The 90,000-\nplus that watched this game was the largest crowd to watch an athletic \ncontest among women. This team, that averaged 70,000 people watching \neach of its contests, was a constant reminder that this event was seen \nas a bellwether for women's athletics in America. Could women's teams \nfill stadiums? Could they draw advertising and television viewers in a \nnonolympic event? The answer to each of those questions was a \nresounding yes.\n  While most of their success is a result of the hard work and \ndedication of each team member to the sport of soccer, their brilliant \nplay on the field, and their personalities off the field, they were \naided even more in the fact this came about as a result of title IX.\n  There are many heroes in bringing about title IX. We could name Molly \nYard, who more than four decades ago started talking about why women \ndeserve to be treated equally in athletics. We could talk about \nSenators Birch Bayh from Indiana and George McGovern of South Dakota \nwho led the way in the Senate against sex discrimination in higher \neducation programs.\n  But there is no need to talk about any one individual. The fact is \nthat title IX makes a great case for American women.\n  I indicated that my youngest son is a good athlete. He really is a \ngreat athlete. But the fact of the matter is, he inherited his \nathleticism from his mother, not from his father. The fact is, his \nmother and I went to high school together.\n  The only thing that his mother, my wife, could do in high school was \nbe a cheerleader. As athletic as she was, she could not do anything \nelse because there was nothing else for her to do. She was not entitled \nto play any other athletics. Title IX says that is not the way it is to \nbe.\n  Title IX has been an outstanding program. It has allowed women to \nbuild their character and athleticism just as men did for many decades. \nThey are building their character, as seen in this team, this women's \nathletic team--the World Cup champions.\n  Women are now seen as sports stars in their own right, not through \ntheir sons but through themselves, from Mia Hamm in soccer to Sheryl \nSwoopes in basketball, and as shown by the inspiring story of Dr. Dot \nRichardson, the captain of the American Olympic softball team, who left \nher triumph in Atlanta to go to medical school. That is what title IX \nis all about. And Dot Richardson exemplifies what has been accomplished \non and off the field because of women's athletics.\n  Before the passage of title IX, athletic scholarships for college \nwomen were rare, no matter how great their talent. After winning two \ngold medals in the 1964 Olympics, swimmer Donna de Varona could not \nfind a college anyplace in the United States that offered a swimming \nscholarship. She was one of the finest, if not the finest swimmer in \nthe world at that time. She could not find one because it did not \nexist.\n  It took time and effort to improve the opportunities for young women. \nTwo years after title IX was voted into law, an estimated 50,000 men \nwere attending U.S. colleges and universities on athletic scholarships \nbut only about 50 women.\n  In 1973, the University of Miami in Florida awarded the first \nathletic scholarships to women--a total of 15 in swimming, diving, \ntennis, and golf. Today, college women receive about a third of all the \nathletic scholarships that are given. That is good. It should be half. \nBut a third is certainly a step in the right direction.\n  It is important to recognize that there is no mandate under title IX \nthat requires a college to eliminate men's teams to achieve compliance.\n  The critical values learned, though, are that women are entitled to \nequality. Those things learned from sports participation--including \nteamwork, standards, leadership, discipline, self-sacrifice, and pride \nin accomplishment--are equally important for young women as they are \nfor young men.\n  These women who have captured America's attention over the last 3 \nweeks are all children of title IX. They came to age athletically at a \ntime when high schools and colleges were required by law--a law that we \npassed--to treat them fairly.\n  These women have set an excellent example for the thousands and \nthousands of young girls who have followed their World Cup play over \nthe last 3 weeks.\n  I was listening to something on public radio this morning where they \ninterviewed young girls who attended their celebrations yesterday. They \nwere saying they wanted to be just like them. That is important.\n  So I congratulate all them and wish them continued success in the \nfuture.\n  I have a resolution that I would like to introduce later in the day. \nI certainly invite everyone to join with me. I would certainly be \nwilling to take a back seat to the women of the Senate, as we do a lot \nof times around here, to allow them to be first in line to sponsor this \nresolution. So at a later time today, I would like to introduce this \nresolution and hope that it would clear both sides of the aisle to give \nthese women the recognition they deserve today, to congratulate the \nU.S. women's soccer team on winning the 1999 Women's World Cup \nchampionship.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have come to the floor to speak on another issue, but I \nwatched the entire soccer game on Saturday. It was exciting and \nwonderful. I also thought about the fact that it is an example of a \nregulation that works. Title IX says: Equal opportunity; you must \nprovide equal opportunity in academics and athletics.\n  Before title IX, of course, there was not equal opportunity. I think \nSaturday's game was such a testament to the regulations and \nrequirements from title IX that have improved athletics and academics \nin this country.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate very much my friend from North Dakota \ncommenting. I say to my friend from North Dakota, it is extremely \ninteresting that young girls recognize that they do now have equal \nopportunity.\n  I was at a small school in rural Nevada and getting ready to speak to \na group of students who were assembling. I was in a holding room \nwaiting to speak, and there were two girls in the room with me. They \nwere wearing their letter sweaters. One of them was a sprinter and one \nplayed softball.\n  I said: Do you know why you can participate in athletics?\n  They said: No. Why?\n  Because we passed a law saying if boys have a program in athletics, \ngirls have to have something that is equal to the program the boys \nhave.\n  They did not know that. They just thought girls had always \nparticipated in athletics. One of the girls said: I would just die \nwithout my athletics.\n  Title IX is a program that of which we should all be proud. It has \nreally done a great deal to equalize athletics for boys and girls in \nAmerica. That is the way it should be.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts).

Mr. President, we are now turning to a 4-week period here \nin the Senate in which we will work, prior to the August recess, on a \nrange of issues--today beginning with the Patients' Bill of Rights, and \nthen turning to appropriations bills and other matters.\n\n[[Page S8207]]\n\n  I want to call to everyone's attention two issues that are of vital \nconcern that I think ought to be and must be part of the Senate agenda. \nThe first is an issue dealing with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is something that has been before \nthe Senate now for some long while. Efforts to achieve a nuclear test \nban treaty originated with President Eisenhower. It has been around a \nlong time. This President, after long negotiations through many \nadministrations, finally signed the treaty. It has now been sent to the \nSenate for ratification. But it has languished in the Senate for 658 \ndays, during which time there has not been even a hearing on the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n  I will put up a couple of charts to describe the circumstances with \nthis treaty.\n  The rule in the Senate requires that the Senate should consider \ntreaties as soon as possible after their submission.\n  In fact, the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963 was considered \nby the Senate in 3 weeks; SALT I, 3 months; the ABM Treaty, 10 weeks; \nABM Treaty Protocols, 14 months; START I, 11 months.\n  We have had the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty before the Senate for \n658 days with not even a hearing. I think that is a shame. This treaty \nought to be part of this Senate's agenda. If we do not have a hearing \nand do not ratify this treaty by the end of September, we will have \nonly a limited role when a conference is formed in October of the \ncountries that have ratified this treaty to discuss its entry into \nforce. It does not make any sense to me.\n  This country ought to lead on issues concerning the nonproliferation \nof nuclear weapons. One way to lead on those issues is to ratify the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It does not make any sense for the \ntreaty to have been signed, negotiated and sent to this Senate, and \nthen to have it languish for all of these days.\n  I would like to put up a chart which shows a concern that some of the \ncritics have. They say: Well, gosh, with all this Chinese espionage, \nthe last thing we want, is to do something with respect to a treaty on \nbanning nuclear tests.\n  The Cox report on the Chinese espionage makes references to the CTBT. \nThe report says it will be more difficult for the Chinese to develop \nadvanced nuclear weapons if we have this treaty in place. If the \nPeople's Republic of China violated the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \nby testing surreptitiously to further accelerate its nuclear \ndevelopment, we could detect it given the monitoring system imposed by \nthe treaty. If the Chinese are signatories to the treaty and the \nRussians are signatories to the treaty--and they are waiting for us--\nand we can stop testing, the only conceivable way they could validate \nany kind of nuclear stockpile is through the use of advanced computers. \nThe restrictions imposed by the CTBT make it extremely difficult or \nimpossible to improve nuclear weapons designs except by high \nperformance computers.\n  The Cox report appears to make the point that it is more important \nfor us to restrict the shipment of advanced computers to the \nChinese. The point is this--we deserve an opportunity to debate the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. We should have done so long ago. \nI don't mean to argue the merits of it on the floor today.\n\n  My hope is, we will not go through July as if this treaty doesn't \nexist. It was negotiated, signed, and has been before the Senate over \n600 days. There hasn't been one hearing. There ought to be a hearing. \nIt ought to be brought to the floor so the American people can, through \nthis Senate, debate that treaty.\n  Finally, support for the nuclear test ban: 75 percent, 74 percent, 85 \npercent, 80 percent, these are national polls over time, always \nconsistently high support for this kind of a treaty. This Congress has \na responsibility. I say to my colleagues who really don't want to do \nthis: You have a responsibility to the country to do this. I hope that \nin the month of July we can make progress in passing this Comprehensive \nNuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to send a resolution \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/12/senate-section/article/S8207-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8207-S8208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE FARM CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me turn to an additional issue I \nbelieve Congress and the President must consider in the month of July. \nIt deals with the urgent farm crisis that exists in farm country across \nAmerica.\n  If there was a massive earthquake, a series of tornadoes, fires, or \nfloods across the Midwest, we would see Congress, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, virtually everyone involved through the Federal \nagencies responding immediately. The President would likely fly out and \nview it. Congress would send emergency help. Federal agents would be \nthere en masse setting up offices to help.\n  Yet in farm country we have a crisis that is just as real, not as \ndangerous to human health or human life as a tornado or a flood, \nperhaps, but just as real and just as dramatic as natural disasters.\n  The chart here shows what has happened to the price of wheat since \n1996. You can see what has happened to the price of wheat. We have \nmostly wheat farmers up in our part of the country. The price of wheat \nhas collapsed like a lead weight. Ask yourself: If your income \ncollapsed, if a Senator's income collapsed like that, do you think \nthere would be howls of protest? Do you think that would be an \nemergency? How about the minimum wage, if it went down like this? How \nabout if the stock market looked like this? Do you think there would be \na problem in this country? Of course, there would.\n  This is a huge problem in the farm belt. Family farmers are finding \nthemselves on the precipice of going broke in record numbers. I had a \ncall this morning from a family farmer who nearly choked up on the \nphone saying: I don't think my son and I can continue. We can't \ncontinue when prices have collapsed. We don't have the income to \ncontinue family farming.\n  For them it is a dream, a lifestyle, a way of life. It is not just a \nbusiness.\n  This Congress, while prices have collapsed, largely is content to \nsort of meander around and talk as if it were theory. It is not theory. \nIt is a crisis.\n  This chart shows what is happening across the farm belt. The red \nindicates the counties that have lost more than 10 percent of their \npopulation, 1980-1998. Take a look at the red. What does that show? The \nmiddle part of America is being depopulated, especially now with prices \ncollapsing, people moving out and not in.\n  The question is, ``What are we going to do about that?'' Congress has \na responsibility to do something about it and so does this President. \nThis Congress passed the Freedom to Farm bill. The presumption of \nFreedom to Farm is, we will reduce support prices and you rely on the \nmarketplace. If the marketplace has collapsed prices, there has to be a \nsafety net. If you don't have a safety net, you won't have family \nfarmers left.\n  Freedom to Farm hasn't worked, and this Congress needs to understand \nthat and do something about it. The President also has a \nresponsibility. He signed the Freedom to Farm bill. He complained a \nlittle about it when he signed it, but he signed it and said: We will \nmake some improvements.\n  The Freedom to Farm bill hasn't worked. Our trade policies are \nbankrupt and not working. Concentration of agricultural industries \nmeans that farmers face monopolies in every direction. All of these \ncombined together are conspiring to leave this country without family \nfarmers in its future, and that will be, in my judgment, a massive \nfailure for America.\n  In the month of July, in the coming 4 weeks, the President has a \nresponsibility, in my judgment, to come to Congress with a bold \napproach in dealing with this issue. Congress has a responsibility to \ndeal with it, as well, in a bold manner.\n  I know some in Congress say: We don't intend to do anything until the \nPresident sends us something. They didn't have that reticence about \nadding $6 billion to the defense bill. When the emergency bill came up \nfor defense, they said: We don't care what the President said. We think \nhe should have $6 billion more.\n  This is a joint responsibility. The Congress needs to act and the \nPresident needs to act. We need to do it together, and it needs to be \ndone now.\n\n[[Page S8208]]\n\nNot later, now. If we don't take action soon, we won't have family \nfarmers left. We won't have to worry about an emergency family farm \nbill because there won't be family farmers around to respond to.\n  Again, if there was an earthquake or a flood or fire or tornado or \nperhaps even some hog disease, as Will Rogers used to say, you'd have \nall the Federal agents coming out to talk about the hog disease. They \nwould want to know, ``what is happening here and will it spread to \nother hogs?''\n  One way to get attention, it seems to me, is for Congress and the \nPresident to decide that this is a farm crisis. It is in my part of the \ncountry, with the collapse in prices and the natural disaster that has \nkept about 3 million acres from being planted in North Dakota because \nit was too wet. The floods and the worst crop disease in this century, \nall piled on top of family farmers' shoulders at a time when prices are \ncollapsed. To add to their burden, we have a trade agreement that \nallows the Europeans to spend 10 times as much on their farm program as \nwe do and undercuts prices on sales to foreign governments. We let them \ndo that in excess of ours--we won't even use our export program for \nreasons I don't understand--at a time of mounting burdens on family \nfarmers in a way that is fundamentally unfair.\n  We had better decide as a country that family farming matters to our \nfuture. If we don't, they won't be around. When they are not around, \ncorporations will farm our country coast to coast. The price of food \nwill go up and this country will have lost something and every small \ntown will have lost something important.\n  This is not just about farmers. It is about small towns and Main \nStreets and boarded-up business and economies that are empty shells in \na lot of our small communities.\n  My message is very simple: We have a responsibility this month. We \nhave a responsibility now, all of us, and so does the President, to \nhave a meeting. I want the White House to have a meeting on this with \nRepublicans and Democrats. I want us to come together with an emergency \npackage that responds to the farm crisis, does it boldly, does it in a \nway that helps real family farmers, and does it in a way that gives \nfamily farmers some hope that their future is a future in which they \ncan make a decent living raising America's food supply.\n  If I might make one additional point: We have to rely on foreign \nmarkets as well. We produce more food than we consume in this country. \nYet I heard last week that the amount of imported food in this country \nhas doubled in the last 7 years.\n  We had protests at the Canadian border last weekend. It is unfair the \nlevel of imports coming from Canada. The thing I don't understand, \nhowever, is the grain market, all these folks that worship at the altar \nof the marketplace in the grain market. The grain market says to our \nfarmers: Your food that you produce has no value. Yet all the testimony \nwe hear from all around the world, Sudan included, tells us that old \nwomen are climbing trees foraging for leaves to eat because there is \nnothing to eat. We know that a substantial portion of the world's \npopulation goes to bed at night with an ache in their belly because of \nhunger.\n  It makes no sense for us to be told that our food has no value when \npeople go to bed hungry each night. I want the White House and the \nCongress together to boldly respond to this issue in the coming weeks. \nThis 4-week period is critical. We must put this on the agenda in a \nbipartisan way and do so boldly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to acknowledge, and I very much \nappreciate, the action taken last week by the President in response to \nthe recommendations of the International Trade Commission--otherwise \nknown as the ITC--on relief for the American lamb industry. As you \nknow, the industry has gone through very difficult times these last few \nyears. Imports have surged dramatically and lamb prices have dropped \nprecipitously. The package of trade relief and adjustment assistance \nannounced by the President will help the industry adjust. It will allow \nour producers and feeders to keep their businesses and prosper in the \nfuture.\n  I am very grateful to the President and the staff of many agencies \nfor their work on behalf of the American lamb industry and the American \nworkers in that industry.\n  This was an important decision. Why? For several reasons. First, of \ncourse, it provides significant relief to the lamb industry, which is \nvery important in my home State, as well as elsewhere in the Nation. \nSecond, however, it demonstrates that section 201 of U.S. trade law can \nwork. This is the so-called ``safeguard provision.'' It is designed to \nprevent serious disruption to the domestic industry whenever there is \nan import surge.\n  Third, the decision was important because I hope it shows a renewed \ncommitment by the Clinton administration to assist American industries. \nThis includes the agriculture sector that faces unprecedented \nchallenges in the U.S. market for reasons not of their own making.\n  Section 201 has been little used in recent years. Both Democratic and \nRepublican administrations have been reluctant to agressively apply its \nprovisions. For example, in the mid-1980s President Reagan would not \nfollow an ITC recommendation for trade relief for the American footwear \nindustry.\n\n  That failure was a major contributor to the introduction of many \nlegislative proposals that could have significantly closed the American \nmarket to foreign products. American industries and workers--whether in \nmanufacturing, agriculture, or services--must think the Federal \nGovernment will use all available tools to help them when they are \nchallenged suddenly by surges in imports. This is especially important \ntoday, when global financial disruption can change competitive \npositions of countries overnight.\n  In the case of lamb, we see an industry that has been severely \ndamaged by imports. Without relief, the injury to the industry would \nhave continued to worsen. The number of sheep being raised is at an \nall-time low. Prices have dropped precipitously. Lending institutions \nare increasingly unwilling to extend credit.\n  The industry did what it was supposed to do. It used the domestic \nlegal process authorized by the WTO. That process is enforced through \nsection 201 of the U.S. trade law. This is how the process should work \nand, in this case, is working.\n  I believe the reluctance of the executive branch over the past 15 \nyears to take action under section 201 has been a serious mistake. The \nmost recent example of this is the late action that was taken by the \nadministration to deal with the surge of steel imports. The volume of \nsteel imports now seems to be under control. But we are still faced \nwith a dilemma. How can we ensure that the next time the steel sector, \nor any other sector, is threatened by a precipitous spike in imports, \nstrong and rapid measures will be taken to provide relief to those \nindustries?\n  Earlier this session, I introduced the Import Surge Relief Act. It \nwould improve and expedite the way our Government deals with import \nsurges. It would ease the standard that must be met to demonstrate that \nthere is a causal link between imports and injury to an American \nindustry. It would\n\n[[Page S8209]]\n\nspeed up the process for addressing import surges. It would provide for \nan early warning about import surges so action can be taken before the \nAmerican industry is irreversibly damaged. All this is perfectly legal \nunder the WTO.\n  Let me address a few remarks to the principal exporters of lamb to \nthe United States--Australia and New Zealand. There has been a lot of \nmisinformation coming from the industry and governments in those two \ncountries.\n  This is not an attack on the lamb industry in Australia or New \nZealand. Rather, it is a measure taken under U.S. trade law to provide \ntemporary--and I underline the word ``temporary''--relief to a \ndevastated American industry. The actions announced by the President \nare compatible with the WTO. Australia and New Zealand will continue to \nship large quantities of lamb to the United States. Their exports would \nbe able to grow each year.\n  The only difference is that the American lamb industry will stay in \nbusiness and American workers will keep their jobs. Australia and New \nZealand have the right to appeal to WTO. I am sure they will do that, \nand I am confident that the appeal will not be successful. Everyone \nshould understand that this action was necessary to provide temporary \nrelief to an industry that was hurting.\n  Let me conclude by again thanking the President and the \nadministration officials who made possible this important action to \nprovide remedies to the devastated lamb industry in the United States.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1344, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1344) to amend the Public Health Service Act, \n     the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to protect consumers in managed \n     care plans and other health coverage.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nfrom general debate on the bill under the unanimous consent agreement.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has begun debate on the Patients' Bill \nof Rights and the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus. There is a growing \nunease across this Nation about changes in how we receive our health \ncare. People worry that if they or their loved ones become ill, their \nHMO may deny them coverage and force them to accept either inadequate \ncare or financial ruin, or perhaps even both. They believe that vital \ndecisions affecting their lives will be made not by a supportive family \ndoctor but, rather, by an unfeeling bureaucracy.\n  Our goal this week should be to join together to work in a bipartisan \nway to enact legislation that accomplishes three major purposes.\n  First, it should protect patients' rights and hold HMOs accountable \nfor the care they promise.\n  Second, it should expand, not contract, Americans' access to \naffordable health care.\n  And, third, it should improve health care quality and outcomes.\n  I believe all of us should be able to agree that medically necessary \npatient care should not be sacrificed to the bottom line and that \nhealth care decisions should be in the hands of medical professionals, \nnot insurance accountants or trial lawyers.\n  We do face an extremely delicate balancing act as we attempt to \nrespond to concerns about managed care without resorting to unduly \nburdensome Federal controls and mandates that will further drive up the \ncost of insurance and cause some people to lose their health insurance \naltogether.\n  That is the crux of the debate we are undertaking this week. The crux \nof this debate is how can we make sure that we address those critical \nconcerns we all have about managed care without so driving up the cost \nof the health insurance people have--as the Kennedy bill would do--that \nwe jeopardize coverage for thousands, indeed millions, of Americans.\n  As the President's Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and \nQuality noted in its report, ``costs matter . . . the Commission has \nsought to balance the need for stronger consumer rights with the need \nto keep coverage affordable. . . Health coverage is the best consumer \nprotection.''\n  I think President Clinton's quality commission hit it right. I \nbelieve they have stated exactly what the debate is before us. I, \ntherefore, have been alarmed by recent reports that American employers \neverywhere, from giant multinational corporations to the tiny corner \nstore, are facing huge hikes in medical insurance averaging 8 percent \nand sometimes soaring to 20 percent or more.\n  This is a remarkable contrast to the past few years when premiums \nrose less than 3 percent, if at all. I am particularly concerned about \nthe impact these rising costs are having on small businesses and their \nemployees.\n  A survey of small employers conducted by the United States Chamber of \nCommerce earlier this year found that, on average, small businesses \nwere hit with a 20-percent premium hike last year. More important, of \nthe small employers surveyed, 10 percent were forced to discontinue \nhealth care coverage for their employees because of these premium \nincreases. Over half of the employers surveyed indicated that they \nswitched to a lower cost plan, while an overwhelming majority indicated \nthat they had passed the additional costs of these premium hikes on to \ntheir employees through increased deductibles, higher copays, or \npremium hikes.\n\n  This, too, is very troubling since it will induce many more \nemployees, especially lower wage workers and their families, who are \ndisproportionately affected by increased costs, to turn down coverage \nwhen it is offered to them. Indeed, in the HELP Committee, on which I \nserve, we saw a GAO report which indicated that an increasing number of \nAmerican employees are turning down the health insurance offered by \ntheir employers because they simply cannot afford to pay their share of \nthe costs.\n  It is no wonder that the ranks of uninsured Americans increased \ndramatically last year to 43 million people--the highest percentage in \na decade. This is happening at a time when our economy is thriving. \nImagine what could happen in an economic downturn.\n  We know that increasing health insurance premiums cause significant \nlosses in coverage. That is the primary reason that I am so opposed to \nthe Kennedy bill. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the \nKennedy bill, that has been laid down before us, will increase health \ninsurance premiums by an additional 6.1 percent over and above the \npremium increases we have already experienced or are likely to \nexperience as a result of a resurgent increase in health care \ninflation.\n  The CBO report goes on to note that:\n\n       Employers could respond to premium increases in a variety \n     of ways. They could drop health insurance [coverage] \n     entirely, reduce the generosity of the benefit package [in \n     other words, cut back on the benefits that are provided], \n     increase cost-sharing by [their employees], or increase the \n     employee's share of the premium.\n\n  CBO assumed that employers would deflect about 60 percent of the \nincrease in premiums through these strategies. In other words, 60 \npercent of this increased cost is going to go right to American \nworkers. The remaining increase in premiums would be passed on to \nworkers in the form of lower wages. In short, it is the workers of \nAmerica, it is the employees, who will be paying this increased cost.\n  Lewin Associates, a well-respected health consulting firm, in a study \nfor\n\n[[Page S8210]]\n\nthe AFL-CIO, has estimated that for every 1 percent increase in \npremiums, 300,000 Americans have their health insurance jeopardized. \nBased on these projections, passage of the Kennedy bill would result in \nthe loss of coverage for more than 1.8 million Americans. That is more \nthan the entire population of my home State of Maine.\n  The Kennedy bill should be more aptly titled the ``Patients Bill of \nCosts'' because ultimately it will be the patient who will get hit with \nhigher health care costs if the Kennedy bill is approved.\n  Our legislation, by contrast, provides the key protections that \nconsumers want without causing costs to soar. It responsibly applies \nthese protections where they are needed. The legislation does not \npreempt but, rather, builds upon the good work that States have done in \nthe area of patients' rights and protections. States have had the \nprimary responsibility for the regulation of health insurance since the \n1940s.\n  I spent 5 years in State government as a member of the Governor's \ncabinet and was responsible for the Bureau of Insurance. I know State \ninsurance regulators have done a good job in protecting the rights and \nneeds of their consumers in their State. In fact, they have been far \nahead of the Federal Government in responding to concerns about managed \ncare.\n\n  For example, 47 States have passed laws prohibiting ``gag clauses'' \nthat restrict communications between patients and their doctors. As a \nconsequence, as the CBO notes in its report on the Kennedy bill, \n``Several studies have shown that few plans impose such restrictions \ntoday.''\n  Forty States have requirements for emergency care. All 50 States have \nrequirements for grievance procedures. And 36 States require direct \naccess to an OB/GYN.\n  States have acted without any mandate from Washington, without any \nprod from Washington, to protect their consumers. Moreover, one size \ndoes not fit all; what might be appropriate for one State may not fit \nfor the consumers in another.\n  Florida, for example, provides for direct access to a dermatologist, \nwhich is understandable given the high rate of skin cancer in that \nState. In the State of Maine, another kind of mandate may be more \nappropriate. Similarly, what may be appropriate for California, which \nhas a high penetration of HMOs, may simply not be necessary in a rural \nState such as Wyoming where there is little or no managed care. In such \nStates, a new blanket of heavyhanded Federal mandates in coverage \nrequirements will simply drive up costs and impede, not enhance, health \ncare. That is why the National Association of Insurance Commissioners \nsupports the approach we have taken in our bill.\n  Currently, Federal law prohibits States from regulating the self-\nfunded, employer-sponsored health plans that cover 48 million \nAmericans. Our bill, which is intended to protect the unprotected \nconsumer, extends many of the same rights and protections to these \nindividuals and their families that those in State-regulated health \nplans already enjoy.\n  For the first time, people in self-funded plans will be guaranteed \nthe right to talk freely and openly with their doctors about treatment \noptions without being subjected to any kind of ``gag clauses'' that \nlimit their communications. They will be guaranteed coverage for \nemergency room care that a ``prudent layperson'' would consider \nmedically necessary without having to get prior authorization from \ntheir health plan. They will be able to see their OB/GYN or \npediatrician without a referral from their plan's ``gatekeeper.'' They \nwill have the option of seeing a doctor who is outside the HMO's \nnetwork. They will also be guaranteed access to nonformulary drugs when \nit is medically necessary, and they will have an assurance of \ncontinuity of care if their health care plan terminates its contract \nwith their doctor or hospital.\n  The opponents of our legislation contend that the Federal Government \nshould preempt the States' patient protection laws unless they have \nalready enacted identical protections. However, the States' approaches \nvary widely--for good reasons. Moreover, if we start adopting a \nWashington-knows-best approach to health care, we will have HCFA \ndeciding whether a State has met the test of a Federal regulation. Our \nexperience with other laws should show that is not a good idea.\n  Other provisions of our bill provide new protections for additional \nmillions of other Americans. These are the procedural protections that \nare in our bill. A key provision of our bill builds upon the existing \nregulatory framework under ERISA to give all 124 million Americans in \nemployer-sponsored plans the assurance that they will get the care they \nneed when they need it.\n  The legislation will enhance and improve current ERISA information \ndisclosure requirements and penalties and strengthen existing \nrequirements for coverage determinations, grievances and appeals, \nincluding--and this is the most important provision of our bill--the \naddition of a new requirement for strong, independent, external review \nthat is available at no cost to the patient.\n  All 124 million Americans in employer-sponsored plans will be \nentitled to clear and complete information about their health plan--\nabout what it covers and what it does not cover, about any cost-sharing \nrequirements, and about the plan's providers. Helping patients \nunderstand their coverage before they need to use it will help to avoid \ndisputes about coverage later.\n  The goal of any patients' rights legislation should be to resolve \ndisputes about coverage up front when the care is needed, not months or \neven years later in a courtroom, as the Kennedy bill proposes. Our \nlegislation would accomplish this goal by creating a strong internal \nand external review process. Both appeals processes are available at no \ncost to the patient.\n\n  Here is how it would work. First, patients or doctors who are unhappy \nwith an HMO's decision could appeal it internally through a review \nconducted by individuals with appropriate expertise who are not \ninvolved in the initial decision. Moreover, this review would have to \nbe conducted by a physician, if the denial is based on a determination \nthat the service is not medically necessary or that it was experimental \ntreatment. Patients would expect results from this review within 30 \ndays, or 72 hours, in cases where delay poses a serious risk to the \npatient's health.\n  Let's say that after this internal review process is completed, the \npatient or the physician is still unhappy with the decision; let's say \nthat the internal review upheld the HMO's decision. There is still \nanother protection in our bill. Patients turned down by this internal \nreview would then have the right to a free, independent, external \nreview conducted by medical experts who are completely independent of \nthe insurance plan.\n  This review must be completed within 30 days, and even faster, if \nthere is a medical emergency or a risk to the patient's life or health. \nMoreover, the decision of these outside reviewers is binding on the \nhealth plan. It is not binding on the patient.\n  If you have been denied care you think you need, you can apply for an \ninternal review. If you are not happy with that review, you can go on \nto an independent external review, and the decision of the physician, \nwho has to have expertise in the condition at issue, is binding on the \nhealth plan, but it is not binding on you, if you are still unhappy. If \nyou are still unhappy with the decision made, the patient would still \nhave the right, would retain the right to sue in Federal or State court \nfor attorney's fees, for court costs, for the value of the benefit, and \ninjunctive relief. Really, it is a three-stage appeals process: First, \nan internal review, an external appeal, and then you can still go to \ncourt to sue for the benefit and for your attorney's fees and court \ncosts.\n  The purpose of our legislation is to place treatment decisions in the \nhands of doctors, not insurance company accountants, and not in the \nhands of trial lawyers. If your HMO denies treatment that your \nphysician believes is medically necessary, you should not have to \nresort to a costly and lengthy court battle to get the care you need. \nYou should not have to hire a lawyer. You should not have to file an \nexpensive lawsuit to get the treatment.\n  Our approach contrasts with the approach taken in the Kennedy bill, \nwhich encourages patients to sue their health plans. I simply do not \nbelieve you can sue your way to quality health care. We should solve \nproblems about\n\n[[Page S8211]]\n\nhealth care coverage upfront, when the care is needed, not months or \neven years later, after the harm has occurred.\n  Let's look at the experience with medical malpractice cases. \nAccording to the GAO, it takes an average of 33 months to resolve \nmalpractice cases. This does nothing to ensure a patient's right to \ntimely and appropriate care. Moreover, patients receive only 43 cents \nout of every dollar awarded in malpractice cases. Exposing health plans \nand employers to greater liability would force plans to cover \nunnecessary services that do not benefit patients in order to avoid \ncostly litigation and to make decisions based not on the best practice \nprotocols but, rather, on the latest jury verdicts and court decisions \nor out of fear of being sued.\n\n  The noted Princeton health economist Uwe Reinhardt was quoted in this \nSunday's Washington Post as saying that he believes the financial \nimpact of the Kennedy bill's liability provisions would be profound. He \nnoted:\n\n       In the end, we're back again to basically the open-ended \n     deal where the individual physician makes a judgment and no \n     one dares question it.\n\n  Mr. President, all of us treasure the relationships we have with our \nphysicians. We are also well aware of studies that have shown there \nhave been unnecessary hysterectomies, for example, or the use of \nmastectomy when removal of a lump from a breast would suffice. That is \nwhy we need to have reviews based on the best medical evidence and \ndecisionmaking possible.\n  The President's Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and \nQuality specifically rejected expanded lawsuits for health plans \nbecause the commission believed it would have serious consequences for \nthe entire health care industry. I agree with that assessment. The last \nthing we need is to introduce more costly litigation into our health \ncare system.\n  At a time when the tort system of the United States has been \ncriticized as inefficient, expensive, and of little benefit to the \ninjured, the Kennedy bill would be bad medicine for American families, \nworkers, and employers, driving up the cost of health insurance and \njeopardizing coverage for some who need it most.\n  Our concern is not just theoretical. I met with a group, a very good \ngroup of Maine employers who care deeply about their employees. They \nexpressed to me their serious concerns about the Kennedy proposal to \nexpand liability for health plans and employers. For example, the \nrepresentative from Bowdoin College in Maine talked about how moving to \na self-funded ERISA plan had enabled the college to greatly improve the \ncoverage it provided to Bowdoin's employees and to offer affordable \ncoverage to them.\n  Since the college is self-funded, it has actually been able to lower \npremiums for its employees while at the same time providing an enhanced \nbenefit package with such features as well baby care, free annual \nphysicals, and prescription drug cards with low copayments. The people \nat Bowdoin College told me that the Kennedy proposal to expand \nliability would seriously jeopardize their ability to offer affordable \ncoverage for their employees. In fact, they told me they would probably \nabandon their self-funded plan and go back into the insurance market \nand, thus, buy a plan that would have fewer benefits for their \nemployees in order to avoid this increased risk of liability and \nlitigation.\n  Similar concerns were expressed to me by the Maine Municipal \nAssociation, which represents cities and towns throughout Maine, L.L. \nBean, Bath Iron Works, and many other responsible Maine employers.\n  Unlike the Kennedy bill, the Republican bill contains key provisions \nthat will help hold down the cost of health care while improving health \ncare quality and holding HMOs accountable.\n  For example, I am particularly pleased that our bill contains a \nproposal, introduced by my colleague, the senior Senator from Maine, \nthat prohibits insurers from discriminating on the basis of predictive \ngenetic information. Genetic testing holds tremendous promise for \nindividuals who have a genetic predisposition to breast cancer and \nother diseases and conditions with a genetic link. However, this \npromise is significantly threatened when insurance companies use the \nresults of such testing to deny or limit coverage to consumers on the \nbasis of genetic information.\n  Our legislation also establishes the agency for health care research \nand quality, an initiative of our physician in the Senate, Mr. Frist \nfrom Tennessee. The purpose of these provisions is to foster an overall \nimprovement in health care quality, to bridge the gap between what we \nknow and what we do in health care today.\n  Most important, the Republican bill will expand access to health \ninsurance for millions more Americans by making it more affordable. \nThis is the key difference between the two alternatives before the \nSenate. Our bill would expand access to health care, a critical issue \nat a time when we have 43 million uninsured Americans. The Kennedy bill \nwould constrict access and jeopardize coverage for many Americans. The \nbiggest obstacle to health care in the United States today is simply \ncost. This is due, in part, to the Tax Code's inequitable treatment of \npeople who do not receive health insurance through their employers. \nSome 25 million Americans are in families headed by self-employed \nindividuals, and, of these, 5 million are uninsured. The Republican \nbill will make health insurance more affordable for these Americans by \nallowing self-employed individuals to deduct the full amount of their \nhealth care premiums.\n\n  I have never understood the policy behind our Tax Code that allows a \nlarge corporation to deduct 100 percent of the cost of the health \ninsurance premiums that it is providing to its employees but restricts \na self-employed individual to a deduction of only 45 percent. Our bill \nwould move that to 100 percent immediately. This would help reduce the \nnumber of uninsured working Americans. It would help make health \ninsurance more affordable to the 82,000 people in Maine who are self-\nemployed. They include our lobster men, our hair dressers, our \nelectricians, our plumbers, and the owners of our gift shops, which we \nhope all of you will visit this summer along the coast of Maine. It \nincludes so many hard-working Mainers for whom the cost of health \ninsurance is simply out of reach.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the Republican approach strikes the \nright balance, as we effectively address concerns about quality and \nchoice without resorting to unduly burdensome Federal controls and \nexpensive, bureaucratic, new Federal mandates that will further drive \nup costs and cause some Americans to lose their health insurance \naltogether.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in supporting the Republican health task \nforce legislation.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished minority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this is truly a historic day. My \nDemocratic colleagues and I have been trying for nearly 2 years to \nbring this debate to the floor of the Senate.\n  For the past 2 years, I have listened to people and their complaints \nabout the health care system. I have come to the conclusion that the \nreason the insurance companies call them HMOs is that H-M-O sums up \ntheir patient philosophy: Having Minimal Options.\n  I thank the majority leader. It is no secret that Senator Lott faced \nconsiderable pressure to prevent this debate. On behalf of the 161 \nmillion Americans who need the protections in our bill, we thank him \nfor agreeing, finally, to bring this debate to the floor.\n  Most of all, I want to acknowledge my Democratic colleagues. We would \nnot be having this debate were it not for their steadfast determination \nand hard work. That is particularly true of the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy. They have each taken considerable risks to \ndemand that this Senate listen to and deal with the real problems \nAmerica's families are having with their HMOs. Every one of them \ndeserves recognition.\n  The general debate on this bill is supposed to last 3 hours--which, \naccording to an HMO, is enough time for a woman to check into a \nhospital, deliver a baby, and be sent home. Senator Kennedy and I and \nothers intend to use these 3 hours to talk about the extraordinary \ndifference in approach between the Democratic and the Republican plans.\n\n[[Page S8212]]\n\n  There are no bills pending in this Congress that will have a greater \nimpact on the lives and health of America's families than this bill. \nThere are no decisions we will make that will have a more profound \neffect than the decisions we make this week.\n  The issues we will debate these next 4 days are literally life-and-\ndeath issues.\n  The insurance industry has spent tens of millions of dollars to try \nto prevent us from ever having this debate. Many of our Republican \ncolleagues responded and worked with them. The Republicans seem to \nprotect insurance companies the way Briana Scurry protects a soccer \ngoal. The insurance industry has spent millions of dollars on ads \ndesigned to confuse and frighten the American people, and intimidate \nus. They hope that by repeating untruths often enough they will be able \nto kill this bill and keep their license to practice bad medicine.\n  The truth is, this whole debate comes down to one critically \nimportant question: Who should make medical decisions, doctors or \ninsurance company accountants?\n  We have all heard the horror stories.\n  In Georgia, a 6-month-old boy was burning up with a 105-degree fever. \nHis mother called her HMO twice and begged to be allowed to take her \nson to the emergency room. Both times the HMO refused. She finally \ndecided to take him to the hospital anyway. By the time they arrived, \nthe infection that was causing the fever had destroyed the circulation \nin the baby's extremities. Both his hands and feet had to be amputated.\n  In Washington, DC, a 12-year-old boy was diagnosed with a cancerous \ntumor in his leg. His oncologist recommended a treatment that could \nsave the leg. But when the doctor's office called the boy's HMO, they \nwere told the only treatment the HMO would pay for was amputation. Four \nmonths and several appeals later, the HMO finally agreed to pay for the \ntreatment the doctor ordered. But by then, the cancer had spread; the \nleg had to be amputated.\n  In Kentucky, a man with prostate cancer needed one chemotherapy \ninjection a month. The injections cost $500 each. His insurance company \npolicy said they were fully covered. But when the HMO changed \nadministrators, the man was told he would have to pay $180 a month out \nof his own pocket. He didn't have $180 a month, so he had to go with \nthe only other treatment his doctor said could control his cancer. He \nwas castrated. The day he returned from the hospital, he got a letter \nfrom his HMO saying they had made a mistake; the HMO would now pay the \n$500 after all.\n\n  Three different people, three different parts of the country, but \nthey all have one thing in common: They were all powerless against \ntheir insurance companies.\n  Unfortunately, I could go on and on.\n  Two years ago, 130 million Americans said they or someone they knew \nhad a problem with a health insurance company. Last year, that number \nhad grown to 154 million Americans.\n  When we first introduced our bill, nearly 2 years ago, a lot of our \nRepublican friends said we didn't need a Patients' Bill of Rights. \nToday, they have a bill of their own. We consider that progress. But we \nstill have big differences of opinion about what a Patients' Bill of \nRights should do.\n  Our bill covers 161 million Americans. Their bill covers 48 million \npeople; it leaves out more than 100 million Americans.\n  Our bill lets health care professionals make medical decisions about \nyour health. Their bill lets insurance company accountants make those \ndecisions.\n  Our bill guarantees you the right to see a qualified medical \nspecialist, including pediatric specialists for your children. The \nRepublican bill doesn't guarantee that either you or your children will \nbe able to see qualified medical specialists.\n  If your HMO refuses to pay for care your doctor says you need, our \nbill allows you to appeal that decision to an independent review board. \nTheir bill contains an appeal process, too--except they let the HMO \ndecide what decisions can be appealed. They also let HMOs handpick and \npay the people who hear the cases.\n  Finally, our Patients' Bill of Rights is enforceable. Theirs isn't.\n  CBO estimates that the most our Patients' Bill of Rights would \nincrease premiums is 4.8 percent over 5 years--less than 1 percent a \nyear. That comes out to less than $2 per beneficiary --less than $2 a \nmonth to guarantee that your health insurance will be there when you \nneed it.\n  Last month, when we offered our Patients' Bill of Rights, a \nRepublican colleagues voted to kill it, without discussing its specific \npieces. Yet, they claim they support nearly all the protections in our \nplan.\n  So this week, we intend to offer our plan again, piece by piece. \nLet's debate each of the protections in our plan. Maybe when our \ncolleagues really look at our proposals, they will decide they can \nsupport some of the protections in our bill. The American people \ndeserve to know exactly where each of us stands on each of these \nprotections.\n\n  Let me just say a word at this point about the kind of debate we \nexpect this week. By agreeing to this debate, we are assuming our \nRepublican colleagues intend to allow a real, honest debate. That means \ndebating and voting on each of the major protections in our Patients' \nBill of Rights. If we have that sort of debate, then, whether we win or \nlose, we will certainly agree not to bring the Patients' Bill of Rights \nup again this year. Up or down, win or lose, if the debate this week is \nfair and honest, we will not offer our Patients' Bill of Rights again \nthis year.\n  But, if we are not able to do that, if we don't have a real debate, \nif we are not permitted to offer our protections as amendments so that \nthe Senate can discuss and vote on each of them, if there are those who \ntry to prevent an honest debate by using parliamentary tricks, we are \nputting them on notice now: This debate will certainly not end on \nThursday. We will continue to offer the protections in our plan as \namendments for as long as we have to until we finally have that honest \ndebate.\n  We know from experience that we can pass bills that protect the \nhealth of American families when we want. Together, Republicans and \nDemocrats passed a bill allowing people to take their health care with \nthem when they change jobs. Together, we passed a bill to help working \nparents purchase private, affordable health insurance for their kids. \nTogether we can pass a real, meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights this \nweek.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1232\n\n (Purpose: To provide the text of Senate Bill 326 (106th Congress), as \nreported by the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of \n                 the Senate, as a complete substitute)\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Daschle) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1232.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me explain the amendment I have just \noffered. This amendment is the Republican HMO reform bill. We are \noffering it as a substitute to the Democratic bill for one reason.\n  Senator Lott has been very candid and open about his intentions. His \nintention, of course, is to offer at the end of this debate a \nRepublican bill that has not been debated or amended or scrutinized in \nany way.\n  By offering as our first amendment the Republican substitute, we now \nlay down a dual track for the week--their bill and our bill. Both bills \nare subject to amendments. Both are subject to consideration. Both are \nsubject to the debate that we had anticipated when we reached this \nagreement.\n  We will be offering amendments to the Republican bill. We would love \nnothing more than for our bill to pass without amendment. But \ncertainly, if that is not to be, we will at least do what we can to \nmake sure the Senate deals honestly with this issue.\n  By offering the Republican bill, we hope to make sure the Senate at \nleast has an honest debate, and we have the opportunity to try to make \nthe Republican bill what it should have been in\n\n[[Page S8213]]\n\nthe first place--a good bill that deals with each of the issues and \noffers real protections.\n  I retain the remainder of our time both under the amendment as well \nas the general debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me begin by explaining how we came to \nbe here. Then I want to take a little walk down memory lane, as Ronald \nReagan used to say, and talk about the real Democrat health care bill--\nthe bill offered in 1993. I then want to talk about the difference \nbetween the two bills--the Democratic Kennedy bill, and our bill--and \nwhy that difference is relevant to every working American family.\n  Then I would like to conclude by explaining why our bill is a good \nbill and why I am confident that if Senator Kennedy and I could go into \nevery house in America and sit down with people at their kitchen table, \nand if he could explain his bill and what he is trying to do, and if I \ncould explain our bill and what we are trying to do, I am confident \nthat 90 percent of the people in America would choose our bill.\n  We are going to have 4 days of debate. But the outcome of the debate, \nI think, is clear. We are going to win when the votes are cast, and we \nare going to win this debate because we have a better program. Our \nprogram benefits the people who do the work and pay the taxes and pull \nthe wagon in America.\n  I think when the week is over that we will have discredited the \napproach of this bill as we discredited the bill in 1993. But, of \ngreater importance, we will have passed a real bill that gives \nAmericans real freedoms.\n  Our colleagues have lamented that we have waited this long to deal \nwith this issue. I want to remind everyone that last year throughout \nthe year the majority leader offered to bring this bill up, and he \noffered to bring it up in two different forms.\n  I thought the most reasonable offer was to let the Democrats write \nthe best bill they could write that does the most that they can provide \nto help people with health insurance and to impose whatever \nrestrictions they want to write. Then let Republicans put together the \nbest bill they can put together, and bring the two bills to the floor \nof the Senate and let the Senate choose between one. We could then \nchoose one or the other. That was rejected by the minority.\n  We then offered them the ability to bring the two bills up and each \nside have five amendments. That was rejected by the minority.\n  Not to waste a lot of time to get into a debate with the minority \nleader, or with other Democrats, I simply submit that we have been 2 \nyears getting to this point because the Democrats have wanted it to be \n2 years getting to this point. We could have brought up bills and voted \nunder an orderly process 2 years ago. But, in reality, the Democrats \nthought they had a political issue. That is why we are only getting to \nthis bill now. I think we are going to prove this week they don't have \nmuch of a political issue, and I think when the debate is over they are \ngoing to be glad it is over. And I think the American people are going \nto be glad it is over.\n  Let me remind my colleagues, and anybody who is watching this debate \nin America, that this is not the first time Bill Clinton and Ted \nKennedy have wanted to rewrite the health care system of this country. \nI have here on this desk the Clinton health care bills, and the version \nof it that was sponsored by Senator Kennedy.\n  Let me remind those who followed that debate in 1993--their memories \nmight have gotten a little clouded--what this bill did. This bill said \nthat the problem in America was that we had 43 million Americans who \ndidn't have health insurance, and that in trying to deal with health \ninsurance and make it available, we needed to get rid of the current \nhealth care system, and we needed to set up on a regional basis in \nAmerica health care collectives that people would be forced to join. \nAnd these collectives would be run by the Government. The whole idea \nbehind the Kennedy bill in 1993 was give up freedom to control cost.\n  Obviously, I wouldn't have enough time in the day or the week to go \nthrough all of these provisions. But let me just remind you of a couple \nof them.\n  In 1993, Senator Kennedy, Senator Daschle, and President Clinton \nsaid: We are going to have the Government take over the health care \nsystem in your hometown--in Phoenix, AZ. There would be one health care \ncollective run by the Government, and if you refused to join that \ncollective, you would be fined $5,000.\n  That is what they wanted in 1993. That was their concept of freedom \nwhen they last asked us to let them run the health care system in \nAmerica.\n  Then they said, if this plan did not provide the kind of health care \nyou needed and you sought to get that health care through your \nphysician and the health care was not allowed under this plan, the \nphysician could be fined $50,000.\n  If you needed health care for your child, their concept of freedom, \nin 1993, in the Clinton-Kennedy health care bill, was: We know what \nkind of health care you need. They said: We are going to provide it in \nthis bill, and, if you want health care outside this bill and a \nphysician provides it for you, we are going to fine them $50,000.\n  That was their concept of freedom in 1993. In 1993 they said, What \nabout the circumstance where your baby is really sick? So you go to a \ndoctor and say, I need health care, and they, under the Clinton-Kennedy \nplan, say, We are not allowed to provide this kind of treatment. You \nsay, forget about the plan, I'll pay for it out of my own pocket. In \n1993, Senator Kennedy and Senator Daschle and President Clinton thought \nso much of freedom that they said, If you pay the doctor out of your \npocket for a treatment that we do not provide for, and the doctor takes \nthe money, he can be sent to prison for 15 years. That was their \nconcept of patients' rights in 1993. That is what they thought freedom \nconsisted of in 1993.\n\n  I submit, this is what they still want. The bill that is before us, \ntheir bill, is step 1 toward government running the health care system, \nso when my mama needs to go see a doctor, she first has to talk to a \ngovernment bureaucrat. We defeated that in 1993, and we are going to \ndefeat it this week in the Senate.\n  What is the plan today? Unlike 1993, when our colleagues were very \nconcerned about the cost of health care, now they are not concerned \nabout health care cost, they are concerned about rights. So all of a \nsudden they have put together a bill that imposes a whole lot of \ngovernment restrictions, that expands liability, so 60 percent of the \npremiums that go to provide insurance against medical liability will \nend up going to lawyers instead of to doctors and hospitals and \nclinics.\n  They have put together a bill that the Congressional Budget Office \nhas said, when you take into account all the bureaucracy and all the \nlegal liability, will drive up the cost of health care by 6.1 percent. \nThat is equivalent to taking 6.1 percent right out of the paycheck of \nworking Americans in order for them to be able to keep their insurance. \nOnly a lot of Americans will not be able to keep their insurance. In \nfact, a study funded by the AFL-CIO has concluded, if you take the \nincrease in health care costs under the Kennedy plan, 1.8 million \nAmericans will lose their health insurance.\n  Mr. President, 1.8 million Americans will lose their health insurance \nif we should adopt the bill that the Democrats have proposed. For those \nwho are lucky enough not to be one of the 1.8 million people who would \nlose their health insurance, they would pay $72.7 billion over a 5-year \nperiod more for health insurance and health costs than they are paying \nnow.\n  This is not just about dollars, this is about real people and real \nhealth care. By 1.8 million people losing their health insurance, that \nmeans you would have 188,595 fewer breast examinations every year for \nAmericans, because the Kennedy bill would take away their health \ninsurance. It means 52,973 American women would not have mammograms who \nwould have them under current law, because the increase in cost under \nthis bill would take away their health insurance. It means that 135,122 \nPap tests would not be undertaken, because people would have lost their \nhealth insurance and therefore lost access to that coverage. Mr. \nPresident, 23,135 American men, mostly elderly men, would lose their \nprostate\n\n[[Page S8214]]\n\nscreening exam as a result of the health care cost increase that would \nbe dictated by the Kennedy plan.\n  So what do they offer us in the name of health care rights? They \noffer us a bill that would drive up health insurance costs by 6.1 \npercent, costing 1.8 million Americans their health insurance, and for \nthose who are lucky enough to be able to afford to keep their health \ninsurance, they would pay $72.7 billion more for their health insurance \nover a 5-year period.\n  In return for all of these costs, what do people get? Rather than \ngoing into the details, I am going to reduce it down to a very simple \nexample. I want to define the problem Senator Kennedy sees--and we \nagree on the problem. Then I am going to explain what he provides in \nthe name of rights that drives up costs by 6.1 percent, costs 1.8 \nmillion people their health insurance, and those who keep their health \ninsurance pay $72.7 billion more for it.\n  Here is the problem. The innovation--which, by the way, has been \nchampioned by the people who are offering this amendment--is HMOs. They \nthought so much of them they wanted to force everybody in America into \na government-run HMO. But, under HMO, there is a problem. The problem \nis that people lose the control they want and need over their health \ncare. Let me reduce it down to a simple example.\n  When people with an HMO go into the examining room, too often, in \naddition to their doctor in the examining room, they have, either \nliterally or figuratively, the HMO gatekeeper in the examining room. So \nthey are going into the examining room--obviously, that often entails \ntaking your clothes off. People are often a little nervous about that. \nThey want privacy. They like to be in the examining room with their \ndoctor, but with an HMO they find themselves with this gatekeeper \nvirtually looking over the doctor's shoulder. They would like to be in \nthe examining room alone with the doctor. We agree. We think they \nshould have the right to make that choice.\n  But how does Senator Kennedy fix the problem? How Senator Kennedy \nfixes the problem--and you will be able to tell why it is so expensive \nwhen you look at it--the way Senator Kennedy fixes the problem is \ndemonstrated by this stethoscope. What people want is the doctor in the \nexamining room with the stethoscope up against their heart, but right \nnow they have an HMO listening in, double-checking their doctor. They \nwould like to get this HMO gatekeeper out of the examining room. So \nwhat does Senator Kennedy do? He says: We can fix your problem. It will \ncost 1.8 million of you your health insurance; those who keep the \nhealth insurance, it will cost $72.7 billion more. But look at what you \nget.\n  What you get under Senator Kennedy's plan is this. He doesn't get rid \nof the HMO, that guy is still there listening in, but he brings a \ngovernment bureaucrat into the examining room who will be there to keep \nan eye on the HMO, and to keep an eye on the doctor, and to regulate. \nThen, in addition to the bureaucrat, he brings the lawyer into the \nexamining room who will be there keeping an eye on the bureaucrat and \nHMO and the doctor, so that he can be there to sue the doctor or the \nHMO.\n  The reason Senator Kennedy's plan drives up health care costs by 6.1 \npercent and costs 1.8 million Americans their health insurance and \ndrives up the cost for those who can afford to keep it by $72.7 billion \nis it costs a lot of money to bring all these bureaucrats and all these \nlawyers into the process.\n  But the point is, what people are unhappy about is the HMO \ngatekeepers being in the examining room. They wanted to get them out of \nthe examining room. They do not want to bring the bureaucrats in and \nbring lawyers in. What they want is a health care system that looks \nlike this: They want a health care system where you have two people in \nthe examining room and one of them is you. You are on this end of the \nstethoscope, and your doctor is on the other end of the stethoscope, \nand there is nobody else in the room. That is what they want.\n  The difference between the Kennedy bill and our bill is, under his \nbill, he brings in the bureaucrat and the lawyer. So now you have four \npeople in the examining room. What we do is we get rid of the HMO \ngatekeeper and give people real freedom.\n  This is such a critically important point. Our Democrat colleagues \nhave gotten caught up in this deal about how they are going to give \npeople rights. I think it is wonderful that it is so easy for somebody \nto see what they mean by ``rights'' and what we mean by ``freedom'' are \ntwo totally different things.\n  Under the Democrat bill, you are not free to fire the HMO your boss \npicks for you, but you are free to have the Government regulate it.\n  Under the Kennedy plan, you are not free to fire your doctor, but you \ncan sue him.\n  Under the Kennedy plan, you are not free to control your health care \ncost, but you can share that control with a lawyer and with the \nGovernment.\n  What we do is give people freedom. It is an interesting paradox that \nthe Kennedy bill debases the very term ``choice.'' It debases the very \nterm of ``rights'' because it contains no rights; that is, no rights \nthat are really meaningful to somebody who has a child who is sick or \nwhose mama is ill.\n  We give people real rights. We give people the right to fire their \nHMO by guaranteeing them an alternative, which I will talk about in a \nminute.\n  We give people the right to fire their doctor.\n  We give people the right to take their health care money and spend it \nas they choose on their own family.\n  We give people the right to pick the protections they believe are \nimportant to their family, not those basic benefits the Government \nmight decide in Washington would be useful.\n  And finally, we give people the right to control their own health \ncare, something the Democrats do not do.\n  The Democrat plan means more Government, more lawyers, more rules, \nmore uninsured and more Government control, but the one thing it does \nnot mean, the one thing it does not provide is more freedom. Our bill \nprovides more freedom. Let me explain two ways it does.\n  First of all, under the current tax system, we have a terrible \ninequity. If General Motors buys your health insurance for you as their \nemployee, it is tax deductible. But if you buy it for yourself as \neither a small businessperson who does not have health insurance or a \nself-employed who does not have health insurance or somebody who works \nfor a company that does not provide health insurance, or if you would \nrather buy your own health insurance rather than General Motors \nchoosing for you, it is not fully tax deductible. The first thing our \nbill does is it treats you as well as current tax law treats General \nMotors. Under our bill, if you buy your own health insurance--let's say \nyou are self-employed. You will get the right to the same tax treatment \nthat General Motors does, so your health insurance is tax free.\n  The second and most important choice we give to people is a totally \nnew program, a new choice. We do not force anybody to take it, but we \ngive people the ability to buy, in addition to all the choices we \nprovide with everything from an HMO to private practice of medicine \nthrough a medical savings account, we expand people's freedom. One of \nthe choices we provide, which I am very excited about, is the right to \nbuy a medical savings account. Here is how it would work.\n  A medical savings account is a device that really is aimed at helping \npeople who want health care coverage but who often do not have a lot of \nmoney. The way it would work is, in addition to joining the health plan \nyour company might try to impose on you, you have the right to take \nyour money and buy a high-deductible insurance policy and then join \nwith your company in setting aside money to pay the deductibles in what \nwe call the medical savings account. Those medical savings accounts are \nfully tax free, just like conventional health insurance. Here is \nbasically how it would work.\n\n  You might buy a health insurance policy with a $3,000 deductible. \nNormally, that policy would cost less than half as much as a first-\ndollar-coverage policy. Then you and your employer would begin to build \nup a savings account up to $3,000, which would belong to you, to cover \nthe deductible.\n  Then how it works is you make the decision, when your child needs to \nsee a doctor, which doctor your child needs to see. You are empowered \nto make the decision.\n\n[[Page S8215]]\n\n  It is true that under the Kennedy plan, if your baby has a 104-degree \nfever, you could get out the phonebook and you could look under the \nblue pages for the U.S. Government and you could find the Health Care \nFinancing Administration, or HCFA as they are called, and at 2 o'clock \nin the morning you could call up HCFA. You would, in all probability, \nget an answering machine if you were lucky. Maybe you would not. I do \nnot think you are going to find the Director of HCFA at work at 2 \no'clock in the morning. You can call up and leave a message, and then \nthey, under the Kennedy plan, will set up a meeting. Maybe next Tuesday \nat 4:52 in the afternoon they might meet with you or talk to you on the \nphone.\n  You also could call up a lawyer. You could look under ``attorney'' in \nthe phone page and you can pick--one thing about Senator Kennedy's \nhealth care rights bill is it gives you no freedom with regard to \ndoctors, but it gives you complete freedom with regard to attorneys.\n  Senator Kennedy's bill is unlike the bill he put together in 1993 \nwith President Clinton. Remember, their health care bill in 1993 did \nnot let you sue. They have had a change in heart, it seems, so now he \nsays you can pick up the Yellow Pages and you can look under \n``attorney'' and you can pick any attorney. You have your car wrecks. \nMaybe you want another attorney. This one deals with car wrecks. You \nhave injury. You have family law, criminal law, jail release, traffic \ntickets, bankruptcy, will and trust, personal injury, board-certified \npersonal attorney. Anyway, you find the one who suits you. You hire \nthat attorney, and you go to court. Eighteen months from now, you might \nbe able to collect some money from some doctor or from some HMO.\n  Our bill does not work that way. Under our bill, if your baby has a \ntemperature, you pick up the Yellow Pages. I have the Yellow Pages from \nArlington and Mansfield, TX. This Yellow Pages lists all the physicians \nwho practice medicine in that area.\n  Under our plan, you pick up the phone and you call up the physician \nyou might pick. Let's say I pick Louis W. Adams, pediatric \nophthalmologist, and I call him up. Under the Kennedy bill, I would \nhave to ask him some questions. I would have to say: Are you a \npreferred provider? In fact, we did an experiment on that in \nWashington, DC. Let me show it to you.\n  In Washington, DC, we took a page out of the phonebook. It was page \n1017. These are the physicians who were listed. The first one is \nGinsberg, Susan M., M.D., and the last one is Robert O. Gordon.\n  Let's say you are in an HMO or you are in a PPO, and you call up--\nlet's say you pick Philip W. Gold. You call him up and say: Dr. Gold, I \nneed health care. I have a child who has a 103-degree temperature. Are \nyou in the Kaiser HMO, or are you part of the Blue Cross PPO?\n\n  We found that out of the 28 doctors, 10 accepted the Kaiser HMO, 17 \naccepted the Blue Cross PPO. But let me tell you the amazing revelation \nwe made. With a medical savings account, which any American could set \nup, under the Republican plan, you would get a checking account. This \nis from Golden Rule Insurance Company in Indiana. This is a medical \nsavings account checking account. Then this is for a medical savings \naccount that is operated by Mellon Bank, and this is a MasterCard. Then \nthis is an American Health Value medical savings account, and this is \noperated through Visa.\n  Under the Republican plan, you would have the right to opt for a \nmedical savings account where you would make the decision about health \ncare for your family. We empower you--not some lawyer, not some \nbureaucrat--but we empower you as a parent.\n  So then we called up everybody on page 1017 of the Yellow Pages and \nwe asked them three questions:\n  Do you take a check?\n  Yes. Every one of them took a check.\n  Do you take Visa?\n  Every one of them took Visa.\n  Do you take MasterCard?\n  Every one of them, all 28 of them, took MasterCard.\n  So the real freedom in the Republican bill is the right for you to \nchoose--not to choose a lawyer to sue somebody 18 months from now, not \nto call up a government bureaucrat and fill out a form and register a \nprotest. What kind of freedom is that? The freedom we give is the \nfreedom to act, the freedom to hire, the freedom to fire, the freedom \nto say yes, the freedom to say no. That is what freedom is about.\n  Our Democrat colleagues believe freedom is about being able to talk \nto a bureaucrat. They think freedom is about the right to sue.\n  Under the Republican plan, freedom is the right to say to your HMO: \nYou're fired. I don't like the way I'm being treated here. I'm leaving \nyour HMO. I'm opting for another option. The example I gave is a \nmedical savings account.\n  Freedom, under the Republican plan, is the freedom to pick up the \nphonebook and let your fingers do the walking. You pick the doctor: I \nwant John V. Golding, Jr. I don't want anybody else. He is the doctor I \nwant. I got his telephone number. I called him up and said: My mama is \nsick, Dr. Golding, and I would like her to come see you. Do you take a \ncheck or MasterCard or Visa? He says: Yes. I am in.\n  As this debate goes on, you are going to hear Senator Kennedy, and \nothers, say: The world will come to an end if you have medical savings \naccounts. They are going to use the interesting charge they use any \ntime they are against something, and that is it is for rich people. If \nDemocrats are not for something, they claim it is for rich people. Tax \ncuts are for rich people. Choice, freedom, is for rich people. They are \ngoing to say: Oh, the medical savings accounts, rich people will get \nmedical savings accounts and poor people will not have them; it will \njust be terrible.\n  The facts are that even though we have a limited number of medical \nsavings accounts that can be sold, even though in the year 2000 they \nlose this option and have to go back into the old system unless we \nchange the law, the people who are buying medical savings accounts are \nprimarily modest-income people. But we are going to repeal those \nlimitations and we are going to do it this week. Uninsured people are \nbuying medical savings accounts because it allows them to buy an \naffordable high-deductible policy that covers them against terrible \nthings happening and then lets them build up savings accounts with \ntheir employer to pay the deductible.\n  So those who are going to criticize medical savings accounts are \ngoing to say it is for rich people, but they really do not like it \nbecause it is freedom. What they want is this. They want the old \nClinton health care bill. They know that if we ever give people the \nright to choose, they will never nationalize health care. So medical \nsavings accounts are, to our dear colleague from Massachusetts, like a \ncrucifix is to a vampire. They cower, they are struck with fear at the \nidea that some parent would actually have the ability to fire an HMO \nand do it without having to call a bureaucrat or without having to hire \na lawyer.\n\n  Why do they fear freedom? Because they are not for it. They want the \nGovernment to take over and run the health care system--always have, \nalways will.\n  The basic question is, Who should manage care? Should it be an \ninsurance company? Should it be the Government? Or should it be you? We \nbelieve it ought to be you. We believe that parents ought to be \nempowered to control health care. We believe that parents can make \nbetter decisions.\n  That is what this debate is about. This debate is about whether \nfreedom means getting access to a bureaucrat or firing your HMO, \nwhether freedom in health care means hiring a lawyer or being able to \nhire your own doctor. That is what the debate is about.\n  A final point I would like to make--and I think it is a significant \npoint; some people would say it is a reach, but I do not think so--why, \nall of a sudden, are our same colleagues who in 1993 wanted the \nGovernment to take over and run the health care system and make \neverybody be in one big Government-run HMO--why, all of a sudden, do \nthey want to drive up costs in the name of expanding bureaucracy and \nlawsuits?\n  Part of it is, they like bureaucracy and they like lawsuits. But that \nis not, in my opinion, the real story. The real story is, if, God \nforbid--and He is going to forbid, because we clearly have the votes to \nstop him but if, God forbid,\n\n[[Page S8216]]\n\nthe Kennedy plan should be adopted, and health insurance went up by 6.1 \npercent and 1.8 million people lost their health insurance, does \nanybody doubt that next year Senator Kennedy would be back with the \nClinton health care bill saying: Now 1.8 million people have lost their \nhealth insurance, and we have no choice except to let the Government \ntake over the health care system? I think that is what he would say. In \nfact, I think that is basically what we are debating here: Destroy the \nprivate health care system so the only alternative would be Government.\n  Our answer is: Let's make the current health care system better; \nlet's have a meaningful, timely internal and external appeal if you \nwant to stay in an HMO; let's empower people to fire HMOs and go to the \nprivate practice of medicine again if they choose; let's expand freedom \nas a solution to making our current system work better to make it more \nefficient and to empower families to make more choices.\n  The alternative the Democrats have is: Destroy the current system and \nthen let's let Government take over and run the health care system.\n  Our answer is: Expand freedom and choice within the current system, \nempower families to decide, and let's forever and ever keep Government \nout of health care.\n  That is really the choice. Our Democrat colleagues believe that \nsomehow they are going to benefit by Americans knowing they are unhappy \nabout HMOs and they want to expand your access to bureaucrats and \nlawyers. We do not think that solves the problem. We think what solves \nthe problem is to make HMOs give you an effective internal and external \nappeal; but we go one step further, and that is, we empower people to \nfire the HMO and to hire their own doctor.\n  We believe in freedom. We believe freedom works. It built America in \nevery other era. Can you imagine if we had a Clinton-Kennedy car \ninsurance bill or car repair bill so that if you are unhappy with your \nassigned repairman to fix your car, and if you are unhappy with what he \ndoes, you contact a bureaucrat and then, if you are unhappy with what \nhe does, you contact a lawyer? I submit that the cost of repairing our \ncars would be astronomical.\n  We have a different system. It is one we would like in health care. \nThat is, you pick where you go to get your car repaired, and if you do \nnot like the work they are doing, you say to them, in a traditional \nAmerican fashion: You are not doing a good job. You have not lived up \nto our trust. You have not done what you said you would do. And you're \nfired.\n  That is freedom. That is freedom. That is what we want. We want the \nright of people to choose. We don't want this substitute for the right \nto choose, the right to pile up costs in lawsuits or the right to deal \nwith bureaucrats. What kind of right is that? How many wrongs do \nbureaucrats right? About one-tenth as many as they create.\n\n  We give you freedom. The Democrats give you bureaucracy. We help \nlower the cost of health care by expanding choices and expanding tax \ndeductibility. They drive up the cost of health care by 6.1 percent. \nTheir bill would deny health insurance to 1.8 million Americans. Their \nbill would drive up health care costs by $72.7 billion. Senator Kennedy \nlikes to claim, well, it is just a hamburger a day for however long. \nWell, with $72.7 billion, you could buy every McDonald's franchise in \nAmerica for the 5-year cost that this will drive up health insurance.\n  Senator Kennedy doesn't understand that if the company you are \nworking for is paying your health insurance and the cost is driven up, \nyou are still paying it. It is part of your wages. What is going to \nhappen, according to estimates that were undertaken by the AFL-CIO--in \nsupport of this bill, by the way--is that 1.8 million people will lose \ntheir health insurance. We don't want that to happen, and we are going \nto stop it from happening.\n  This is going to be a very meaningful debate. I look forward to it. I \nthink people will learn from it. I think in the end they are going to \nhave two different choices about what freedom is.\n  If freedom to you is access to a bureaucrat and a lawyer, then you \nare with Senator Kennedy. If freedom to you is the right to choose your \nown health care, your own doctor, the right to hire and the right to \nfire, the right to say what you want and people either do it or you get \nsomebody else, if that is what freedom means in your hometown, if you \nwould rather be able to pick up the Arlington-Mansfield phonebook when \nyour baby is sick and look up ``physician'' rather than look up \n``attorney'' or, rather than look in the Blue Pages for HCFA, if that \nis what you would like to have, you are with us. On the other hand, if \nyou think your answer is at HCFA in the Blue Pages or with an attorney, \nthen you want to be with Senator Kennedy. It is about as clear a choice \nas you could possibly have.\n  When the debate is over this week, not only will we have won the \nvote, but I think, more importantly, we will have won the debate. We \nwill have ended, hopefully forever, any dream of ever getting back to \nthe Clinton health care bill, where every American is forced into a \nhealth care collective and, when your momma gets sick, she talks to a \nbureaucrat instead of a doctor. They tried that in 1993. Eighty-two \npercent of the American people thought this might be a good idea. \nFinally, when a few of us stood up and fought it, it was like sticking \na great big inflated balloon with a pin. Suddenly, once people \nunderstood it, they were against it. They understood that what was at \nstake wasn't just health care, but what was at stake was freedom.\n  That is what this is about--the right to choose. Don't get confused \nabout it, as we go through the debate.\n  I thank the Chair for its indulgence. I yield the floor and reserve \nthe remainder of our time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am very hopeful we will be able to get \ninto the substance of the differences between the approaches taken in \nthe two bills. We heard a great deal of rhetoric, of course, earlier in \nthe afternoon. We have had a brief presentation by the Democratic \nleader, Senator Daschle.\n  At the outset, one point worth highlighting, as we begin this debate, \nis that there isn't a single health or medical organization in the \nUnited States that supports the position being advanced by that side of \nthe aisle--not one.\n  This really isn't or shouldn't be a Democratic or Republican debate. \nRepublicans are members of HMOs as well as Democrats. Children are \nRepublicans as well as Democrats. Women who need clinical trials are \nRepublicans and Democrats. Those who have been in the vanguard of \nprotecting women's health issues have been Republicans as well as \nDemocrats. On children's issues, disabled issues, there have been \nRepublicans as well as Democrats.\n\n  I cannot remember a single piece of legislation that has been \nconsidered on the floor of the Senate in the time that I have been here \nwhere you have such overwhelming support for one side and virtually no \nsupport for the opposition side--in this case, the Republicans--not a \nsingle instance. I made that statement during one of the brief times we \nhad a chance to talk about the Patients' Bill of Rights debate and \ndiscussion. It has never been rebutted.\n  We heard earlier, in the course of the afternoon, about how the \nRepublican proposal is really going to provide for necessary specialty \ncare. Why is it then that every specialty organization in the country \nsupports our bill? We heard over on the other side: Look, we are really \ngiving the consumers a great deal of protection in our bill. Why is it \nthat every consumer organization in the country supports our bill and \nopposes theirs? Every one, make no mistake about it.\n  We are in a situation where, as so many of us have seen, special \ninterest groups can pay for and buy just about any statistic they want \nto buy, and they have done so. They have put out misrepresentations and \ndistortions about our bill. These misrepresentations and distortions \nabout cost are all over the airwaves. We will have a chance later in \nthe course of this debate to address the issue of costs. We will have a \nchance to make a presentation about what independent studies have \nconcluded about the cost of our particular proposal. Despite the fact \nthat we will introduce and present\n\n[[Page S8217]]\n\nthese independent studies, do you think that will than alter and change \npeople's minds? Absolutely not. You are going to hear distortions and \nmisrepresentations. You have already heard them over the course of this \nafternoon.\n  I was sitting here when our good friend from the State of Maine was \nspeaking about the importance of the types of protections included in \ntheir Patients' Bill of Rights. The interesting fact is, their proposal \ndoesn't cover any members of HMOs. Isn't that amazing? Listen to this: \nIt doesn't cover any of the patients of HMOs. That is what brought \nabout all of this concern. We can ask ourselves: Is there a concern \ntoday? The answer is yes, and not just because we say so.\n  I heard talk about the importance of the State insurance \ncommissioners. I ask our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to \ncall their State commissioners and hear about the complaints that we \nare hearing. Call them this afternoon; call them tomorrow. Call them \nbefore we finish this debate and find out: There are two and three and \nfour times more complaints today than there were a year ago or 2 years \nago. Those are the facts. You would not know these facts from the \nearlier debate.\n  This is a very interesting chart. We know there are 160 million \nAmericans who are covered by private health insurance. On this \nparticular chart, the ``Republican Plan Excludes More Than 100 Million \nPeople,'' there are 48 million people covered through self-funded \nemployer plans. That is the total group that is covered by the \nRepublican plan.\n  There are 75 million people whose employers provide coverage through \ninsurance policies or an HMO--that is what I thought this debate was \nreally all about. They are not protected in the Republican plan. We \nlistened this afternoon to assertions about all the protections \nincluded in the Republican plan. But these 75 million people are not \nprotected under the Republican plan. They are not phased in next year \nor in 2 years. They are out; the Republican bill doesn't apply to them.\n  State and local government workers, they are left out of the \nRepublican bill. People buying individual policies, some 15 million, \nare left out. Who are they, Mr. President? They are the small \nshopkeepers.\n  They are the farmers and the mom-and-pop stores that have to go out \nand buy these health plans. They are the one of the most vulnerable \ngroups in our society.\n  Do you know what was missing in the other side's presentation? The \nfact that the top 10 HMOs in this country, last year, made $1.5 \nbillion. Isn't that interesting? We see crocodile tears coming from the \nother side of the aisle about the cost of protecting patients. Then we \nfind out the profits of the major HMOs and the multimillion dollar \nsalaries paid to their CEOs. We hear about the $100 million being spent \nby the insurance companies to defeat our proposal.\n  How much is that going to add? Why don't you address that, I say to \nour friends on the other side. Over $100 million. You know, generally \naround here--and the American people understand it--you can look at who \nis for a piece of legislation and who is against it in terms of who \nwill benefit and who will lose out. It is not a bad way of looking at \nit. Sometimes issues are so complex that the balance is not completely \nclear. But on this issue, all the health care groups that favor \nadequate protections are in favor of our Patients' Bill of Rights. On \nthe other side is the insurance industry--one industry, the insurance \nindustry. That is it.\n  Can we have some explanation by the other side, as we start this \ndebate, about how they justify that? That is the bottom line. It is one \nindustry. The Republican program is the profit protection program for \nthe insurance industry. It is a bill of goods. It is a bill of wrongs. \nThe Democratic proposal is the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  So as we start off on this issue, it is our hope, as we have \nmentioned before, to review for this body and the American people \nexactly what we intend to do. We have commonsense protections which \nhave been developed over the last decade. What we want to ensure is \nthat any bill passed will at least provide these commonsense \nprotections. Perhaps legislation isn't going to be so all-inclusive as \nto include every commonsense protection. I hope it will.\n  These are commonsense protections. You can ask where they all come \nfrom? Where did these patient protections that are included in the \nDaschle proposal come from? That is a fair question. We say they come \nfrom at least one of four different evolutions. You have the insurance \ncommissioner's recommendations; Insurance commissioners, representing \nRepublicans and Democrats, making recommendations. The President's \nbipartisan commission made what they call, not majority recommendations \nbut unanimous recommendations. Do we understand that? Unanimously, \nRepublicans and Democrats have said: Here are five or six protections \nwe recommend, and we have included those recommendations.\n  The only difference is that the bipartisan commission recommended \nthat the protections be voluntary. Well, if every one of the companies \ncomplied with that recommendation, we would probably not be here today. \nThey have not complied, and they will not comply. We also include \nprotections included in Medicare and Medicaid, and protections \nrecommendations by the health plans themselves. Those four groups have \nmade the recommendations that are included in our proposal. That is why \nour bill has the unanimous support of the health professions.\n  I will not take further time this afternoon. But I will point out, as \nwe start this debate, that no health care debate this year is more \nimportant to every family. Yes, Medicare is enormously important. Yes, \nthe issue of medical records privacy is important. Yes, home health \ncare for our elderly is enormously important. There are other important \nissues concerning basic medical research.\n  But the issue of health care quality is most important. The issue of \nwhether your child, your wife, your loved one, your family member, \nreceives the kind of health care that well-trained, committed medical \nprofessionals, doctors and nurses, who are trained and dedicated to try \nto provide the best in health care, want to provide, is most important.\n  This legislation belongs to the nurses of this country, the doctors \nof this Nation, the cancer researchers, the children's advocates, and \nto the disabled organizations. Every one of those organizations \nsupports our bill. Over the course of this week we will have an \nopportunity to address each and every one of these items. Hopefully, \nthe American people will speak through their representatives and the \nresult will be sound patients' protection legislation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be very brief because we are \nanxious to get on with this debate. I want to add to the words of \nSenator Kennedy.\n  This debate is a very personal debate for many of us, for both \nDemocrats and Republicans. It is really heartbreaking to sit down with \na family and talk to a father whose son was denied experimental \ntreatment for cancer and wonders whether or not his son might have \nlived if he had been able to obtain that treatment. It is really \ndisheartening to meet with a railroad worker whose wife talks to you \nabout her husband and how he is fighting cancer but how every day she \nis on the phone battling these insurance companies to find out whether \nor not they will provide coverage for the treatment.\n  That is what this debate is really all about. I think that, by the \nend of the week, it is going to be really clear what the differences \nare between the two proposals. This Republican bill that is on the \nfloor--the Daschle amendment--altogether covers 48 million people. But \nfor those citizens who aren't working for a Fortune 500 company, who \nare small businesspeople, family farmers, and others, there is no \npatient protection. That is a huge difference. There is a huge \ndifference between the 2 proposals of 115 million Americans. The \nRepublican plan doesn't cover the 115 million Americans that the \nDemocratic plan does. Quite often, I don't talk in terms of Democrat or \nRepublican, but here it makes a difference.\n  Second of all, people are so desperate to make sure that if their \nchild needs to see a pediatric oncologist, or a parent with Parkinson's \nneeds to see a\n\n[[Page S8218]]\n\nneurologist, they will have access to that specialty care. The \nRepublican plan does not guarantee that that will be the case. The \nDemocratic plan makes it crystal clear to these managed care plans: \nMake sure you have those specialists available for people, and make \nsure that if it is not in your network, they will have access to \nwhoever can provide the best care for their child or their parent.\n  Third is the question of consumer choice and continuity of care.\n  This Republican bill on the floor of the Senate, does not guarantee \nthe continuity of care and doesn't give you the right, really even if \nyou have to pay a little bit more in premium, to go outside the network \nof the managed care plan and take your child or your parents to the \nbest expert or make sure your family members see the best specialist. \nThis is called the point-of-service option.\n  I will have an amendment that deals with that.\n  Fourth, I heard my colleague from Maine speak about the appeals \nprocess. But, in all due respect, if people are not able to go to an \nindependent, external appeal from these managed care plans dominated by \nthese insurance companies and make sure that those independent panels \nare not picked by the companies, I don't call that independence.\n  The Republican plan has the external appeals process controlled and \ndominated by the very companies that you have a grievance against.\n  The Democratic plan provides for an independent appeals process \nbacked by an ombudsman program that can help families.\n  I will conclude because there are other Senators who want to speak.\n  I think that this debate is all about representative democracy.\n  I think this debate goes far beyond the issues at hand, although I \nagree with my colleague from Massachusetts; I think this is the most \nimportant debate of our session.\n  This debate is all about whether or not the Senate belongs to the \ninsurance companies of America or belongs to the people of Minnesota or \nNevada or Massachusetts or North Dakota--the people around the country. \nThat is what this debate is all about.\n  I look forward to debating into these specific amendments. I hope \nthat people in the country will be engaged.\n  I say to all of my colleagues that I believe people will hold us \naccountable.\n  This is an opportunity to do well for people. This is an opportunity \nto provide families with some protection. This is an opportunity to be \nwilling to stand up against some powerful economic interests--the \ninsurance companies of America that dominate so many of these managed \ncare plans--and be advocates for the people we represent back in our \nStates.\n  Republicans, no matter what you call your plan--no matter what the \nacronym is--it is swiss cheese. You have too many loopholes in this \nplan. You don't provide protection for consumers. The people in \nMinnesota are not going to be in favor of an insurance company \nprotection plan. They want it to be a Minnesota family protection plan.\n  That is what I am going to fight for all week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota on the substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are finally going to have a debate on \nthe issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights. It will not be a debate \nabout theory. It will not be a debate about past proposals for health \ncare reform. It will be a debate about real protections for real people \nin this country.\n  We have two plans before us.\n  One is a patients' protection act that we have offered that has the \nsupport of virtually every health care organization in this country.\n  The other is a piece of paper with a name--just a name, just an empty \nvessel--that pretends that it provides protection but in fact it \ndoesn't.\n  Let me describe, if I might, some of the details of these plans. I \nwant to be very brief, but I want to do it by talking about protections \nfor people.\n  This young boy's name is Ethan. Ethan was born in 1992 after a \ndifficult birth. During his delivery, oxygen was cut off from Ethan, so \nhe was born with significant problems that required special therapy. \nBut the HMO denied the special therapy for Ethan because they said the \nprobability of him being able to walk by age 5--a 50-percent potential \nof being able to walk by age 5--was insignificant. They called a 50-\npercent chance of being able to walk insignificant.\n  So corporate profits take precedence over patients' protection, and \nEthan does not get the therapy he needs.\n  Or let me show you another example. Dr. Ganske, a Republican in the \nU.S. House, used this chart to show a young child with a serious facial \nbirth defect, a cleft lip. No one looking into the face of that young \nchild could say that correcting this birth defect should not be done.\n  Yet Dr. Ganske did a survey of reconstructive surgeons and found that \n50 percent of the doctors who had patients like this have had the \ncorrective surgery denied by HMOs. These HMOs said this procedure was \nnot ``medically necessary.''\n  Would any parent in the world believe that this is not ``medically \nnecessary''?\n  Dr. Ganske, a Republican Congressman from the U.S. House, certainly \ndoesn't believe that. He has been a champion for this kind of patients' \nprotection act.\n  Here is an example of what a young child with that deformity can look \nlike after reconstructive surgery.\n  Isn't that wonderful? Is that a ``medical necessity''? You bet it is. \nOf course, it is. But health insurance only works if patients get what \nthey pay for.\n  Dr. Ganske sent something around the other day that I pulled out in \npreparation for this debate. I want to describe this just briefly \nbecause I think it illustrates the difference between an empty vessel \nwith the same title and a patients' protection bill that gives real \nprotection to real people.\n\n       At 3:30 in the morning, Lamona Adams found her six-month \n     infant boy, Jimmy, panting, sweaty, and moaning. He had a \n     temperature of 104. So she phoned her HMO to ask for \n     permission to go to the emergency room.\n\n  You have to do that, by the way--get permission to go.\n\n       The voice at the other end of the 1-800 number told her to \n     go to Scottish Rite Hospital. ``Where is it?'' asked Lamona. \n     ``I don't know--find a map,'' came the reply. It turns out \n     that the Adams family lived south of Atlanta, Georgia, and \n     Scottish Rite was an hour away on the other side of the \n     Atlanta metro area.\n       Lamona held little Jimmy while his dad drove as fast as he \n     could. Twenty miles into the trip while driving through \n     Atlanta, they passed Emory University Hospital's ER, then \n     Georgia Baptist's ER, then Grady Memorial's ER. But they \n     pushed on to Scottish Rite Medical Center--still 22 miles \n     away, because they knew that if they stopped at an \n     unauthorized hospital, their HMO would deny treatment and \n     they would be left with the bill.\n       They knew Jimmy was sick, but they didn't know how sick. \n     After all, they weren't trained professionals.\n\n  They pushed on to where the HMO said they could stop.\n\n       With miles yet to go, Jimmy's eyes fell shut and wouldn't \n     open.\n       Lamona frantically called out to him. But he didn't awaken. \n     His heart had stopped.\n\n  Imagine Jimmy's dad driving as fast as he could to the ER while his \nmother is desperately trying to keep him alive.\n  They finally pulled into the emergency room entrance. Jimmy's mother \nleaped out of the car and raced into the ER with Jimmy in her arms \ncalling, ``Help my baby! Help my baby!\"\n  They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation while a pediatric ``crash \ncart'' was rushed to the room. Doctors and nurses raced to see if the \nmiracles of modern medicine could save his life.\n  He was intubated and intravenous medicines were given and he was \ncardiopulmonary resuscitated again. He was a tough little guy. He \nsurvived despite the delay in treatment by his HMO. But he didn't \nsurvive whole.\n  He ended up with gangrene in both his hands and feet, and the doctors \nhad to amputate both of Jimmy's hands and feet.\n  This is a picture of little Jimmy before his illness, and then \nafterward. His folks drove past three hospital emergency rooms because \nthe HMO said he had to go to the fourth one miles and miles and miles \naway. And this young boy has no hands and no feet now because of that.\n\n[[Page S8219]]\n\n  We have two plans on the floor.\n  One of the plans, our bill, says that families have a right to the \nemergency care they need at the nearest hospital.\n  The other plan says they offer such a right--until you read the fine \nprint. The other side will tell you they have a good plan, but they \nhave an empty vessel.\n  On the issue of emergency care, little Jimmy, his parents, and others \nacross this country will understand that it doesn't improve care when \nHMOs are allowed to determine which emergency rooms they will allow \npatients to stop at to get emergency treatment for these children.\n  My point is this: We are going to debate theory all week. But it is \nnot theory that is important. What is important is children like Jimmy, \nchildren like Ethan, or children like this little boy who has a severe \nbirth defect of the face and was told by an HMO that this deformity \nneed not be fixed.\n  We know that is not right.\n  This debate is about profits, patient care, insurance companies, and \nthe rights of patients who are sick.\n  I think at the end of the day and at the end of this week all of us \nwill see that there are two plans. One is supported by virtually every \nmedical and consumer group in the country because they know it allows \nreal protections to allow doctors to practice medicine--not an \ninsurance accountant thousands of miles away making decisions about \npatients' health care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, what is the time situation on the \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the amendment, there are 10 minutes \nremaining for the Senator from Oklahoma and 23 minutes for the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  Mr. NICKLES. What about the remaining time on the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the underlying bill, there are 63 minutes \nfor the Senator from Oklahoma and 80 minutes for the minority.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield to my colleague from Wyoming 10 minutes on the \namendment, and if he desires additional time on the bill, I will yield \nthat as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, during the last few months I have \npatiently watched the minority come to the Senate floor and threaten to \nhold up the legislative process until they received a full debate and \namendment process on the President's Patients' Bill of Rights. On May \n25, leaders of the minority put that request in writing by sending a \nletter to the distinguished majority leader asking for a debate on \ntheir bill. That time has arrived. No tricks, no gimmicks. This debate \nwill allow us to determine if the President's bill is everything they \nsay it is.\n  Last Friday, the President, while in Los Angeles, suggested that by \ndebating his bill the Republicans are trying to hide their plan from \nthe voters. This comment begs the question: Why wouldn't the Democrats \nwant to debate their own bill? Aren't they getting exactly what they \nasked for?\n  They asked for it by holding up the agriculture bill. They asked for \nit by holding up appropriations. Now they have what they asked for. \nPerhaps they would rather have an issue to talk about--not legislation.\n  Our presence today and throughout this week clearly illustrates we \nare not hiding anything from the voters. Who is hiding? My mom can \nwatch this on her television in Sheridan, WY--and she probably is.\n  We have every intention of offering our bill during this debate. Be \nassured, the Senate will vote on our bill. We are not interested in \nhiding. We are interested in showing that we have a better bill. If \nanyone should be nervous, it is the President. If I had to defend his \nbill, I would be pretty nervous too.\n  I am glad we are debating his legislation. Perhaps all the rhetoric \nwe have heard during the last few weeks, and even today, will be \nreplaced with some substance. Sound policy conquers rhetoric. We are \nconfident of this as the debate unfolds. The bill left standing will be \nour Patients' Bill of Rights Plus.\n  I commend our leadership for the work they have done to put together \nour Patients' Bill of Rights. On January 13, 1998, the majority leader \ncreated the Republican health care task force, pouring the foundation \nfor a comprehensive piece of legislation to enhance quality of care \nwithout increasing the number of uninsured Americans. During the last \n18 months, the task force in the Senate Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions has worked together to make our bill live up to its \ntitle--a Patients' Bill of Rights our Nation's consumers and patients \ncan be proud of.\n\n  Aside from the title, the scope of the President's bill and our bill \nis quite different. I agree it is important we explain the difference \nbetween the two measures. The amendments Senators offer this week will \nclearly show those differences. I am proud of our bill's scope. It \nrespects State's jurisdiction. The President's would apply across the \nboard--a nationalized bureaucracy, budget busting, a one-size-fits-all \nnational approach.\n  I remember the last time this administration pushed a health care \npackage of this size and scope. It was back in 1993 when the President \nand Mrs. Clinton launched an aggressive campaign to nationalize the \ndelivery of health care under the guise of ``modest reform.'' The sales \npitch back then wasn't any different from what it is now, backed with \nscores of anecdotes illustrated from Presidential podiums across the \ncountry. These stories will pull on the heart strings of all Americans \nand are intentionally aimed at injecting fear and paranoia into all \npersons covered or not covered by private health insurance.\n  I am in Wyoming almost every weekend. I am quick to ask my \nconstituency interested in the President's bill to look at the fine \nprint. It is no surprise to me that most of them already have. The \nAmerican people aren't easily fooled. They haven't forgotten the last \ntime the President and Mrs. Clinton tried to slip nationalized health \ncare past their noses. Anyone can put lipstick on a pig, give it a \nHollywood-style debate, and hope for a political slam dunk. Expecting \nthe public to close its eye and kiss this pig, however, is an entirely \ndifferent matter.\n  I remember the reaction Wyoming residents had to the 1993 ``Clinton \nCare'' plan. I was a State senator at the time. I recall how the \nPresident and Mrs. Clinton rode a bus across America, promoting their \nplan to federalize our Nation's health care system. The people of \nWyoming also remember the detour they took when they got to the Wyoming \nborder. Instead of entering our home State, they chose a more populated \nroute through Colorado. That was an unfortunate choice. They missed \ntheir chance to receive an education on what rural health care is \nabout. Had they driven all 400 miles across southern Wyoming, they \nwould have seen for themselves why federalized national bureaucracy, \none-size-fits-all legislation doesn't work in rural, underserved \nStates.\n  Wyoming has 480,000 people scattered over 98,000 square miles. My \nhometown of Gillette has 22,000 people--fourth largest in the State. It \nis 145 miles to another town of equal or greater size, and it isn't \neven in our State. Many of the people in my State have to drive up to \n125 miles one way just to receive basic health care. More important is \nthe difficulty we face in enticing doctors and health care \nprofessionals to live and practice medicine in rural areas. I am very \nproud of Wyoming's health care professionals. They practice with their \nhearts, not with their wallets.\n  In a rural, underserved State such as Wyoming, only three managed \ncare health plans are available, and that covers just six counties of \nour State. Once again, this is partly due to my State's small \npopulation. Managed care plans generally profit from high enrollment, \nand, as a result, the majority of plans in Wyoming are traditional \nindemnity plans commonly known as fee-for-service. In fact, the vast \nmajority of regulated health insurance in Wyoming is handled by the \nState.\n  Some folks might wonder why I am so concerned about the scope of the \nPresident's bill if it doesn't affect Wyoming that much. I am worried \nbecause a number of Wyoming insurers offer managed care plans \nelsewhere. Any premium hike spurred by a federalized bureaucracy, \nnational one-size-fits-all bill would be distributed across the board. \nWe would get an increase when\n\n[[Page S8220]]\n\nwe didn't receive a benefit, thereby causing increases in the fee-for-\nservice premiums in Wyoming. Simply put, my constituents could easily \nend up paying for services they will never get.\n  Expecting my constituents to pay more dues to the President's \nnational health care system poses a potential threat to exclude them \nfrom health insurance coverage altogether. That is entirely \nunacceptable. Moreover, it further hinders our ability to keep \nphysicians in Wyoming. If the President's bill passes, it will actually \ndrive down the number of health care professionals we have in our \nState.\n  Our Patients' Bill of Rights is not a federalized, national health \ncare system. It stays within the traditional, regulatory boundaries \nestablished and already built in by the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act, ERISA, of 1974. ERISA applies to self-insured plans, \nmeaning employers who fund their own insurance plans for their own \nemployees--all 48 million. These plans lie outside the regulatory \njurisdiction of the States. Since it is the responsibility of the \nfederal government to regulate ERISA plans, our bill stays within that \nscope.\n\n  The President and the Senate minority, however, argue that our bill \nshould apply to all plans and all persons--including those already \nregulated by the states. Our bill's goal is to improve health care \nquality through better information and improved procedures as well as \nrights for consumers and patients, without significantly increasing the \ncost of health coverage and the number of uninsured Americans. By \nlegislating within the federal jurisdiction of ERISA only--and not \nusurping state jurisdiction--we accomplish our goal.\n  Unfortunately, that hasn't silenced the claims made by the President \nand the Senate minority. These claims are no different than those made \nby the President and Mrs. Clinton back in 1993. He wants nationalized \nhealthcare--plain and simple. Americans have been down this road \nbefore. The states, however, have been in the business of regulating \nthe health insurance industry far longer than Congress or any \nPresident. The President wants all regulatory decisions about a \nperson's health insurance plan to be made from Washington. The reason \nthis won't work is that it fails to take into account the unique type \nof health care provided in states like Wyoming.\n  While serving in the Wyoming Legislature for 10 years, I gained \ntremendous respect for our state insurance commissioner's ability to \nadminister quality guidelines and insurance regulations that cater to \nour state's consumers and patients. State regulation and respect for \ntheir jurisdiction is absolutely, unequivocally essential. I firmly \nbelieve that decisions which impact my constituents' state regulated \nhealth insurance should continue to be made in Cheyenne--not \nWashington.\n  You can call Cheyenne and talk to the same person each day, if you \nneed to. But since you can talk to the same person, you do not have to \nmake as many calls. Here you have to spend half of your time explaining \nto the person the problem that didn't get followed-up on the last time \nyou called. The President and the Senate minority want to crate that \nall up and ship those decisions back here to Washington.\n  By advocating federalized, national one-size-fits-all health care, \ndone through a bureaucracy, the President's bill would increase the \nnumber of uninsured. Perhaps that's something he wants. We know that \nthe President and Mrs. Clinton prefer a national, Federal health care \nsystem in lieu of private health insurance. Their 1993 plan is evidence \nof that. By increasing the number of uninsured, maybe he hopes that \nthese folks will join him in his campaign for a Washington-based health \ncare system. I sure hope that is not the case, but as long as the \nPresident continues to dodge that issue, I am forced to assume that \nthis is his position.\n  By keeping the scope of this bill in perspective, we also control \nthat cost which directly impacts access. Affordable access to health \ncare is an even higher priority than quality. If it is not affordable, \nquality does not exist. By issuing federalized, national one-size-fits-\nall mandates and setting the stage for endless litigation, the \nPresident's bill could dramatically raise the price of premiums--\nbarring people from purchasing insurance. That is the bottom line for \nAmerican families--the cost. We all want as much consumer and patient \nprotection as the system can support. There is not a member in the \nSenate who does not support consumer and patient protection. But if \nAmericans are expected to pay for the premium hikes spurred by the \nPresident's bill, they'll most often go without insurance. That is why \nwe must keep the scope of this bill in perspective.\n\n  The President has repeatedly accused the Senate majority of being in \nthe pocket of the insurance industry. I take great offense to that \ncharge. That same blanket claim was also made during the tobacco debate \nlast summer, even though I never took a dime from the tobacco industry. \nJust last Friday, the President said that we are being captive to the \n``raw political interest of health insurers'' and said that our party's \nleaders had resorted to delaying debate on his plan for cynical \npolitical reasons. How does the President respond to claims that his \nplan was written on behalf of special interests like organized labor \nand trial lawyers? I'd sure like to get his thoughts on that.\n  The President's bill would allow a patient to sue their own health \nplan and tie up state courts with litigation for months or years. The \nonly people that benefit from this would be trial lawyers. The patient, \nhowever, would be lucky to get a decision about their plan before their \nailment advanced or even took their life. A big settlement does not do \nyou much good if you win because you died while the trial lawyers \nfiddled with the facts. Folks are not interested in suing their health \nplan. They watch enough court-TV shows to know how expensive that \nprocess is and how long it takes to get a decision made. This is not \nL.A. Law--it is reality. Our Patients' Bill of Rights avoids all this \nby incorporating an expedited external appeals process that does not \nexceed 72 hours. Getting quick decisions saves lives. We insist on a \ndecision before the patient dies!\n  The President apparently has no problem expanding the scope of \nfederal jurisdiction, but he is silent when it comes to increasing \naccess for the uninsured. Our Patients' Bill of Rights delivers on \naccess. It would increase access to coverage by removing the 750,000 \ncap on medical savings accounts (MSA's). MSA's are a success and should \nbe made available to anyone who wishes to control his or her own health \ncare costs. Moreover, persons who pay for their own health insurance \nwould be able to deduct 100 percent of the cost if our bill becomes \nlaw--equalizing the taxes, making coverage more affordable. This would \nhave a dramatic impact on folks in Wyoming. These provisions would, \nwithout a doubt, pave the way for quality health care to millions of \nAmericans without dismantling access and affordability due to federally \ncaptured state jurisdiction.\n  While the President's bill has been pitched as being essential to \nenhancing the quality of care Americans receive, I hope that my \ncolleagues will carefully evaluate the impact that any federalized, \nnational one-size-fits-all approach would have on our nation's health \ncare system. As I have encouraged my constituents to read the fine \nprint, I also ask them to listen carefully to this week's debate. I \nhope they'll see for themselves how the President's legislation effects \ntheir home state. Rural states deserve a voice, too. Only our Patients' \nBill of Rights would provide them that podium from which they can be \nheard.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Robert \nMendoza, a fellow on my staff, and Matt Maddox on my staff be granted \nthe privilege of the floor during the pendency of this bill, and also \nthat same privilege be granted to Ellen Gadbois and Arlan Fuller, \nfellows from Senator Kennedy's office.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I rise to discuss managed care reform, \nan extremely important issue which we are finally getting to a debate \nthis week. We have an opportunity this week to substantially improve \nthe\n\n[[Page S8221]]\n\nquality of life for 161 million Americans, including 900,000 New \nMexicans, many of whom have contacted me through letters and phone \ncalls and faxes, telling about their desire for some reform of the \nmanaged care system.\n  Our goal this week seems to me very clear. The American people--and I \nbelieve every family who spends their hard-earned dollars on health \ninsurance--need to receive nothing less than the finest of medical care \navailable. We are trying to ensure that through this legislation. That \nis the task we have set, to guarantee the people of this country \ncritical patient protections.\n  It is clear the reasons are valid, why we should do this. First, \nsurvey after survey reports the American people are demanding the \npassage of patient protections such as those contained in the \nDemocratic bill that I supported, which Senator Kennedy offered in the \ncommittee. In my State, there are 350,000 New Mexicans who will not \nhave critical patient protections if the bill we pass at the end of \nthis week leaves medical decisions up to non-medical insurance \npersonnel. There are 200 patient groups and health care provider \norganizations, physicians, workers' unions, and employee groups, that \nstand behind the need for these patient protections. There are 30 \nmillion Americans who have had trouble seeing a specialist, women and \nchildren with special needs who either had critical care delayed or, \nworse, had that care denied. I heard my colleague from Wyoming just now \nsay providing this access to specialized care will dramatically \nincrease premiums.\n  The statistics are clear. The Congressional Budget Office did an \nanalysis and determined that the increase in premium costs would be, at \nthe most, 4.8 percent over a 10-year period. Providing this specialized \ncare or access to specialists would be a one-tenth-of-1-percent \nincrease in cost, less than $2 per patient per month for the entire \narray of patient protections about which we are talking. This is a very \nmodest amount which Americans are willing to pay.\n  Americans who live in rural areas, such as my State and the Senator \nfrom Wyoming was talking about his State, have to travel an hour or \nmore to get to a doctor when there is an appropriate health care \nprovider just down the road. We are trying to ensure those other \nappropriate health care providers also be made available to those \npatients.\n  Even if you put aside all of these particular reasons for passing the \nbill, clearly the main reason we should pass it is that it is the fair \nthing to do.\n  There was a very good editorial in this morning's Washington Post \nwhich I believe all Members should read. Let me refer to it for a \nmoment. It talks about the managed care debate coming up in the Senate \nthis week. It says:\n\n       The objective is, or ought to be, to legitimize the \n     containment of these costs by giving the public a greater \n     guarantee that the process will be fair. Republicans resist \n     the increased regulation this would entail. In the past they \n     have tried to deflect the bill; now they offer weak \n     legislation that is mainly a shell.\n\n  My colleague from North Dakota said the Republican proposal is an \nempty vessel. The Washington Post says it is ``mainly a shell.''\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The stronger Democratic bill is itself fairly modest. Much \n     of it is ordinary consumer protection. Patients would have to \n     be fully informed about the costs and limits of coverage, \n     including any arrangements a plan might have with physicians \n     or other providers that might give them an economic incentive \n     to cut costs. No gag orders could be imposed on physicians to \n     keep them from disclosing the range of possible treatment, \n     without regard to cost. A plan would be required to have \n     enough doctors to meet the likely needs of the enrollees. \n     Patients could not be unfairly denied access to emergency \n     care or specialists. . . .\n\n  It goes on:\n\n       The Republican bill professes to provide many of the same \n     protections, but the fine print often belies the claim.\n\n  Madam President, the debate is going to be very constructive this \nweek. The distinctions between the Democratic bill, which contains real \nprotections, and the Republican bill, which the Washington Post refers \nto as ``mainly a shell,'' will be made clear to the American people. I \nhope very much we will step up to the challenge and pass something that \ncontains some substantive protections for the people of my State. We \nwill have other opportunities to debate specific amendments in the \nfuture.\n  I see the Democratic leader is ready to speak. I yield the floor, and \nI appreciate the chance to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The minority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico for his excellent statement and for his leadership on \nthis issue. He has been very much a part of the effort from the very \nbeginning and has lent the caucus and the Senate an extraordinary \namount of his expertise on this issue, and we are deeply grateful to \nhim.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1233 To Amendment No. 1232\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that the protections provided for in the Patient's \n  Bill of Rights apply to all patients with private health insurance)\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, we yield back the remainder of the time \non the substitute, and I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle], for Mr. \n     Kennedy, for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Wellstone, \n     Mr. Wyden, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. \n     Chafee, proposes an amendment numbered 1233 to amendment No. \n     1232.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Does the Democratic leader \nyield time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I yield the remainder of the time to \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts for him to manage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, there are several of my colleagues on \nthe floor. As I understand, we have 50 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 7 minutes.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that David Doleski from \nSenator Wellstone's office and Steven Snortland from Senator Dorgan's \noffice be granted the privilege of the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as we start this debate, there are a \nseries of issues before us. One of the most important and most \nsignificant is who is covered under the two different approaches before \nthe Senate. One approach has been advanced by Senator Daschle, of which \nmany of us are cosponsors, and the other approach on the other side has \nbeen reported out of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee. Senator Frist and the Republican leadership are cosponsors.\n  In our proposal, we provide that virtually every individual who has \nhealth insurance will have the protections included in our bill. Under \nthe Republican proposal, we are finding out that the total numbers \ncovered are only those in what they call ERISA plans. There are 163 \nmillion total individuals who have health insurance covered under our \nbill. The other side covers only 48 million, and excludes 113 million. \nThey are only covering a third of all Americans.\n  We can ask ourselves: If their proposal is so solid and makes so much \nsense, why don't they cover all Americans? We heard the principal \nadvocates for the Republicans go on about what good things their \nparticular proposal is going to do. Then why not cover all the people \nin the country instead of only a third?\n  They will find out that under their proposed legislation, they do not \ncover anyone who receives their health care through health maintenance \norganizations. Isn't it extraordinary that this\n\n[[Page S8222]]\n\nwhole development, the need for patient protections, is a result of \ninsurance companies making medical decisions in the interest of the \ncompany profitability rather than the health interests of the patient? \nThat is the basic reason this whole issue has developed.\n  Their solution is to advance a program that does not even cover all \nAmericans. I am still waiting to hear why. If their program is so \nwonderful, as has been stated in the Senate, I still wonder why they \nare not covering everyone. Can they explain how they justify to people, \nliving side by side, that one will be covered and the other one will \nnot be covered under the Republican plan? They certainly are not \ncovering the 15 million people who are buying individual policies. \nThese are generally small business men and women, farmers, and \nindividuals who are buying individual policies. They are excluded under \nthe Republican plan. State and local government workers are excluded, \nand the 75 million whose employer provides fully funded coverage, the \nlargest category, are all excluded. Only 48 million are covered under \nthe Republican plan.\n  I tried to read through every explanation to understand. Then I \nstarted to read the proposals advanced in the House of Representatives.\n  There are five different Republican House proposals. But all the \nRepublican proposals in the House of Representatives cover all \nAmericans. Why is it that the Republican bills in the House of \nRepresentatives cover all Americans and over here in the Senate the \nRepublicans only cover a third of Americans? I thought there might be \nsome explanation.\n  The Democrats cover all Americans. When we say ``all,'' we mean all. \nWhen we say ``protections,'' we mean protections. That is what this \nlegislation is all about. We want to make sure we will have the \nopportunity, over the course of this week, when we are talking about \nprotections for the type of specialty care that a child might need--\nsuch as a child who has cancer--that they are guaranteed they will be \ncovered by the protections we have included in our bill.\n  We want to ensure that all women are going to be guaranteed the \nprotections we have included. We want to make sure that all of those \nwith some type of physical or mental challenge are going to be \nguaranteed the protections we have included--not just a quarter, not \njust a third, not just a half, not just three-quarters but all of them.\n  So I find that on the most basic and fundamental issue, the plans \ndiffer greatly. We are all asked: Well, look, Senator, the Republican \nproposal has emergency protections and you have emergency protections. \nCan you tell us what the differences are?\n  The fact is that virtually two-thirds are excluded from the \nRepublican proposal, before we even discuss the loopholes they have \nwritten so that their legislation does not provide adequate protections \nthat have the support of the emergency room physicians.\n  We heard this afternoon how the Republican bill provides protections \nfor emergency room care and specialty care. The fact is that none of \nthose professional groups that are dealing with children every single \nday and none of the specialists that are dealing with the most \ncomplicated cases are supporting their plan. All are supporting our \nplan.\n  It is for this reason I would have thought we would be able to bring \nRepublicans and Democrats together. Let's decide whether we really want \nto deal with the issue. Let's start off this debate on the first day, \non Monday, and say: OK, let's go ahead and make sure whatever we are \ngoing to do is all inclusive in protecting the children, not only those \ncovered by self-funded employer plans. I do not know how many children \nin this country know whether they are getting their health care as a \nresult of a self-funded employer plan or whether it is the employer \nproviding the services through insurance programs.\n  I say, let's deal with children. Let's deal with all the children. \nThat is what our bill does. And that, I believe, is fundamental.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator from Massachusetts to yield me 10 minutes \nfrom the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I can remember the first time I went to New York as a young \nman. My wife and I, of course, traveled the streets of New York. We \nwalked, and there were a lot of fascinating things. But one of the \nthings I will never forget is the people on the streets who were \ninvolved in shell games. I did not participate in any of them, but they \nwould try to get people to come. They would move these little markers \naround. You could never win. No one ever won. None of the people they \ngot to participate in these shell games ever won. I had had enough \nexperience from going to carnivals as a young man not to participate in \nthose games because there are certain games you can never win.\n\n  What is happening with the majority is they have a shell game going \non. They are here today pronouncing what is so good about their bill. \nBut the fact of the matter is, it is a shell game. Because you pick it \nup, and what they talk about is never there. The important part of what \nthey are talking about is never there. Pick it up, and it is gone.\n  What am I talking about? The Senator from Massachusetts has talked \nabout the bill of the Republicans covering only about one-fourth, about \n25 to 30 percent, of the people that our bill covers. That is part of \nthe shell game. You pick it up and 75 percent of it is missing.\n  We are talking about passing a real patient protection act, a bill \nthat covers 161 million Americans, not 25 percent of 161 million \nAmericans who receive health care through some form of managed care.\n  Our bill is not a bill that omits 113 million Americans. Our bill \nensures access to the closest emergency room without prior \nauthorization and without higher costs.\n  There have been lots of stories told about people wanting to go to an \nemergency room but having to check first. I participated in an event \nthis afternoon where an emergency room physician talked about what is \nhappening with managed care and how an emergency room physician never \nhas the opportunity, under managed care, to really do what they need to \ndo because of: How did that patient get there? Did they come on their \nown? Did they get prior approval?\n  Our bill is not a shell game. As to emergency care, you pick up the \nshell and under it the Republicans give you nothing. Our bill ensures \naccess to qualified specialists, including pediatric specialists, \nunlike the Republican bill, a bill that limits access to specialists \nand does not guarantee that children may see a pediatric specialist.\n  We live in a world of specialization. When your child is sick, you \nwant your child to go to someone who is a pediatric specialist. Whether \nit is a pediatric oncologist specialist, whether it is a pediatric \northopedic specialist, you need to be able to take your child to the \nperson who can render the best care. But when you pick up this \nRepublican shell where they talk about ``they get everything,'' and you \nwant a pediatric specialist, it is empty; you cannot get it.\n  Our bill, the minority bill, guarantees that women may designate \ntheir obstetrician/gynecologist as a primary care provider. Why is \nthat? Because that is, in fact, the reality in America. Women go to \ntheir gynecologists. That person treats them when they have a cold, \nwhen they are sick from something dealing with whatever the cause might \nbe. They look to their gynecologist as their primary care physician.\n  Under our legislation, it guarantees that women may designate their \nOB/GYN as a primary care provider. But what happens under the \nRepublican bill? It makes no guarantees and limits this to only a few \nselect women.\n  Again, you look up and you see this shell game and you see all these \npromises. You think you are going to score big. You pick up this shell, \nand there is nothing there for women that guarantees their OB/GYN as a \nprimary care provider.\n  The junior Senator from Wyoming came to the floor and again tried to \nmove this shell around. What was his shell game? The junior Senator \nfrom Wyoming said that this was national health insurance--those bad \nwords: national health insurance. Of course, this\n\n[[Page S8223]]\n\nhas nothing to do with national health insurance, absolutely nothing. \nBut, of course, this is part of the shell game: We want to frighten \npeople; we want to frighten and confuse people, as the health insurance \nindustry is doing as we speak by spending millions of dollars with \nfalse and misleading advertisements.\n  The insurance industry, as the Senator from Massachusetts pointed \nout, opposes this legislation. Hundreds of groups support this \nlegislation--hundreds of groups.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a partial list \nof those organizations that support this legislation.\n

This isn't national health insurance. This is something \nthat the junior Senator from Wyoming and others would like you to think \nis. You can follow these shells. You pick one up, and, of course, again \nit is misleading. Our legislation ensures access to needed drugs and \nclinical trials. It is not a bill that imposes financial penalties for \nneeded drugs. Of course, their bill does not guarantee access to \nclinical trials for cancer patients, among others.\n  What does this mean? Again, not speculation but facts. We were at an \nevent at 2 o'clock today, and there was a man there whose 12-year-old \nson last August got cancer. It was a rare form of cancer. During his \nchemotherapy, the managed care entity suddenly said: We don't cover \nyou. What was he going to do? He wrote numerous letters and called \nnumerous people. In short, by the time the managed care entity finally \nagreed to cover it and that it was certainly something which was \nnecessary, and by the time his family and friends gathered together to \nhelp pay for this, the boy was almost dead, and he died in February, \njust a few months ago.\n  Our bill ensures access to needed drugs and clinical trials, not this \nshell game where you say: Here, my 12-year-old son is sick; I have been \ntold this will cover me. You pick up the shell. It is empty. There is \nnothing under there. You lose again.\n\n  Our legislation prohibits arbitrary interference of HMO bureaucrats. \nWhat does that mean? It means that insurers cannot overrule doctors' \nmedical decisions. What we need is a bill that reestablishes the \npatient-doctor relationship, not one that allows clerks in Minneapolis \nor Baltimore or Sacramento to make decisions for my friends, relatives, \nand constituents in the State of Nevada. We want the doctors making \nthose decisions. Our legislation does that. The Republican version does \nnot do that. It is a part of the shell game that shuffles these shells \naround. People think they have won, but they pick up the shell and, \nagain, they have lost.\n  The minority legislation prohibits gag clauses and improper financial \nincentives to withhold care. What does this mean? There are many \norganizations around the country that give incentives to keep people \nout of hospitals, incentives to keep people from having certain types \nof care rendered. Why? Because if they do that, they get bonuses.\n  Our legislation also prevents HMOs from prohibiting doctors and other \nmedical care specialists from telling patients what is really wrong. \nThey can't be fired if they do so. Again, our legislation is not a \nshell game. It is not a shell game, as the majority legislation is a \nshell game. The majority would like you to believe that under every one \nof those shells you have a winner, but the fact of the matter is, every \nshell you pick up under the Republican version is empty; you lose \nagain.\n  The minority bill holds HMOs accountable when their decisions lead to \ninjury or death. There have been people who have talked about how this \nbill is going to be overtaken by the lawyers. Let me give you a little \nstatistic about medical malpractice cases. In the State of Nevada, \nsince we have become a State, there have been fewer than 40 medical \nmalpractice cases tried by a jury. We became a State in 1864.\n  I say that HMOs should be treated like everyone else. I went to \ndinner in Reno a couple weeks ago with a woman who is a manager of a \nmanaged care entity. She said: Harry, I like your bill except for the \nlawyers. I said: Why should you be any different from anybody else in \nAmerica? We all have to deal with lawyers. You should, too.\n  This legislation will not increase costs more than the cost of a \ncheeseburger and a very small order of fries every month. We can go \nthrough a list of people who have indicated that that, in fact, is the \ncase, contrary to what the junior Senator from Wyoming and others have \nsaid today.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes, \nsince the manager is not here. I will take that off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the fact that lawyers are involved will \nmake managed care entities do better work. The history of this is \ncertainly adequate. In the State of Texas, as an example, where they \nhave a Patients' Bill of Rights, it doesn't cover enough people, but it \ncovers some people. By the way, it is a Patients' Bill of Rights that \nGeorge W. Bush vetoed. They came back and passed another one, and he \nrefused to sign that. He is going around talking, in his Presidential \nrun, about what a great Patients' Bill of Rights they have in Texas. \nEveryone should understand, he vetoed the bill and refused to sign the \nsecond one. The fact of the matter is, the Texas experience indicates \nthat it doesn't increase cost; it just makes the health care entity, \nthe managed care entity, do a better job.\n\n  Our bill holds HMOs accountable when the decisions lead to injury or \ndeath. This is not a bill, as the Republican bill, that maintains \nprotections for HMOs that injure or kill patients. I was startled today \nto hear one of the majority talk about how their bill would reimburse \ncosts for somebody who has been aggrieved, whatever the medical care \nwould have been. That is what happens now under HMOs. That is why it \nmakes it so bad.\n  We want a bill that takes care of patients, a bill that takes care of \npatients based on doctors' decisions, not clerks' decisions. We want a \nbill that is more concerned about patients than about profits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I will speak in general on the bill, \nbut I am on amendment time.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Surely.\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of Senator Kennedy, the manager of the bill, I \nask unanimous consent that the time I used, so there is no \nmisunderstanding, be charged to the amendment and not the underlying \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I express my appreciation to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the list \nof staff I now send to the desk be granted the privilege of the floor \nduring consideration of S. 1344, the Kennedy-Daschle health care bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The list is as follows:\n\n                         HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n             Senate office                           Staffer\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrownback.............................

Peter Stein\nSessions..............................  Libby Rolfe\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I will speak in general about the bill \nand maybe correct some statements that I believe are factually \nincorrect. I think it is important to deal with facts.\n  I have heard a lot of opinions. I heard that the Republican bill that \nmany of us worked together on was a shell. I am kind of offended by \nthat, I mention to my colleague.\n  First, let me say, when we are considering health care, we should \nmake sure we don't do any damage. We should do no harm. Maybe we should \nrepeat the physicians' Hippocratic oath: Do no harm.\n  When I look at the proposal of Senator Kennedy, the Democrats' bill, \nI see it doing a lot of harm. If that bill was enacted, a lot of people \nwould become uninsured. That is harm. As a matter of fact, it is \nestimated as many as 1.8 million, almost 2 million, people would become \nuninsured if we passed his bill. We already have 43 million uninsured \nAmericans. Let's not add to it. Let's not make it worse. Unfortunately, \nI think that is what would happen.\n  We shouldn't be dramatically increasing health care costs. That is \nnot going to help solve the problem. Cost is a big problem. We had a \nlittle press conference today. We had several self-employed people who \nsaid: I can't afford health insurance. One said they didn't have it. \nOne said they barely had it and, if the cost went way up, they would \nlose it. They would have to cancel it for themselves and their \nemployees. We don't want to do that. That is doing harm. That is doing \ndamage. That is doing damage, frankly, to the best health care system \nin the world. I am not saying the health care system we have in the \ncountry today is perfect. Does it make mistakes? You bet. Can we make \nit better? Sure we can. Let's do that.\n  But I don't think we make it better by coming up with a whole laundry \nlist of Federal mandates stacked on top, duplicating State mandates, \nsaying: The Federal Government knows best. Yes, this is going to cost \nyou a lot of money. Oh, yes, Mr. Employer, you can be sued. The \nemployer saying: Thank you very much, but I don't have to provide this \nbenefit in the first place and, if you are going to sue me for it, I \nwill just drop it. I hope my employees take care of their health care \nneeds on their own. I will give them a little money. I hope they do it.\n  You and I know, in many cases they won't do it. We shouldn't do harm; \nwe shouldn't do damage to the system.\n  I heard my colleagues, from Massachusetts and from Nevada, say: Well, \nour bill doesn't cost much. It costs about the cost of a cheeseburger, \nmaybe a cheeseburger and fries.\n  Let's look at the reality. The Congressional Budget Office says the \nKennedy bill would increase health care costs by 6.1 percent. I \nunderstand they may amend it to make it 4.8 percent. What people \nhaven't caught onto is, that is in addition to health care inflation \nthat is already in the system. The cost of health care is going up. It \nis estimated to go up 9 percent, by a national survey of plans by \nWilliam Mercer. So health care costs are going up 8 or 9 percent. You \nadd another 5 or 6 percent on top of it, that means if we pass the \nKennedy bill, health care costs will be up by 15 percent. What if it is \n14 percent? I think that is too high. I think if health care costs go \nup that percentage, you are going to have a lot more people uninsured.\n  Then what about: Well, it only costs as much as a Big Mac. I have the \ngreatest respect for Senator Kennedy, but I do not know how good his \nmath is. Let me use some people who are pretty good at math, the \nCongressional Budget Office. They are not Democrats. They are not \nRepublicans. They're not people who say: Let's come up with some bad \ninformation on the Kennedy bill.\n  They said, Senate bill 6, the Kennedy Patients' Bill of Rights, will \nincrease health care premiums by 6.1 percent, resulting in an $8 \nbillion reduction in Social Security payroll taxes over the next 10 \nyears, an $8 billion reduction in Social Security payroll taxes. The \ntotal reduction in payroll over that period of time is $64 billion over \nthe next 10 years. Now, $64 billion in lost wages is a lot more than a \nBig Mac. As a matter of fact, I think it equates to $355 more per \nfamily per year. That is not a Big Mac. That is about $30 a month. That \nis not $3 a month, or $2 a month, as Senator Kennedy alluded to. That \nis about $30 a month. That is a big hit. That means that is $30 less \nthat an employer will have to compensate his employees. Where does that \nmoney come from? That is real money. According to CBO, $64 billion over \nthe next 10 years is the cost of the Kennedy bill. Where does that come \nfrom? From lost wages of employees. A whole lot of employees say: Thank \nyou very much, Senator Kennedy, but I want the money. Thank you, but I \nwant to keep my health insurance. Don't price it out.\n\n  So I think it is funny, in a way, that I hear it will only cost $2 a \nmonth. That is not accurate. CBO says it would cost $355 per year per \nfamily. So I mention that, and I think it is important that we use \nfacts. I think everybody is entitled to their own opinion, but they are \nnot entitled to their own facts. The fact is that the Kennedy bill \nwould cost families hundreds of dollars per year and would increase the \nnumber of uninsured in the millions.\n  Right now, there are 43 million uninsured Americans. That equals the \npopulation of 9 States--the population of the States that I have in \nyellow on the chart. If we pass the Kennedy bill, we can add 3 more \nStates, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. The entire population \nof those States would be uninsured. We should not be doing that. \nDemocrats and Republicans, from the outset, should not do any harm and \nwe should not increase the number of uninsured.\n  Another thing we should not do is increase the complexity of plans. \nMy friend and colleague, Senator Daschle sent that to the desk for \nSenator Kennedy. He said we need to expand the scope, that the \nRepublican plan only covers 48 million Americans, and we cover 161 \nmillion Americans, and those other 100 million Americans have no \nprotections whatsoever.\n  Well, this chart, compliments of Senator Gregg from New Hampshire, \nshows you the complexity of the Kennedy plan. Now, this is very \ngraphic, and I am sure anybody looking at it closely would say that \nlooks like a mess. And it is, because what it does it, it says: States, \nwe don't care what you have done. We know better. The Federal \nGovernment knows best.\n  Again, I have great affection and admiration for my colleague, \nSenator Kennedy. He has always thought the Federal Government knows \nbest when it comes to health care. He has always supported national \nhealth care and thought the Federal Government should write the plan \nand insist on the benefits. We know best, so States get out of the way. \nThe Federal Government will tell you how to run your health care \nbusiness. We don't care if you have had experience over the last 50 \nyears in administering insurance, health care, having insurance \ncommissioners, and having quality inspectors. We don't care if you have \nthat. We know better. The Federal Government, HCFA, Health Care Finance \nAdministration, knows better and should be making these decisions.\n  Under the Kennedy bill, we are going to overlay on top of all the \nState regulations a Federal-Government-knows-best plan. We are going to \ndictate that you have all these things. This little chart kind of shows \nthe complexity of it. Health care is fairly complex anyway with State \nadministrations. But this says we are going to overlay, on top of what \nthe States do, complex Federal mandates. States, you must do as the \nFederal Government decided.\n  What if there is competition? What if the State has an emergency room \nprovision for their State-regulated plans? We are going to say: We are \nsorry, but we know better, so you have to comply\n\n[[Page S8226]]\n\nwith ours. The State says: We think ours is better. But we are going to \nhave to have a Government bureaucrat who knows best. Senator Kennedy \nknows best, HCFA know best, the Government knows best.\n\n  That is the problem with the Kennedy bill. Unfortunately, in many \ncases, the Government doesn't know best. There are lots and lots of \nState mandates, and I pulled out a few on this chart. Forty-two States \nhave a Bill of Rights. My colleague from Nevada said the Texas Governor \nvetoed a Bill of Rights. I see on the list that Texas has a Bill of \nRights. I happen to see that Texas has a total of 42 mandates. Probably \nmany of them--the Senator from Texas says it may be too many. It is \nprobably increasing the cost of health care, but the State of Texas is \ndoing it.\n  Maybe we are the source of all wisdom. I don't know what the State of \nTexas has, but is it really in our prerogative and our right to say: \nTexas, you don't know what you are doing; we know what is best. So \nwhatever you have in your mandates, we are going to mandate something \nmore, something more expensive. We are going to dictate to you. I think \nthat is a mistake.\n  There is a basic difference in philosophy between Senator Kennedy and \nDr. Frist, who will be here shortly to discuss this. I might mention, I \nthink the plan we proposed, as far as scope is concerned--we said, \nlet's regulate the unregulated and protect the unprotected. There were \na lot of plans that aren't covered by State insurance, and we said \nthose plans should have some basic protections, so we put them in. \nThose plans weren't covered by the State mandates. That is the reason \nwe put them in there. My Democrat colleagues said they are unprotected, \nout of luck, as if the States have no role whatsoever. The States don't \nknow what they are doing. HCFA knows better. HCFA is not a cure-all for \nhealth care.\n  Here is an example. On a bill that we passed last year, I have a \ncouple comments. This was in a bill we passed:\n\n       HCFA, as a regulatory authority to enforce consumer \n     protections, stands by the Health Insurance Portability and \n     Accounting Act of 1996. In States that failed to enact these \n     provisions, according to the General Accounting Office, HCFA \n     admits that it has ``pursued a Band-Aid or minimalist \n     approach'' to enforcing these consumer protections. The \n     General Accounting Office also found that HCFA lacks \n     ``appropriate experience'' in regulating private health \n     insurance.\n\n  So GAO said HCFA is not doing a very good job. The Kennedy bill says \nturn it all over to HCFA. We don't think the States are good enough. We \nare going to turn it over to HCFA and let them do it better. GAO also \nsaid that HCFA is doing a crummy job. They should not be trying to \nregulate insurance throughout the country. They have a big job. What \nabout the health insurance portability bill, the Kennedy-Kassebaum \nbill? People have been bragging on it. It is interesting to find out \nthat the State of Massachusetts has not yet complied. Five States have \nnot complied. I doubt that that means the State of Massachusetts \ndoesn't care about insurance portability. My guess is that it is \nprobably just as portable in Massachusetts as it is in other States. \nBut they have not met congressional criteria. Therefore, HCFA is \nsupposed to administer their plans. Guess what? They are not doing it. \nThey have not done it. I don't want them to do it; I will be frank. \nEven though that is a law we have already passed, I don't think Federal \nregulation of health care in Massachusetts is going to make it any \nbetter. As a matter of fact, it might make it worse. I think that might \nbe a mistake.\n  Look at the number of health care mandates on this chart. My State of \nOklahoma has 26. The State of Texas has 42. Florida has 44. States have \nan average, I think, of 30-some or 40. Again, is it really necessary \nfor us to come in and say: States, thank you very much, we are sure you \nare well-intended, but we know better. We have decided this, and we \nhave had hearings. Our emergency room provision has to be better than \nyours. Our access to specialists has to be better than yours. We don't \nknow what yours is, but we know ours is better. A colleague showed \npictures and said: Look at this child; he was denied the health care. \nThe plan said it was not medically necessary; therefore, the child \ndidn't get the health care. So we are going to change all the laws of \nall the States because somebody finds some horror stories.\n  I have said in the past that there have been mistakes. There always \nwill be. There will be some mistakes. We have to decide what is the \nbest way to solve the problem. Is the solution to the problem coming up \nwith more Government mandates--a Federal Government takeover of health \ncare, which is really, in effect, what the Kennedy Patients' Bill of \nRights is. Is that the solution? Or will it make it worse? Look at \nother countries that have really tried socialized medicine, government-\ncontrolled medicine, government dictates from A to Z. Is their health \ncare better or worse than in the United States? It is worse. It is much \nworse. All you need for evidence of that is people in their states \ncontinue to come to the United States for quality health care, \nincluding their leaders, and including their top officials. They want \nto have health care in the United States because we have the best \nquality health care system in the world.\n\n  We need to make sure that we do no harm to that system. We absolutely \nneed to make sure that if we can make improvements on the system, let's \ndo so, but let's not make it worse.\n  Let's not pass this government-knows-best, one-size-fits-all, \nWashington, DC, HCFA, you are going to run it, and that we have \nconfidence in the government bureaucrats that we are going to hire, and \nsolve all the problems.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield before he gets off this point?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield to my friend from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. This is very important.\n  Senator Kennedy keeps standing up and really setting up the straw man \nand knocking him down, it seems to me.\n  I want to pose this as a question.\n  He is saying this bill covers 160 million people, whereas our bill \ncovers only 48 million people.\n  But isn't it true that under our bill we cover those that are in \nself-funded plans where the Federal Government has jurisdiction and \nwhere the States don't have the freedom to legislate patients' rights? \nSo we deal with the Federal jurisdiction and allow the individual \nStates to set up their own program. But Senator Kennedy wants to do the \nsame thing that he did in the Clinton-Kennedy health bill of 1993, and \nthat is to have the Federal Government set mandates even though 43 \nStates have passed their own laws.\n  Is that not the distinction we are talking about? Senator Kennedy \nbelieves that only he knows anything about this and that the State \nlegislature in Texas does not know anything about health care and \ndoesn't care anything about Texas. But Senator Kennedy knows about it. \nIn fact, he helped President Clinton do the 1993 bill, which would have \nput everybody into a health care collective run by the Federal \nGovernment--one big HMO very much similar to and with all the \ncompassion of the IRS. But now he says that States aren't competent, \neven though 43 of them have passed patients' bills of rights. He is \ntrying to preempt those States, whereas I understand our bill simply \ngoes to the people who can't, because of Federal law, be covered by \nState patients' rights.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is correct. I appreciate my colleague making that \ndistinction.\n  I have a list of all of the mandates that the State of Texas has. I \nhave a list that says 42 States have a State bill of rights.\n  I might say that those States might have a more far-reaching bill of \nrights than the proposal that Senator Kennedy offers. They may; I don't \nknow. But I happen to think they are probably a lot closer to the \npeople in that State. I happen to think if there are complaints, they \nare more likely to be resolved favorably by the State regulators than \nthey would be by bureaucrats in HCFA that have no idea of how to \nregulate health care plans.\n  That quote that I just read from GAO said that HCFA pursued a Band-\nAid or minimus approach to enforcing consumer protections, and that \nHCFA lacks appropriate experience in regulating private health \ninsurance.\n  The GAO has already studied HCFA's results, and they have failed. Yet \nSenator Kennedy's bill says to States: We want HCFA to regulate their \ninsurance.\n\n[[Page S8227]]\n\n  I just disagree with that. I disagree with that very strongly.\n  When I see the pictures of the health care catastrophes where \nsomebody was denied care, or somebody didn't get care, I am \nvery sympathetic to the families. But I don't think they are going to \nget more protection by turning it over to the Federal Government. I \nthink, frankly, they get less.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. If the Senator will yield further, does the Senator \nbelieve that HCFA cares more about the people of Oklahoma than the \nState representatives--the State senator and the Governor--who may not \nknow the Oklahoma needs the way Senator Kennedy and HCFA know them?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will answer the Senator's question. No, I don't. I \ndon't think HCFA knows the State of Oklahoma. I think HCFA is an \norganization that has a lot of responsibilities, and most of which are \nnot doing a very good job--most of which haven't done a very good job, \nfrankly, regulating Medicare. They have caused a lot of problems, as \nthe Senator from Maine can attest to, whether you are talking about \nhome health care, or whether you are talking about information to \nseniors. I know for a fact they haven't given information to seniors \nwhich was mandated by law under the Medicare changes in 1997.\n  I am looking at HCFA. I am sure there are some very good quality \npeople who are very concerned about health care in general. But I don't \nwant to turn over all insurance regulation to them, because GAO says \nthey don't have appropriate experience. Frankly, I don't think they can \ndo it as well. I know they shouldn't be doing it. I think that is a \nresponsibility that can and should be left to the States. The States \nmay make mistakes. Individuals may make mistakes. I want to make sure \nthat I point this out before we see--I am sure--dozens more charts of \nsomebody who was denied care.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Let me finish this point. I haven't made this point just \nyet. It is important.\n  We will have countless charts showing somebody who needs a cleft \npallet replaced, or somebody who has lost an arm by mistake, or \nsomebody was not treated. Obviously, any lay person would say, Why \ndidn't that person get health care?\n  If you pass our plan, we were going to see them and make sure they \nget health care.\n  The distinction that I want to make is that the bill that we have \nbefore us on the Republican proposal is that every health care plan in \nAmerica has an internal appeal done by a doctor. The internal appeal is \ndone by a doctor. It is done by a physician. If for some reason that \nphysician still determines that it wasn't medical necessary, that \nphysician can appeal it to an outside, independent expert to make the \ndetermination of whether or not it was medically necessary, or whether \nor not the treatment should go forward.\n  Hopefully that would solve the pictures, or the horror stores that we \nhave seen.\n  It wouldn't be decided by politicians. It would be decided by an \nindependent expert in that field who has no financial incentive \nwhatsoever and no connection to the health insurance industry--as I \nheard one of my colleagues say, Oh. Yes. They are bought and paid for. \nThat is not correct.\n  What we are offering instead of a lot of litigation and the \nprobability that people will be dropping plans like crazy is the chance \nfor people who need health care to get. If they are denied health care \ncoverage, they get an appeal. If their life is threatened, or if it is \ndangerous, they can get it immediately, and they can get it done by an \nindependent review board. So they get the health care they need--not \nget a lot of litigation, and not in the process uninsured millions of \nAmericans.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Sure.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Will the Senator agree that it is absolutely \nirresponsible to be proposing a vast expansion of HCFA's authority in \nregulating the private insurance market given HCFA's record, which \nincludes missing 25 percent of the implementation deadlines in the \nbalanced budget amendment of 1997; of taking 10 years to implement a \n1987 law establishing nursing home standards; of yet to have updated \n1985 fire safety standards for hospitals; when it is utilizing 1976 \nhealth and safety standards for the treatment of end-stage kidney \ndisease; when it is shown that it has been unable to handle the \nresponsibilities that Congress gave it under the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act?\n\n  Is that part of the Senator's concern about taking away the authority \nfrom State governments that are doing an excellent job in providing \npatient protections, and instead relying on the Federal Government and \nthe agency of HCFA to do that job?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I certain concur with my colleague from Maine that \nturning the responsibility over to HCFA won't make any improvement. It \nwill make it worse.\n  I might qualify part of the Senator's statement. I am not sure that \nStates are doing an excellent job in every area. I think they will do a \nmuch better job than they would be if it is turned it over to the \nFederal Government. I think they would be much closer to fixing the \nproblem, and they could fix the problem of the absence of quality. I \nthink they can fix that much, much better than we can by dictating it \nfrom Washington, DC.\n  Ms. COLLINS. If the Senator will yield on one further point for a \nquestion, would the Senator agree that the health committee legislation \nis an attempt to protect the unprotected consumers, to reach out to \nthose health care consumers that the States are prohibited from \nprotecting, and that, indeed, the assertions we are hearing from \nSenator Kennedy, our colleague, and others, and that we are leaving \nmore than 100 million Americans completely unprotected is absolutely \nfalse because they are protected under State laws that the States \nenacted without any prompt from Washington, without any encouragement \nfrom Washington, and in fact the States are far ahead of Washington in \nthis debate?\n  Mr. NICKLES. To answer my colleague from Maine, the Senator is \nexactly right--although I say we protect the unprotected. Even in the \nState-regulated plans, we make sure all those plans have an appeals \nprocess.\n  ERISA, which is a national law that does deal with fiduciary \nstandards, deals with reporting standards. We make sure there is also \nan appeals process that covers 124 million people. Maybe our colleagues \non the other side forget that. That is a basic process which we think \nis much better than saying, let's go to court; you were denied \ncoverage, let's go to court and sue. It may be 3 or 4 years and the \nplaintiff may eventually get something--or the trial lawyer may get \nmost of the money. We say, instead of going that way, let's go through \nan appeals process. We formulate an excellent internal and external \nappeals process for 124 million Americans, broad based, for any \nemployer-based plan.\n  That is a fundamental asset in our plan that will improve quality \nhealth care throughout the country.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator. I certainly agree with his \nanalysis.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Democrats have half an \nhour on the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. There was a historic event that just occurred on the \nfloor of the Senate. Those who look through the Congressional Record \nare going to find something truly amazing has just occurred. This \ndebate on health insurance reform started at 1:10 p.m. It wasn't until \n3:59 p.m., almost 3 hours later, that the first Republican Senator \nreferred to our amendment as ``socialized'' medicine. Almost 3 hours \npassed on the Senate floor before the Republicans turned to that old, \nbeat up shibboleth--socialized medicine. That may show there has been \nsome progress. In years gone by, that would have been raised in the \nfirst 5 minutes.\n  However, I think it is important my friends on the Republican side of \nthe aisle, who were supporting the approach favored by the insurance \nindustry, stop and consider for a moment that the world has changed \ndramatically since we used to simplify debate into terms of socialized \nmedicine and the medical practice that most Americans want.\n\n[[Page S8228]]\n\n  I say to Senators on the floor for the Republican side, do the \nSenators not consider it odd, if State regulation--which you are \nlauding--is so effective, that the American Medical Association is \nsuggesting they may have to unionize across America to deal with these \nhealth insurance companies? Isn't it strange, if State regulation and \nState bills of right for patients are so effective, that over 200 \nmedical organizations and others support the Democratic approach for a \nnational standard of protection for all American citizens? If the \nStates are doing such a great job protecting so many people, why are so \nmany medical professionals unhappy? Why are so many families across \nAmerica calling our office, writing letters, telling these horror \nstories which we have recounted on the floor of the Senate and will \nrecount during the course of this week?\n  There may not be a more important debate on the floor of the Senate \nthis year for America's families. We are going to decide this week \nwhether or not you can count on your health insurance. A lot of people \nacross America can't count on it. When it comes down to the tough time, \na 12-year-old boy with cancer, as Mr. and Mrs. Ray Cerniglia discussed \nthis afternoon, they had to fight their HMO. A couple, facing the \ntragedy of a 12-year-old with a rare, dangerous cancer, summons the \ncourage to deal with it. They go for the best medical help they can \nfind. That isn't enough. Now they have to worry about fighting the \ninsurance company.\n  The Republican approach is: So what. That's business. That is the way \nthings are.\n  We on this side of the aisle disagree. We believe, along with the \nmedical professionals in America, that American families deserve \nbetter. The Republican approach is an approach supported by one group: \nthe insurance industry. The insurance industry is spending millions of \ndollars on television ads distorting what this debate is all about.\n  I heard my Republican colleagues talk about States rights; we should \nleave it to the States to decide whether or not America's families \nshould have good health insurance protection.\n  Take a look at what the States have already done:\n  Twelve States haven't done a thing about access to emergency \nservices. If you have a serious accident in your backyard, you can take \nthat little boy who fell out of the tree and broke his arm to the \nnearest emergency room and not fumble around looking at your insurance \npolicy, wondering if you will be covered.\n  Thirty-one States have not enacted laws for independent appeals. If \nan insurance company denies coverage, you have an opportunity for an \nindependent appeal. The Republican approach is an in-house appeal by \nthe insurance company.\n  Thirty-eight States have not protected families that want to make \ncertain they have access to the right medical specialists. But the \nRepublican bill is one that doesn't guarantee that right to literally \nover 100 million Americans.\n  The list goes on and on.\n  Many of the Republicans who oppose this plan to protect America's \nfamilies and their health insurance argue ``States rights.'' It is an \nold argument.\n  Senator Kennedy, Senator Daschle, and others have said: Yes, if you \nbring these new protections into law, as we would like to have for \nevery American regardless of where they live, the cost of health \ninsurance will go up--$2 a month.\n  I see crocodile tears on the floor of the Senate as they bemoan the \nincreased costs of health insurance policies if we pass our bill--$2 a \nmonth. Isn't it worth $2 a month to have access to a specialist when \nyou need it? Isn't it worth $2 a month to know your doctor is giving \nyou the best medical advice and his decision is not being overridden by \nsome health insurance clerk? I think it is worth that and more.\n  They on the other side argue that our approach is too much \ngovernment. It isn't empowering government. We are empowering families \nacross America to have negotiable rights with the insurance companies, \nthat they can stand up and say these are our rights, this is for what \nwe stand.\n  This isn't a right for government. It is a right for families--\nfamilies in the most precarious situations in their lives, facing the \nmost serious illnesses. That is what we are doing here. We are \nempowering families and individuals to stand up to these health \ninsurance companies.\n  We have seen from the letters--I have seen them from Illinois; every \nSenator has--how helpless people feel when they have someone in their \nfamily who is near death and they are sitting there fighting with some \nfaceless clerk at an insurance company, begging for the care their \ndoctor says their little boy or their little girl needs.\n  We give these families power with this Patients' Bill of Rights. Why \nthe Republicans oppose this, I don't know. I can understand why the \ninsurance industry opposes it. They have a pretty good thing going on. \nThey make the decisions and they can't even be sued when they are \nwrong. You can't even take them to court.\n  I had an interview the other day in Chicago. One of the reporters \nafterwards said: Let me get this straight. We can't sue these health \ninsurance companies when they make the wrong decision? I said: That is \nright. It is the only business in America that can't be held \naccountable for its wrongdoing.\n  Think about their wrongdoing. It is a matter of life and death. A \nhealth insurance company denies a basic treatment and someone can die \nas a result and they wouldn't be held accountable.\n  The thing that troubles me, too, is the Republicans leave so many \npeople behind. What they call ``our Patients' Bill of Rights'' is an \nempty promise. Mr. President, 113 million Americans without health \ninsurance--no protection in the Republican bill; no protection in a \nbill supported by the insurance industry.\n  Look what it means in some of the States of the Senators who have \nbeen on the floor today. I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, 1,574,000 \npeople in Oklahoma are not protected by the Republican bill; 79 percent \nof privately insured are not protected under the Republican plan. Who \nare these people? They are farmers. They are self-employed people, \nwheat growers in Oklahoma.\n  Look at the State of Maine, the potato growers. Farmers there, \n557,000 of them, are not protected by the Republican bill; 70 percent \nof the privately insured are not protected by the Republican \nbill. State of Texas: We have heard a lot about big government there, \nhaven't we? Over 6 million residents of Texas are not protected by the \nRepublican bill, 59 percent of them.\n\n  Yes, it is true. There is a State Bill of Rights in Texas. Governor \nGeorge W. Bush vetoed it, and it was overridden by the State \nlegislature. It is on the books. But basically we say everybody in \nAmerica--Texas, Illinois, you name it--deserves the same kind of \nprotection. If the Republicans had their way, in my home State of \nIllinois, almost 5 million people would not be protected, would not \nreceive the benefit of the reforms we are talking about in health \ninsurance; 59 percent of those privately insured not protected by the \nRepublican plan.\n  Who are those folks? Let me show you a picture of some of them. This \nis my home State, farmers left unprotected by the Republican \n``Patients' Bill of Wrongs.'' This is a gentleman I know by the name of \nTom Logsdon. His 24-year-old daughter was diagnosed with breast cancer. \nShe has gone through a lot. The Republicans would not protect her, \nwould not protect her family because they are self-employed people. \nThey are farmers. They do not believe there should be this kind of \nprotection for those folks. I disagree. I think these families and \nfamilies across America deserve the same continuity of care, the same \nprotection. I think, frankly, when you look at the choice in this bill, \nyou can understand why the insurance companies support the Republican \nbill and oppose the Democratic bill.\n  Here is the only way we are going to get this bill passed. We have to \nhope that five or six Republican Senators will break ranks and decide \nto join us in a bipartisan effort to really provide coverage and \nprotection for people across America. If that does not happen, if this \nbreaks down along partisan lines, we will spend a week in debate and \nthe American people will say: What happened? Nothing will have \nhappened. I hope before this debate is concluded we have that \nbipartisan support.\n\n[[Page S8229]]\n\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of Senator Kennedy, I yield the Senator from \nNorth Dakota 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have sat and listened quietly and \npatiently to the debate over this amendment. I was thinking to myself \nthat, if ever there were an Olympic sport for sidestepping, I surely \nhave seen some gold medal winners this afternoon. The issue in this \namendment is, whom does this piece of legislation protect? Whom does \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights protect?\n  Some people view this debate as a debate between a bunch of wind \ngenerators in blue suits, and they do not know whom to believe. So here \nis an editorial from USA Today--not from Republicans, not from \nDemocrats. The headline of this USA Today editorial reads: ``100 \nMillion Reasons GOP's Health Plan Fails. That's How Many People \nProposal Will Leave Unprotected.'' Let me read what it says:\n\n       Judging from the health insurance reform package announced \n     this week by Senate Republicans, at least the title is \n     correct. The proposal is called the Patients' Bill of Rights. \n     If you are waiting for this perfunctory plan to protect you, \n     you'll need to be patient indeed, many of the plan's key \n     protections are restricted to the 51 million Americans who \n     get their insurance through self-insured employer-sponsored \n     plans subject to direct Federal regulation. But another 100 \n     million or so whose health plans are subject to state \n     regulation are excluded.\n\n  Again, USA Today says this plan is an empty shell. This plan does not \nmatch the needs the American people ought to expect will be met.\n  I have heard debate this afternoon I would have expected 100 years \nago in this Chamber. Back in the years when suspenders and spittoons \nadorned this Chamber, you would have heard exactly the same debate on \nevery issue. Meat inspection? Let the States do it. The Federal \nGovernment should not be involved. Pollution control? Let the States do \nit. Nursing home regulation? Let the States do it. Minimum wage? The \nFederal Government should not be involved. That is a debate a century \nold, and it is old and tired.\n  The question here is, What kind of legislation are we going to pass \nthat protects American families? Are we going to pass a bill that \nincludes the 100 million people their side leaves out? You were told to \nbe careful of stories about children who tug at your heart because \nsomehow that is not reflective of the whole issue. Jimmy, here, is \nnever going to stroke his mother's face, may never be able to shoot a \nbasket. He has no arms and no legs. Why? Because in the middle of the \nnight when 6-month-old Jimmy was desperately ill, his dad had to drive \npast the first hospital, drive past the second hospital, drive past the \nthird hospital, in order to get to the hospital they approved for this \nlittle boy to get emergency treatment. As a result, he lost his hands \nand his feet. Our opponents bill does not provide a guarantee that this \nyoung boy would have gotten emergency treatment at the first, second, \nor third hospital. No such guarantee exists in their plan. If it did, \nit would not apply to 100 million Americans.\n  They say don't let these stories affect you. That is what this is \nabout. It is about patient care. It is about real people. It is about \nJimmy, it is about Ethan, it is about the people I have talked about on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  Let me conclude just by pointing out the differences in titles. They \nbrought a bill to the floor of the Senate with the title the Patients' \nBill of Rights. That is the same name as the piece of legislation we \nauthored. Ours contains real protections; theirs does not.\n  Abe Lincoln was debating Douglas, and he could not get Douglas to \nunderstand his point. Finally he said to Douglas: Let me ask it this \nway. He said:\n\n       Tell me, how many legs does a horse have?\n\n  And Douglas said,\n\n       Four, of course.\n\n  Abe said,\n\n       Now if a horse's tail were called a leg, how many legs \n     would a horse have?\n\n  And Douglas said,\n\n       Five.\n\n  And Abe Lincoln said,\n\n       No, that's where you are wrong. Simply calling a tail a leg \n     doesn't make it a leg at all.\n\n  You can call this proposal that has been offered by the majority \nparty whatever you like, but it does not make it a patients' protection \nact. As USA Today says in its editorial, if you think you are going to \nget protection from the Republican patient protection plan, you had \nbetter be patient, because it leaves out 100 million Americans. There \nis a lot of misinformation that has been given on the floor of the \nSenate today and a lot of sidestepping on the important issues. But I \nsay when this debate is over, do not, as the Senator from Oklahoma \nsuggests, dismiss the concerns and stories that are raised about \nindividual people. After all, the only question really important in \nthis debate is how it affects the individual patients, the men, women, \nand children who seek treatment in our health care system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield to the Senator from Maine such time as she \ndesires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, we have heard it again. Once again we \nhave heard the myth that is being perpetrated on the other side of the \naisle that the bill approved by the health committee leaves millions of \nAmericans unprotected, completely unprotected. You heard it again. That \nis simply not true. These Americans live in States that have enacted \npatient protections very similar to the ones included in the health \ncommittee bill to apply to those plans where people truly are \nunprotected. Those are the ERISA plans, the self-funded plans that the \nStates cannot regulate because of a Federal preemption.\n  According to the CBO, 80 percent of the U.S. population lives in \nStates with laws guaranteeing access to emergency care; 77 percent of \nAmericans work in organizations offering employee health plans with a \npoint-of-service option. The Kennedy mandates, with direct access to \nOB/GYN, already exist in States containing almost 70 percent of the \npopulation. We know that 47 States have enacted laws to prohibit gag \nclauses, something we all agree need to be prohibited. Why do we need \nto duplicate and preempt the good work of the States? Why not build on \nthe good work of the States?\n  The State of Maine has enacted 35 mandates--35 patient protections. \nNow, who is to say the emergency access protection of the State of \nMaine is somehow inferior to the one in Senator Kennedy's bill, just \nbecause it differs from Senator Kennedy's bill? Who is going to make \nthese determinations? Are they going to end up in court? Is HCFA, by \nthe Federal Government, by fiat, going to decide that Maine's was not \nquite right, that it should be knocked out, replaced by the Kennedy \nstandard, because Washington knows best? Washington is the source of \nall wisdom in this?\n  The opponents of our legislation contend that the Federal Government \nshould preempt the States' patient protection laws unless they are \nidentical to the ones in Senator Kennedy's legislation. However, the \nStates' approaches to the same types of patient protection can vary \nwidely.\n  States may have emergency requirements but not the exact same \nstandards as in the Kennedy bill. That is the case with the State of \nMaine.\n  Moreover, what if the State has made an affirmative decision not to \nact in one of these areas because the market in their State does not \nrequire it and they are concerned about costs? What if the bill has \nfailed in the legislature or has been vetoed by the Governor? Let me \ngive a recent example from my home State of Maine.\n  Maine law requires insurance plans to allow direct access to OB/GYN \ncare without a referral from a primary care physician but only for an \nannual visit. Maine's law also requires plans to allow OB/GYNs to serve \nas the primary care provider.\n  Our State legislature recently decided that those current laws, which \nMaine was the head of the Nation in enacting, provided sufficient \naccess, that they corrected a problem in the\n\n[[Page S8230]]\n\nmarketplace. The legislature rejected a bill that would have expanded \nthe direct access provision primarily out of concern that it would \ndrive up premium costs.\n  I note for my colleague from Massachusetts, this decision was made by \na legislature controlled by the Democratic Party. This was not some \nRepublican legislature that made this decision, but rather the \nlegislators in Maine were satisfied with the current law and decided \nnot to expand it because they were concerned about the additional costs \nthat would be incurred.\n  In cases such as this, the Kennedy proposal for a one-size-fits-all \nmodel would just simply preempt the decision made by the State \nlegislature. That is why the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners supports the approach that was taken in the legislation \nreported by the Health Committee.\n  In a March letter to the committee, the NAIC pointed out:\n\n       The states have already adopted statutory and regulatory \n     protections for consumers in fully insured plans and have \n     tailored these protections to fit the needs of their states' \n     consumers and health care marketplaces. In addition, many \n     states are supplementing their existing protections during \n     the current legislative session based upon particular \n     circumstances within their own states. We do not want states \n     to be preempted by Congressional . . . actions.\n\n  The letter continues:\n\n       It is our belief that states should and will continue the \n     efforts to develop creative, flexible, market-sensitive \n     protections for health care consumers in fully insured plans, \n     and Congress should focus attention on those consumers who \n     have no protections in self-funded ERISA plans.\n\n  That is exactly what our plan would do. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe letter from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, current Federal law prohibits the States \nfrom regulating the self-funded, employer-sponsored health plans that \ncover 48 million Americans. Our legislation, which is intended to \nprotect the unprotected, to reach those consumers in self-funded plans \nthat the States are prohibited from regulating, would extend many of \nthe same rights and protections to the Americans covered by these plans \nthat are already enjoyed by Americans who are under the State-regulated \nplans.\n  The States have been ahead of the Federal Government in this area. \nThey have acted over the past 10 years to correct problems in the \nmanaged care marketplace by enacting specific consumer protections. Our \nbill extends those kinds of protections to those plans that the States \ncannot reach. We go beyond that, though, when it comes to the \nprocedural protections, the all-important internal and external appeal \nprocedures that are in our legislation. We provide that to all plans \nacross the board. Again, another myth perpetuated by those on the other \nside of the aisle that somehow our appeals process does not cover these \nAmericans.\n  We have produced a good bill. It builds on, but does not preempt, the \ngood work of the States. It provides protections to those 48 million \nAmericans whom the States cannot protect. It balances carefully the \nneed to have reforms that ensure that essential care is provided, that \nno one is denied care that an HMO has promised. It holds HMOs \naccountable for their decisions. It puts decisions in the hands of \nphysicians, not insurance company executives or accountants and not \ntrial lawyers. It carefully strikes a balance of providing important \nconsumer protections without driving up the costs, as the Kennedy bill \nwould do, in a way that would jeopardize, that would undermine health \ninsurance coverage for millions of Americans.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                      Insurance Commissioners,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 1999.\n     Hon. James Jeffords,\n     Chair, Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \n         Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeffords: We are writing this letter in \n     response to some concerns raised by your office regarding the \n     testimony of the National Association of Insurance \n     Commissioners (NAIC) Special Committee on Health Insurance \n     (``Special Committee'') before the Senate Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee on March 11, 1999. The \n     hearing focused on the rule of the states and the federal \n     government in enacting patient protections for consumers in \n     group health plans. Specifically, concerns have been raised \n     over the Special Committee's testimony and whether the \n     Special Committee now supports a federal floor.\n       We understand why the members of the Senate HELP Committee \n     would get the impression from our oral testimony that the \n     members of the Special Committee are supportive of a federal \n     floor. During our testimony we may have implied that the \n     members of the Special Committee would accept a federal floor \n     in any federal patient protection legislation. The members of \n     the Special Committee have not made a determination that a \n     federal floor is acceptable. It is our belief that states \n     should and will continue the efforts to develop creative, \n     flexible, market-sensitive protections for health consumers \n     in fully insured plans, and Congress should focus attention \n     on those consumers who have no protections in self-funded \n     ERISA plans.\n       Rather, the members of the Special Committee are interested \n     in strengthening the distinction between self-funded ERISA \n     plans, which are clearly outside the purview of state law, \n     and fully insured plans. State insurance departments want to \n     ensure that citizens in their states who are covered by fully \n     insured ERISA plans can still rely on the state to address \n     their questions, complaints and grievances and can still \n     expect the same level of protections already established by \n     the states. The states have already adopted statutory and \n     regulatory protections for consumers in fully insured plans \n     and have tailored these protections to fit the needs of their \n     states' consumers and health care marketplaces. In addition, \n     many states are supplementing their existing protections \n     during the current legislative session based upon particular \n     circumstances within their own states. We do not want states \n     to be preempted by Congressional or administrative actions.\n       During our testimony, we highlighted our Statement of \n     Principles on Patient Protections (``Statement of \n     Principles''), which were created to assist Congress in \n     developing patient protection legislation. The Statement of \n     Principles highlights the elements that we believe must be \n     included in any patient protection legislation and reflects \n     the NAIC's commitment to consumer protection. We suggested \n     that these principles be used as guidelines in drafting any \n     federal legislation.\n       The principles are as follows:\n       Principle 1: Federal legislation establishing patient \n     protection laws should reinforce the ERISA saving clause and \n     not preempt existing state health care consumer protection \n     laws, particularly as these protections apply to fully \n     insured health plans.\n       Principle 2: Federal legislation establishing patient \n     protection laws should ensure a basic level of protections \n     for all health care consumers, focusing particular attention \n     on those consumers in self-funded ERISA plans who do not \n     currently have such protections.\n       Principle 3: Federal legislation establishing patient \n     protection laws should preserve the state infrastructure \n     already in place.\n       Principle 4: Federal legislation establishing patient \n     protection laws should ensure that all health care consumers, \n     whether under fully insured or self-funded plans, have access \n     to an appropriate regulatory body for answers to their \n     questions, complaints and grievances.\n       Principle 5: Federal legislation establishing patient \n     protection laws should establish an appeals process to \n     resolve disputes and enforce decisions for those consumers, \n     such as those in self-funded plans, without access to such a \n     process.\n       The members of the Special Committee appreciate the efforts \n     of Congress to provide patient protections to all consumers, \n     and we offer the above principles as guidelines in developing \n     such legislation. In doing so, we urge Congress to focus its \n     legislative activity on consumers in self-funded ERISA plans, \n     which are under the federal government's exclusive \n     jurisdiction, and to preserve the state protections that \n     already exist for consumers in fully insured ERISA plans. \n     Again, we have not endorsed the concept of a federal floor \n     with regard to patient protections.\n       On behalf of the members of the Special Committee, we would \n     like to thank you for the opportunity to testify before the \n     Senate HELP Committee and for the opportunity to clarify our \n     position. If any members of the NAIC can be of further \n     assistance, please feel free to contact Jon Lawniczak at \n     (202) 624-7790.\n           Sincerely,\n     George Reider, Jr.\n                                                  President, NAIC.\n     Kathleen Sebelius,\n                                        Secretary-Treasurer, NAIC.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have 15 minutes left; is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 7\\1/2\\ minutes to the junior Senator from North \nCarolina and 7\\1/2\\ minutes to the senior Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n[[Page S8231]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will briefly respond to the remarks by Senator \nCollins from Maine, for whom I have tremendous respect. She and I have \nworked together on a number of issues. I know she believes deeply in \nthe cause she advocates this afternoon. I have great professional and \npersonal respect for her. This is an issue on which I happen to \ndisagree with her for a number of reasons.\n  First, she suggests their plan--the plan she is referring to I assume \nis the Republican plan--is one that adequately protects patients' \nrights because of laws enacted in States across the country. If that is \nso, why is there such an enormous public outcry for reform? The \nAmerican people believe deeply that patient protection legislation is \ndesperately needed across this country. If these laws already exist and \nare already in place and are working, why in the world does anybody \nneed to do anything? The reality is that these laws are not in place \nand they are not working. Let me give a few examples.\n  For example, access to clinical trials, which is a critical component \nof our bill: 47 States of the 50 have no provision for access to \nclinical trials.\n  External appeals, which are absolutely essential: 32 States have no \nprovision for independent external appeals.\n  Access to specialists: 39 States have no provision allowing people to \ndesignate a specialist as their primary care provider, and 36 States \nhave no provision for standing referrals to specialists.\n  Continuity of care: 30 States have no continuity of care provisions.\n  This list goes on and on.\n  The reality is, No. 1, that the majority of States have none of the \nprotections we are talking about in the Democratic Patients' Bill of \nRights. That is the reason there is an enormous public outcry. That is \nthe reason we have a health care crisis in this country today, and it \nis the reason I respectfully disagree with my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Maine.\n  The second reason is, to the extent a State has passed any kind of \npatient protection legislation and that legislation conflicts in any \nway with ERISA, it is preempted. It is absolutely preempted, under \nexisting law, if we never pass anything. Even the laws that have been \npassed, to the extent those laws conflict in any way with the existing \nERISA statutes, are preempted by ERISA.\n  The bottom line is this: No. 1, if State laws adequately dealt with \nthis problem, we would not have the public outcry, the horror stories \nwhich we have heard and will continue to hear in this Senate over the \ncourse of the next week.\n  No. 2, the fact of the matter is, to the extent those laws exist--and \nthey do not exist in the majority of States on the critical issues--to \nthe extent they do exist, they are preempted by ERISA.\n  I do want to mention one other thing on the issue of cost because \nthere has been a lot of discussion about cost from the Senator from \nOklahoma and the Senator from Maine.\n  First of all, it is critically important to recognize that to the \nextent we get a patient to a specialist soon, and we do that in our \nbill, to the extent we allow women to go directly to an OB/GYN as their \nprimary care provider, to the extent we allow patients who are in a \ncritical emergency to go the nearest hospital and be seen by an \nemergency room department or physician and thereby save that patient's \nlife or reduce the amount of long-term care that patient receives--in \nevery one of those instances we are reducing long-term health care \ncosts in this country.\n\n  So I want us to recognize, first, that to the extent we are talking \nabout increased costs, they are only talking about short-term costs, \nnot long-term costs. The truth of the matter is that long-term costs \nwill be reduced by passage of the Patients' Bill of Rights for the very \nsame reason that preventive medicine reduces health care costs in this \ncountry, because we are going to get folks to the doctor they need to \nsee sooner; they are going to get the care they need quicker.\n  The net result of that is that they do not need the ongoing, chronic, \nlong-term care that many patients, unfortunately, have to get because \nthey do not see the physician they need to see as quickly as they need \nto see them. That is what the external review process does. That is \nwhat the internal review process does.\n  I might add, those two things work in concert with the fact that, \nunder our bill, an HMO can be held accountable in court for what they \ndo. I want the American people to recognize what happens when an HMO \ncannot be held accountable, when they are treated as a privileged \nentity. And under existing law they are a privileged entity. They, \namong all the businesses and corporations and individuals in this \ncountry, get special treatment, treatment that none of our families or \nour children or our small businesses get. They are all held completely \nresponsible. But HMOs, for some reason, are above the rest of us. They \nare a cut above the rest of us. They get special treatment. They cannot \nbe held accountable in court.\n  So what happens when an HMO makes an arbitrary and capricious \ndecision and a child suffers a serious injury as a result and has a \nlifetime of medical care in front of them--for example, a 7-year-old \nchild? If the HMO can be held responsible, the HMO bears that cost, as \nwell they should bear that cost because they are responsible for it.\n  But what happens if the HMO does not bear the cost? We know where the \ncost goes. It goes to us. It goes to the American taxpayer. Because \nthose kids do not have the money to pay for chronic, long-term care \nover the course of their lives. They are paid out of Medicaid. They are \npaid with taxpayer dollars. The net result of that is that the cost an \nHMO or a health insurance company would bear has been shifted to the \nAmerican taxpayer. That is wrong. We know it is wrong. That is one of \nthe things we are trying to do something about in this bill.\n  I have to add one other thing. The Senator from Oklahoma said over \nand over during the course of his argument that what our bill proposes \nis that the Government knows the answer, that the Government has the \nsolution. My response to that, with all due respect, is existing law \nand the bill of the other side would say the HMO has the answer, the \nhealth insurance company has the answer.\n  I say to the American people, and to my colleagues, we have tried \nthat. We have tried leaving this in the hands of the HMO. We have tried \nleaving it in the hands of the health insurance industry. And it has \nnot worked.\n  With that, I conclude by saying I think it is critically important \nthat we cover all Americans, that all Americans are covered by health \ninsurance plans. That is done under the Democratic bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, one of the key issues in this debate is \nthe scope of the provisions; that is, should patient protections we are \ndebating apply solely to those 48 million Americans enrolled in the \nself-insured ERISA plans or should they apply to all privately insured \nAmericans? Obviously, there can be varied views on this subject, as we \nheard from the Senator from Maine, the Senator from Oklahoma, and \notherwise on the floor today.\n  In 1996, through the Kassebaum-Kennedy law, Congress passed reforms \nto the private health insurance marketplace with respect to \nportability. In my opinion, we should use the same framework used then \nwith respect to scope and effect on State law. Thus, we should \nestablish, I believe, a minimum floor of Federal protection for all 164 \nmillion privately insured Americans, not just those 48 million enrolled \nin self-insured ERISA plans.\n  I see no reason for narrowing the scope of the patient protections in \nthis next and far more consequential area of reform. Protections as \ncritical to patients as the right to a specialist when needed should \napply to all Americans, I believe.\n  Some of my colleagues argue that it is the individuals only in the \nself-insured plans--those completely out of State reach--who should \nbenefit from these Federal protections. While it is true that States do \nhave the authority\n\n[[Page S8232]]\n\nto legislate patient protections for these other plans, that alone, I \nbelieve, is insufficient reason to deny these basic quality \nimprovements and safeguards to all 164 million Americans in privately \ninsured plans. Such a system would, in my judgment, create many \nunnecessary and inequitable circumstances for consumers and exacerbate \nthe already unlevel playing field which exists in the health insurance \nmarketplace.\n  Congress has recognized the need for minimal Federal guarantees \nregarding health insurance in several instances. I think this is very \nimportant to note. For example, in addition to the portability \nprotections included in the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, all Americans have \nbeen granted protections for continuation of care under the so-called \nCOBRA, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985. They \nhave been given this protection in mental health parity. They have been \ngiven this protection in maternity lengths of stay. They have been \ngiven this protection just last fall when we passed the breast \nreconstructive surgery protections. And we extended that to all \nAmericans; we did not restrict it just to the self-insured under the \nERISA plans.\n  Republicans and Democrats alike continue to recognize the need for \nFederal protections that apply to the entire health insurance market. \nThe generic nondiscrimination provisions of S. 326 would apply to plans \nbeyond the self-insured ERISA plans.\n  Where is the logic in creating Federal protections applying to the \nentire health insurance market regarding these aspects of health \ninsurance but not patient protections as fundamental as access to \nexternal appeal or emergency services?\n  Furthermore, as with many other limited preemption laws on the books, \nthis approach would not preempt equal or stronger patient protections \nwhich have been adopted by the States.\n  Look at this list. These are not health matters. These are \nenvironmental matters. They are consumer and other statutes. They start \nwith the Clean Air Act. All of these statutes provide a floor of \nFederal protections that the States can and, in some instances, do go \nbeyond.\n\n  The Federal Government has come in, in all these instances, and said: \nThis is a floor--Toxic Substances Control Act, Safe Drinking Water Act. \nIf you in the State want to go further, fine, go ahead, but these are \nthe minimals you have to do. That is what we are suggesting presents a \nreal problem in the legislation that has been reported and then \ndiscussed by the Senator from Maine and the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  It is critical that the protections we adopt this week in the Senate \napply to all Americans, including those with plans regulated by the \nStates because State protection is extremely spotty. One justification \nfor applying privacy protections to the entire health insurance market \nis that there is not a complete body of State law on privacy. For \nexample, it is likewise true with respect to patient protections. \nConsidering only a few of the most important patient protections, only \n15 States have adopted an external review procedure and only 13 States \nhave adopted standing referrals to specialists.\n  It is important to note that by not covering all Americans, many of \nthe most vulnerable insurance customers will be left with no \nprotection. You go out to buy a policy. You do not have employee \nbenefit managers; you do not have somebody to look after you like that; \nand you are at the mercy of the insurers making decisions based solely \nor primarily on cost considerations.\n  To summarize, all Americans, I believe, should have these basic \nprotections regardless of whether the plan they are in is regulated at \nthe State or Federal level. In fact, most Americans probably do not \nknow who is responsible for regulating their plan and should not have \nto worry when they are sick as to who is the regulator and what \nprotections they have as a result. They should have the assurance that \nhowever their plan is regulated, it will provide them the care they \nneed according to the most basic and commonsense principles.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, how much time do we have on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen and a half minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Let me just say at the outset that I, for one, am very \nglad that we are on this bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is a \nbill that is terribly important to the American people. All of us know, \nas we conduct our town meetings around our various States, that we have \na real problem today in that today's problem is reflected in the \nfeeling of helplessness by patients, helplessness by physicians, \nhelplessness by other providers when it comes to managed care. There \nare reasons for that.\n  As my colleagues know, I am a physician and was involved in the \npractice of medicine and training for about 20 years where every day--\nbefore coming to this body--I took care of many patients, thousands of \npatients, well over 10,000 patients, and the changes have been \ntremendous over the last 20 years as we look at how health care is \ndelivered and the reasons for it.\n\n  Right now our society, our country is caught up in a rapidly changing \nhealth care system. In all those changes and in that evolution, many \nchallenges have been introduced. Part of our responsibility as \nSenators, as trustees to the American people, is to make sure that we \nvery gently, but in many ways very firmly, make sure these challenges \nare faced in a systematic way, such that a patient--again, I come back \nto patients. We are going to hear about cost and about managed care \ncompanies and health maintenance organizations and trial lawyers and \ncosts going up and big budgets. I hope throughout this week we will \ncome back again and again to patients. Patients have to be at the \ncenter of this debate.\n  When we talk about patients, we are talking about a Patients' Bill of \nRights, a bill of rights that patients can expect when they are dealing \nwith the health care system and with managed care and with HMOs. We \nalso need to be talking about the quality of care that is delivered. We \nneed to be talking about access and not ever forget about the 43 \nmillion people who don't have health insurance.\n  For the most part, people say: Well, let's deal with the people who \nhave insurance, group health insurance with managed care plans. Let's \nmake sure their rights are protected. In doing that, let's not forget \nthat there is a whole group of people over here, 43 million people--too \nmany people, inexcusable, I feel--who don't have any health insurance \nat all, making sure that when we fight for the rights of the people who \ndo have health insurance, we don't want to drive more people to the \nranks of the uninsured, who don't even have insurance in the first \nplace.\n  When we talk about the Patients' Bill of Rights, whether it is the \ngag clause or access to specialists or scope of the plan, let's not \nforget that we are talking about individual patients. In trying to get \nrights to one segment, let's not go so far or too far in all the anger \nthat we feel against managed care that it drives up the ranks of the \nuninsured.\n  Why is this access issue important? We know--studies document it \nagain and again--that in America, if you have some health care \ninsurance, the health care system does open up to you broadly. If you \nhave no health care insurance at all, it is less likely that that \nhealth care system will open up to you broadly. So the last thing I \nthink we want to do in this body is take rights to such an extreme that \nwe drive up the number of uninsured, recognizing that access is a huge \nproblem, a huge challenge for our country.\n  When I first started 20 years ago in the field of medicine, it was \nvery different. The practice of medicine was basically straight out fee \nfor service. Very few physicians were in groups. They were practicing \nby themselves. They had full autonomy. They were making a very good \nliving, basically went to medical school and worked very hard. They had \nprofessional ethics of ``do no harm,'' all of which continues today, \nexcept the system around them has changed dramatically. Managed care 20 \nyears ago was tiny. Today, managed care, coordinated care, health \nmaintenance organizations, if you look\n\n[[Page S8233]]\n\nat the overall, nongovernment coverage is the majority of care that we \ngive. And as a product of that, we have this pendulum which has swung \nback and forth over time. It is true--that is why we are debating this \nbill today--there is no question that that pendulum has swung way over \ntowards managed care and away from individual patients, individual \npeople who need that care, who will go to bed tonight worried that if \nthey have a heart attack tomorrow, will they be taken care of \nappropriately, will they have access to the emergency room, will they \nhave access to the appropriate specialist. That is where this whole \nPatients' Bill of Rights comes in because over the last 5 years or 10 \nyears that pendulum has swung way in the favor of managed care.\n\n  Now, I believe we are going to hear a discussion over the next week \nof how we can best get that pendulum back to the middle and have that \nbalance between patients and physicians on the one hand and managed \ncare on the other.\n  One of the objectives I would like to see as we go forward in a very \nrational way, after we cut away all the rhetoric, going at each other \nand the hot debate, is to come back and say: Let's keep our eye on the \nball. The ball is the patient who is in this system of managed care, \nand not physicians and trial lawyers and lawsuits, and make sure we say \nthat they are going to get the very best care. If anything is going to \nhappen to them, they know they will have certain rights in this \nevolving, changing world.\n  It has gotten to the point that it is not just anecdotal, but some \nmanaged care, some health maintenance organizations have garnered so \nmuch power, so much control that they have abused the system. The whole \naccusation that some HMOs are in the business of practicing medicine is \nhard to argue against. I think one of our objectives needs to be to \nmake sure that we don't have insurance companies or managed care \ncompanies or HMOs practicing medicine. In other words, get that \npendulum back to that patient, to that decisionmaking through that \ndoctor-patient relationship.\n  On the other hand, I think it is irrational to assume that we will go \nback 20 years and not have managed care, not have coordinated care, not \nhave health maintenance organizations. That being the reality, we want \nto have a strong Patients' Bill of Rights that looks to those patient \nprotections that empower the patient, empower the American citizen, \nempower the physician and bring that pendulum back over to that doctor-\npatient relationship, to keep the patient in charge.\n  We have on the floor now a Democratic bill, a Republican leadership \nbill, and we have one amendment talking about the scope. We will need \nto come back to talk a little bit more about scope because it is one of \nthe important issues where there is a sharp dividing line. We will hear \nwords like ``medical necessity,'' the issue of scope, of medical \nspecialists, but amidst all of that, let's come back to the patient.\n  Let me speak to what is in the Bill of Rights Plus Act, which is the \nRepublican bill which is now on the floor, in terms of scope. Scope \nreally means who is being covered. Does this bill cover just a targeted \npopulation, the whole population, a part of the population? You can \nalmost look at it as a pie chart in your mind.\n  There are a number of provisions in each of these bills. You have to \ngo through each of the provisions when you are talking about scope.\n\n  When we talk about the issue of comparative information in the \nRepublican leadership bill, all group health plans would be required to \nprovide a wide range of comparative information about health insurance \ncoverage so that the individual patient knows what is covered and what \nis not covered, what that relationship is, what they have actually \nsigned, what that contract is about, what the network descriptions are, \nwhat the cost-sharing information is. The scope is complete, all 124 \nmillion people in the Republican bill are covered by that particular \nprovision, the information.\n  When we look at what I think is fundamentally the most important \nmechanism by which we are fixing the system, getting that pendulum back \nover in the middle between managed care and the patients and the \nphysicians, it is the whole process of accountability, the grievance \nand appeals process, the internal review process, the external review \nprocess. Over the next 4 days, we will be talking a lot about how these \nappeal processes work.\n  If you look at the way health care is delivered, I do believe this is \none of most important provisions in the Patients' Bill of Rights. Both \nbills address grievance and appeals, but I want to make it very clear, \nin terms of the Republican bill, that the scope is complete, with all \n124 million Americans covered. The scope is complete. All group health \nplans would be required to have written grievance procedures and have \nan internal review process. So if you have a patient who disagrees with \nthe coverage from the plan, or a doctor and a patient who disagree with \na plan, they will have someplace to go in an internal review process. \nIf they don't like what the internal review process says, if there is \ndisagreement on coverage between the doctor, the patient, and the plan, \nthey can go outside the system to an external review process.\n  Now, what I like very much about our plan, which I think is very \nimportant, is that our external review process has a physician in \ncharge. It is not an insurance company; it is not a trial lawyer; it is \nnot a bureaucrat. It is a medical--I will use the word--``specialist,'' \nif necessary, in that field who is independent of the doctor, the \npatient, and the plan.\n  Remember, that external appeals process all started with a \ndisagreement on coverage; you have gone through the internal appeals \nprocess, and now you are outside. You go through an external appeals \nprocess and that person also is independent.\n  So we have an internal appeals process, and then we have an external \nappeals process, where you have an independent physician reviewing the \ncoverage and making the decision. In addition, that independent medical \nexpert makes the final decision on coverage--not a trial lawyer \nsomewhere, not a court, not a lawsuit, but an independent medical \nspecialist makes the final decision on coverage. That decision is \nbinding; it is binding on the plan.\n  Therefore, we aim at the heart of what I think is broken today; that \nis, if there is some sort of disagreement, if the managed care is \ntaking advantage in some shape or form of an individual patient or \nindividual physician, we have an independent medical expert making the \nfinal decision, not some statute written here in the Congress, not some \ndefinition that we try to give it if we try to define ``medical \nnecessity'' in statute, but somebody who is independent and outside of \nthe system.\n\n  I mention that because when we are talking about scope, all 124 \nmillion people in plans are covered, not a segment. It has nothing to \ndo with ERISA, and non-ERISA, and State-regulated, and Federal-\nregulated. All 124 million Americans are covered by both self-insured \nand fully insured group health plans. All 124 million Americans are in \nthere.\n  Again, when we talk of scope and about the information components of \nour bill, everybody is covered. What I think is much of the heart and \nguts of this bill is the accountability provisions, the accountability \nof managed care, the accountability of coordinated care. Everybody is \ncovered, all 124 million people.\n  Now, in our bill, we also have an important component on genetic \ninformation. As we all know, the human genome project has been \ntremendously successful. We have 2 billion bits of information coming \nout in the next several years and, with that, we raise the potential \nfor insurance companies, or managed care companies, to use that \ninformation to discriminate against a patient. In other words, if a \npatient had a test, and there was an 80-percent chance that a patient \nwould develop cancer, and that information were to get out, an \ninsurance company might say: We are not going to insure you. That is \ninteresting information so we are going to raise your rates.\n  We are not going to let that happen. That provision in our bill--\nwhich is not in the Democrats' bill--basically covers everybody. Scope \nis complete.\n  Now, the one area where scope is targeted in a particular area is \nwhat we call the consumer protections, patient protections. That is the \ngag clause, the access to specialists, the prudent layperson access to \nemergency rooms, and the continuity of care.\n\n[[Page S8234]]\n\n  Mr. President, do we have 1 minute remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). That is correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will yield 30 seconds to my colleague, \nSenator Enzi. Let me notify my colleague that he will have more time \nthan that. Instead of yielding now, I will yield to him in about a \nminute.\n  Mr. President, do we have 30 seconds left on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chairman will be recognized for 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the last area, in terms of focus, where the \nscope narrows down, is that for the specific patient protections we \ncover the 48 million people. Why? Because they are not covered. They \nare not regulated by the States, and that is why we target that \npopulation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes on the \nbill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am not going to take the time right \nnow. I was waiting for my good friend, Dr. Frist, to be able to get \ninto the questions of scope. I was waiting for Dr. Frist to and answer \nwhy the protections included in our legislation--for example, the \nguarantees for emergency room care, the access to specialists who might \nbe necessary to care for a sick child, the formulary protections that \nwere included in our legislation, should not apply to all Americans. I \nwas waiting to ask Dr. Frist why the Republican House of \nRepresentatives bills protect 124 million Americans, while the Senate \nRepublican legislation falls woefully short on those particular \nprotections.\n  I hope in these next few days we come back to what this whole debate \nis about, the commonsense protections that are included in this bill. \nThat is what is important. Are we really going to have the protections \nnecessary to guarantee the prudent layperson's judgment is used in \ndetermining whether emergency room treatment is covered? Are we going \nto have that? Are there going to be real protections, or are we going \nto have in the fine print something that effectively creates a \nloophole? Let's get to addressing that issue.\n  Let's start talking about guaranteeing access to clinical trials, \nwhich are so important to women who have cancer. Clinical trials may be \nthe only option for saving their lives--yet their medical doctor says \nthis is in your best interest but the HMO says no. That is what this \nlegislation is about.\n  The information that the Senator talked about is all very valuable, \nbut what this is about is clinical trials. Their particular proposal \nrequires a study of this particular provision. There isn't a clinical \nresearcher out there, or I daresay a member of the National Cancer \nInstitute at the NIH, who does not support the importance of clinical \ntrials. That is what is at the heart of this. Those are the kinds of \nprotections we are talking about here. Are we going to make sure we \nwill finally have the accountability that is so important to assure \nthat plans are really going to be serious in guaranteeing good quality \nhealth care?\n  Mr. President, on behalf of my colleagues, Senators Graham and \nothers, is it in order for me to send an amendment to the desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Until the time has been used or yielded back \non the first-degree amendment, a second-degree amendment is not in \norder.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains on the first-degree \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 seconds on the Republican side \nand a minute and a half on the Democrat side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield our time.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not sufficient time to suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to Senator Enzi to speak \non the general debate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 10 \nminutes on the general debate time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am sorry that in my absence from the floor \nfor a few minutes there was some exception taken to the comments that I \nmade about the Democrats' proposal for this one-size-fits-all, budget-\nbusting Federal bureaucracy bill.\n  I am pleased now to return to be able to talk a little bit more about \nStates rights and to support the scope of the Republican amendment.\n  Among the handful of principles that are fundamental to any true \nprotection for health care consumers, probably the most important one \nis allowing States to continue in their role as the primary regulator \nof health insurance--not a Federal bureaucracy.\n  This is a principle which has been recognized--and respected--for \nmore than 50 years. In 1945, Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act, \na clear acknowledgment by the federal government that states are indeed \nthe most appropriate regulators of health insurance. It was \nacknowledged that states are better able to understand their consumers' \nneeds and concerns. It was determined that states are more responsive, \nmore effective enforcers of consumer protections. And, as if we need to \nre-learn this lesson yet again, it is usually for the best when we let \neach state respond to the needs of its own consumers.\n  As recently as this year, this matter of fact was reaffirmed by the \nGeneral Accounting Office. GAO testified before the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, saying, ``In brief, we found that many \nstates have responded to managed care consumers' concerns about access \nto health care and information disclosure. However, they often differ \nin their specific approaches, in scope and in form.''\n  Wyoming has its own unique set of health care needs and concerns. \nBut, despite our elevation, we don't need the mandate regarding skin \ncancer that Florida has on the books. My favorite illustration of just \nhow crazy a nationalized system of health care mandates would be comes \nfrom my own time in the Wyoming Legislature. It's about a mandate that \nI voted for and still support today. You see, unlike in Massachusetts \nor California, for example, in Wyoming we have few health care \nproviders; and their numbers virtually dry up as you head out of town. \nSo, we passed an any willing provider law that requires health plans to \ncontract with any provider in Wyoming who's willing to do so. While \nthat idea may sound strange to my ears in any other context, it was the \nright thing to do for Wyoming. But I know it's not the right thing to \ndo for Massachusetts or California, so I wouldn't dream of asking them \nto shoulder that kind of mandate for our sake when we can simply, \nresponsibly, apply it within our borders.\n  An extra, unnecessary layer of mandates, whether they be for certain \nkinds of coverage or for a protection that not everybody needs or \nwants, are so-called ``protections'' we simply shouldn't force people \nto pay for. If we were all paying for skin cancer screenings that only \na few of us need or want, or if we were all paying for any willing \nprovider mandates that only some of us need to assure access, then we'd \nall be one of two things--either over-charged, not-so-savvy consumers, \nor we'd be uninsured.\n  As consumers, we should be downright angry at how some of our elected \nofficials are responding to our concerns about the quality of our \nhealth care and the alarming problem of the uninsured in this country. \nIt is being suggested that all of our local needs will be magically met \nby stomping on the good work of the states through the imposition of an \nexpanded, unenforceable federal bureaucracy. It is being suggested that \nthe American consumer would prefer to dial a 1-800-number to nowhere \nversus calling their State Insurance Commissioner, a real person whom \nthey're likely to see in the grocery store after church on Sundays.\n  As for the uninsured population in this country, carelessly slapping \ndown a massive new bureaucracy on our states does nothing more than \nsquelch their efforts to create innovative and flexible ways to get \nmore people insured. We should be doing everything\n\n[[Page S8235]]\n\nwe can to encourage and support these efforts by states. We certainly \nshouldn't be throwing up roadblocks.\n  And how about enforcement of the minority's proposal?\n  One of the findings of the amendment reads as follows, ``It would be \ninappropriate to set federal health insurance standards that not only \nduplicate the responsibility of the 50 State insurance departments but \nthat also would have to be enforced by the Health Care Financing \nAdministration (HCFA) if a State fails to enact the standard.'' In \nother words, not only is it being suggested that we trample the \ntraditional, overwhelmingly appropriate authority of the states with a \nthree-fold expansion of the federal reach into our nation's health \ncare, they want HCFA to be in charge. HCFA, the agency that leaves \npatients screaming, has doctors quitting Medicare, and, lest we not \nforget, is the agency in charge as the Medicare program plunges towards \nbankruptcy.\n  I could go on at length about the very real dangers of empowering \nHCFA to swoop into the private market with its embarrassing record of \npatient protection and enforcement of quality standards. For example, \nit took ten years for HCFA to implement a 1987 law establishing new \nnursing home standards intended to improve the quality of care for some \nof our most vulnerable patients. According to the General Accounting \nOffice, HCFA missed 25 percent of its implementation deadlines for the \nconsumer and quality improvements to the Medicare program which were \nrequired under the Balanced Budget Act of 1977--10 years.\n  Even more alarming is that HCFA is still using health and safety \nstandards for the treatment of end-stage kidney disease that are 23 \nyears old! Equally astonishing is that HCFA has yet to update its 1985 \nfire safety standards for hospitals. HCFA is a federal bureaucracy at \nits worst, making it the last place to which we want our consumer \nprotection responsibilities to revert.\n  The message is pretty clear to me. Expanding the role of the federal \ngovernment well beyond its lawful authority would be a big mistake. The \nscope of federal authority under the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act (ERISA) with regard to the regulation of health care is \nwell understood. Duplicating, complicating and ultimately unraveling 50 \nyears of state experience and subsequent action makes no sense. For \nthose of my colleagues who think no one is bothered by that, I, and the \n117 million Americans currently protected by State health insurance \nstandards, beg to differ.\n  Our federal responsibility lies with the 48 million consumers who \nfall outside the jurisdiction of state regulation. That's our scope; \nthat's our charge. That's what the states are politely reminding us of \nright now.\n  In March of this year, the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners implored us not to make a mess of what they've done for \nhealth care consumers, saying, ``The states have already adopted \nstatutory and regulatory protections for consumers in fully insured \nplans and have tailored these protections to fit the needs of their \nstates' consumers and health care marketplaces. In addition, many \nstates are supplementing their existing protections during the current \nlegislative session based upon particular circumstances with their own \nstates. We do not want states to be preempted by Congressional or \nadministrative actions.'' I'm stunned that their plea is so easy for \nsome to ignore.\n  I will not undo what's good in Wyoming only to offer my constituents \nwhat's good for Washington. That's my mandate from them.\n  When we balk at the minority's ``one-size-fits-all'' proposal, it \nsounds like such a cliche, but the health care needs and wants in this \ncountry are a living, breathing example of why a singular approach is a \nbad prescription for American consumers. No one should be forced to \nswallow this poison pill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On whose time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. On my time equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield back the \nremainder of our time on the last amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                amendment no. 1234 to amendment no. 1233\n\n (Purpose: To do no harm to Americans' Health Care Coverage and expand \n                    health care coverage in America)\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], for Mr. Santorum \n     for himself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Hutchinson, and Mr. \n     Craig, proposes an amendment numbered 1234 to Amendment No. \n     1233.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word in line three and insert \n     the following:\n\n     SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING THE SCOPE OF A PATIENTS' BILL \n                   OF RIGHTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress agreed that States should have primary \n     responsibility for the regulation of health insurance when it \n     passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945.\n       (2) The States have done a good job in responding to the \n     consumer concerns associated with a rapidly evolving health \n     care delivery system and have already adopted statutory and \n     regulatory protections for consumers in fully-insured health \n     plans and have tailored these protections to fit the needs of \n     their States' consumers and health care marketplaces.\n       (3) 117,000,000 Americans who are enrolled in fully insured \n     plans, governmental plans and individual policies are \n     protected by State patient protections.\n       (4) Forty-two States have already enacted a Patient's Bill \n     of Rights.\n       (5) Forty-seven States already enforce consumer protections \n     regarding gag clauses on doctor-patient communications.\n       (6) Forty States already enforce consumer protections for \n     access to emergency care services.\n       (7) Thirty-one States already enforce consumer protections \n     requiring a prudent layperson standard for emergency care.\n       (8) The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 \n     (referred to in this section as ``ERISA'') expressly \n     prohibits States from regulating the self-funded employer \n     sponsored plans that currently cover 48,000,000 Americans.\n       (9) The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has \n     recommended that Congress should focus its legislative \n     activities on consumers in self-funded ERISA plans, which are \n     under the Federal Government's exclusive jurisdiction, and \n     preserve the State protections that already exist for \n     consumers in fully insured ERISA plans.\n       (10) The National Association of Insurance Commissioners \n     has expressly stated that they do not endorse the concept of \n     a Federal floor with regard to patient protections.\n       (11) Senate bill 6 (106th Congress) would greatly expand \n     the Federal regulatory role over private health insurance.\n       (12) It would be inappropriate to set Federal health \n     insurance standards that not only duplicate the \n     responsibility of the 50 State insurance departments but that \n     also would have to be enforced by the Health Care Financing \n     Administration if a State fails to enact the standard.\n       (13) One size does not fit all, and what may be appropriate \n     for one State may not be necessary in another.\n       (14) It is irresponsible to propose vastly expanding the \n     Federal Government's role in regulating private health \n     insurance at a time when the Health Care Financing \n     Administration is having such a difficult time fulfilling its \n     current and primary responsibilities for Medicare.\n       (15) In August, 1998, the United States Court of Appeals \n     affirmed a district court ruling that the Health Care \n     Financing Administration failed to enforce due process \n     requirements and monitor health maintenance organization \n     denials of medical service to medicare beneficiaries.\n       (16) On April 13, 1999, the General Accounting Office \n     testified that the Health Care Financing Administration \n     failed to use its authority to ensure that medicare \n     beneficiaries were informed of their appeals rights under \n     managed care plans.\n       (17) The General Accounting Office testified at a July, \n     1998 hearing in the Ways and Means Committee of the House of \n     Representatives that the Health Care Financing Administration \n     missed 25 percent of the implementation deadlines for the \n     consumer and quality improvements to the Medicare program \n     under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n\n[[Page S8236]]\n\n       (18) The Health Care Financing Administration should not be \n     given new, broad regulatory authority as they have not \n     adequately met their current responsibilities.\n       (19) The Health Care Financing Administration took 10 years \n     to implement a 1987 law establishing new nursing home \n     standards.\n       (20) The Health Care Financing Administration has yet to \n     update its 1985 fire safety standards for hospitals.\n       (21) The Health Care Financing Administration is utilizing \n     1976 health and safety standards for the treatment of end-\n     stage kidney disease.\n       (22) ERISA preempts State requirements relating to coverage \n     determinations, grievances and appeals, and requirements \n     relating to independent external review.\n       (23) In a recent judicial decision in Texas (Corporate \n     Health Insurance, Inc. V. The Texas Department of Insurance), \n     the lower court held that ERISA does preempt the State's \n     external review law as it relates to group health plans.\n       (b) Deduction for Health Insurance Costs of Self-Employed \n     Individuals Increased.--In General.--Section 162(l)(1) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to special rules for \n     health insurance costs of self-employed individuals) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(1) Allowance of deduction.--In the case of an individual \n     who is an employee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), \n     there shall be allowed as a deduction under this section an \n     amount equal to the amount paid during the taxable year for \n     insurance which constitutes medical care for the taxpayer, \n     the taxpayer's spouse, and dependents.''\n       (c) Clarification of Limitations on Other Coverage.--The \n     first sentence of section 162(l)(2)(B) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to read as follows: \n     ``Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any taxpayer for any \n     calendar month for which the taxpayer participates in any \n     subsidized health plan maintained by any employer (other than \n     an employer described in section 401(c)(4)) of the taxpayer \n     or the spouse of the taxpayer.''\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1998.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, \nlet me outline where we are procedurally. We notified Members under the \nunanimous consent request that we would lay down S. 6, the so-called \nKennedy bill, to mark up. The Democrats offered a substitute to that, \nthe Republican bill that passed out of the Labor Committee, S. 326.\n  The Democrats then offered a first-degree perfecting amendment to the \nsubstitute, to the Republican bill. Their amendment dealt with scope. \nTheir amendment says: We want the Federal Government to have far-\nranging scope to overrule all State plans. All State plans must do such \nand such under their first-degree amendment.\n  I am offering a second-degree amendment on behalf of my colleagues. \nThe amendment would do two things. One, it is the sense of the Senate \nthat the States are the primary providers of health care, for good \nreasons. States have hundreds of mandates. We don't think the Federal \nGovernment should come in and say: We know best; Senator Kennedy knows \nwhat is best; HCFA knows what is best; the Health Care Financing \nAdministration should regulate all health care plans.\n  We think that would be a mistake. We don't think that, many times, \nthe Federal Government knows best. That doesn't mean all State plans \nare administered perfectly. It doesn't mean that they are not without \nproblems. We just don't think HCFA--the Health Care Financing \nAdministration--overruling States, dictating to the States, or this \nCongress, or Senator Kennedy, should be saying: States, here is what we \nknow should be in your plan.\n  We state that in the sense of the Senate.\n  We also state some other things that come not just from Republicans \nbut from the GAO. The Health Care Financing Administration has, in \nparagraph 16, stated:\n\n       On April 13, 1999, the GAO office testified the Health Care \n     Financing Administration failed to use its authority to \n     ensure that Medicare beneficiaries were informed of their \n     appeals rights under managed care plans.\n\n  HCFA failed, according to the GAO. Yet Senator Kennedy's bill says: \nWe want to give HCFA more power.\n  Section 17 says the GAO testified in a July 1998 hearing in the Ways \nand Means Committee, House of Representatives, that the Health Care \nFinancing Administration missed 25 percent of the implementation \ndeadlines for consumer and quality improvements to the Medicare Program \nunder the Balanced Budget Amendment of 1997.\n  Senator Collins alluded to that earlier.\n  Section 18 states the Health Care Financing Administration should not \nbe given new, broad authority as they have not adequately met their \ncurrent responsibilities.\n  I could go on.\n  Section 1 of this amendment states the States should maintain primary \nregulatory authority over health care.\n  Section 2 states that self-employed individuals should be able to \ndeduct 100 percent of their health care premiums.\n  It is ironic that when we talk about health care we have such \ninadequate, inequitable treatment under the present Tax Code. \nCorporations deduct 100 percent of their health care costs; self-\nemployed individuals deduct 45 percent. I personally am offended by \nthat provision. I used to be self-employed, and I used to run a \ncorporation. I wanted health care for my family in both circumstances. \nWhen I was self-employed, you could deduct almost nothing. Any person \nself-employed today can deduct 45 percent. Under the present Tax Code, \nin another 8 years they finally get to deduct 100 percent. That is a \nmistake. It needs to be remedied. We remedy it in this amendment. We \nprovide 100 percent deductibility, beginning December 31, 1998--it \nwould be effective immediately--100 percent deductibility for the self-\nemployed.\n  I want my colleagues to understand that under this provision we are \ncorrecting the fact that the self-employed can only deduct 45 percent \nof their health care costs. We are expanding access. We are making it \npossible for more people to buy health insurance. I hope we will have \nstrong bipartisan support for this provision.\n  This amendment is a second-degree amendment to the underlying \namendment offered by Senator Kennedy and Senator Daschle that tries to \nexpand the scope that says the Federal Government knows best. We say \nno, the States should be the primary regulator over health insurance, \nand self-employed individuals should be entitled to deduct 100 percent \nof their health care premium.\n  I yield to my colleague from Arkansas such time as he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the \nsecond-degree amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma, the sense of the \nSenate regarding the State being the primary regulator of health \ninsurance plans, as well as the provision supporting 100 percent \ndeductibility for the self-employed.\n  We talk about scope. We talk about increasing the number of people in \nthis country who have health insurance. This is one of the most \nimportant steps we could possibly take.\n  Over the next 3 days, the Senate will debate legislation that will \nimpact the lives of every American in terms of health care benefits \nthey receive. The Kennedy bill that we will talk a lot about in the \nnext few days, while called the Patients' Bill of Rights, is certainly \nnot as simple as it sounds. It involves decreased access; it involves \nhigher costs; and it involves the quality of our Nation's health care.\n  In 1997, the percentage of uninsured individuals under the age of 65 \nin my home State of Arkansas was 28.2 percent. Arkansas ranks the \nlowest in the country in terms of the percentage of individuals covered \nby private insurance and is second to dead last in terms of the \npercentage of workers covered by employment-based health insurance.\n  An even more alarming figure is that Arkansas has the highest rate of \nuninsured children in the Nation. I applaud the efforts of our Governor \nin Arkansas and the State legislature in trying to change that, but \nstill it is a very alarming figure.\n  Any legislation this body passes will have a direct impact on \nArkansas workers and families. The bill introduced by Senator Kennedy \nand his colleagues would increase premiums by as much as 6.1 percent \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office. If we pass the Kennedy \nbill and were it signed into law, over 1.8 million people would lose \ntheir health insurance coverage.\n  We see heartrending portrayals of those who have been denied care \nunder managed care plans, and we ought to be concerned about that. That \nis why we have a bill that is going to provide protections for 48 \nmillion Americans\n\n[[Page S8237]]\n\nunder self-insured ERISA plans. But as Senator Frist from Tennessee \nwell pointed out, let's not forget the millions, over 40 million \nAmericans, who are without any health insurance at all and whose \nnumbers are going up by the day.\n  The Kennedy bill, by increasing premiums over 6 percent, will result \nin over 1 million, nearly 2 million more Americans being added to the \nranks of the uninsured. Let's not forget those. Those are the ones who \nare most vulnerable. If we could only put up their portraits, \nportrayals of those millions of Americans who, day in and day out, are \nliving without the protection that most Americans take for granted in \ntheir health insurance plans, I think we would see the Kennedy bill, \nthe so-called Bill of Rights, in a different light altogether.\n  If we pass the Kennedy bill, 1.8 million people will lose health \ninsurance coverage they now have. That is demonstrated by a Lewin study \ncommissioned by the AFL-CIO which shows that for every 1 percent \nincrease in premiums an additional 300,000 people will become \nuninsured.\n  My colleague, Senator Kennedy, during the markup of the Republicans' \nPatients' Bill of Rights Plus Act, stated that this premium increase \nwould be spread out over several years; therefore somehow that made it \nacceptable. I suspect that the 6-plus percent increase in premiums \nbeing spread out over several years and the additional 1.8 million \npeople added to the ranks of the uninsured which occurs over several \nyears is of little comfort to those who will lose their insurance as a \nresult of this bill. No matter how you slice it, the total number of \npeople impacted, the 1.8 million people impacted, remains the same. \nThat is simply unacceptable.\n  Last year, 98 Members of the Senate voted for an amendment expressing \ntheir belief that Congress should not increase the number of uninsured. \nClearly, the Kennedy health care bill violates this statement of \nbelief. The uninsured population in the United States grew from 32 \nmillion to, most recently, 43 million in 1997. It is certain the \nKennedy legislation will only make this growing problem even worse.\n  The result of passing the Kennedy health care bill is more hard-\nworking Arkansas families, more American families will go without \nhealth care insurance. The Kennedy bill gives quality health care only \nto those who can afford it. On average, the Kennedy bill would cost \nemployees an additional $183 per year according to the Congressional \nBudget Office, and the cost for families under the Kennedy bill is \nestimated to be an additional $275 per year. Whether it is $183 or $275 \nper year, the Kennedy bill places a huge additional expense on American \nfamilies which many simply cannot afford. What the Democrats give with \none hand, they take away with the other. How can you say you are \nprotecting people when you are taking their insurance away from them?\n  By contrast, the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act, I \nbelieve, is both rational and responsible. It protects those who are \nnot covered by State regulations. It ensures that health insurance \npremiums will not rise more than a fraction of a percent according to \nCBO. It also provides important tax incentives to increase access to \nhealth insurance for the current uninsured population, including the \n100 percent deductibility of health insurance premiums for the self-\nemployed and the expansion of medical savings accounts.\n  There are few more effective things we could do in the area of \npatients' rights to expand access than to include the self-employed and \ngive them that 100-percent deductibility that they so deserve. \nAccording to one recent poll by Public Opinion Strategies, 82 percent \nof the public want Congress to make health care more affordable. The \nRepublican Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act responds to that need and \nthat overwhelming desire of the American people.\n  Does the Kennedy bill do anything for the 43 million uninsured \nAmericans in this country? The answer to that is very simple, it is \nvery plain, and I think it is absolutely undisputed. The Kennedy bill \ndoes nothing to assist 43 million Americans who do not currently have \nhealth insurance get that insurance they so desperately need. It does \nnothing. So while we hear from bleeding hearts, while we hear emotional \nstories, I ask my colleagues to remember, I ask the American people to \nremember, the 43 million who currently do not have insurance need to \nhave it more accessible. The Republican bill does that while providing \ngreatly enhanced protections for the 43 million Americans who are in \nself-insured plans under ERISA. Not only does the Kennedy bill increase \ncost and decrease access, it creates a whole new system of Government-\nrun health care. The Kennedy bill would create 359 new Federal \nmandates, 59 new sets of Federal regulations, and would require 3,828 \nnew Federal bureaucrats to enforce the legislation at a cost to \ntaxpayers of $155 million per year. The question begs to be asked: Who \nwill benefit from this new bureaucracy and maze of Government \nregulation? Patients? Or the bureaucrats? I think we know the answer.\n\n  It is illustrated by a chart we have already seen today. The bottom \nof this chart, a summary of the effects of the Kennedy bill, are all of \nthe new mandates that would be imposed as a result of the Kennedy \nlegislation. Flowing from these mandates are the arrows and all of the \nvarious bureaucratic agencies required to enforce the Kennedy health \ncare bill.\n  It is simply a one-size-fits-all approach to regulating health care \nin this country. It disregards the good work that has already been done \nby the States in this area, as opposed to what the Republican bill \ndoes, building upon the good works the States have already done in \npatient protections.\n  Mr. President, 42 States have already enacted a Patients' Bill of \nRights; 47 States already enforce consumer protections regarding gag \nclauses on doctor-patient communications; 40 States already enforce \nconsumer protections for access to emergency care services; 50 States, \nevery State already has requirements for grievance procedures; and 36 \nStates already require direct access to an OB/GYN.\n  The Kennedy bill imposes a blanket of heavy-handed Federal mandates \non States and throws away the States' hard work to tailor patient \nprotections for their populations' specific needs. One size does not \nfit all. What may be appropriate for California may not be appropriate \nfor a rural State such as Arkansas.\n  When the Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945, it agreed \nthat States should have primary responsibility for the regulation of \ninsurance. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has also \nspoken on this issue. We have heard about this on the floor of the \nSenate today. In a March 16, 1999, letter to members of the Health and \nEducation Committee, the commissioners stated their concern. They said:\n\n       It is our belief that states should and will continue the \n     efforts to develop creative, flexible, market-sensitive \n     protections for health consumers in fully insured plans, and \n     Congress should focus attention on those consumers who have \n     no protections in self-funded ERISA plans.\n\n  That is precisely what the Republican bill does. Congress needs to \nact to protect the 48 million Americans covered by self-insured ERISA \nplans. It should not override the States in the area that they have \nprimary responsibility.\n  My colleague, Mr. Kennedy, says the Republican bill leaves millions \nof Americans without any protection. That is false. If you are not \ncovered by an ERISA self-insured plan, you fall under the protections \nenacted by your State legislature, a group in which most Americans have \ngreater confidence, I daresay, than in their Federal officials hundreds \nof miles away. This is why the Republican bill applies patient \nprotections to the 48 million Americans who currently do not have any \nprotections. It is sound policy and it makes good sense.\n  The Republican bill also creates new rights for millions more \nAmericans. For instance, all 124 million Americans in employer-\nsponsored health plans will have an improved internal appeals process \navailable to them as well as a new, independent, external review \nprocess. These 124 million Americans will also be entitled to clear and \ncomplete information about their health plan, about what their health \nplan does\n\n[[Page S8238]]\n\nand what it does not cover, about copayments, and about other plan \nprocedures and policies. Our bill also improves existing Federal law on \ninsurance underwriting with regard to preexisting conditions by \nensuring that all 140 million Americans' group and individual plans \nwill not be discriminated against by health insurers on the basis of \npredicted genetic information. Ironically, Senator Kennedy's bill \nincludes several provisions that were specifically rejected by the \nPresident's Advisory Commission on health care quality.\n\n  For example, State-run ombudsman programs were rejected by the \nCommission. Yet they are included in the Kennedy bill. This is the \nPresident's Advisory Commission on health care quality.\n  The Kennedy bill also includes 12 other Federal mandates that were \nnot specifically recommended by the President's Advisory Commission.\n  In its report, the Commission states that it sought to ``balance the \nneed for stronger consumer rights with the need to keep coverage \naffordable.''\n  That is the balance we have sought to maintain in our Republican \nbill. It is rejected by the Democrats in the Kennedy bill; it is \nembodied in the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act.\n  The bottom line is that cost does matter because cost is directly \nrelated to access and the number of uninsured in our country. If cost \nwas not such a factor, why have the Democrats tried to reduce CBO's \nscoring of their own bill? It is a factor. It is a big factor. It is an \nimportant factor because it affects who can buy insurance and how many \nmillions of Americans are going to go without insurance protection.\n  Guess how the Democrats thought about trying to reduce that CBO \nscoring. They sought to reduce the CBO scoring by taking away legal \nremedies currently available to those in ERISA health plans.\n  A Patients' Bill of Rights should not be about taking away existing \nrights. The fact of the matter is, the Kennedy bill would put health \ncare out of reach for close to 2 million Americans. It is not in this \ncountry's best interest to pass the kind of legislation that will make \ninsurance less affordable and less accessible to those who need it \nmost.\n  I thank the Chair, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to address the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I yield the \nSenator 3 minutes on the amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the amendment proposed in the second-\ndegree amendment by the Republican side states a principle which is \nuniversally popular in the Senate. It is this: If you are a self-\nemployed person buying health insurance, you should be able to deduct \nthe cost of that health insurance from your taxes like other Americans \ndo.\n  I introduced legislation along these lines more than 10 years ago in \nthe House. I introduced it in the Senate with Senator Bond of Missouri \nand Senator Collins of Maine. It is bipartisan. It is universal. It \nwill easily pass. And it is a diversion from the debate. It is a \ndiversion.\n  The Republicans want to talk about access to health insurance, which \nis important; the Democrats believe it is equally important to talk \nabout the quality of the health insurance that you are buying.\n  It is ironic as well that the Republicans offer this amendment so \nthat the self-employed people in America can buy insurance. When I take \na look at their underlying bill, which you might find surprising, it \nsays those same people who will now be able to buy insurance will enjoy \nnone of the protections of the Republican bill. On the one hand they \nsay: Buy the insurance. But on the other hand they say: We can't \nguarantee that it is worth buying.\n  The Democratic approach is consistent: Help families buy insurance, \nmake sure the insurance policy is worth owning, make sure that in time \nof family crisis you are protected.\n  The Republican approach is: We will help you buy it, but we cannot \ntell you whether it is worth buying or not.\n  They argue it is a matter of States rights. This is such a weak \nargument when you consider the 200 different organizations--the \nAmerican Nurses Association, the American Medical Association, all of \nthe different groups for medical professionals--have said that State \nregulation is not enough; we do not have a consistent national standard \nof protection for American families. That is what the Democratic side \nis offering: a consistent national standard.\n  It bothers those on the Republican side. They do not want to see this \nconsistency. They think people who live in Oklahoma deserve perhaps \nmore rights than those who live in Maine. They think people who live in \nNevada should be treated differently than people in Illinois. I \ndisagree. Wherever you live in America, if you buy health insurance, \nyou ought to know that it protects your family. To leave it to State \nlegislatures and to leave over 113 million Americans behind, as the \nRepublicans have done with their approach, is not fair.\n  This second-degree amendment, which allows self-employed people like \nfarmers and businesspeople to buy health insurance, is so universally \npopular we can accept it with a voice vote. But let it not divert us \nfrom our mission at hand: to make sure the insurance that every \nAmerican buys is worth owning.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I was a little disappointed when I heard \nmy colleague say the Republican amendment is a diversion. The \nRepublican amendment is an effort to increase access to quality health \ncare for the self-employed. We have 43 million Americans who are \nuninsured today. We want to help them get insurance.\n  A large number of the people who are uninsured are self-employed. \nThey are in small businesses. Small businesspeople who are just \nstarting their businesses sometimes have a hard time getting quality \nfringe benefit packages. Almost all of the larger corporations have \nhealth insurance and pension benefits. But most job growth is in small \nbusinesses, and a lot of small businesses have not had time yet to \ndevelop and expand a fringe benefit program, including access to \nquality health care.\n  When they find out they can deduct 100 percent of their wages but \nthey cannot deduct but 45 percent of their health insurance cost, what \ndo you think most self-employed people are going to do? They might tell \ntheir employees: I will just give you the money and you buy the \ninsurance yourself; I cannot deduct it so why spend it? I want to spend \nmy money in my business operations. Everything I spend should be \ndeductible.\n  It is not. We are trying to remedy that.\n  I am glad my colleague from Illinois says we have bipartisan support. \nI know we passed a provision a year or two ago that phased it in \ngradually, but that is too long. We want to make it effective now. We \nwant to make it where the self-employed get to deduct 100 percent of \ntheir health care costs just like corporations. Why not do it now? That \nis not a diversion.\n  When we promote our bill, we say Patients' Bill of Rights Plus. What \nis the plus? We want to increase access. That is in stark contrast to \nthe Kennedy bill which will decrease access. Their bill dramatically \nincreases health care costs, and when you increase health care costs, \nyou are going to be driving a lot of people into the ranks of the \nuninsured. We do not want to do that. That is not a diversion. It just \nhappens to be a fact.\n  We want to make health insurance more affordable. The people who \ncannot afford it, in many cases, are self-employed, and they get the \nshort end of the stick in the Tax Code. They are not treated fairly in \nthe Tax Code. We are trying to remedy that. That is what we have in our \namendment.\n  Also, we have in our amendment a finding of the Senate that, frankly, \nHCFA does not do a very good job in many cases. Despite what our \ncolleagues say--we want all these people to have assurances and we want \nthem to have all these guarantees. They are basically saying: We want \nthe Health Care Financing Administration of the Federal Government to \nregulate insurance--we are saying no, that really\n\n[[Page S8239]]\n\nshould not be the prerogative of the Federal Government to duplicate, \noverride, overrule State regulation of insurance plans.\n  There is a difference. I am amazed that people keep making the \ncomment: The Republican plan leaves all these people unprotected, as if \nthe States are not doing anything. Every State has a regulatory regimen \nset up to regulate health insurance under their plans, and our \ncolleagues evidently on Senator Kennedy's side seem to think whatever \nthe States are doing is not good enough; we know better, in spite of \nthe fact, if you look at HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act that Congress passed in 1996, there are five States \nthat are not complying. HCFA is supposed to be regulating those plans, \nand they are not. They are not complying with the law that we passed 3 \nyears ago. The State of Massachusetts is one of the States that is not \ncomplying. Maybe I have too much faith in the States, but I cannot help \nbut think the State of Massachusetts is still interested in making sure \nemployees have portability and continuity of coverage, so I am not \nreally faulting the State. I just find it ironic that some people seem \nto think: Whatever the States are doing, it's not good enough. We know \nbetter. And HCFA, this grand almighty bureaucracy of the Federal \nGovernment, can do better than the States. I disagree with that.\n\n  So the second-degree amendment that we have states two things: One, \nfindings that the primary regulatory authority of insurance should be \ndone and handled by the States, not the Federal Government; and, two, \nwe should help the self-insured be able to have equitable tax treatment \ncomparable to corporations; they should be able to deduct 100 percent \nof their health care costs.\n  I just hope that our colleagues, if they agree in the primacy of \nStates, if they believe in State regulation, if they believe in the \n10th amendment to the Constitution that says all other rights and \npowers are reserved to the States and to the people, respectively, will \nadopt this amendment. I hope we will when we vote on this. For the \ninformation of our colleagues, I expect the vote will occur sometime \ntomorrow, most likely after the policy lunches.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded for purposes of a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I had thought that the Senator from \nOklahoma was yielding back the remainder of the time on that amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. No.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Therefore, I was going to offer the next in order second-\ndegree amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. To clarify, I did not yield back the remainder of the \ntime. I yielded the floor, just for the information of my colleagues.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. How much time is \nremaining on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrat side controls 47 minutes; the \nRepublican side controls 26 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Is the time running during the quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume \non the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for such \ntime as she may consume.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I regret that my colleague and friend \nfrom Illinois, Senator Durbin, has temporarily left the floor because I \nwanted him to hear my comments.\n  I want to start by commending the Senator from Illinois who has, \nindeed, been a leader in the effort to provide 100 percent tax-\ndeductibility for health insurance purchased by self-employed \nindividuals. I have been proud to be a cosponsor of the legislation he \nhas introduced, as well as an identical bill introduced by Senator \nBond, the chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee.\n  This issue has been an important one to me. I believe it will help \nmany of our small business men and women throughout this Nation, \nincluding the 82,000 Mainers who are self-employed. They include, as \nyou might suspect, many of our farmers, our fishermen, our lobstermen, \nour hairdressers, our electricians, our plumbers, our small shop \nowners. They are the ones who find it very difficult to afford the \ncosts of health insurance.\n  Indeed, the part of Maine's population that has the most difficulty \nin affording health insurance is our self-employed individuals. By \nproviding 100 percent deductibility for health insurance, we can assist \nthese individuals in affording health insurance coverage. We thus will \nbe taking a very important step toward reducing the number, the growing \nnumber, of uninsured Americans.\n  But this provision is important for another reason. It is important \nas a matter of equity. Right now a multinational corporation can deduct \n100 percent of the cost of health insurance premiums for its employees, \nand yet the Tax Code discriminates against self-employed individuals. \nIt allows self-employed individuals to deduct only 45 percent of the \ncost of the health insurance they purchase. That is simply unfair. So \nthis corrects an inequity in our Tax Code, and it is important in terms \nof expanding access to health insurance.\n  I disagree with those on the other side of the aisle who contend, \nhowever, that somehow this very important provision does not belong on \nthis bill, that it is a diversion of some sort. That statement tells me \nthat my friends on the other side of the aisle still do not understand \nthe crux of this debate. The crux of this debate is, are we going to \npass legislation which will drive up the cost of health insurance to \nthe point where we jeopardize coverage for 1.8 million Americans? That \nis the crux of this debate.\n  This debate is not only about holding HMOs accountable for the care \nthat they promise; it is not only about improving the quality of care; \nit is not only about ensuring that people who are denied care that they \nneed have the remedies to give them that care to ensure that care is \nprovided before harm is done, but also this debate is about ensuring \naccess to health insurance.\n  The single most important determining factor about whether or not \npeople have health insurance is its cost. We face a growing problem \nwith uninsured Americans in this country. It has gone to a record high \n43 million Americans who lack health insurance. That is a terrible \nsituation.\n  We should not be passing any legislation that is going to exacerbate \nthat problem. Yet that is exactly what the Kennedy bill would do, by \ndriving up the cost of health insurance to the point where it would \njeopardize coverage for 1.8 million Americans. That is more than the \npopulation of the entire State of Maine. The last thing we need to do \nis to increase the pressure to drive up the cost and jeopardize \ninsurance for working Americans.\n  The second part of Senator Nickles' amendment is also important. It \naffirms the Federal policy that was passed back in the 1940s when \nCongress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act giving the States primary \nresponsibility for insurance regulation. Some on this side of the aisle \napparently believe that we need a debate on the McCarran-Ferguson Act. \nFine. Let's have a debate on that. But we should recognize that until \nwe repeal or change the McCarran-Ferguson Act, it is the policy of this \ncountry and the law of the land that the States, not the Federal \nGovernment, have the primary responsibility for the regulation of \ninsurance. It is a system that has worked well for more than 50 years.\n  As someone who was responsible for the Bureau of Insurance in the \nState of\n\n[[Page S8240]]\n\nMaine for 5 years, I know firsthand what a good job our State \nregulators do and how seriously they take their responsibility of \nprotecting consumers. Indeed, in my capacity as commissioner of the \nDepartment of Professional and Financial Regulation, I worked hard to \nstrengthen the consumer division of our Bureau of Insurance.  We took \nenforcement actions against insurance companies that did not live up to \nthe letter and the spirit of Maine's law. I can tell you that I know \nthe people of Maine would much rather make a phone call to Augusta to \nthe Bureau of Insurance and to ask for help--it has actually moved to \nGardiner now--but to ask for help from the Bureau of Insurance's \nConsumer Division than to try to figure out the maze of Federal \nregulation and call the ERISA office in Boston for assistance. I don't \nthink that is serving our consumers well.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Nickles' amendment. It is an \nimportant amendment that will help expand access to health care while \nreaffirming the wisdom of the policy adopted more than 50 years ago \nwhen the Federal Government gave responsibility to the States to be the \nprimary regulator of insurance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the \ntime on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two members \nof my staff, Mr. Matt Barry and Ms. Melanie Nathanson, be granted the \nprivilege of the floor for the balance of consideration of this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, will the Senator mind repeating the \nrequest?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was floor privileges.\n  Mr. NICKLES. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides on \nthe amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican side holds 19 minutes, and the \nDemocrat side controls 47 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield 5 minutes to our colleague from Alabama, Senator \nSessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 5 \nminutes on the amendment.\n   Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate very much the outstanding remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine on her experiences dealing with \ninsurance issues in that State.\n  I served as attorney general of the State of Alabama until a little \nover 2 years ago. I worked with the State insurance commissioner on a \nnumber of important issues. Each State in our Nation has an insurance \ncommissioner. They have for many years worked to develop specific \nregulations of insurance plans within their own States.\n  The reason we are here--and, in my opinion, it is for a legitimate \nreason --is because under the Federal law known as ERISA, certain state \npolicies are preempted. That is what this Congress should concern \nitself with: the kind of health care plans that cannot be regulated by \nthe States. States have set up policies regarding health care. They \nhave passed regulations. The insurance departments have promulgated \ntheir own regulations to address managed care concerns in their own \nstates, and I think it is healthy that that happens.\n  Therefore, it is appropriate that we in Congress focus only on the \npolicies and insurance programs that fall under the federal law ERISA.\n  Many have attempted to create an aura of fear by saying that health \ncare in America is failing and in great danger, and that people can't \ncount on their health care anymore. That is not what the people of \nAmerica are saying. I am not hearing them say that to me when I travel \nmy State. When I have town hall meetings, they are not lining up and \ncomplaining about that issue. They are, in most instances, well \nsatisfied. We can, and we will, help and improve health care in certain \nareas, but I am just not hearing really outrageous cries of widespread \nabuse.\n  In fact, in March of this year, March 14 to be exact, the Mobile \nPress Register-University of South Alabama reported a poll of \nAlabamians concerning their views of health care. This is the question \nthat was asked:\n\n       I would like to ask you a few questions about health care. \n     Which of the following statements best describes your \n     family's health insurance coverage?\n\n  A number of potential answers was listed. The one that received the \nhighest vote: We have sufficient health insurance coverage. Sixty-nine \npercent of the people in Alabama said: We have sufficient health \ninsurance coverage for our family.\n  The second answer, which was the second highest vote getter at 7 \npercent, was: We probably have more coverage than we need: We have \ninsurance, but we don't have sufficient coverage: 16 percent. We do not \nhave health insurance at all: 6 percent.\n  Therefore, I suggest that what we in Congress need to do is recognize \nthe fact that we have a good health care system in the United States. \nThe first thing we should want to do is do no harm and not destroy it. \nWhen you have 76 percent of the people satisfied with their health \ncare, then you have to conclude the system is doing well. In fact, we \nhave the greatest health care system in the world.\n  I will make one more point. I know the Senator from Missouri would \nlike to make some comments, and I would like to yield the floor to him.\n  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has testified \nbefore our Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and on \nMarch 16, 1999, they sent a letter stating the official position of \ntheir association on the matter as to whether or not the federal \ngovernment ought to have control over every plan in America.\n  They said this:\n\n       It is our belief that states should and will continue \n     efforts to develop creative, flexible, market-sensitive \n     protections for health consumers in fully-insured \n     plans. Those are the plans that the States can regulate \n     and do regulate data.\n       Congress should focus attention on those consumers who have \n     no protections under the self-funded ERISA plans.\n\n  Now, that is exactly what this bill does. It focuses on those plans.\n  My time is up, and I yield the floor. I believe the legislation as \nproposed is precisely the course we should take.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Missouri, who \nhas been one of the principal sponsors of deductibility for the self-\nemployed in the Senate. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority side controls 14 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the Senator 13 minutes and 30 seconds, reserving \n30 seconds for myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 13 \nminutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank my \ndistinguished colleague from Oklahoma. In a gesture of goodwill, I ask \nthat the Chair notify me when 13 minutes is up because I would like to \nhear a full minute from the Senator from Oklahoma. I very much \nappreciate the opportunity to discuss the amendment that the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma has addressed and sent to the floor.\n  First, let me put into context some of my views about the competing \nPatients' Bill of Rights. I happen to be very proud to be a supporter \nof the majority or Republican Patients' Bill of Rights Plus. I am proud \nto be one of 50 Senators who cosponsored the majority bill, and I will \nbe proud to vote for the legislation.\n  As with anything we do up here, there are probably some ways you \ncould say it is not perfect. But I believe it is the best approach we \nhave before us that places reasonable controls on managed care \ncompanies, while also helping rather than hurting access and coverage \nproblems.\n  That is something that is extremely important to many Americans--\nhaving access and getting the coverage they need.\n  When we look at the competing proposals, I think it is good to drop \nback to the first rule of medicine, which is do no harm. I am stunned \nthat with the bill offered on the other side, described as helping \npatients, we are faced with the fact, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office and others, that\n\n[[Page S8241]]\n\nover a million people who have health insurance today probably can't \nafford it tomorrow, and that thousands more who were thinking they \nwould be able to get insurance would see that opportunity snatched away \nif their bill, which would drive up costs, were to pass.\n  I wonder how anyone can support such a backwards proposition that we \nare willing to price people out of health care in the name of helping \nthem. That is a fatal flaw, as I see it, in the Kennedy plan: too much \ncost; too little gain.\n  In contrast, our Patients' Bill of Rights Plus contains basic, \nreasonable, commonsense patient protections; access to emergency room \ncare for which their health plan will pay. Americans shouldn't have to \nworry that their insurance won't pay for necessary emergency room care. \nOur bill guarantees that patients have information on treatment \noptions. Doctors and patients need to be able to discuss openly all \npossible treatment options without gag rules.\n  Our bill provides access to a quick, independent, expert appeals \nprocess. Patients should get the care they need when they need it. \nThere has been a lot of talk on the other side about how we need to \nopen up the courts for more costly litigation. Well, frankly, we don't \nwant to see widows or orphans having to sue because their breadwinner \ndid not get the health care he or she needed. We want to make sure they \nget that care promptly, efficiently, and effectively.\n  I am very pleased that the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus contains \nimportant pediatric and maternal health care protections, which I \nintroduced earlier this year in what we call the Healthy Kids 2000 \nlegislation, which had broad support from major health care supporters, \nincluding children's hospitals and pediatricians, who are concerned \nabout care for children.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus gives the right for a child to go \nsee a pediatrician without going through a gatekeeper. It gives the \nright for a child to see a specialist with pediatric expertise, \nincluding going to children's hospitals when necessary. It gives the \nright to a woman to have direct access to an obstetrician or \ngynecologist without having to go through some gatekeeper. It gives the \nright to have a pediatric expert review a child's case when appealing \nan HMO decision. In other words, somebody who treats kids will be the \none who will oversee the decision and be able to participate in the \nexternal review as to whether the kind of care the HMO proposes for a \nchild is appropriate for that child.\n  But just as important as what is in our Republican bill, the \nPatients' Bill of Rights Plus, is what isn't in it. It doesn't contain \nthe same costly bureaucratic provisions the Democratic bill has. One \nwould have thought they would have learned something when we had the \nhealth care debates of 1993 and 1994, the Clinton plan, which had the \nFederal Government and its bureaucracy controlling health care. When \npeople took a look at that dog and found out how mangy it was, it \nfailed, not because the Republicans beat it, but because nobody was \nwilling to get out and support it--and with good reason. The more \npeople looked at it, the worse it looked.\n  Well, the Congressional Budget Office has given estimates that the \nDemocratic bill could raise health care premiums anywhere from 5 to 6 \npercent, depending on which version of the bill we are discussing. I \nhave heard people on talk shows saying that is one Big Mac a month. \nFive percent of basic family health insurance at $3,600 a year--my math \nsuggests that is a whole lot more than a Big Mac a month. We are \ntalking in the neighborhood of $180 a year.\n  CBO and others have told us that for every 1 percent increase in \ncosts, a couple hundred thousand people will lose health care \ninsurance. Under this bill, that means, under the Democratic version, \nover a million Americans or more could lose their health care coverage.\n  I speak as chairman of the Committee on Small Business because cost \nincreases for small businesses and small business employees is a No. 1 \nconcern. We have listened to small businesses, and we have heard from \nsmall businesses. They say: Please don't do us any more favors. Don't \nburden us with more costly health care plans. Small businesses are \nfighting to try to get economical, caring, compassionate, effective \nhealth care for their employees and for the business owners themselves. \nSmall business owners are particularly sensitive to the issue of cost. \nSmall businesses--the owners and their families, the employees and \ntheir families--would be the ones who would pay for an extravagant \nbill.\n\n  Nearly 40 years ago, President Kennedy told the Nation that a rising \ntide would lift all boats. Unfortunately, the bill before us turns that \nconcept on its head, and perhaps a new doctrine is that rising costs \nwill sink health care hopes. To me, that is a major concern.\n  As an alternative to this heavyhanded bureaucratic approach, the \nPatients' Bill of Rights Plus, offered by the Republicans, tries to \nincrease access and coverage. Now, it is extraordinary and \nunconscionable that the bill we are debating, the Democratic bill, \ndoesn't do anything to improve access to health care. It seems that the \nonly thing our colleagues on the other side of the aisle can think of \nto improve access is to have Government-run care, like the Clinton \nhealth care plan of 1993 and 1994. Since that fell on its face a few \nyears ago, they seem not to have had any good ideas about how to get \nmore people health insurance.\n  We need to increase access. Perhaps the most important part of our \nbill is the acceleration of the full deduction of insurance costs for \nthe self-employed. I am very pleased that our distinguished majority \nwhip, the Senator from Oklahoma, has introduced an amendment that \nachieves, for this year, full deductibility of health care costs. That \nmeans there is hope that the health care premiums paid this year will \nbe fully deductible.\n  Now, my colleagues, the Senator from Maine and the Senator from \nAlabama, have already discussed the importance of keeping insurance \nregulation at the State level. As a former Governor, I can tell you \nthat government insurance regulation, run at the State level, is \nreadily accessible, it is more professional, and it is more responsive \nto the needs of the citizens. That is why I agree with the portion of \nthe amendment introduced by Senator Nickles which talks about moving \naway from Federal Government takeover of health care regulation.\n  But I am particularly pleased that Senator Nickles has introduced \nfull deductibility based on the Self-Employed Health Insurance Fairness \nAct of 1999, which I introduced on February 3 of this year. I am very \nproud to have 30 bipartisan cosponsors. We are making progress when we \nwork on a bipartisan basis to assure full deductibility of health care \ncosts for the self-employed. I am proud to work with my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  According to the Employment Benefit Research Institute's estimates of \nthe March 1998 current population survey, there are 21.3 million \nAmericans in families headed by a self-employed entrepreneur. Nearly a \nquarter--23.9 percent--of them have no health insurance. That is 5.1 \nmillion uninsured Americans. Even more troubling, that means that the \n21.1 percent of the children in self-employed American families are \nuninsured; 1.3 million children have no coverage for annual checkups, \nlet alone any major health care needs.\n  This amendment would address these alarming statistics by providing \nan immediate--I mean right now, in real time--100 percent deductibility \nin order to make health insurance more affordable and accessible to \nhard-working entrepreneurs and their families.\n  Let me add an additional perspective on the importance of this \namendment. Today, one of the fastest growing segments of the small \nbusiness community is the woman-owned business. Women are opening \nbusinesses at a very rapid rate. They are the ones with the \nentrepreneurial spirit. They may be operating out of their homes, they \nmay be moving from another full-time job, or they may just have a good \nidea. But women are now seeing an opportunity to start up their own \nbusinesses, and we are very proud of the significant contributions they \nare making to our economy.\n\n  According to statistics from the National Foundation for Women \nBusinessowners, there are now 9.1 million women-owned businesses in the \nUnited States, which compromise almost 38 percent of all U.S. \nbusinesses.\n\n[[Page S8242]]\n\nIn addition, between 1987 and 1999, the number of women-owned firms \nincreased by 103 percent nationwide--more than double. The reasons for \nthis explosive growth are manifold. Topping the list is greater \nflexibility in meeting the demands of family life, and the ability to \nspend more time with children.\n  Even more impressive, the National Foundation for Women Business \nOwners reports that women-owned businesses employ more than 27\\1/2\\ \nmillion people, and that employment rate has increased by 320 percent \nover the past 12 years.\n  Today, while self-employed woman business owners can deduct 60 \npercent of their health care costs thanks to the strides that we made \nin previous years, that is still not on a level playing field with a \nlarge business which can deduct 100 percent. While the self-employed \nare slated to have full deductibility in 2003, what woman business \nowner or her family members can wait 4 more years to get sick?\n\n  By making health-care insurance fully deductible now, the added tax \nsavings will enable many women business owners to cover their health-\ncare needs and those of their children. In addition, it will encourage \nthese women entrepreneurs to provide health insurance for their \nemployees and their families.\n  And we're not talking about a tax break for ``the rich'' when it \ncomes to the health-insurance deduction for the self-employed. Recent \nestimates based on the March 1998 Current Population Survey indicate \nthat 68.7 percent of families headed by a self-employed individual with \nno health insurance earn less than $50,000 per year.\n  These are the people who we are trying to get health coverage. These \nare the people who need the benefit of full deductibility.\n  Coverage of these entrepreneurs and their children through the self-\nemployed health-insurance deduction will enable the private sector to \naddress the health-care needs of these individuals rather an expensive \nand intrusive government program.\n  Currently, S. 343, from which my amendment is derived, has the \nbipartisan support of 30 cosponsors. It also enjoys overwhelming \nsupport of small business organizations including the National \nAssociation for the Self-Employed, the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, the Small Business Legislative Council, the \nNational Small Business United, and the Health Tax Deduction Alliance, \nto name just a few.\n  I have also added a provision to the amendment to correct a disparity \nunder current law that bars a self-employed individual from deducting \nany of her health-insurance costs if she is eligible to participate in \nanother health-insurance plan. This provision unfairly affects \nentrepreneurs who are eligible for, but do not participate in, a \nhealth-insurance plan offered through a second job or through a \nspouse's employer. The bill ends this disparity by clarifying that a \nself-employed person loses the deduction only if she actually \nparticipates in another health-insurance plan.\n  It has long been my goal that the self-employed have immediate 100 \npercent deductibility of health-insurance costs. I have sought every \nopportunity to achieve that goal, and I will keep coming back until we \nget this job done. I commend the Senator from Oklahoma for pushing for \nthis amendment on the bill so that we can have bipartisan, unanimous \nsupport for the effort to ensure that all Americans who are self-\nemployed will have the same kind of benefits in terms of taxes that a \nlarge corporation or its employees do; and that is 100 percent \ndeductibility.\n\n  I am very proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment. I ask all of my \ncolleagues to join in supporting a very forward-looking amendment which \ndeals with some of the significant problems in the underlying bill \noffered by our colleagues on the other side and makes significant \nchanges to assure access to fair and equitable health care insurance \nfor all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bond for cosponsoring \nthis amendment, in addition to Senator Santorum, who is also a \nprincipal sponsor of this amendment, and Senators Hutchinson, Craig, \nand myself who are original sponsors.\n  Mr. President, I inquire of my colleague from Nevada, is he prepared \nto yield the remainder of time on this amendment?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. We are.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, if my colleague from Nevada is yielding \nback the remainder of time on the amendment, we likewise yield the \nremainder of time on the amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nRepublican manager of the bill be allotted an additional 40 minutes on \nthe bill itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, on second thought, I tell my \nfriend, the majority whip, we also want 40 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that both sides \nbe allotted an additional 40 minutes on the underlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?  Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the second-\ndegree amendment proposed by myself and Senator Bond and others be \ntemporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1235 to Amendment No. 1233\n\n      (Purpose: To provide for coverage of emergency medical care)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), for himself, Mr. \n     Reid, Mr. Chafee, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n     Schumer, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Feingold, \n     and Mr. Dorgan, proposes an amendment numbered 1235.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senators listed, I offer \nan amendment relative to emergency care services.\n  This is a particularly critical issue because so many of the \nconflicts between beneficiaries and their health maintenance \norganizations occur in an emergency room setting.\n  When the Senate in 1997 adopted provisions that extended to Medicare \nand Medicaid beneficiaries--the same rights that this amendment will \nnow provide to all Americans--we discussed the fact that 40 percent--40 \npercent--of the conflicts between Medicare beneficiaries and HMOs \noccurred in an emergency room setting.\n  Questions of coverage, type of coverage, and what would happen after \nthe patient was stabilized was the cauldron in which many of the \ndisagreements between HMOs and beneficiaries were fought out.\n  Just as the Medicare and Medicaid provisions which were adopted by \nthe Congress and signed into law by the President have helped to \nrelieve that tension for 70 million Americans, this amendment will \nattempt to do the same for the rest of Americans.\n  This amendment also raises a couple of other important issues.\n  One of those is what I call the ``big monster argument''--that \nanything that we do is going to inevitably lead to an escalation of \ncost and an escalation of Federal regulation and bureaucracy and an \noverwhelming of the patients' ability to get affordable health care.\n  I would like to point out the first sentence of this amendment. The \nfirst sentence is essentially, if the health care plan offers emergency \nservices, then these are the standards that will have to be met.\n\n[[Page S8243]]\n\n  The clear implication of that is that no HMO under this amendment is \nrequired to offer emergency room services. If the HMO wishes to go to \nits beneficiaries and say, Now, look, you are not covered if you go to \nthe emergency room--you understand that--and the fee that you are going \nto pay for your HMO contract is predicated on the fact that emergency \nroom services are not covered, the HMO has the prerogative of so doing. \nIf the HMO gives the appearance that it is offering emergency room \nservices, then it is required to offer credible emergency room services \nthat comport to what the average American thinks they are going to get \nin an emergency room.\n  So the ``big monster argument'' that this is going to have all of \nthese adverse effects is irrelevant as long as the HMO plays by the \nrules. It cannot offer emergency room services at all. But once it \npurports to do so, it can't bait and switch and say, Yes, you thought \nyou were getting comprehensive emergency room coverage, but in fact you \nare getting something much, much less.\n  The second argument is what I call the ``checking off the boxes'' \nargument. We have heard it already. We will say, well, the plan of the \nRepublicans offers an external appeal provision, and the Democratic \nplan offers an external appeal provision. So we check both of them with \nan equally large mark. We have an emergency room provision. You have an \nemergency room provision. Check, check--both get the same large mark.\n  The problem is that it is not just a matter of checking off the \nboxes. It is a matter of seeing what inside the box. What are the \nactual words? What is the detail? Words make a difference. Details \nmatter. We are not talking about semantics or legalisms. We are talking \nabout whether in the final analysis the beneficiary--the American \nfamily--gets the kind of protection that they think they paid for.\n  There will be other colleagues who will discuss important \ndistinctions between the two bills. I want to focus on two of those \ndifferences.\n  I look forward to a debate with my Republican colleagues on these two \ndifferences, whether they are meaningful, and whether they have \nproperly stated what the Republican provisions are. The first of those \ndistinctions is hidden in the Republican bill in language which \neffectively eviscerates the ``prudent layperson standard'' that is at \nthe heart of the emergency care provision.\n\n  What is the prudent layperson standard? This is a standard which is \nnow in the Medicare law and the Medicaid law by action of Congress. It \nessentially says if a prudent layperson--a layperson of normal \nintelligence and knowledge of health and medical matters--thinks \nsymptoms occurring require urgent attention, that prudent layperson can \nthen seek the attention of the most available emergency room, and the \nHMO will be responsible for paying the costs of that emergency room \nservice.\n  How does the Republican bill eviscerate that basic principle, which \nnow protects 70 million Americans on Medicare and Medicaid? The \nRepublican bill allows for the imposition of ``any form of cost-sharing \napplicable to any participant or beneficiary (including copayments, \ndeductibles, and any other [form of] charges . . . if such form of \ncost-sharing is uniformly applied under such plan with respect to \nsimilarly situated beneficiaries.''\n  Now, what does that mean? It means that a patient who goes to a \nhospital that is not part of the network of the HMO will have to pay, \naccording to the HMO's plans, for additional deductibles, coinsurance, \nand other charges, while a person who is in the same position of an \nemergency medical crisis, who goes to the in-network hospital will not \nbe required to pay those additional out-of-network charges.\n  The practical effect of that distinction is to create a strong \neconomic incentive for the prudent layperson who thinks they have \nsymptoms requiring emergency attention. If they understand they could \ngo to the emergency room which is 5 minutes away but which is not part \nof their HMO's network or they could go to the emergency room that is \n30 minutes away and be within the network of the HMO, and that there \nwill be a significant economic differential as to what that choice is, \nthen you have a prudent layperson making a critical decision. Will I go \nto the emergency room that offers the most immediate attention to my \ncondition, or will I go to the emergency room where the cost will be \nless?\n  How do we know this is what was meant in the Republican version of \nthe emergency room provisions in the Patients' Bill of Rights? Because \nthey said it in very clear language in the committee's report of this \nsection, which appears on page 29. I will read from that report:\n\n       The Committee believes that it would be acceptable to have \n     a differential cost-sharing for in-network emergency coverage \n     and out-of-network emergency coverage, so long as such cost-\n     sharing is uniformly applied across a category (i.e. [across \n     all] in-network, out-of-network). . .[beneficiaries and \n     providers.]\n\n  I suggest there goes the prudent layperson definition, or the \nrationale for the prudent layperson definition, right out the window.\n  The Democratic plan provides explicitly that there will be parity \npayment between in-network and out-of-network emergency room services; \nthat is, the prudent layperson would have the right to go to what is \nthe most prudently accessible emergency room to get that service.\n  I suggest what is good for 70 million Medicare and Medicaid \nbeneficiaries should be good for all Americans. Patients should not be \nrequired to call an insurance bureaucrat to see if they can get \nemergency room care approved before they go to the emergency room. They \nshouldn't have to call their HMO before they call 911. That is the very \nthing we are trying to prevent. Patients should be able to seek the \ntreatment wherever it can be provided--inside or outside the network--\nand not be subject to economic compulsion.\n\n  That is one important differential between the Republican and the \nDemocratic bill. That little devil was in the details.\n  Another provision called poststabilization is a crucial component of \nemergency room care. This provision relates to what happens after a \nperson has gone to the emergency room, had that immediate treatment, \nand their condition is now stabilized; what happens next?\n  Let me give an example. A person goes to an emergency room on a \nFriday night with shortness of breath, high fever, pain in the left \nside of their chest. They are diagnosed by the emergency room as having \nnot a heart attack but acute pneumonia. The emergency room treats the \npatient with intravenous antibiotics and oxygen. The emergency \ndepartment then calls the HMO to request one of two things be done: \nthat the plan take responsibility for the patient by having the patient \ntransferred to one of their in-network hospitals, or the plan authorize \nthe admission of the patient to the treating hospital.\n  Unfortunately, this is a Friday night, about 10 or 11 o'clock, and no \none picks up the phone at the other end of the line. The hospital is \nstuck; the party is stuck. The hospital cannot transfer the patient to \nanother facility but it can't get authorization to admit the patient to \nits own facility. As a result, the emergency room does admit the \nindividual for treatment. On Monday, the patient goes home.\n  The health care plan has not authorized the treatment. It now denies \nthe claim, retroactively, after the hospital services have been \nprovided. Under the Republican bill, the patient is responsible for the \nnoncovered hospital bill, potentially for several thousand dollars for \nthat weekend institutionalization.\n  Under our amendment, the nonresponsive HMO would be financially \nresponsible for that bill. Better yet, we see a different scenario. \nUnder our amendment, we see the health plan with a positive incentive \nto coordinate the patient's care with the emergency department. The \npatient was transferred to a network facility, which in turn has saved \nall overall health costs both for the patient and the health plan--a \nwin-win scenario.\n  Let me give an example of this coordination. A parent brings their \nyoung child into an emergency room with a high fever. The emergency \nphysician rules out a life-threatening illness. She brings the fever \nunder control, thereby stabilizing the patient. However, follow-up care \nis necessary to determine the cause of the high fever and the extent \nand nature of the illness. The emergency room calls the\n\n[[Page S8244]]\n\nplan to get the plan to refer the child to a primary care doctor. The \nplan doesn't call back. What is the result? The child is admitted to \nthe hospital overnight, potentially costing the family thousands of \ndollars of unnecessary hospitalization and emotionally traumatizing the \nchild.\n  Under the Republican proposal, the plan gets a double windfall. \nFirst, the plan saves the money of having to staff ``response \ncapability,'' particularly on the weekend, and by not having personnel \nto respond to that emergency room call and to make treatment decisions. \nThat is not all. The HMO also saves; when the emergency room treats the \npatient without prior authorization, the health plan can then go back \nand claim the care was unnecessary and refuse to pay.\n  What the Democratic poststabilization provision is all about is \nsimply requiring the health plan to take responsibility for the patient \nby answering the phone when the emergency room calls, and then either \nauthorizing treatment, referring follow-up primary care, or \ntransferring the individual.\n  There are those who say this provision places an unwarranted burden \non the HMO. But let's give an example of one of the Nation's oldest and \nlargest health maintenance organizations, Kaiser-Permanente. Kaiser-\nPermanente endorses this position and has implemented the \npoststabilization requirement voluntarily. Guess what. After all the \ndiscussion about cost and the desire to maintain affordable and \naccessible health care, this provision has saved Kaiser-Permanente \nmoney. How could it do that? Because Kaiser has found that by \ncoordinating care with the emergency room, it has been able to avoid \nunnecessary admissions through providing followup care at an outpatient \nfacility.\n\n  I will quote from a letter signed by Mr. Don Parsons, the associate \nexecutive director for health policy development for Kaiser-Permanente. \nI ask unanimous consent the entire letter be printed in the Record \nimmediately after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. Parsons states:\n\n       By assuring immediate response to telephone inquiries from \n     non-participating emergency facilities, we have been able to \n     provide substantial assistance to the emergency doctor who \n     otherwise is practicing in an isolated environment without \n     access to the patient's medical record.\n       Our own emergency physicians on the telephone have offered \n     peer consultations, personally approved coverage for urgently \n     needed tests and treatment, arranged for the coordination of \n     follow up care, and implemented critical care transportation \n     of patients back to our own facilities. Of over 2,000 \n     patients transported in this fashion, one third have been \n     discharged to their homes. Without this coordination of care, \n     these patients would have been hospitalized at needless \n     expense.\n\n  For example, to go back to my hypothetical of the child with the high \nfever without signs of a bacterial infection, they could have been sent \nhome if there were arrangements made for the child to see a doctor the \nnext day. But absent the communication between the plan and the \nemergency room, the emergency room admits the child. If the insurance \ncompany plays by the rules, as Kaiser-Permanente, it will now be only \nout the $50 for a routine primary care visit rather than the $1,000 or \nmore that it might be out if the child is admitted to the hospital.\n  So why are companies such as Kaiser coordinating poststabilization \ncare with emergency departments? They are doing it because it is good \nhealth care and it is good business. I point out again, this is the \nsame provision that the Congress passed in 1997 as it relates to \nMedicare and Medicaid beneficiaries who currently have this \npoststabilization coordination of care coverage.\n  So how the amendment is drafted, what the amendment says, what the \ndetails are, makes all the difference. This is not just a matter of \nchecking off the box. It is a matter of looking inside that box to see \nif the prudent layperson provision, which both versions purport to \noffer--is it meaningful? The person who exercises prudence by going to \nthe nearest emergency room, not necessarily the nearest emergency room \nthat happens to be part of the network of the HMO, will they be \nfinancially protected?\n  The person who has been stabilized--and now the question is what \nneeds to be done to deal with the underlying cause of their symptoms--\nwill they be financially protected when the HMO fails to respond to the \nrequest for specific authorization? Those are the types of real \ndifferences that make the difference between the two alternative \nversions of emergency room care that are before the Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues to study these differences and to be mindful of \nthe other differences that will be articulated by the other cosponsors \nof this amendment. I urge their support for this amendment that makes \nemergency room care real for the families of America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two letters be printed in the Record: \nOne from the American College of Emergency Physicians supporting the \namendment that has been offered, and the letter from the American Heart \nAssociation supporting the emergency room provision that I and \ncolleagues have offered.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  American College\n\n\n                                      of Emergency Physicians,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 1999.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Hon. John H. Chafee,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Graham and Chafee: The American College of \n     Emergency Physicians (ACEP), on behalf of its more than \n     20,000 physicians and the patients we serve, is pleased to \n     support your amendment, which will protect people with health \n     insurance who make reasonable decisions to seek emergency \n     care from claims denials by managed care plans. Today's \n     health care market warrants establishment of basic consumer \n     protections to ensure coverage for emergency services, and \n     ACEP believes that your amendment would provide such \n     safeguards.\n       As emergency physicians, we applaud your efforts to prevent \n     health plans from denying patients coverage for emergency \n     services. Prior authorizations requirement for emergency care \n     and ``after-the-fact'' claims denials create barriers that \n     can place a patient's health at serious risk. Your amendment \n     provides those covered by private managed care plans with the \n     same ``prudent layperson'' standard that Congress provided \n     Medicare and Medicaid patients as a part of the ``Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1997.''\n       Again, ACEP is pleased to offer its support of your \n     amendment, and we commend your leadership in proposing a \n     bipartisan solution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                      John C. Moorhead, MD, FACEP,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Heart Association, Office of Communications and \n           Advocacy,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 1999.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: The American Heart Association \n     strongly supports your amendment, to be offered today to the \n     patient protection legislation, which will ensure prompt \n     emergency room access. This important amendment is essential \n     to our mission of reducing death and disability from \n     cardiovascular diseases, the leading cause of death in \n     America.\n       To reduce the devastation caused by cardiovascular \n     diseases, the American Heart Association is committed to \n     educating the public about the warning signs and the symptoms \n     of heart attack and stroke. Acting on this knowledge is often \n     the key to survival. In fact, every minute that passes before \n     returning the heart to a normal rhythm after a cardiac arrest \n     causes the chance of survival to fall by as much as 10 \n     percent. Our consistent message to the public, therefore, is \n     both to know the signs and symptoms of heart attack and \n     stroke and to get emergency care as quickly as possible.\n       However, unnecessary and burdensome obstacles often stand \n     between the patient and the emergency room door. Insurer \n     ``pre-approval'' processes for emergency care can impede \n     prompt treatment of heart attack and stroke. Delays in \n     treatment can significantly increase mortality and morbidity. \n     Our efforts to educate the public about the importance of \n     getting prompt treatment are severely hindered by these \n     ``pre-approval'' barriers.\n       The American Heart Association applauds your efforts to \n     address these obstacles by ensuring the ``prudent layperson'' \n     definition of emergency. Any managed care reform proposal \n     that seeks to protect patients' rights must include this \n     prudent layperson standard.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Diane Canova, Esq.,\n                                         Vice President, Advocacy.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And so, Mr. President, as I stated early in my remarks, \nhow the amendment is drafted, and what the amendment says, makes all \nthe difference.\n\n[[Page S8245]]\n\n  It's not good enough just to check off the boxes. That's why I urge \nthe adoption of our amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                            Kaiser Permanente,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 7, 1999.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: Since 1996, Kaiser Permanente has \n     supported the passage of federal legislation embracing the \n     Prudent Lay Person concept, which requires insurance coverage \n     of emergency services provided to people who reasonably \n     expect they have a life or limb threatening emergency. In \n     connection with this, we support a requirement that the \n     emergency physician or provider communicate with the health \n     plan at the point where the patient becomes stabilized. This \n     will allow for coordination of post-stabilization care for \n     the patient, including further tests and necessary follow-up \n     care. These concepts are contained in several bills currently \n     pending before Congress. I should note, however, that our \n     favoring of this language should not imply endorsement in its \n     entirety of any specific bill that deals with other issues.\n       As a result of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 with its \n     ensuing regulations applicable to Medicare + Choice and \n     Medicaid enrollees and the Executive Order applying the \n     President's Advisory Commission's Bill of Rights to all \n     federal employees, approximately 30 million Americans are now \n     the beneficiaries of a financial incentive to emergency \n     departments to communicate with the patient's health plan \n     after the patient is stabilized. This helps to ensure that \n     the patient's care is appropriate, coordinated and \n     continuous. It is important that emergency departments have \n     the same incentive to coordinate post-stabilization and \n     follow up care for patients who are not federal employees or \n     beneficiaries of Medicare or Medicaid. We have heard of \n     minimal problems implementing this standard in those health \n     plans participating in FEHBP and Medicare + Choice programs. \n     Since a federal standard is in place and working, it is good \n     policy to extend that standard to the general population.\n       For the past ten years, we have implemented on a voluntary \n     basis a program that embraces these concepts of honoring \n     payment for the care our members receive in non-participating \n     hospital emergency departments up to the point of \n     stabilization. Our Emergency Prospective Review Program has \n     encouraged the treating physicians in such settings to \n     contact our physicians at the earliest opportunity to discuss \n     the need for further care. This has allowed us to make \n     available elements of the patient's medical record pertinent \n     to the problem at hand and to coordinate on-going care as \n     well as the transfer of the patient back to his/her own \n     medical team at one of our facilities. We have found this \n     program to be considerate of the patients' needs, emphasizing \n     both the urgency of treatment for the immediate problem as \n     well as the continuity of high quality care.\n       This has been a cost-effective practice, affording the \n     patient the highest quality of care in the most appropriate \n     setting. By assuring immediate response to telephone \n     inquiries from non-participating emergency facilities, we \n     have been able to provide substantial assistance to the \n     emergency doctor who otherwise is practicing in an isolated \n     environment without access to the patient's medical record. \n     Our own emergency physicians on the telephone have offered \n     peer consultations, provisionally approved coverage for \n     urgently needed tests and treatment, arranged for the \n     coordination of follow up care, and implemented critical care \n     transport of patients back to our own facilities. Of over two \n     thousand patients transported in this fashion, one third have \n     been discharged to their homes. Without this coordination of \n     care, these patients would have been hospitalized at needless \n     expense.\n       In summary, this program has served the needs of our \n     patients, the treating emergency physicians, and our own \n     medical care teams, while providing substantial savings in \n     both clinical expense and in administrative hassle over \n     retrospective approval of payment for services provisionally \n     approved through the telephone call. We are strongly in favor \n     of the post-stabilization coordination provision as an \n     essential element of the emergency access provision of the \n     Patients Bill of Rights.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Donald W. Parsons, MD,\n                                     Associate Executive Director.\n\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume on \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, just briefly, the Senator from Alabama \nstated the State of Alabama had this great health insurance by some \npoll that he had conducted by, I think, South Alabama University.\n  First of all, regarding coverage of emergency care, the State of \nAlabama is one of 12 States that does not use the prudent layperson or \nsimilar standard for emergency room treatment. In addition to that, \nwith drug formularies, 36 States have no procedures for obtaining \nnonformulary drugs; Alabama is one of those. Access to clinical trials, \n47 States have no access to clinical trials; Alabama is one of those. \nContinuity of care, 29 States have no continuity of care provisions; \nAlabama is one of those. Bans on financial incentives, 28 States have \nno ban on financial incentives to providers; Alabama is one of those. \nProvider protections, 21 States have no protections for providers who \nare terminated; Alabama is one of those. Point-of-service options, 30 \nStates do not require that point-of-service plans be offered; Alabama \nis one of those. Coverage of emergency care, I have already stated 12 \nStates do not use a prudent layperson or similar standard; Alabama is \none of those.\n  The State of Alabama has 1,617,000 State residents who are not \nprotected under the Republican plan; 62 percent of privately insured in \nAlabama are not protected under the Republican plan. So I do not know \nabout the poll in South Alabama, but I know what the facts are. The \nfacts are that State is similar to many States. That is why groups \nsupport our Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Why do I say groups? Hundreds of groups. They are already on the \nrecord, the groups that support us, a listing of some of the groups \nthat support us. Alliance for Lung Cancer Advocacy, Alzheimer \nAssociation, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, \nAmerican Academy of Emergency Medicine, American Academy of \nNeurologists, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of \nPhysical Medicine and Rehabilitation--over 200 groups support this \nlegislation, over 200.\n  In addition to that, we have a unique situation. The doctors and the \nnurses have joined with the lawyers to support this legislation. It is \na unique day in American legislation when we can say not only do the \ndoctors support this--the American Medical Association does, all the \nspecialty groups--but in addition to that the lawyers support it.\n  I suggest people coming in, bragging about the other bill, the \nmajority's bill, they are talking about--the junior Senator from Maine \nsaid all we want to do is ensure access. I respectfully submit they \nwant to ensure the insurance companies continue to rip off the American \npublic. That is what that legislation is about. That is what they are \ntrying to ensure, and this legislation is meant to stop that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have a number of issues on the floor \ntoday--the underlying bill that has been introduced and a substitute \nbill. We have talked some about scope today. Now we are talking about \nemergency services. I think it is important that people understand that \nboth of the underlying bills do have parts which address this access to \nemergency medical care. It is absolutely critical that over the course \nof today and on future amendments on emergency care we appropriately \naddress a bill of rights that does have a real impact because there is \nno way we can responsibly leave this debate without addressing the \nfear, the fear which is supported by anecdote--I do not know how big of \na problem it is, but it is a fear and that means we have to deal with \nit and we should deal with it--of having a heart attack or chest pain \nor laceration or broken arm or a sick child and going to an emergency \nroom, and in some way, for some reason, having that care denied or be \nchanneled to emergency rooms that are across town, all of the sorts of \nthings that are truly frightening and are really unconscionable. \nTherefore, it needs to be addressed and needs to be addressed well.\n  The amendment today brings up an issue of poststabilization, which I \nthink needs to be addressed, and I will carefully look at the \namendment.\n  Poststabilization is a point after which you have gone to the \nemergency room, gone through screening, and gone through treatment. \nThen what happens? Again, it looks at a more complete picture, and we \nneed to make sure what we ultimately pass several days from now \naddresses that adequately and appropriately, given the\n\n[[Page S8246]]\n\nrealities of the managed care, coordinated care, and fee-for-service \nsystem.\n  Let me briefly comment on what is in our Republican bill. This was \ndiscussed in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. We \ntalked about emergency access, and we talked about some of the other \nissues as it went through the committee.\n  What passed out of committee, and is before this body, is as follows: \nWe require group health plans that are covered by the scope of the \nbill--and the issue of scope has come forward--to pay, without any sort \nof prior authorization, for an emergency medical screening exam. If you \ngo to the emergency room, that exam, using a prudent layperson \nstandard, which has just been discussed--meaning, if you are at a \nrestaurant and you have chest pain, you think it might be a heart \nattack, you know it is an emergency or you feel it is an emergency, and \nyou go to the emergency room. They say it is indigestion, not a heart \nattack; therefore, they are not going to cover it. The prudent \nlayperson --that is, the average person in terms of medical knowledge \nin America today--says there is no way I am going to know if it is an \nemergency or not, if it is serious or not. We reach out, using the \nprudent layperson standard, and cover that individual.\n  You would not have to have prior authorization. That would be for an \nemergency medical screening exam and any additional emergency care that \nis required to stabilize that condition.\n  Stabilization is difficult. As a physician, when I think of \nstabilization, because I am a heart surgeon, I think of heart failure \nand blood pressure, going into shock, and all sorts of bad things \nhappening overall. Stabilization might also mean if you have a broken \narm or if you have a laceration. The definitions are important as we go \nforward.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, will the Senator from Tennessee yield for \na question?\n  Mr. FRIST. Let me finish walking through what is in the Republican \nproposal first.\n  The stabilization end of it is important. I mention that because we \nare talking about a period of poststabilization--after you are \nstabilized. Again, the Republican bill covers, through the screening \nand stabilization process, using that prudent layperson standard.\n  We define in our bill what a prudent layperson is, and that is an \nindividual who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine. I \nthink that is as good a definition as one can generate, and the concept \nof prudent layperson I believe is accepted by both sides.\n  As to the cost-sharing aspect, again looking at what is in the \nRepublican bill which was introduced earlier today, plans may impose \ncost sharing on emergency services, but the cost-sharing requirement \ncannot be greater for out-of-network or out-of-plan emergency services \nthan for in-network services. That is very important, because I have \nheard several people allege, no, you can charge anything, you can \ncharge much higher than what in-network cost sharing is, and that is \nsimply not true in the Republican bill.\n  An individual who has sought emergency services from a \nnonparticipating provider or nonparticipating hospital or \nnonparticipating emergency physician cannot be held liable for charges \nbeyond that which the individual would have had to pay if that \nphysician were a member of that particular coordinated care plan or \nmanaged care plan or health maintenance organization.\n  The important points are basically that you do not need prior \nauthorization. It does not matter whether or not that facility is part \nof that plan or that HMO's network itself. So you can go to the nearest \nhospital if, using that prudent layperson standard, you have a concern \nthat you have something that does need to be treated and treated very \nquickly.\n  The prudent layperson would expect the absence of immediate medical \nattention to result in some sort of jeopardy to the individual's health \nor serious impairment--again referring back to that standard--or \nserious dysfunction of their body. Again, it is very difficult in terms \nof covering the overall realm.\n  The poststabilization period: What happens after you go to the \nnearest emergency room, using that prudent layperson standard, not \nhaving to pay anything beyond what you would have to pay if you had \ngone to a facility in that network, you have had the screening exam and \nyou have had that stabilization or that initial treatment.\n  Poststabilization introduces: What if you are there and you had this \nchest pain and you found out it was just indigestion, but while you \nwere there in that poststabilization period, the physicians find a spot \non the chest x-ray that you need to rule out as lung cancer, or you \nhave cholecystitis or right quadrant pain, and with a quick exam it is \npretty clear another medical problem has been picked up. Does that fall \ninto that poststabilization period? And, if so, does that treatment \ncontinue over time?\n\n  Those are the questions we need to debate, we need to look at. We \nneed to make sure we do not open the door so broadly that somebody \nbasically goes to an emergency room with a complaint and it is taken \ncare of, but 10 other complaints are found and that is an excuse to get \nall your care outside of that network simply because that might \npotentially circumvent the whole point of having care coordinated and \nto have a management aspect of coordinated care.\n  Over the debate, as it continues tonight and in the morning, the \npoststabilization period is an important period we need to address. We \ndo not want to create any huge loopholes through which people can \nslide. I am going to keep coming back to again and again that we have \nto do what is best for the individual patient, and we have to keep our \nfocus on the patient, and we do not want to do anything that \nexorbitantly increases cost if it is unnecessary, if it is wasteful, \nbecause if we do that, we increasingly, by an increase in premiums--\nsomebody is going to have to pay for it--drive people to the ranks of \nthe uninsured.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. First, on the question of prudent layperson, you are \ncorrect; both bills have essentially the same language on a prudent \nlayperson, but there is a very sharp difference in terms of the \neconomic exposure of that prudent layperson, whether they are in a \nhospital as part of the HMO's network or in a hospital that is not part \nof the network.\n  The Democratic plan clearly states there must be parity of treatment; \nthat is, if you are in an out-of-network hospital, you cannot be \ncharged more than if you are in an in-network hospital.\n  The Republican bill--and I will quote from the committee report, \nwhich is on our desks, on page 29. This is the committee that reported \nthe Republican bill, the Labor Committee. The first full paragraph \nstates:\n\n       The committee believes that it would be acceptable to have \n     a differential cost-sharing for in-network emergency coverage \n     and out-of-network emergency coverage, so long as such cost-\n     sharing is applied consistently across a category (i.e., in-\n     network, out-of-network) and uniformly to similarly situated \n     individuals and communicated in advance to participants and \n     beneficiaries. . . .\n\n  What that language seems to say to me is that under the Republican \nproposal, if you have a standard copay, let's say, of 20 percent if you \nare inside the HMO network but it is a 50-percent copay if you are out \nof the network, and you end up in the emergency room that is out of the \nnetwork because it was the one closest to where you were when you had \nthat chest pain, you may end up having to pay 50 percent of the \nemergency room bill rather than 20 percent that you would have had to \npay in your in-network emergency room, which is what the Democratic \nbill would provide, that you would pay whatever emergency room from \nwhich you ended up receiving that emergency service.\n  Mr. FRIST. The question is, in essence, what I said earlier about the \ndifferential cost sharing; if you go back and look at the committee \nreport, if you go to an emergency room, you can be charged out-of-\nnetwork rates instead of in-network cost sharing. I do not have that \nreport language before me right now, but if that is what is in the \ncommittee report, that is unacceptable to me. That is something that I \nam willing to work on in terms of the amendment process over the next \nseveral days because there is no question\n\n[[Page S8247]]\n\nin my mind as to the cost-sharing requirement, when you go into an \nemergency room, that you have to remove all barriers, that you can go \nto the closest emergency room, and that that cost-sharing requirement \ncannot be exaggerated or elevated to an out-of-network rate as we go \nforward.\n  I will work with you in terms of this whole issue that the cost-\nsharing requirement cannot be greater for out-of-network emergency \nservices than for in-network services. That is a barrier that should \nnot be there.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, that response was so satisfactory and \nindicated the kind of spirit which I hope this debate over the next \n3\\1/2\\ days will sustain; that we are all trying to do what is best for \npatients and that we will work together to get to that end.\n  I have no further questions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me just respond that I hope in my \nearlier comments in what I was saying about poststa-bilization--\nalthough I have not seen the wording of the amendment, but I know from \ncommittee that the Senator is committed to this--in the \npoststabilization end of things, in terms of how far in the process of \nprudent layperson recognition, the presentation to the emergency room \nof your choice, the cost-sharing arrangement we talked about, the \nmedical screening, the stabilization, the poststabilization period, I, \nagain, want to work with the Senator as we go forward.\n  I have to say it is a very complex issue as to how you trade back \ninto the network, how you do that notification process. I worked in \nemergency rooms. I have been there. I worked for years in emergency \nrooms.\n  When somebody comes in, the last thing you want to be thinking about \nis a lot of phone calls and calling networks--should we or should we \nnot take care of that individual patient? On the other hand, after \nthings settle down and you take care of the emergency in the emergency \nroom, you have the heart going, you have resuscitated them, then at \nsome point in time they have to make their entrance back into the \ncoordinated care plan.\n  So we have to be careful about poststabilization--at an appropriate \ntime--but, again, doing what is right for the patient. So those two \nissues--the cost sharing and the poststabilization--I am committed to \nworking with the Senator over the next several days.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Florida that was an excellent \nquestion. It does appear the Senator from Tennessee has indicated that \nthe Republican version of the emergency care aspect of that bill is \nlacking and that he would support the provisions you have indicated, \nhaving parity in charging from one emergency room to the other. It was \nan excellent question.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I first ask unanimous consent that my assistant, Brent \nAsplin, be allowed floor privileges during the remainder of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to follow up on the dialogue we had \nbetween Senator Graham from Florida and Senator Frist from Tennessee. I \nthink we are finally getting to the heart of the matter as to on why \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Florida really does make \nsense and why it saves money and at the same time helps the patients.\n  I point out that this amendment contains identical language that this \nSenate has already passed 2 years ago with respect to Medicare and \nMedicaid--the same language. I frankly think it would not be wise--in \nfact, I think it would be a mistake--if the Senate were now to turn \naround and adopt a lower standard of care for Americans with private \nhealth insurance plans. It just does not make any sense.\n  I must also say that both bills appear to provide coverage for \nemergency services using the prudent layperson standard. At least that \nis how it appears on the surface. The prudent layperson standard is the \nstandard that guarantees emergency care without prior authorization in \nany case that a prudent layperson would regard as an emergency. Both \nbills appear to have that same standard.\n  The question here is something that is a little bit different. The \ndifference comes down to poststabilization services. The amendment \nbefore us today does offer coverage for poststabilization services. The \nRepublican bill does not.\n  What are poststabilization services? They are those services needed \nwhen a patient has been stabilized after a medical emergency. That is \nafterwards.\n  Really, the debate about poststabilization comes down to two basic \nquestions: First, is poststabilization care going to be coordinated \nwith the patient's health plan or is it going to be uncoordinated and \ntherefore inefficient?\n  The second question is: Are decisions about poststabilization care \ngoing to be made in a timely fashion; that is, when they are needed, or \nare we going to allow delays in the decisionmaking process that will \ncompromise patient care and also lead to overcrowding in our Nation's \nemergency rooms?\n  Those are the two basic questions. Again, are the poststabilization \nservices going to be coordinated with the health care plan or not; and, \nsecond, are these decisions going to be made in a timely fashion?\n  We have heard a lot of rhetoric about how poststabilization services \namount to nothing more than a ``blank check'' for providers. That is \nthe major argument against this amendment. Is it going to provide for a \n``blank check'' for doctors, for hospitals, and for emergency care \nproviders? If these provisions are a ``blank check,'' I might ask, \nthen, why did one of the oldest, largest, and most successful managed \ncare organizations in the country, Kaiser-Permanente, help create them \nin the first place?\n  Kaiser-Permanente likes this because it knows it makes sense. It \nhelps patient care and it helps reduce costs. Kaiser-Permanente is a \nstrong supporter of the poststabilization provisions in our bill; that \nis, the provisions offered by the Senator from Florida.\n  Why does Kaiser-Permanente support this? One simple reason. They \nrealize that coordinating care after a patient is stabilized not only \nleads to better patient care but--guess what--it also saves money.\n  Let me give you an example of how the poststabilization services in \nthis amendment can actually save money.\n  Just last week, while the Senate was in recess, I learned of a 40-\nyear-old woman who went to an emergency room complaining of numbness on \nthe right side of her body. The symptoms began to improve in the \nemergency room, and she was diagnosed with what her physicians referred \nto as a ``mini-stroke'' or a ``TIA.'' This condition is a warning sign \nfor the possibility of a more serious, debilitating stroke.\n  The patient was stabilized in the emergency room, and the emergency \nphysician attempted to contact the patient's physician but was unable \nto do so. The emergency doc tried to contact the patient's physician \nbut could not. If the poststabilization provisions in our bill had been \nin place, it may have been possible to send this woman home to continue \nher tests as an outpatient. It would have been possible. It would have \nbeen probable because of the way she was stabilized.\n  But because the plan and the private physician were not available to \nprovide coordinated and timely followup care, the emergency physician \nhad to admit the patient to the hospital. Now, I am confused. Why don't \nsome of my colleagues support this provision? Why don't they support a \nprovision that provides a pathway to more efficient medical care?\n\n  Mr. President, I ask consent to speak for an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. In this case, the outcome is very simple. A patient could \nhave been discharged to home with follow-up care as an outpatient. \nInstead, she was admitted to the hospital because timely follow-up care \ncouldn't be guaranteed through the health plan. Her hospitalization \ncosts were much higher than the care she would have received as an \noutpatient.\n\n[[Page S8248]]\n\n  Now, I must say, too, we have heard many stories about the \nretrospective denial of coverage for poststabilization services. These \nservices are not optional medical care. That is not what we are talking \nabout. That is a red herring. We are not talking about optional medical \ncare. We are talking about the situation where the emergency doc has \ntime only to make sure the patient is taken care of, either admitted to \na hospital poststabilization or coordinate a plan with the patient's \ndoctor, some similar thing, not unrelated or just tangentially related \noptional medical care. That is a red herring. That is not what we are \ntalking about.\n  If my colleagues support the Graham-Chafee amendment, it is clear \nthey will be voting for more efficient and more timely medical care. I \nhope the Republicans will join us to pass the real prudent layperson \nstandard for emergencies. This standard has bipartisan support. It is \nendorsed by many professional organizations and consumer groups \nthroughout the country.\n  For example, just this afternoon I received an endorsement by the \nAmerican Heart Association of the prudent layperson amendment offered \nby Senators Graham and Chafee. The American Heart Association states \nthat the prudent layperson standard is ``essential to their mission of \nreducing death and disability from cardiovascular disease, the leading \ncause of death in America.''\n  The American Heart Association wants this amendment because they know \nit is right. Kaiser-Permanente wants this amendment because they know \nit is right. There is no reason why this amendment should not pass, \nparticularly when the same standard applies today because of a law \npassed by this Congress 2 years ago, to Medicare and Medicaid.\n  I think it is common sense. I can't believe the objections to this \namendment. I hope that after the other side thinks about it a little \nbit, they will realize that it does make sense and support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter to me from the American Heart Association endorsing this \namendment.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   American Heart Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 1999.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Baucus: On behalf of the 4.2 million \n     volunteers of the American Heart Association, I urge you to \n     support Senator Bob Graham's amendment, to be offered today \n     to the patient protection legislation, which will ensure \n     prompt emergency room access. This amendment is essential to \n     our mission of reducing death and disability from \n     cardiovascular diseases, the leading cause of death in \n     America.\n       To reduce the devastation caused by cardiovascular \n     diseases, the American Heart Association is committed to \n     educating the public about the warning signs and the symptoms \n     of heart attack and stroke. Acting on this knowledge is often \n     the key to survival. In fact, every minute that passes before \n     returning the heart to a normal rhythm after a cardiac arrest \n     causes the chance of survival to fall by as much as 10 \n     percent. Our consistent message to the public, therefore, is \n     both to know the signs and symptoms of heart attack and \n     stroke and to get emergency care as quickly as possible.\n       However, unnecessary and burdensome obstacles often stand \n     between the patient and the emergency room door. Insurer \n     ``pre-approval'' processes for emergency care can impede \n     prompt treatment of heart attack and stroke. Delays in \n     treatment can significantly increase mortality and morbidity. \n     Our efforts to educate the public about the importance of \n     getting prompt treatment are severely hindered by these \n     ``pre-approval'' barriers.\n       The American Heart Association strongly supports Senator \n     Graham's efforts to address these obstacles by ensuring the \n     ``prudent layperson'' definition of emergency.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this issue. We look \n     forward to your strong support for the Graham amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Diane Canova, Esq.,\n                                         Vice President, Advocacy.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, HMO's across the country are denying \ncoverage for emergency care, and patients are suffering.\n  A child has a severe fever, but his parents are forced to drive past \nthe nearest emergency room to a distant facility that participates in \nthe HMO's network. The child's hands and feet are amputated as a result \nof the delay in getting care.\n  A middle-aged man has severe chest pain and believes he is having a \nheart attack, but finds out at the emergency room that it was merely \nindigestion. His HMO denies payment for the visit, leaving him with an \nexpensive bill for tests to rule out his symptoms.\n  A woman fractures her skull and is knocked out during a 40-foot fall \nwhile hiking. She is airlifted to a local hospital, but her HMO later \ndenies coverage because she did not seek ``pre-authorization'' for \nemergency treatment.\n  A teenager dislocates his shoulder in an after-school sports program \nin Massachusetts. Another student's mother--who happens to be a \nphysician--saves his arm by performing an emergency procedure while \nwaiting for his HMO to send an ambulance to take him to the hospital.\n  Each case is unique, but all share a common theme. Patients are \ninjured or stuck with the bill because their HMO tries to avoid \nresponsibility for care that should be covered. According to a \nSeptember, 1998, survey by Harvard University and the Kaiser Family \nFoundation, one in seven HMO patients report that their plan refused to \npay for an emergency room visit, and one in ten say they have \ndifficulty getting emergency care.\n  Two years ago, Congress passed legislation with strong bipartisan \nsupport in the Balanced Budget Act that put a stop to these abuses for \nMedicare and Medicaid patients. As a result, America's elderly, \ndisabled and low-income citizens can seek care at the nearest \nhospital--without financial penalty--when they believe they are facing \na medical emergency.\n  The Graham amendment and the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights, \nwhich are strongly supported by the American College of Emergency \nPhysicians, would extend those protections to all 161 million Americans \nwith private health insurance.\n  The Republican leadership claims to do the same in their proposal, \nbut their so-called protections are missing key parts or are riddled \nwith loopholes. They apply to fewer than one-third of privately insured \nAmericans. According to the American College of Emergency Physicians in \na letter dated June 22, 1999, S. 326, as reported out of Committee, \n``fails to achieve the promise of its section name. As drafted, [it] \ncalls into serious question the underlying intent of the provision.''\n  First, the prudent layperson standard applies only if the HMO happens \nto define emergency medical care exactly as the act does. Thus, plans \nmay be able to avoid the standard simply by changing their definition \nof emergency care.\n  Second, even if the prudent layperson standard were to apply, the \nRepublican bill allows plans to charge patients more for going to the \nnearest emergency department, instead of the HMO's hospital. An \namendment was offered in the committee to try to limit cost-sharing for \npatients who seek care at an out-of-network provider, but conflicting \nlanguage in the legislation and accompanying Committee Report calls \ninto question the true effect and intent of the amendment. The American \nCollege of Emergency Physicians calls the situation ``vague and \nconfusing.'' Clearly, without this assurance, the protections offered \nby using a prudent layperson standard and removing prior authorization \nrestrictions are moot. Patients will still feel pressured to seek care \nonly at network hospitals--even if it means risking life or limb to get \nthere--because they will fear the financial repercussions that may \noccur if they go to the nearest emergency room.\n  Third, the Republican leadership bill does not ensure coverage and \ncoordination of the care that is provided after a patient is stabilized \nin the emergency room. This is a critically important gap, and an area \nin which coverage can be confusing and disputes frequent. That is why \nCongress included coverage for post-stabilization care in the Balanced \nBudget Act's protections for Medicare patients. Senator Hutchinson \nincluded it in the legislation he cosponsored with Senator Graham last \nyear. This year, however, Republican support for this important \nprotection has disappeared, leaving millions of patients out in the \ncold.\n  Coverage of post-stabilization care will not significally undermine \nan\n\n[[Page S8249]]\n\nHMO's relationships with particular facilities or become a vehicle for \na hospital or patient to manipulate the system after care is provided \nat a non-participating hospital. It simply ensures that patients \nreceive all necessary care before being transferred or discharged, and \nthat they are not left with the bill simply because the HMO turns off \nits phones at 5 p.m. or refuses to coordinate with the hospital.\n  Our plan would create a system to ensure that the treating provider \nand the plan begin a conversation to coordinate care as soon as \npractical once the patient arrives at the emergency room.\n  I have heard my Republican colleagues argue that this protection is \nunnecessary because no hospital will discharge a patient until that \npatient is sufficiently stabilized. That may be true, but the problem \nwe seek to address here deals with coverage, not treatment. Thanks to \nthe anti-dumping Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, under \ncurrent law patients should received the care they need when they \npresent with symptoms in an emergency room.\n  But HMOs do not need to abide by this act--hospitals and doctors do. \nSo, when the hospitals and doctors do their job and provide the care \nthey think is necessary, the insurance company can later deny coverage \nfor the care and patients are stuck with the bill.\n  The Graham amendment, which I strongly support, would put a stop to \nthis abuse by ensuring that all parties begin discussing proper \ntreatment and coverage options at the earliest possible moment. This \namendment is based on Medicare's provisions. It says that insurance \ncompanies must use a prudent layperson standard if they cover emergency \nservices. It says patients should not be charged more for going to the \nclosest, but non-participating hospital. And it says that coverage \nshould extend for necessary post-stabilization care, too. Millions of \nfamilies deserve this protection, and they are waiting for its passage.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting meaningful emergency services protection for patients in \nmanaged care plans. I am happy to cosponsor this amendment with my good \nfriend, Senator Bob Graham.\n  This is one area where we should have little difficulty in coming to \nagreement--we have already extended this critical protection to \nMedicare and Medicaid beneficiaries as part of the Balanced Budget Act \nof 1997. Now it is time for the federal government to finish the job \nand provide all Americans with a single and consistent standard for \nemergency room coverage. What's good for our Medicare and Medicaid \npatients should be good for patients in private plans; there is no \nearthly justification for not extending this basic protection to all \nAmericans. If a plan says it covers emergency medical services, then it \nought to do just that--cover legitimate emergencies.\n  Simply put, this provision establishes reasonable standards to \nguarantee that patients will have their emergency services covered by \ntheir insurance company--regardless of when or where they happen to be \nfaced with the emergency. This question of where the emergency occurs \nis an important one--the very nature of an emergency situation suggests \nthat the patient will not always have the luxury of going to an \nemergency room that is part of the plan's network. It is important for \npatients who reasonably believe they need emergency medical care to \nreceive it without delay.\n  There are several aspects to this provision that must be included to \nmake it a meaningful protection for patients. I will quickly run \nthrough just a few of the most important:\n  First, protection from higher cost-sharing must apply to emergency \nservices received without prior authorization. When time is of the \nessence, the patient should not be held to prior authorization \nrequirements.\n  Second, if the patient is faced with an emergency, he or she should \nnot be charged higher cost-sharing for going to an out-of-network \nhospital.\n  Third, the patient must have the assurance that his or her plan will \narrange for necessary post-stabilization care--either at the facility \nwhere the patient is being treated for the emergency, or at an in-\nnetwork facility--in a timely fashion. The best way to achieve this is \nthrough a reference to the post-stabilization guidelines already \nestablished in the Social Security Act.\n  This so-called ``post-stabilization'' requirement has been widely \nmischaracterized as requiring plans to pay for a whole host of services \nunrelated to the emergency condition at hand. However, I want to make \nclear that the requirement is really one for coordination--that is, the \nplan must simply communicate with the emergency facility in order to \ncoordinate the patient's post-stabilization care. If the plan fails to \ncommunicate with the treating emergency facility, then, and only then, \ncould the plan be held responsible for payment of post-stabilization \nservices. Furthermore, the services must be related to the emergency \ncondition.\n  Lest anyone doubt the importance of this coordination requirement--\nfor patients and plans alike--all we have to do is look at the \nexperience of Kaiser-Permanente, one of our nation's largest and oldest \nhealth insurers. They have found the provision easy to implement, and a \nmoney-saver. In a letter to Senator Baucus dated June 24, 1999 they \nwrite ``Of over two thousand patients transported in this fashion, one \nthird have been discharged to their homes. Without this coordination of \ncare, these patients would have been hospitalized at needless \nexpense.''\n  All of these features are a part of the current law for Medicare and \nMedicaid beneficiaries, and have been extended to Federal employees by \nExecutive Order. Patients in private health insurance plans deserve no \nless protection.\n  In sum, with passage of this provision, patients will no longer be in \nthe unreasonable position of fearing that payment for emergency room \nvisits will be denied even when these emergency conditions appear to \nboth the patient and emergency room personnel to require urgent \ntreatment. Patients will be assured prompt access to emergency care \nregardless of whether the emergency happens to occur out of range of an \nin-network provider.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, how much time remains on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has 17 minutes 11 \nseconds.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as is necessary \nand ask to be notified when there are 5 minutes remaining for the \nproponents of the amendment.\n  When I spoke earlier, I said the devil was in the details, and I took \nsome time to talk about two of those details, which were the question \nof cost sharing, whether you went to an emergency room that was inside \nthe HMO's network or outside the network and, therefore, created an \neconomic incentive under the Republican plan to not go to the emergency \nroom that might be closest and most appropriate and, in instances, the \nlife-saving emergency room. Then we talked about poststabilization \ncare, whether the HMO could, by just not answering the telephone, not \ngiving authorization, put the hospital and the patient in the situation \nwhere they had to take either a medical risk or an economic risk.\n  Let me mention two other specific areas which I think deserve the \nattention of the Senate where there are differences between the \nRepublican and the Democratic proposal.\n  First is the issue of what is the kind of initial care that one will \nreceive when they go into the emergency room as a prudent layperson. \nThat is, they have exercised common sense as a layperson, that they \nhave a symptom that could be emergent in character and, therefore, they \nshould go to an emergency room.\n  In the Democratic plan, the definition of the services that will be \nprovided are: A medical screening examination that is within the \ncapability of the emergency department of a hospital, including \nancillary services routinely available to the emergency department to \nevaluate an emergency medical condition. That is the definition of the \nservices to which you are entitled.\n  In the Republican bill, here is the definition: The plan shall \nprovide coverage for benefits without requiring prior preauthorization \nfor appropriate emergency medical screening examinations.\n  Now, are we going to get into the situation a week, a month, a year \nafter\n\n[[Page S8250]]\n\nthe emergency services have been provided that there will be a raging \ndebate between the emergency room physician and the HMO as to whether \nthe services that were provided were appropriate? Or should we not use \nthe language that is in the Democratic provision which clearly states \nthat it will be those services that are within the capability of the \nemergency department of the hospital?\n  The second concern is: What is the responsibility of the prudent \nlayperson while you are lying there on the gurney having emergency \ndiagnosis? Under the Republican plan, it states that to the extent that \na prudent layperson who possesses an average knowledge of health and \nmedicine would determine such examinations to be necessary to determine \nwhether emergency medical care is necessary.\n  Do they really mean to say that here is this person who is having \nsymptoms of a heart attack, is stretched out, is attached to all kinds \nof medical equipment, is obviously in a very distressed physical \ncondition and probably in a very distressed emotional condition, that \nnow this prudent layperson has to be so prudent as to second-guess \nwhether the examinations that the emergency room physician is providing \nare the kind of examinations that should be provided? Presumably, if \nthe prudent layperson in that almost comatose state doesn't make the \nright judgment as to what examination the emergency room physician \nshould be rendering, those services won't be covered by the HMO.\n  That provision is so extreme as to shock the conscience of a prudent \nlayperson who is just reading the language in the Republican bill. I am \nhopeful that the kind of spirit of common sense that our colleague, Dr. \nFrist, the Senator from Tennessee, expressed would apply to focusing on \nthese provisions.\n  The fortunate aspect of this proposal is that we don't have to \ntotally operate in an environment of hope and guess. As the Senator \nfrom Montana stated, it has now been almost 3 years since this Senate \nand our colleagues in the House of Representatives, and the President \nof the United States, joined hands to adopt an emergency room provision \nfor Medicare and for Medicaid covering almost 70 million Americans. We \nhave had 3 years of experience under virtually the identical language \nthat is now in the amendment before us.\n  My exploration with emergency room physicians, who strongly support \nthis amendment, with HCFA, the Federal agency with the responsibility \nfor the administration of the Medicare program in conjunction with the \nStates, of the Medicaid program, have not pointed out that there have \nbeen this parade of horribles as a result of that legislation. If \nsomeone has other evidence they would like to offer, I urge them to do \nso.\n  I do not believe such testimony was given before the Labor Committee, \nwhen it considered this legislation, that indicated there had been a \ncratering of health care services in the emergency room for Medicare or \nMedicaid beneficiaries, or an escalation of cost as a result of the \nactions of the Congress and the President just some 3 years ago.\n\n  So I suggest that the prudent senatorial course of action on this \nmatter would be to adopt the amendment that is before us. It is an \namendment that we have already voted on in previous years as it relates \nto Medicare and Medicaid. We have a positive track record. We don't \nneed to take chances with the emergency room treatment of the other \nalmost 190 million Americans who are not under Medicare or Medicaid.\n  So in the spirit of the good will expressed by our colleague from \nTennessee, I look forward to a close examination, and I hope that at \nthe conclusion of that examination we will support and reaffirm the \nwisdom and judgment that we made in 1997.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be charged to the opponents of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time during \nthe quorum call run against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time not be \ncharged against either side on this quorum call that I am going to \nsuggest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I stand in support of a strong \nPatients' Bill of Rights. S. 6, the Democratic leadership bill, is of \nimmense importance to the American people.\n  Some may ask, is such a bill necessary? Without question, it is. \nCurrently, over 160 million of our family, friends, neighbors and \nchildren, are paying good money for health care with no guarantee of \nproper and appropriate treatment.\n  We don't have to look too hard to see that there are too many cases \nwhere appropriate care is not being provided. We have all heard horror \nstories of individuals unable to see their doctor in a timely manner * \n* * of patients unable to access the specialist they need * * * of \nindividuals unable to get coverage for the type of care they believed \nand expected was covered under their plan.\n  It's very simple. Insurance either fulfills its promises or it \ndoesn't. And we've heard enough to know that in too many cases it \ndoesn't. Employers and patients pay good money for health care \ncoverage, only to find that they're not getting the coverage they \nexpected. In too many cases, the coverage they expected disappears when \nthe need arises. I didn't have to look very hard to find such \nsituations in my own state of Iowa.\n  Let me tell you a story about Eric, from Cedar Falls, Iowa, who has \nhealth insurance through his employer. Eric is 28 years old, with a \nwife and two children. He suffered cardiac arrest while helping out at \na wrestling clinic. He was rushed to the hospital, where he was \nresuscitated.\n  Tragically, while in cardiac arrest, Eric's brain was deprived of \noxygen. He fell into a coma and was placed on life support. The \nneurosurgeon on call recommended that Eric's parents get Eric into \nrehab.\n  It was then the problems began. Although Eric's policy covered \nrehabilitation, his insurance company refused to cover his care at a \nfacility that specialized in patients with brain injury.\n  Thankfully, Eric's parents were able to find another rehab facility \nin Iowa. And Eric began to improve. His heart pump was removed, his \nrespirator was removed, and his lungs are now working fine.\n  But, even with this progress, Eric's family received a call from his \ninsurance company saying they would no longer cover the cost of his \nrehab, because he is not progressing fast enough.\n  Eric's mother wrote to me, saying, ``This is when we found out we had \nabsolutely no recourse. They can deny any treatment and even cause \ndeath, and they are not responsible.''\n  This week, here on the Senate floor, we have a critical choice before \nus. A choice for Eric and his family. A choice between real or \nillusionary protections. A choice between ensuring care for millions of \nAmericans or for perpetuating the already burgeoning profit margins of \nthe Managed Care industry.\n\n[[Page S8251]]\n\n  The Republicans have offered a bill that leaves out 115 million \npeople because most of the patient protections in the plan apply only \nto self-funded employer plans. This would protect only 48 million of \nthe 161 million with private insurance.\n  Our bill establishes a minimum level of patient protections by which \nmanaged care plans must abide. States can--and it's my hope that states \nwill--provide even greater protections, as necessary, for the \nindividuals in such plans in their states. As a starting point, \nhowever, we need to pass a strong and substantive managed care reform \nbill.\n  The American people want real patient protections.\n  Our bill, the real Patients' Bill of Rights Act, delivers on what \nAmericans want and need, real protection against insurance company \nabuse. The bill provides basic protections for Americans, such as:\n  Access to needed specialists, including access to pediatric \nspecialists;\n  the guarantee that a patient can see a doctor who is not on their \nHMO's list if the list does not include a provider qualified to treat \ntheir illness;\n  access to the closest emergency room and coverage of needed emergency \ncare;\n  the guarantee that patients with ongoing serious conditions like \ncancer, arthritis, or heart disease can see their oncologist, \nrheumatologist, or cardiologist without asking permission from their \nHMO or primary care doctor each time;\n  the guarantee that patients can continue to see their doctor through \na course of treatment or a pregnancy, even if their HMO drops their \ndoctor from its list or their employer changes HMOs;\n  the guarantee that patients can get the prescription drug their \ndoctor says they need, not an inferior substitute the HMO chooses \nbecause it's cheaper;\n  access to quality clinical trials for those with no other hope;\n  the ability to appeal an HMO's decision to deny or delay care to an \nindependent entity and receive timely, binding decisions;\n  and, finally, the right to hold HMOs accountable when their decisions \nto deny or delay care lead to injury or death. Most situations will be \nresolved through our appeals mechanism. However, I believe that HMOs \nand insurers should not have special immunity when they harm patients.\n  No one can argue with the need to ensure access and quality of care \nfor Americans. Over 200 organizations representing patients, consumers, \ndoctors, nurses, women, children, people with disabilities, small \nbusinesses, and people of faith support the Democrats' Patients' Bill \nof Rights.\n  The Majority pretends that their bill offers real patient \nprotections, but when you read everything below the title, it reads \nmore like an insurers' bill of rights.\n  We have a chance to pass real and responsible legislation. The time \nfor real reform is now. The American people have been in the waiting \nroom for too long.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/12/senate-section/article/S8251-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8251-S8252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JEANMARIE HICKS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I would like to take a moment to \nacknowledge a remarkable young woman from Rapid City, South Dakota, \nJeanmarie Hicks, who was recently selected as the National Winner in \nthe 1999 National Peace Essay Contest sponsored by the United States \nInstitute of Peace.\n  This year more than 2,500 high school students from all 50 states \nwere asked to express their thoughts on the topic of preventing \ninternational violent conflict. Winners from each state were awarded a \n$1,000 college scholarship and invited to participate in a week of \nspecial activities here in Washington. The National Winner receives an \nadditional $10,000 college scholarship.\n  Jeanmarie Hicks, who recently graduated as valedictorian from St. \nThomas More High School in Rapid City, wrote an eloquent essay entitled \n``Preventive Diplomacy in the Iraq-Kuwait Dispute and in the Venezuela \nBorder Dispute.'' In addition to her writing skills, Jeanmarie recently \ntook first place in South Dakota in both the National French Contest \nand the National Spanish Contest, and will attend the College of St. \nBenedict in Minnesota this fall.\n  I know my colleagues join me in congratulating Jeanmarie on all of \nher accomplishments, and I ask unanimous consent that her essay be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the essay was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n Preventive Diplomacy in the Iraq-Kuwait Dispute and in the Venezuelan \n                             Border Dispute\n\n  (By Jeanmarie Hicks, St. Thomas More High School, January 22, 1999)\n\n       ``Too little, too late'' often in the prevention of violent \n     conflicts holds true (Peck). When the roots of the problem \n     are not identified in time, violence becomes the solution. \n     Preventive diplomacy, one way of avoiding conflicts, can be \n     defined as ``action to prevent disputes from arising among \n     parties to prevent existing disputes from escalating into \n     conflicts, and to limit the spread of the latter when they \n     occur'' (Boutros-Ghali 45).\n       Preventive diplomacy protects peace and ultimately people, \n     who suffer greatly in armed conflicts. Preventive diplomacy \n     has been used in many disputes, including the border dispute \n     in Venezuela with Great Britain in the 1890s and in this \n     decade's Iraq-Kuwait dispute. Conflict was prevented in \n     Venezuela. However, preventive action was not effective in \n     Kuwait; and civilians suffered as a result.\n       The United States' intervention in the border dispute in \n     Venezuela is one example of preventive diplomacy. \n     Unfortunately, the border between Guyana and Venezuela was \n     never clearly defined; and colonial maps were inaccurate \n     (Lombardi 29). From the 1840s until the 1880s, Britain pushed \n     into Venezuela over Guyana's western border by claiming the \n     area's gold (Lombardi 29), and by asserting that the land \n     from the Rio Essequibo to the Orinoco was part of Guyana \n     (Schomburgk Line) according to colonial maps (Daly 2). \n     Britain was vehement about its right to the land, and \n     Venezuela appealed to the U.S. for aid. Under the Monroe \n     Doctrine, the U.S. states that it will act as a police force \n     to protect Latin America from European influence. The U.S. \n     viewed Britain's occupation of a portion of Venezuela as a \n     breech of the doctrine (Cleveland 93).\n       Conflict was imminent, as Britain began to prepare its navy \n     for war (Boutwell 4). A solution appeared in 1895 in the \n     person of Secretary of State Richard Olney, Enthusiastic to \n     attempt preventive diplomacy, Olney sent a dispatch to \n     Britain stressing the importance of the Monroe Doctrine. Lord \n     Salisbury of Britain responded, saying that the Monroe \n     Doctrine was not applicable in the Venezuela situation, as no \n     system of government was being forced upon the country \n     (Cleveland 100-101). In addition, Salisbury pointed out that \n     the conflict was not the result of the acquisition of new \n     territory: Guyana owned the territory in question (Boutwell \n     10).\n       Olney stressed that the issue was pertinent to American \n     stability, and remained steadfast in his demands (Cleveland \n     109). When Britain refused to submit, Congress authorized the \n     president's appointment of an investigative committee. \n     Meanwhile, Salisbury and Olney organized a meeting for \n     November 10, 1896. At the meeting, a treaty was written; and \n     the U.S. threatened to use its military to remove Britain \n     from Venezuela's border if necessary. Britain and \n     Venezuela signed the treaty on February 2, 1897, giving \n     Venezuela control of the Rio Orinocco and much of the land \n     behind the Schomburgk Line (Cleveland 117-118). Thus \n     preventive diplomacy on the part of the U.S. was \n     successful, and war was avoided.\n       The use of preventive diplomacy in the recent Iraq-Kuwait \n     dispute was less successful. Iraq had been part of the \n     Ottoman Empire from the 1700s until 1899, when Britain \n     granted it autonomy (Darwish and Alexander 6). When in 1961, \n     Britain gave Kuwait independence, Iraq claimed that, \n     historically, Kuwait was part of Iraq (Sasson 9). Iraq \n     begrudgingly recognized Kuwait's independence in 1963.\n       For awhile, relations between the two countries improved as \n     Kuwait aided Iraq monetarily in the Iran-Iraq War (1980 until \n     1988) (Sasson 11). After the war, however, Iraq demanded \n     money from Kuwait for reconstruction. Then Iraq accused \n     Kuwait of drilling oil from the border without sharing and of \n     taking more oil than the Organization of Petroleum Exporting \n     Countries (OPEC) quota permitted (Sasson 12). Iraq began to \n     threaten Kuwait borders, beginning a conflict that would take \n     thousands of soldiers away from their homes, harm civilians, \n     and detrimentally affect the environment.\n       In 1990, Iraq began to mobilize near the Kuwait border \n     (Darwish and Alexander 6). Arab nations made unsuccessful \n     attempts at preventive diplomacy (U.S. News & World Report \n     99). Surrounding nations attempted unsuccessfully to meet \n     with Saddam Hussein. Iraq invaded Kuwait, took control of its \n     capital on August 2, 1990, and installed a puppet government \n     under Hussein's command. Iraqi soldiers brutally raped \n     Kuwaiti women, and killed any civilian who was considered an \n     obstruction (Sasson 76). At this point, the United Nations \n     Security Council and the Arab League placed an embargo on \n     Iraqi oil as punishment. Iraq, in response, annexed Kuwait \n     (U.S. News & World Report 95-96).\n       War was imminent. On November 29, 1990, Iraq showed no \n     signs that it would retreat. The United Nations Security \n     Council declared that the coalition should use all\n\n[[Page S8252]]\n\n     means to expel Iraq from Kuwait if Iraq remained there after \n     January 15, 1991 (Gordon and Trainor 195). In a final attempt \n     at preventive diplomacy on January 9, James Baker of the U.S. \n     met with Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz. Baker stressed \n     that the coalition was willing to fight, and encouraged Iraq \n     to leave Kuwait (U.S. News & World Report 199). Iraq, \n     however, refused to retreat; and Hussein declared that Iraq \n     would fight a ``holy war'' for Kuwait. The world realized \n     that war was the only means of solving the problem (Gordon \n     and Trainor 197-198).\n       Air assaults began on January 17, and land war began on \n     February 24 (U.S. News & World Report). Iraqi civilian \n     casualties were heavy. The land war lasted only 100 hours, \n     but numerous oil wells were set afire, causing the emission \n     of dangerous gases. Peace was never truly made. Hussein \n     resisted the requirements for peace, including frequent \n     United Nations inspections and the prohibition of possession \n     of nuclear weapons (U.S. New & World Report 447).\n       The consequences of the Iraq-Kuwait conflict are grave. \n     Civilians of both Iraq and Kuwait suffered. Fires in oil \n     wells caused dangerous air pollution. American soldiers \n     suffer from the so-called Gulf War Syndrome, which has caused \n     a number of afflictions and death. The Syndrome is believed \n     to have resulted from the biological and chemical weapons and \n     the gases emitted by the oil wells (Eddington 1-2).\n       As illustrated, preventive diplomacy can affect the outcome \n     of imminent disputes. Various factors affect its success. In \n     the Venezuela border dispute, preventive diplomacy was \n     effective for several reasons. First, the problem was \n     recognized early; and neither side was truly battle-ready. \n     Second, the problem was contained, in that only four nations \n     (Venezuela, Britain, Guyana, and the U.S.) were involved. \n     Finally, both sides were willing to cooperate: the U.S. \n     supported the Monroe Doctrine, and Britain decided that the \n     border area was not worth war.\n       Preventive diplomacy was not effective in the Iraq-Kuwait \n     dispute. First, the problem was not recognized and acted upon \n     until Iraq had mobilized in Kuwait. Second, many nations were \n     involved in the conflict, putting Iraq on the defensive. \n     Problem solving was made a worldwide effort rather than an \n     isolated effort concerning Iraq, Kuwait, and a few mediators. \n     Finally, Hussein and the Iraqis were and remain unwilling to \n     cooperate for peace, as illustrated by the recent problems \n     with weapons' inspections.\n       With increasingly powerful weapons of mass destruction, \n     preventive diplomacy is particularly important. Moreover, \n     preventing crises is more effective than dealing with the \n     consequences of armed conflict (USIA Electronic Journals). \n     Consequently, some factors could be initiated to make \n     preventive diplomacy more effective in the future. First, \n     nations must learn about other nations' cultures in order to \n     learn respect for the people (``Stopping War Before It \n     Starts''). Children should be taught about the other \n     countries' histories and cultures in school; and current \n     information about events abroad should be readily available \n     to the public. Secondly, acceptable political behavior must \n     be explicitly defined by an international council that all \n     nations will be aware of the consequences of their actions \n     (Kennan 83). The ownership of nuclear weapons, for example, \n     should be limited. An international council would deal with \n     breaches of the rule by inspections, reprimands, and military \n     action, if necessary.\n       Preventive diplomacy centers must be established in all \n     regions (Peck). Each center would have professional \n     peacemakers and staffs, and report to the previously \n     mentioned international council, for international \n     cooperation is important in the prevention of war in that all \n     nations must cooperate to maintain good relations, and thus \n     peace (``Preventive Diplomacy in Action''). The centers would \n     watch for signs of conflict, study causes, and train \n     diplomats. With centers in all regions, conflicts could be \n     dealt with immediately. The involved nations would not need \n     to feel threatened, unless preventive diplomacy is refused, \n     in which case, the nations in the council would unite \n     militarily to maintain peace. If a potential conflict was \n     identified, the center would react by gathering \n     representatives from each party (Peck). The center's \n     diplomats would facilitate negotiation by suggesting ways to \n     make concessions; and hopefully, war would be prevented.\n       Preventive diplomacy, when used effectively as in \n     Venezuela, aids in the avoiding of armed conflict. However, \n     as apparent in the tragedy in the Iraq-Kuwait dispute, when \n     preventive diplomacy is not effective, people on both sides \n     of the conflict and resources suffer. Certain measures, \n     including regional centers, the consolidation of the problem, \n     and cooperation, should be taken for optimum effectiveness. \n     Preventive diplomacy can make the difference between \n     bloodshed and peace, which is necessary for survival in these \n     times of technological advances in weaponry. As Abraham \n     Lincoln said in his second inaugural address, ``Let us strive \n     . . . to do all which may achieve a just and lasting peace \n     among ourselves and all nations'' (qtd. in Boutwell 16).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/12/senate-section/article/S8252-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8252-S8254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BILLS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on July 1, 1999, just before last week's \nrecess, the Senate passed four bills which Senator Hatch and I had \njoined in introducing and which the Judiciary Committee had unanimously \nreported on the same day as Senate passage. These four bills would \nreauthorize the Patent and Trademark Office, update the statutory \ndamages available under the Copyright Act, make technical corrections \nto two new copyright laws enacted last year, and prevent trademark \ndilution. Each of these bills makes important improvements to our \nintellectual property laws, and I congratulate Senator Hatch for his \nleadership in moving these bills promptly through the Committee and the \nSenate.\n  Passage of these four bills is a good start, but we must not lose \nsight of the other copyright and patent issues requiring our attention \nbefore the end of this Congress. The Senate Judiciary Committee has a \nfull slate of intellectual property matters to consider and I am \npleased to work on a bipartisan basis with the chairman on an agenda to \nprovide the creators and inventors of copyrighted and patented works \nwith the protection they may need in our global economy, while at the \nsame time providing libraries, educational institutions and other users \nwith the clarity they need as to what constitutes a fair use of such \nworks.\n  Among the other important intellectual property matters for us to \nconsider are the following:\n  Distance education. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing in \nMay on the Copyright Office's thorough and balanced report on copyright \nand digital distance education. We need to address the legislative \nrecommendations outlined in that report to ensure that our laws permit \nthe appropriate use of copyrighted works in valid distance learning \nactivities.\n  Patent reform. A critical matter on the intellectual property agenda, \nimportant to the nation's economic future, is reform of our patent \nlaws. I worked on a bipartisan basis in the last Congress to get the \nOmnibus Patent Act, S. 507, reported by the Judiciary Committee to the \nSenate by a vote of 17 to one, and then tried to have this bill \nconsidered and passed by the Senate. Unfortunately, the bill became \nstalled due to resistance by some in the majority. We should consider \nand pass this important legislation.\n  Madrid Protocol Implementation Act. I introduced this legislation, S. \n671, to help American businesses, and especially small and medium-sized \ncompanies, protect their trademarks as they expand into international \nmarkets by conforming American trademark application procedures to the \nterms of the Protocol in anticipation of the U.S.'s eventual \nratification of the treaty. Ratification by the United States of this \ntreaty would help create a ``one stop'' international trademark \nregistration process, which would be an enormous benefit for American \nbusinesses.\n  Database protection. I noted upon passage of the Digital Millennium \nCopyright Act last year that there was not enough time before the end \nof that Congress to give due consideration to the issue of database \nprotection, and that I hoped the Senate Judiciary Committee would hold \nhearings and consider database protection legislation in this Congress, \nwith a commitment to make more progress. I support legal protection \nagainst commercial misappropriation of collections of information, but \nam sensitive to the concerns raised by the Administration, the \nlibraries, certain educational institutions, and the scientific \ncommunity. This is a complex and important matter that I look forward \nto considering in this Congress.\n  Tampering with product identification codes. Product identification \ncodes provide a means for manufacturers to track their goods, which can \nbe important to protect consumers in cases of defective, tainted or \nharmful products and to implement product recalls. Defacing, removing \nor tampering with product identification codes can thwart these \ntracking efforts, with potential safety consequences for American \nconsumers. We should examine the scope of, and legislative solutions to \nremedy, this problem.\n  Online trademark protection or ``cybersquatting.'' I have long been \nconcerned with protection online of registered trademarks. Indeed, when \nthe Congress passed the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, I noted \nthat:\n\n       [A]lthough no one else has yet considered this application, \n     it is my hope that this\n\n[[Page S8253]]\n\n     antidilution statute can help stem the use of deceptive \n     Internet addresses taken by those who are choosing marks that \n     are associated with the products and reputations of others. \n     (Congressional Record, December 29, 1995, page S19312).\n\n  Last year, my amendment authorizing a study by the National Research \nCouncil of the National Academy of Sciences of the effects on trademark \nholders of adding new top-level domain names and requesting \nrecommendations on related dispute resolution procedures, was enacted \nas part of the Next Generation Internet Research Act. We have not yet \nseen the results of that study, and I understand that the Internet \nCorporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (I-CANN) and World \nIntellectual Property Organization (WIPO) are considering mechanisms \nfor resolving trademark and other disputes over assignments of domain \nnames in an expeditious and inexpensive manner.\n  This is an important issue both for trademark holders and for the \nfuture of the global Internet. While I share the concerns of trademark \nholders over what WIPO has characterized as ``predatory and parasitical \npractices by a minority of domain registrants acting in bad faith'' to \nregister famous or well-known marks of others--which can lead to \nconsumer confusion or downright fraud--the Congress should tread \ncarefully to ensure that any remedies do not impede or stifle the free \nflow of information on the Internet. I know that the Chairman shares my \nconcerns and that working together we can find legislative solutions \nwhich make sense.\n\n  As detailed below, the four intellectual property bills by the Senate \nwill help foster the growth of America's creative industries.\n\n\ns. 1257, the digital theft deterrence and copyright damages improvement \n                              act of 1999\n\n  I have long been concerned about reducing the levels of software \npiracy in this country and around the world. The theft of digital \ncopyrighted works and, in particular, of software results in lost jobs \nto American workers, lost taxes to Federal and State governments, and \nlost revenue to American companies. A recent report released by the \nBusiness Software Alliance estimates that worldwide theft of \ncopyrighted software in 1998 amounted to nearly $11 billion. According \nto the report, if this ``pirated software had instead been legally \npurchased, the industry would have been able to employ 32,700 more \npeople. In 2008, if software piracy remains at its current rate, 52,700 \njobs will be lost in the core software industry.'' This theft also \nreflects losses of $991 million in tax revenue in the United States.\n  These statistics about the harm done to our economy by theft of \ncopyrighted software alone, prompted me to introduce the ``Criminal \nCopyright Improvement Act'' in both the 104th and 105th Congresses, and \nwork over those two Congresses for passage of this legislation, which \nwas finally enacted as the ``No Electronic Theft Act.'' The current \nrates of software piracy show that we need to do better to combat this \ntheft, both with enforcement of our current copyright laws and with \nstrengthened copyright laws to deter potential infringes.\n  The Hatch-Leahy-Schumer ``Digital Theft Deterrence and Copyright \nDamages Improvement Act'' would help provide additional deterrence by \namending the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Sec. 504(c), to increase the \namounts of statutory damages recoverable for copyright infringements. \nThese amounts were last increased in 1988 when the United States \nacceded to the Berne Convention. Specifically, the bill would increase \nthe cap on statutory damages by 50 percent, raising the minimum from \n$500 to $750 and raising the maximum from $20,000 to $30,000. In \naddition, the bill would raise from $100,000 to $150,000 the amount of \nstatutory damages for willful infringements.\n  Courts determining the amount of statutory damages in any given case \nwould have discretion to impose damages within these statutory ranges \nat just and appropriate levels, depending on the harm caused, ill-\ngotten profits obtained and the gravity of the offense. The bill \npreserves provisions of the current law allowing the court to reduce \nthe award of statutory damages to as little as $200 in cases of \ninnocent infringement and requiring the court to remit damages in \ncertain cases involving nonprofit educational institutions, libraries, \narchives, or public broadcasting entities.\n  In addition, the bill would create a new tier of statutory damages \nallowing a court to award damages in the amount of $250,000 per \ninfringed work where the infringement is part of a willful and repeated \npattern or practice of infringement. I note that the House version of \nthis legislation, H.R. 1761, omits any scienter requirement for the new \nproposed enhanced penalty for infringers who engage in a repeated \npattern of infringement. I share the concerns raised by the Copyright \nOffice that this provision, absent a willfulness scienter requirement, \nwould permit imposition of the enhanced penalty even against a person \nwho negligently, albeit repeatedly, engaged in acts of infringement. \nThe Hatch-Leahy-Schumer bill avoids casting such a wide net, which \ncould chill legitimate fair uses of copyrighted works.\n\n\ns. 1258, the patent fee integrity and innovation protection act of 1999\n\n  The Patent Fee Integrity and Innovation Protection Act would \nreauthorize the Patent and Trademark Office for fiscal year 2000, on \nterms that ensure the fees collected from users will be used to operate \nthe Patent and Trademark Office and not diverted to other uses.\n  The PTO is fully funded and operated through the payment of \napplication and user fees. Indeed, taxpayer support for the operations \nof the PTO was eliminated in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n1990, which imposed a large fee increase (referred to as a \n``surcharge'') on those who use the PTO, namely businesses and \ninventors applying for or seeking to protect patents on trademarks.\n  The fees accumulated from the surcharge were held in a surcharge \naccount, for use by the PTO to support the patent and trademark \nsystems. Unfortunately, however, the funds in the surcharge account \nwere also diverted to fund other, unrelated government programs. By \nfiscal year 1997, almost $54 million from the surcharge account was \ndiverted from PTO operations.\n  Last year, Congress responded to this diversion of PTO fees by \nenacting H.R. 3723/S. 507, which the chairman and I had introduced on \nMarch 20, 1997. That legislation authorized a schedule of fees to fund \nthe PTO, but no other government program, and resulted in the first \ndecrease in patent application fees in at least 50 years.\n  This PTO reauthorization bill would make $116,000,000 available to \nthe Patent and Trademark Office, a self-sustaining agency, to pay for \nsalaries and necessary expenses in FY 2000. This money reflects the \namount in carryover funds from FY99 that PTO expects to receive from \nfees collected, pursuant to the Patent Act and the Trademark Act. By \nauthorizing the money to go to PTO, the bill would avoid diversion of \nthese fees to other government agencies and programs. Inventors and the \nbusiness community who rely on the patent and trademark systems do not \nwant the fees they pay to be diverted but would rather see this money \nspent on PTO upgraded equipment, additional examiners and expert \npersonnel or other items to make the systems more efficient. This bill \nwould ensure those fees are not diverted from important PTO operations.\n\n\n            s. 1260, copyright act technical corrections act\n\n  In the last Congress, Senator Hatch and I worked together for passage \nof the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and the Sonny Bono \nCopyright Term Extension Act. This significant legislation is intended \nto encourage copyright owners to make their works available online \nby updating the copyright laws with additional protections for digital \nworks, and conforming copyright terms available to American authors to \nthose available overseas. The Hatch-Leahy substitute amendment to this \nbill adopted by the Judiciary Committee and passed by the Senate, makes \nonly technical and conforming changes to those new laws and the \nCopyright Act.\n\n\n               S. 1259, The Trade Amendments Act of 1999\n\n  The Hatch-Leahy Trademark Amendments Act is significant legislation \nto enhance protection for trademark owners and consumers by making it \npossible to prevent trademark dilution before it occurs, by clarifying \nthe remedies available under the Federal trademark dilution statute \nwhen it does occur, by providing recourse\n\n[[Page S8254]]\n\nagainst the Federal Government for its infringement of others' \ntrademarks, and by creating greater certainty and uniformity in the \narea of trade dress protection.\n  Current law provides for injunctive relief after an identical or \nsimilar mark has been in use and has caused actual dilution of a famous \nmark, but provides no means to oppose an application for a mark or to \ncancel a registered mark that will result in dilution of the holder's \nfamous mark. In Babson Bros. Co. v. Surge Power Corp., 39 USPQ 2d. 1953 \n(TTAB 1996), the Trademark Trial and Appeals Board (TTAB) held that it \nwas not authorized by the ``Federal Trademark Dilution Act'' to \nconsider dilution as grounds for opposition or cancellation of a \nregistration. The bill remedies this situation by authorizing the TTAB \nto consider dilution as grounds for refusal to register a mark or for \ncancellation of a registered mark. This would permit the trademark \nowner to oppose registration or to petition for cancellation of a \ndiluting mark, and thereby prevent needless harm to the good will and \ndistinctiveness of many trademarks and make enforcing the Federal \ndilution statute less costly and time consuming for all involved.\n  Second, the bill clarifies the trademark remedies available in \ndilution cases, including injunctive relief, defendant's profits, \ndamages, costs, and, in exceptional cases, reasonably attorney fees, \nand the destruction of articles containing the diluting mark.\n  Third, the bill amends the Lanham Act to allow for private citizens \nand corporate entities to sue the Federal Government for trademark \ninfringement and dilution. Currently, the Federal Government may not be \nsued for trademark infringement, even though the Federal Government \ncompetes in some areas with private business and may sue others for \ninfringement. This bill would level the playing field, and make the \nFederal Government subject to suit for trademark infringement and \ndilution. I note that the Lanham Act also subjects the States to suit, \nbut that provision has now been held unconstitutional. Last week, the \nSupreme Court held in College Savings Bank versus Florida Prepaid \nPostsecondary Education Expense Board that federal courts were without \nauthority to entertain these suits for false and misleading \nadvertising, absent the State's waiver of sovereign immunity. This case \n(as well as the other two Supreme Court cases decided the same day), \nraise a number of important copyright, federalism and other issues, but \ndo not effect the provision in the bill that waives Federal government \nimmunity from suit.\n  Fouirth, the bill provides a limited amendment to the Lanham Act to \nprovide that in an action for trade dress infringement, where the \nmatter sought to be protected is not registered with the PTO, the \nplaintiff has the burden of proving that the trade dress is not \nfunctional. This will help promote fair competition and provide an \nincentive for registration.\n  Finally, this bill makes a number of technical ``clean-up'' \namendments relating to the ``Trademark Law Treaty Implementation Act,'' \nwhich was enacted at the end of the last Congress.\n  These bills represent a good start on the work before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee to update American intellectual property law to \nensure that it serves to advance and protect American interests both \nhere and abroad. I began, however, with the list of copyright, patent \nand trademark issues that we should also address. We have a lot more \nwork to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/12/senate-section/article/S8254-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

His leadership in holding together the international \ncoalition during the Gulf War seems even more remarkable in recent \nyears, as other attempts to hold together a Persian Gulf alliance have \nfailed.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nLieberman, in bringing attention to a wonderful story by the \nindefatigable White House Correspondent, Trude Feldman. Few people \ncould provide such insight in profiling President George Bush on the \noccasion of his 75th birthday.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of Senator Lugar \nand myself to note the passing of another milestone for former \nPresident George Bush, a man the State of Connecticut considers a \nnative son. President Bush recently celebrated his 75th birthday in his \ntypically exuberant fashion, by jumping out of an airplane, just as he \ndid on his 70th birthday.\n  After such a long and distinguished career of public service--which \nstarted in the South Pacific, where he put his life on the line for the \ncause of freedom, and which culminated in the Persian Gulf, where he \nput his Presidency on the line to stand up to the brutal aggression of \nSaddam Hussein--it's hard for some to believe that President Bush would \nhave the interest, let alone the energy, to pursue his sky-diving habit \nas a septuagenarian.\n  But no one has ever accused the man who assembled and led the Gulf \nWar coalition to victory of taking the easy way out. And today, much as \nwe have grown to appreciate the fortitude and unobtrusive dignity he \nbrought to the Presidency, so too can we admire the vitality and vigor \nhe has brought to his life outside the Oval Office. He has shown \nhimself to be a man for all seasons, not to mention all altitudes.\n  Those estimable characteristics were vividly captured in a profile \nrecently penned by White House correspondent Trude B. Feldman to \ncommemorate President's Bush's birthday. To pay tribute to President \nBush on the passing of this important milestone, and in the spirit of \nbipartisanship, I would join with Senator Lugar in asking unanimous \nconsent to print the full text of Ms. Feldman's article in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times International]\n\n                           George Bush at 75\n\n                         (By Trude B. Feldman)\n\n       George Bush, the former President of the United States, \n     just turned 75 years old, and says, ``It doesn't hurt a \n     bit.''\n       In an interview to mark the milestone, he adds: ``I am \n     blessed with good health--very good health. Oh, one hip might \n     need replacing and the other might need a little shot of \n     something, but I still fast-walk--13 minutes per mile--enough \n     to get the aerobic effect going, yet not enough to pound the \n     old joints into agony.''\n       Nonetheless, prior to his birthday, he took another \n     parachute jump on the grounds of his presidential library at \n     Texas A & M University in College Station, Texas. The next \n     day, he participated in a fund-raising event for his Number \n     One cause--the fight against cancer--that will highlight the \n     role the Houston-based M.D. Anderson Cancer Center has played \n     in that fight. (It was leukemia that took the life of the \n     Bushes' daughter, Robin, in 1953 before her 4th birthday. \n     George Bush's father, Prescott S. Bush, a U.S. senator from \n     Connecticut (1953-62), also died of cancer--of the lung--on \n     Oct. 8, 1972, at age 77.)\n\n[[Page S8255]]\n\n       The father of five children--two of whom are the governors \n     of America's second and fourth largest states--George Bush \n     told me: ``Last November, when George W. was reelected \n     governor of Texas and Jeb (John Ellis Bush) was elected \n     governor of Florida, I was happier than when I was elected \n     President of the United States 10 years before.''\n       After his Inauguration as the 41st President on Jan. 20, \n     1989, George Bush went to the Oval Office in the White House. \n     In the top drawer of the presidential desk, he found a \n     handwritten note from President Ronald Reagan. On stationery \n     headed ``Don't Let the Turkeys Get You Down,'' the note read \n     ``Dear George, You will have moments when you want to use \n     this stationery. Well, go to it. I treasure the memories we \n     share and wish you the very best. You will be in my prayers. \n     God bless you and Barbara. I will miss our Thursday lunches . \n     . . Ron.''\n       As President and Vice President (from 1981 to 1989), the \n     two men ate lunch together every Thursday in the Oval Office \n     and shared each others' views on domestic issues and foreign \n     affairs as well as personal sentiments. To this day, neither \n     one has revealed those conversations. Despite their fierce \n     competition in the presidential primaries in 1980, Mr. Bush \n     had been genuinely loyal to Mr. Reagan in eight years as Vice \n     President.\n       Five years ago, while preparing a feature for George Bush's \n     70th birthday, I asked Ronald Reagan about those private \n     lunches. While not disclosing much of the substance of their \n     sessions, he did tell me that Mr. Bush was much more than a \n     silent partner and that his solid advice was always valued.\n       ``From those luncheons and from our constant interaction, I \n     got to know him well,'' Ronald Reagan told me. ``He was \n     always informed, understanding and decent. He was also wise, \n     honest and capable.''\n       Mr. Reagan added: ``No American Vice President should sit \n     on the sidelines, waiting; he should be like an executive \n     vice president of a corporation--active--and George was all \n     that. He was a part of all we did--during times of crises and \n     times of historic triumphs and achievements.''\n       In our interview, Mr. Reagan also recalled: ``As Vice \n     President, George led the task force to cut away excess \n     regulation, saving Americans 600 million man-hours of \n     paperwork a year and making possible millions of new jobs. He \n     also worked with our allies to strengthen NATO; and he helped \n     make possible the new INF (Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces) \n     Treaty. I'd say he helped to make our world much safer.''\n       Ronald Reagan noted that Mr. Bush also had launched a \n     successful major offensive against drug smuggling that \n     succeeded in blocking a record 70 tons of cocaine from ever \n     reaching our communities. ``In addition, he handled our Task \n     Force on Terrorism that advised me on policy,'' Mr. Reagan \n     said. ``He was the architect of the plans we put into \n     effect.''\n       In defending Mr. Bush's role in the Iran-Contra affair--the \n     crisis that engulfed and threatened his presidency--Mr. \n     Reagan emphasized: ``George had been completely honest. He \n     was supportive of our policy--to establish communication with \n     the pragmatic leadership in Iran with the goal of eventually \n     renewing U.S.-Iranian relations. Yes, he had some \n     reservations, but that often happened with other issues. For \n     example, when we discussed and debated any policy at our \n     Cabinet meetings--some Cabinet members still had reservations \n     after I made a decision. But once the decision was made, they \n     supported it. That's what George did--he supported my \n     decision.''\n       According to George Bush, who visited with Ronald Reagan \n     two years ago, it was President Reagan who had set the stage \n     for the world to change. ``President Reagan contributed by \n     building a foundation of principles that is solid,'' Mr. Bush \n     remembers, ``and I was proud to build upon that.''\n       Born in June 1924, in Milton, Mass., George Herbert Walker \n     Bush was named for his mother's father. George Bush's mother, \n     Dorothy, died of a stroke at age 91. ``Even at 90 she was the \n     moral leader of our family and the idol of our children and \n     grandchildren,'' he recalls. ``I often think of her advice on \n     the fundamentals--to be tolerant, to turn the other cheek, to \n     stand against discrimination and for fair play.'' He credits \n     her with instilling in him a respect for principles and \n     values that motivate him to this day. ``She was the \n     personification of everything that is good, everything that \n     is for our family--the Christian ethic,'' he adds. ``She set \n     examples. She would discipline us, then put her arms around \n     us and love us.''\n       The Rev. Billy Graham, who first met George Bush through \n     his relationship with the senior Bushes, describes Dorothy \n     Bush as a ``woman of God, a wonderful Bible student, who \n     constantly emphasized spirituality, honesty and integrity.''\n       In an interview, Rev. Graham also told me that George Bush \n     is ``one of the best and most loyal friends I ever had. I \n     admire him for the way he loves his family and friends; for \n     the way he handled his near-death experience in World War II \n     when his plane was shot down; and for his courageous speeches \n     on controversial issues.''\n       Describing George Bush as ``one of America's greatest \n     presidents who provided excellent leadership and brought to \n     the office close family ties and strong religious faith,'' \n     Rev. Graham adds that Mr. Bush had also put the presidency on \n     a high level and maintained the dignity of the office that \n     Ronald Reagan bequeathed to him.\n       Rev. Graham led the prayers at George Bush's Inauguration \n     for President in 1989 as well as for the swearing-in \n     ceremonies for Gov. George W. Bush in 1995 and Gov. Jeb Bush \n     in 1999.\n       While George Bush was the leader of the Free World, his \n     five children knew him as their loving, attentive father--a \n     constant, guiding influence on their lives. They, in turn, \n     have proven to be loving children who did their part to give \n     him a lasting place in history as well as to sustain his \n     pride in them. In addition to the two governor sons--there \n     are Marvin and Neil, both businessmen, and Dorothy (Doro), \n     still the apple of her father's eye.\n       At the time of Doro's birth, in August 1959, in Houston, \n     Texas, her father was in the offshore oil-drilling business. \n     Since then, he has been a two-term congressman from Texas \n     (1967-71); U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations (1971-73); \n     chairman of the Republican National Committee (1973-74); \n     chief of the U.S. Liaison office in Beijing (1974); director \n     of the Central Intelligence Agency (1976); Vice President of \n     the United States (1981-89), and President of the United \n     States (1989-93).\n       Rather than complain about the demands on her peripatetic \n     father's time over the years, Doro expresses pride in his \n     achievements and reflects on their relationship. She says her \n     father has given her a strong sense of security and has \n     enhanced her life. ``No matter how hard he worked in his \n     various jobs, he took time for family, friends and small \n     kindnesses, which really meant so much,'' she adds. ``I'm now \n     the mother of four children, and I try to instill my dad's \n     teachings in them.''\n       She says that his high positions did not change him as a \n     father--that he has always had a gentle, personal touch and, \n     to this day, continues to care about the details in each of \n     his children's lives. ``He still writes us special notes,'' \n     she says, ``and his sense of humor and optimistic outlook \n     haven't changed. And now, even on his 75th birthday, he isn't \n     comfortable focusing attention on himself.''\n       George Bush says that he has allowed his children to do \n     their own thing. ``Barbara and I decided that they were \n     strong enough to chart their own course, to lead their own \n     lives,'' he says. ``They do not often need fine-tuning advice \n     from their parents.''\n       As for Marvin, Neil and Doro, he says, they are good \n     children and happy out of politics. ``George and Jeb, in \n     spite of the ugliness of the times, have decided to get into \n     politics,'' he told me. ``Having two sons as governors is a \n     blessing that I cannot describe. I am proud of them and I \n     don't want to see them hurt in what, unfortunately, has \n     become a mean, intrusive political climate. They are honest \n     and honorable men with wonderful families of their own and \n     with nothing to be ashamed of. But some in the press have \n     literally gone well beyond the bounds of just plain common \n     decency. And, as you know, I have disdain for the policies of \n     destruction.''\n       Why, then, I asked, in view of today's destructive \n     atmosphere, does George Bush want his two sons in the \n     political arena?\n       ``Because,'' he responds, ``I believe if good and competent \n     people are unwilling to get involved, our whole system of \n     democracy is diminished.''\n       When contemplating his legacy, does he think in terms of \n     his two governor sons as being an extension of him?\n       ``Regarding George W. and Jeb, I do not think in terms of \n     legacy,'' he replies. ``I just take great pride in two \n     extraordinarily able and strong men who, on their own--\n     without their father's help--have already gone a long way.''\n       He adds that marrying the mother of his five kids was the \n     best decision he made in his personal life. ``That was 54\\1/\n     2\\ years ago,'' George Bush reminisces. ``I first met Barbara \n     Pierce at a Christmas party, just after Pearl Harbor was \n     attacked. I was 17 and she was 16. The U.S. was at war, so \n     ours was a wartime romance. Ever since, to me, it has been a \n     classic love story.\n       ``We found we had much in common, even our sense of humor. \n     When I graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy (a preparatory \n     school in Andover, Mass., on June 4, 1942), I took Barbara to \n     the senior prom.''\n       Eight days, later, his 18th birthday, he enlisted in the \n     U.S. Navy as a Seaman Second Class. In 1943, he earned his \n     wings and was commissioned as the youngest naval aviator, \n     assigned to USS San Jacinto in the Pacific.\n       At the time of his marriage, on Jan. 6, 1945, a man under \n     21 years of age needed parental consent to marry; a woman \n     over 18 did not. Mr. Bush's brother, Prescott, remembers that \n     19\\1/2\\-year-old Barbara was ``really ticked'' that her 20\\1/\n     2\\-year-old fiance--a war hero with a Distinguished Flying \n     Cross--had to get his parents' permission to marry. And \n     despite teasing suggestions that two Geminis are usually not \n     compatible--the ``warnings'' still amuse the Bushes. (Mrs. \n     Bush was also born in June--on the 8th.) She recalls that the \n     timing of their wedding was determined by world events, \n     because had it not been for the war, she believes neither \n     family would have consented to their marrying at that young \n     age.\n       Today, Mr. Bush admits to many disappointments--personally \n     and in politics, even in the Oval Office--``but none that \n     have shaken our happy marriage.''\n       As a boy, George Bush often went to Yankee Stadium (in New \n     York) with his father and had youthful hopes of one day \n     playing first base there. Years later, when baseball great \n     Babe Ruth came to Yale University to present his papers at a \n     ceremony at the stadium, George Bush, as captain of the\n\n[[Page S8256]]\n\n     baseball team, was chosen to receive the papers in behalf of \n     the university. (Mr. Bush graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a \n     degree in economics from Yale in 1948--the year Babe Ruth \n     died.)\n       ``Meeting Babe Ruth,'' he recalls, ``was one of the most \n     memorable days of my young life.''\n       While George Bush did not go on to a career in baseball, he \n     is, today, one senior citizen who is the personification of \n     the premise that there is life after 40--even after 75. He is \n     in great demand the world over for speaking engagements on \n     all subjects and issues. Since leaving the White House, he \n     has visited some 55 foreign countries. Last week, he was in \n     Korea and Thailand, as well as in Hong Kong, where he spoke \n     at The International Bank of Asia.\n       On the lecture circuit, he recently addressed organizations \n     such as the American Medical Association and the American \n     Hotel & Motel Association.\n       To what does he attribute his long, happy and healthy life?\n       ``Possibly because I was so active,'' he says. ``And I've \n     always been involved in competitive sports.''\n       He still revels in fresh-air sports--fishing, swimming, \n     high-speed boating, camping, golf and horseshoes. His passion \n     for pitching horseshoes was once so strong that he built a \n     horseshoe court with two pits on the grounds of the White \n     House when he was its occupant.\n       ``Physically, I'm still in good shape and feel young at \n     heart,'' he says, ``but there are things I cannot do anymore, \n     like jogging and tennis (he has played with tennis \n     champs Billie Jean King and Chris Evert). I travel a lot \n     and have tons of energy. Oh, once in a while, I get really \n     tired, but I'm lucky with my physical condition.''\n       Does aging bother him?\n       ``Not in the least,'' he says. ``I haven't lost interest in \n     events, nor have my body and health deserted me. The only \n     thing about aging that does bother me is that I want to be \n     here on Earth long enough to see my grandkids--all 14 of \n     them--grow up and be happily married, raising their own kids. \n     That would be the best things that could happen to me after a \n     full and happy and lucky life.''\n       He says he worries about the decline and disintegration of \n     today's American family. ``I'm convinced that this decline \n     leads to the many social and cultural problems facing our \n     nation,'' he adds. ``Thank God, we have mentors and `other \n     points of light' willing to help the neglected kids, to read \n     to them, to love them. But so many slip through the cracks. \n     When the parents go AWOL, the kids are hurt and our society \n     suffers.''\n       Turning to his years in the White House, Mr. Bush says \n     that, as President, one of his best decisions was selecting \n     Colin L. Powell as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \n     (During his years in the highest military position in the \n     Department of Defense, Gen. Powell oversaw 28 crises, \n     including Operation Desert Storm in the 1991 Persian Gulf \n     War.) ``Another important decision, once it became clear we \n     had to fight in Desert Storm, was to put full confidence in \n     the military and not try to second-guess them or change the \n     mission,'' Mr. Bush told me. ``My team and I did the \n     diplomacy, and then, when we had to go to war, we let the \n     military, under the leadership of Gen. Powell; Dick Cheney \n     (Secretary of Defense) and Norman Schwarzkopf (commanding \n     general of the U.S. forces in the Gulf) and others, fight and \n     win.''\n       Gen. Powell, also a National Security Advisor in the Reagan \n     White House and now chairman of ``America's Promises--The \n     Alliance for Youth,'' told me: ``I considered George Bush a \n     tremendous Commander in Chief. And as President of the U.S., \n     he brought class, character and dignity to the office.''\n       George Bush emphasizes that the decision to commit troops \n     to battles is the most onerous a Chief Executive can make. \n     His most difficult moment in the Oval Office, he recalls, was \n     when he had to decide whether or not to send someone's son or \n     daughter to war. ``To commit one to fight--to put one in \n     harms' way,'' he stresses, ``is the toughest of all calls.'' \n     I did this in Panama, in the Gulf and Somalia, but I did it \n     knowing we were going to give them full support--to enable \n     them to complete their mission, to win and come home.\n       ``This we did. I regret that the mission in Somalia changed \n     after I left the White House. I do not like mission creep (an \n     evolution of the mission away from its originally stated \n     purpose). I was proud of our military in all three actions.''\n       He adds, ``You know, I miss dealing with our military \n     because I believe in `duty, honor, country.' My own military \n     experience in WW II well equipped me to wrestle with the \n     problems of military action. That also instilled in me a \n     respect for those who do their duty for our country. I was \n     proud to wear our uniform in WW II, and when I was Commander \n     in Chief I took pride in my support of the military.''\n       Two years ago, when George Bush jumped from an altitude of \n     12,5000 feet and opened his parachute canopy at 4,000 feet \n     above the Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona, he called that feat \n     a great thrill. ``I was alone, at peace,'' he recalls. ``I \n     was floating into the tranquil sands of Yuma.''\n       That jump was in keeping with a personal vow to ``some day, \n     do it right'' (jumping from a plane) he made after Sept. 2, \n     1944, when he bailed out of his flaming torpedo bomber near \n     Japanese-held Chichi Jima Island, some 150 miles from Iwo \n     Jima. After five hours in the water, he was rescued by a \n     submarine.\n       I asked George Bush if the pilot--recently downed over \n     Serbia in the former Republic of Yugoslavia--brought back \n     memories of when he was shot down as a Navy pilot 55 years \n     ago.\n       ``To some degree, yes, it did, because, like this pilot, I \n     was shot down near the enemy,'' he remembers. ``I wasn't sure \n     that I would be rescued. Neither was this pilot sure he would \n     be found. I knew the Navy would go all out to find me. This \n     pilot felt sure his comrades in arms would go the extra mile \n     to rescue him. He prayed, and so did I--so, yes, there are \n     some similarities.''\n       If George Bush could have had his life to live again, what \n     would he have done differently?\n       ``I would not do anything differently,'' he answers with an \n     air of finality. ``My life has been a good one--satisfying \n     and rewarding. I did not set a grand design for my career. I \n     just tried to do well in each of my jobs and lead a \n     meaningful life.\n       ``I also tried to make a difference in the lives of others. \n     I have always cared about the welfare of others.''\n       Attesting to Mr. Bush's self-assessment, former Attorney \n     General Dick Thornburgh told me that throughout his \n     presidency, George Bush exhibited an extraordinary \n     sensitivity to questions of law and justice and the \n     protection of the civil rights and civil liberties of all \n     Americans. ``Nowhere,'' Mr. Thornburgh states, ``was this \n     more evident than in President Bush's support for the \n     Americans With Disabilities Act--which he signed into law on \n     July 26, 1990.''\n       Mr. Thornburgh, a former governor of Pennsylvania, adds, \n     ``This important civil rights legislation--strongly \n     championed by the President during its considerations by \n     Congress--provides a significant vehicle to secure access to \n     the mainstream of American society for those 54 million \n     Americans with physical, mental and sensory disabilities. \n     (Thornburgh's son, Peter, now 39, was the victim of a car \n     accident in 1960 when he was 4 months old. He suffered \n     serious brain injuries, causing mental retardation.)\n       ``In this, as in other endeavors, George Bush's compassion \n     and commitment to justice for all was an inspiration to those \n     of us privileged to serve in his administration.''\n       Manifesting his concern for human rights, Mr. Bush visited \n     the infamous Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz in Poland \n     in 1987 when he was Vice President of the United States. He \n     then told me that that visit made him determined not just to \n     remember the Holocaust, but, more important, to strengthen \n     his resolve to renew America's commitment to human rights the \n     world over.\n       He quoted Nobel Peace Laureate Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust \n     survivor who this week is in Macedonia, visiting refugees \n     from Kosovo: ``In extreme situations, when human lives and \n     dignity are at stake, neutrality is a sin.''\n       Elie Wiesel, now a professor at Boston University, spoke at \n     a recent Millennium Evening at the White House on ``The \n     Perils of Indifference: Lessons Learned From a Violent \n     Century.'' He later told me that in the years he has know \n     George Bush, he always found him to be sensitive to issues \n     related to human rights.\n       ``As Vice President, he directed the rescue mission that \n     brought the surviving remnant of Ethiopian Jews to Israel,'' \n     he adds, ``and he was instrumental in enabling a group of \n     Nobel laureates to go to Poland, still under the dictatorship \n     of Gen. Jaruzelski.''\n       If he had his presidency to live over, what would George \n     Bush have done differently?\n       ``I would like to have been a better communicator so I \n     could have convinced the American people in 1992 that we were \n     not in a depression, that the economy had recovered,'' he \n     says. ``We handed the Clinton Administration a fast-\n     growing economy, but I could not convince the people or \n     the media that this was so.''\n       He describes as ``wonderful'' his 12 years in the White \n     House as Vice President and President, but he continues to \n     feel a sense of ``sadness'' that he was not given another \n     four years ``to finish what I had begun.''\n       In Rev. Graham's view, George Bush lost that election \n     ``mainly because his campaign people did not work hard \n     enough, and some of his advisors gave him wrong advice. There \n     was also an element of over-confidence due to the favorable \n     polls.''\n       Gen. Brent Scowcroft, Mr. Bush's National Security Advisor, \n     still considers it a ``tragedy'' that George Bush lost the \n     1992 election and did not have four more years ``to build the \n     sense of closeness with other foreign leaders--which could \n     have done so much to promote a closer world community.''\n       For his part, Mr. Bush continues, that if he had had his \n     way, he would have won the election ``because I would have \n     done a better job of getting out the facts and the benefit of \n     our programs, and I would have gotten more legislation \n     through Congress.\n       ``For instance, the economy was better than it had been \n     reported,'' he recalls, ``but the media pounded me on how bad \n     things were. When I said we were not in recession, the press \n     ridiculed me. It turned out that the recession ended in the \n     spring of 1991.''\n       If he could turn back the clock, what decisions would he \n     have changed?\n       ``Given the way history worked out, raising taxes was not \n     good because it got at my word,'' he recalls. ``People said \n     that I broke\n\n[[Page S8257]]\n\n     my word, and that is a regret. Raising taxes was my worst \n     desision. I lost the election because of the economy. Yet, \n     what I was saying--at the time--about the economy was true.''\n       On other decisions, Mr. Bush believes that his wisest was \n     having ``mobilized the world to stand up against aggression'' \n     in the Persian Gulf.\n       He describes the start of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait as ``a \n     critical moment in world history.''\n       On that night--Jan. 16, 1991--he invited Rev. Billy Graham \n     to the White House for private prayers. The next morning, \n     Rev. Graham conducted a prayer service for the Bush Cabinet, \n     congressional leaders and Marines at a chapel in Ft. Myer, a \n     military compound in Virginia. ``Our prayers were for a short \n     war,'' Rev. Graham says, ``and one that would be followed by \n     a long period of peace in the Mideast.''\n       He also told me that George Bush will be remembered in \n     history for having put together a coalition of nations in the \n     Gulf War, and that much of that was due to his own \n     relationship with world leaders. ``He got along well with \n     them,'' he adds, ``and that means a great deal during \n     crises.''\n       For his accomplishments, Mr. Bush cites his housing \n     initiatives, his education program--America 2000--and his \n     national energy strategy. He says he was more successful when \n     he was able to work with state governors on issues such as \n     his welfare reform programs, his crime-prevention initiative \n     and the Americans With Disabilities Act. ``MY Administration \n     deserved credit for those initiatives,'' he recalls, ``and we \n     received none.''\n       In foreign affairs, Mr. Bush considers among his most \n     significant achievements the START II Treaty, which he signed \n     in Moscow (Jan. 3, 1993) during his last foreign trip as \n     President. He also singles out Desert Storm, the U.N. \n     coalition in 1991 to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi domination.\n       He says he was satisfied with START II, and, in terms of \n     history Desert Storm led to many things, like people talking \n     peace in the Midwest and the U.S. being the sole country to \n     which people turn to solidify their democracies. He notes \n     that his secretary of State, James A. Baker III, initiated \n     the Mideast peace process that began with multilateral talks \n     in Madrid in October 1991. ``We made dramatic strides, which \n     history will record,'' he states. ``You would never believe \n     that Arabs and Israelis would be talking to each other. No \n     one thought we could get that done. Well, at least we got \n     it started, and that happened largely because of Desert \n     Storm.''\n       Mr. Bush recalls that he learned much from the courage of \n     Russian President Boris Yeltsin, when, in August 1991, he \n     climbed on a tank to talk to the crowd supporting him against \n     the hard-line Communists. ``I was appreciative of what Mr. \n     Yeltsin said about me being his first and most stalwart \n     supporter.''\n       With all of his accomplishments, what continues to trouble \n     George Bush and his associates is the perception that he was \n     a ``wimp.'' In retrospect, how does he view that image?\n       ``I never convinced the Washington press corps of what my \n     real heartbeat was about,'' he says. ``I don't think I came \n     through as a caring person, and one with a sense of humor. \n     And the press felt I was posturing to get away from my Ivy \n     League background when I played horseshoes or listened to \n     country music. Some, like Newsweek (in 1988), had me down as \n     `wimp.' Some said I wasn't tough enough. I believe my record \n     in life entitled me to a better assessment than that, but I \n     couldn't get around their misperceptions.''\n       According to Rev. Billy Graham, George Bush is ``anything \n     but a wimp--look how he handled the Gulf War. Everyone has \n     faults, but he has fewer than almost any leader I have \n     known.''\n       Gen. Scowcroft--co-author with Mr. Bush of ``A World \n     Transformed'' (Knopf, 1998)--puts it this way. ``One \n     misperception is what became known as the `wimp factor.' That \n     was the view that he was unwilling to make tough decisions or \n     stand up for his beliefs. That was a total misperception \n     because he fully demonstrated his decisive manner in the way \n     he, as President, conducted the foreign and military policy \n     of the United States. By the time he became President, he was \n     not only a true foreign policy professional but he knew the \n     leaders of virtually every country. That enabled him to \n     establish a personal diplomacy that I believe is without \n     parallel in the presidency. He communicated directly with an \n     enormous number of foreign leaders. He listened to their \n     problems, explained his views, discussed what U.S. policy \n     was, or should be, thus adding a new and invaluable dimension \n     to America's ability to act and be received as the leader of \n     the world.\n       ``Another misperception is that he is a patrician or a blue \n     blood with an aristocratic approach. But that's not so. He is \n     warm, friendly and outgoing. I never saw him, even as \n     President, put on airs or any kind of imperial manner.''\n       Further describing George Bush, the man, Gen. Scowcroft \n     says that in the years he has known him, he has ``developed \n     and become broad and deeper, because he is wiling and eager \n     to learn. He was, and is, a patient listener and has a good \n     way of eliciting the views of others on all issues.''\n       He adds that, as President, George Bush's judgment was \n     basically instinctive rather than analytical, but that it was \n     based on extensive probing discussions with principal \n     advisors before he made decisions.\n       Today, George Bush--looking younger than his age--presents \n     a picture of a man full of vitality and brimming with \n     confidence. He still possesses an innate sense of decency but \n     is a complex personality. He is as tenacious as he is \n     unassuming.\n       He singles out two of many turning points in his life: \n     joining the Navy in 1942 and moving from the East Coast to \n     Texas after graduating from Yale. ``These two moves really \n     changed my life in many ways,'' he recalls. ``My move to \n     Texas changed my life because I learned a lot about \n     entrepreneurship and risk-taking.''\n       His first job was as a clerk in an oil-equipment company in \n     Odessa, Texas, and he soon rose to become co-founder and \n     president of an oil-drilling company.\n       Twenty years ago, as a Republican Presidential candidate, \n     George Bush appeared on the NBC news program `MEET THE PRESS' \n     to explain why he should be elected President of the United \n     States; and how he would make a difference in American life--\n     from the Oval Office.\n       ``I believe a man can make a difference,'' he pointed out. \n     ``I'd like to re-awaken our sense of pride in ourselves as it \n     applies to our relationships abroad.'' People abroad are \n     wondering, `Does the United States want to lead the free \n     world anymore?'\n       He also told the Christian Science Monitor's Godfrey \n     Sperling: ``I want to demonstrate, and help Americans \n     demonstrate--given our strengths--that we can cope and solve \n     problems, particularly our domestic economy. Once we solve \n     these problems, I believe we can offer a better life to \n     everybody in America. So I am motivated by that.\n       ``I also want to re-awaken a sense of pride by putting \n     stars in the eyes of our children.''\n       How has his philosophy changed over the years?\n       ``I am not sure there has been a fundamental change,'' he \n     told me. ``I hope I have become more tolerant of the \n     different opinions of others. I feel even more convinced that \n     the United States of America must stay involved in the world \n     and be the leader.\n       ``You know, there was a time during the Cold War days when \n     I had only disdain for Russia and China. That has changed a \n     lot. We must stay engaged with both nations. We must look at \n     the big picture and work closely with both of these powers--\n     not doing it their way, but not always bashing them, \n     either.''\n       I asked George Bush for his views on the current crisis in \n     Kosovo.\n       His response: ``I will not criticize President Clinton and, \n     thus, will say nothing more.''\n       Concerning the revelations of surreptitious Chinese \n     espionage allegedly involving four American administrations, \n     Gen. Scowcroft, speaking for the Bush Administration, told \n     me: ``In the four years as President Bush's National Security \n     Advisor, I do not recall an issue of Chinese espionage at the \n     nuclear labs being brought to my attention.''\n       Dr. Condoleezza Rice, director of Soviet and East European \n     Affairs, national Security Council in the Bush Administration \n     (1989-91), told me that there is no one who is more deserving \n     of the title `public servant' than George Bush.\n       ``I most appreciated his integrity and his devotion to \n     America,'' She adds. ``And I'm especially grateful to him for \n     the way that he handled the end of the Cold War.''\n       Dr. Rice, now provost at Stanford University, notes that in \n     the former president's book, ``A World Transformed,'' Mr. \n     Bush describes his final phone conversation with Mikhail \n     Gorbachev only moments before the Soviet president resigned \n     and brought to an end 75 years of Soviet communism.\n       ``Mr. Gorbachev was clearly looking for affirmation that \n     this fateful decision would be good for the word.'' Dr. Rice \n     points out. ``Why, might you ask, would the Soviet president \n     call the President of the U.S. at that moment? It speaks \n     volumes about how President Bush had managed difficult \n     issues. He was tough, vigorously pursuing America's interests \n     and skillful in his diplomacy.\n       ``His leadership was quite and persistent. But he was also \n     compassionate and humane. He found a way to treat this great, \n     defeated, but still dangerous adversary with respect and \n     dignity. That, more than anything, allowed the Soviet Union \n     to slip quietly into the night--to collapse with a whimper, \n     not a bang. We all owe President Bush a great debt for \n     that.''\n       As George Bush's secretary of State, James A. Baker III \n     traveled to 90 foreign countries as the U.S. confronted the \n     unprecedented challenges and opportunities of the post-Cold \n     War era. ``I think history will treat George Bush very, very \n     well,'' Mr. Baker told me. ``He was president at a time of \n     remarkable global changes. The world, as he and I had known \n     it all our adult lives, changed fundamentally with the \n     collapse of communism, the end of the Cold War and the \n     implosion of the Soviet Union.\n       ``In addition, during his presidency, America successfully \n     fought the Gulf War and Panama. Through his leadership, \n     Germany was reunified as a member of NATO and Israel and all \n     of her Arab neighbors negotiated face to face for the first \n     time at the Madrid peace conference.\n       ``President Bush managed all of this with skill and \n     dexterity. As a result, America was respected by our allies \n     and feared by our adversaries--the way it should be.''\n       Secretary Baker adds: ``Another accomplishment was to make \n     the national security apparatus of our nation work the way it \n     should--without the usual rivalries, backbiting and \n     counterproductive leaking to the\n\n[[Page S8258]]\n\n     press. That enabled us to manage properly the historic \n     changes that occurred around the world from 1989 to 1992.''\n       Baker, an intimate Bush friend of 40 years, also served in \n     1997 as the personal envoy of U.N. Secretary General Kofi \n     Annan to mediate direct talks between the parties to the \n     dispute over Western Sahara.\n       ``Friendships mean a lot to George,'' Jim Baker writes in \n     his book ``The Politics of Diplomacy'' (Putman, 1995). \n     ``Indeed, his loyalty to friends is one of his defining \n     personal strengths. Yet some have suggested it became one of \n     his greatest political weaknesses and that out of concern for \n     their friendship, he stayed loyal for too long to people who \n     hurt his presidency.''\n       Gen Scowcroft concurs: ``If I observed any faults, it was \n     perhaps that George Bush was too loyal in that he would \n     support colleagues and associates even after it had become \n     apparent that they were not adequately suited to the jobs \n     they held or were about to hold.''\n       In 1974, when Mr. Bush was head of the liaison office in \n     China, it was a restricted period as far as contact with the \n     Chinese leaders was concerned. Nonetheless, he set out to \n     learn about the people and the country. He even studied \n     Chinese. He and Mr. Bush bicycled around Beijing, asked \n     questions, invited the people to their home and developed a \n     real feel for them and their culture.\n       In 1976, when Mr. Bush was appointed by President Ford to \n     be director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Gen. \n     Scowcroft was his (Ford's) National Security Advisor. ``I saw \n     how George Bush was learning more and more about foreign \n     policy,'' Gen. Scowcroft says.\n       ``It was not so much his foreign policy expertise, although \n     he was well versed as a result of his U.N. and China \n     positions, but what he did in restoring the morale and self-\n     respect of the CIA. The morale at CIA was at rock bottom \n     after the congressional investigations of the Pike and Church \n     committees. Even today, Mr. Bush is considered to be the \n     agency's most revered CIA director.''\n       One birthday gift George Bush considers especially \n     significant is the 258-acre complex named after him in the \n     Central Intelligence Agency's headquarters in Langley, Va.--\n     the first Washington, D.C.-area tribute to him.\n       Last October, President Clinton signed legislation \n     authorizing the designation of the George Bush Center for \n     Intelligence, and, in a letter, read by CIA Director George \n     Tenet at the recent dedication ceremony, Mr. Clinton noted \n     that when George Bush assumed his duties as director of the \n     CIA (1976), the Vietnam War had just ended, the Watergate \n     scandal was still an unhealed national wound, and government \n     investigations had exposed abuses of power in connection with \n     intelligence activities.\n       ``Many Americans had lost faith in government and asked \n     whether the CIA should continue to exist,'' President Clinton \n     noted. ``George Bush restored morale and discipline to the \n     Agency while publicly emphasizing the value of intelligence \n     to the nation's security, and he also restored America's \n     trust in the CIA and the rest of the intelligence community.\n       ``I have been well served by the talented and dedicated men \n     and women who make up the intelligence community that George \n     Bush did so much to preserve and strengthen.''\n       The ceremony was attended by former CIA Directors Richard \n     Helms, James Schlessinger, Robert Gates and William Webster. \n     Mr. Tenet hailed George Bush--the only director to have \n     become President of the United States--as a war hero and said \n     that every component of the Agency ``feels indebted to him in \n     some way--because his belief in the fundamental importance of \n     its work never faltered.\n       ``He was a staunch defender of the need for human \n     intelligence--for espionage--at a tough time when it really \n     counted.''\n       Mr. Tenet also pointed out that each day, the men and women \n     of the CIA provide the President of the United States and \n     other decision-makers the critical intelligence they need to \n     protect American lives and advance American interests around \n     the globe. ``Thanks in great measure to George Bush's \n     leadership, the U.S. no longer confronts the worldwide threat \n     from a rival superpower that we did during the Cold War,'' he \n     stated. ``But, as the 21st century approaches, we must \n     contend with a host of other dangerous challenges--\n     challenges of unprecedented complexity and scope.\n       ``The U.S. remains the indispensable country in this \n     uncertain and chaotic world. And time and again, the CIA has \n     proven itself to be the indispensable intelligence \n     organization, helping America build a more secure world for \n     people everywhere.''\n       Accepting a model of the sign bearing the name of the \n     compound, George Bush--in his remarks--observed: ``My stay \n     here had a major impact on me. The CIA became part of my \n     heartbeat some 22 years ago, and it has never gone away. I \n     hope it will be said that in my time here, and in the White \n     House, I kept the trust and treated my office with respect.''\n       And to the assembled CIA employees, Mr. Bush added: ``Your \n     mission is different now from what it was in my time. The \n     Soviet Union is no more. Some people think, `What do we need \n     intelligence for?'\n       ``My answer is that plenty of enemies abound . . . \n     unpredictable leaders willing to export instability or to \n     commit crimes against humanity. Proliferation of weapons of \n     mass destruction, terrorism, narco-trafficking, people \n     killing each other, fundamentalists killing one another in \n     the name of God, and many more.\n       ``To combat them, we need more intelligence, not less. We \n     need more human intelligence and more protection for the \n     methods we use to gather intelligence and more protection for \n     our sources, particularly our human sources who risk their \n     lives for their country.''\n       Mr. Bush went on to say that even though he is now a \n     ``tranquil guy,'' he has ``contempt and anger for those who \n     betray the trust'' be exposing the names of our \n     (intelligence) sources.\n       ``They are, in my view, the most insidious of traitors,'' \n     he asserted. ``George Tenet is exactly right when it comes to \n     the mission of the CIA and the intelligence community. `Give \n     the President and the policy-makers the best possible \n     intelligence product and stay out of the policymaking or \n     policy implementing--except as specifically decreed in the \n     law.''\n       George Bush has always been hesitant to talk about \n     himself--even as to how he made a difference as President. \n     ``You ask others,'' he tells me, ``I am not good at talking \n     about myself. That is part of my make-up. Some people say it \n     is lack of character, but I can't blow my own horn. My mother \n     taught me not to brag and she is still watching me.''\n       Respecting his penchant for modesty, I did ask others--\n     including former American presidents, as well as the current \n     one--for their reflections and comments on George Bush's \n     milestone.\n       Former President Gerald R. Ford said: ``President Bush, at \n     75, has earned the highest compliments for his strong and \n     effective military and diplomatic leadership in the Gulf War \n     with Iraq.''\n       Former President Jimmy Carter says: ``From one \n     septuagenarian to another, I, of course, wish George Bush a \n     wonderful birthday and many more years of good health and \n     much happiness.\n       ``He is a man of integrity who served America with honor. \n     We had a very good relationship while he was in the White \n     House, and even though we did not agree on every issue, he \n     treated me with respect and kindness.\n       ``I always shared my invitations to foreign countries with \n     him or with Secretary of State James Baker, and they were \n     supportive of our work at the Carter Center (in Atlanta, \n     Ga).''\n       Jimmy Carter adds that he and his wife, Rosalynn \n     ``thoroughly enjoyed'' attending the opening of the Bush \n     Presidential Library. (On Nov. 6, 1997, the library and \n     museum, together with the George Bush School of Government \n     and Public Service, were opened.)\n       President William Jefferson Clinton recalls with gratitude \n     his wide-ranging conversations with George Bush four months \n     ago as they flew on Air Force One to and from Jordan for King \n     Hussein's funeral. (Former Presidents Ford and Carter were \n     also aboard.)\n       ``George Bush embodies the spirit of public service,'' Mr. \n     Clinton told me. ``For me, he has also been a trusted \n     advisor. While there are many who advise me, at times the \n     greatest counsel comes from one who has shared the pressures \n     and unique experience of serving in the Oval Office--one who \n     knows exactly what you're up against and one who will tell \n     you the truth.\n       ``George has often done that, and while I have been the \n     immediate beneficiary of his counsel, people here and abroad \n     have ultimately benefited most of all.''\n       Richard Fairbanks, President of the Center for Strategic & \n     International Studies (CSIS), advised Mr. Bush on policy \n     during his 1980 presidential bid. Later, as chief U.S. \n     negotiator for the Mideast peace process, he worked closely \n     with Vice President Bush. Ambassador Fairbanks recalls that \n     George Bush was seen as a pragmatic problem-solver rather \n     than a conceptualizer, ``which is one of the reasons he \n     encountered trouble with his famous statement that he was not \n     comfortable with `the vision thing.' ''\n       Mr. Fairbanks, a member of the Council of American \n     Ambassadors, adds that George Bush is a natural leader with \n     real intellectual depth, but he is also a private man, who is \n     ``not comfortable flaunting his thought processes in a public \n     forum.''\n       Edwin Meese, counselor to President Reagan (1981-85) and \n     U.S. Attorney General (1985-88), who is now The Ronald Reagan \n     Fellow in Public Policy at The Heritage Foundation, says that \n     he ``thoroughly appreciated the opportunity to work with \n     George Bush as Vice President because he was an invaluable \n     asset to President Reagan and to all of us in the Cabinet.''\n       In his 12 years as Vice President and President, George \n     Bush witnessed a number of scandals, including Watergate, \n     Irangate, Iran-Contra and the Savings and Loan bust.\n       On his last day in the Oval Office as president I asked him \n     how he would advise incoming President Bill Clinton to \n     prevent similar scandals.\n       ``If Governor Clinton asks me, I would tell him to be very \n     conscious of how he works with his staff; and to be sure \n     there are no loose cannons running around the White House,'' \n     Mr. Bush told me during that interview. ``People around a \n     President or Vice President or any high official can make or \n     break his image. So we each need to surround ourselves with \n     competent and caring individuals--men and women of integrity \n     who respect the presidency and live their own lives \n     accordingly.''\n       He adds: ``There is a need for revival of ethical behavior, \n     and exemplary conduct must come from officials and leaders. \n     It cannot be legislated.\n\n[[Page S8259]]\n\n       ``What mattered to me most in the White House was integrity \n     and responsibility. Public service has been damaged by people \n     who don't have the judgment to place the public's business \n     above their own self interest, and unethical conduct should \n     not be tolerated at any level of government.''\n       Mr. Bush went on to say that he was determined--at all \n     times--to treat the office of the presidency with respect and \n     not do anything that would cheapen or diminish it.\n       ``I still take pride in the fact that my administration was \n     clean and free of scandal,'' he says. ``We had not been \n     hounded by people using government jobs for personal gain. We \n     came to the White House with high ethical standards and we \n     left with heads high in that regard.''\n       And what did George Bush learn from his years in the White \n     House that has made a lasting impact on him?\n       ``I learned that the power to get things done is less than \n     some people believe,'' he remembers. ``Yes, the presidency is \n     magnified out of proportion. You can get some things done, \n     but you can't wave a wand to have everything work the way you \n     want it. The presidency is too complicated.\n       ``I also learned that the White House is surrounded by \n     history, and I left there with even more respect for \n     America's principles, more respect for the institution of the \n     presidency, and more respect for the civil servants, \n     including the staff of the executive residence and the \n     uniformed Secret Service officers, who make that magnificent \n     museum of a place into a real home for whoever is President \n     of the U.S. as well as for his family and guests.''\n       And since he departed the White House, in 1993, how, in his \n     view, has the presidency evolved?\n       ``Like many Americans, I have worried about the recent \n     happenings in and around the White House,'' George Bush told \n     me. ``But the presidency is a vital and strong and resilient \n     institution. Just as (former President) Jerry Ford instantly \n     restored honor to the Executive Mansion--after Watergate--so \n     will whoever is elected President in the year 2000.\n       ``Respect for the office is important and character and \n     behavior in that office do count. The office is not too big \n     for any individual, provided he or she can make tough \n     decisions and give credit to bright and experienced people \n     who should surround the Chief Executive.''\n       If George Bush could leave but one legacy, he wants it to \n     be a return to the moral compass that must guide America \n     through the next century.\n       ``And,'' he adds, ``I hope historians will say that I and \n     my Administration left the world a little more peaceful by \n     the way we handled the unification of Germany, the liberation \n     of Eastern Europe and the Baltics, as well as the way we \n     worked with the Soviet leaders to bring about change there, \n     and to get their support when we had to fight the Gulf War.''\n       ``I also hope my legacy will include the Madrid peace \n     conference (1992); our key role in NAFTA, the Brady Plan \n     (plan for debt relief for Latin America), and the way we \n     handled China after Tiananmen Square 10 years ago.\n       ``On a personal level, I hope my legacy will be that \n     `George Bush did his best and served America with honor.' ''\n       If he could have one wish on this birthday, what would it \n     be?\n       ``I am not sentimental,'' he says, ``but, yes, there is a \n     certain special quality to this milestone. For myself, I have \n     no wishes for my birthday. I have everything a man could \n     want. But, for the world, I would wish more peace; and for \n     America, I wish for stronger families and better values.''\n       And George Bush's vision for the next century?\n       ``I am optimistic about the 21st century,'' he told me. \n     ``With no superpower confrontation on the horizon, I believe \n     the next century can be one of peace--though there will \n     always be regional conflicts. But I, for one, am still \n     hopeful.''\n       And to share that hope, he likes to recount the time that \n     his wife, Barbara, was planting a flowering bush. She was \n     instructed to dig a deep bed, fill it with fertilizer and \n     firmly plant the bush by covering it with water and soil.\n       ``We were told that the plant would not bloom right away, \n     but that it would, after a year or so, and then for a long \n     time to come,'' he mused. ``Soon, we realized that she was \n     planting that flowering bush for our kids and grandkids and \n     great-grandkids.\n       ``So despite the vicissitudes we face now, and will face in \n     the future, I believe that that planting was not in vain. \n     Sure, we have problems in the U.S. and overseas, and the \n     world has the weapons to blow itself up. Yet my inner self \n     tells me that our great-grandkids will be around to enjoy \n     those flowers.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/12/senate-section/article/S8259-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  AID FOR RUSSIAN AND ROMANIAN ORPHANS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, before the recess, with the help and \nsupport of my colleagues Mr. Helms, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. McConnell, I \noffered an amendment to Senate Bill 1234, which would provide some \nrelief for the hundreds of thousands of orphans who find themselves \nconfined to institutions and have no one to provide the love, affection \nand guidance that they so desperately need. Sadly, the disruption and \nextreme poverty which followed the end of the Cold War Era has had a \ndevastating impact on the lives of the children in the Eastern block. \nIn both Russia and Romania, it is the children, the future of \ndemocracy, who are struggling to survive. It is my hope that the funds \ndesignated by this amendment will allow the governments in each of \nthese two countries to protect the health, safety and well being of \ntheir children and in doing so, build for a stronger and brighter \ntomorrow.\n  Specifically, this amendment ensures that $2,000,000 of the funding \nappropriated for aid to Russia and the Independent States is used to \nfurther the innovative efforts of nongovernmental organizations, such \nas Christian World Adoption Agency, to provide vocational and \nprofessional training for those children who are about to ``age out'' \nof orphanages. When this body created Independent Living, it recognized \nthat such training and support is essential to the future of the young \nadults who have, for whatever reason, grown up in an institution rather \nthan in a family. With the help of help organizations like Christian \nWorld, these children can be given the tools they need to become \nconfident and successful adults.\n  Further, my amendment provides that $4,400,000 of the funds provided \nfor aid to Eastern Europe and the Baltic States will be used to support \nthe Romanian Department of Child Protection and their work to save the \nlives and improve health of the more than 100,000 Romanian children in \norphanages. Just the other day, myself and several of my colleagues met \nwith the present Secretary of the Department of Child Protection, Dr. \nCristian Tabacaru. With great passion, Dr. Tabacaru painted for me a \npicture of the dire circumstances faced by his country's children. At \npresent, Romania has the highest infant mortality rate in Europe. What \nis worse, is that 60% of these deaths are from preventable causes such \nas malnutrition and premature births.\n  The Romanian Department of Child Protection is working desperately to \nsave their most precious resource, their children. They have instituted \nprograms that provide nutritional supplements to these children, they \nhave developed their first ever in-home foster care program and are \nworking to improve the services available for those with special needs. \nWhile they have made a great deal of progress in very little time, they \nneed and deserve our help. This small amount of money will help them \nout of their present crisis and to build a child welfare system of \nwhich they can be proud.\n  In closing, I want to again thank Mr. Helms, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \nMcConnell for their support of my amendment. As we continue to aid the \nchildren of this world, we can be confident that we are building the \nhope of a bright and wonderful future, a future in which few children \nwill grow up without a family to call their own.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/12/senate-section/article/S8259-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8259-S8260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA'S FISCAL YEAR 2000 BUDGET REQUEST \n                 ACT--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 46\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with section 202(c) of the District of Columbia \nFinancial Management and Responsibility Assistance Act of 1995 and \nsection 446 of the District of Columbia Self-Governmental \nReorganization Act, as amended, I am transmitting the District of \nColumbia's Fiscal Year 2000 Budget Request Act.\n  This proposed Fiscal Year 2000 Budget represents the major \nprogrammatic objectives of the Mayor, the Council of the District of \nColumbia, and the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and \nManagement Assistance Authority.

To ensure the solvency and to regulate the trade \n     practices of various providers of insurance in this state; \n     and\n       2. To provide adequate protection to the residents of this \n     state who purchase insurance from those providers, without \n     establishing an effective mechanism for the federal exercise \n     of that authority; and\n       Whereas, The purposes of H.R. 10 and S. 900 can be \n     accomplished without preempting the authority of this state \n     to regulate providers of insurance for the protection of its \n     residents; and\n       Whereas, This state currently has an effective system of \n     laws to monitor and ensure the financial stability of \n     providers of insurance and to protect the residents of this \n     state from unfair trade practices: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the Nevada Legislature hereby urges Congress to \n     ensure that the provisions of H.R. 10 S. 900 and any similar \n     federal legislation do not interfere with the jurisdiction of \n     this state to regulate providers of insurance for the \n     protection of its residents; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the house of Representatives and each member of \n     the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage and approval.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-244. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Illinois relative to reauthorization of the \n     Older Americans Act; to the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 39\n\n       Whereas, The Older Americans Act promotes the dignity and \n     value of every older person age 60 and over (numbering \n     2,000,000 in Illinois) through an Aging Network led by the \n     Illinois Department on Aging, 13 area agencies on aging, 233 \n     community-based senior service agencies, and 63 nutrition \n     services agencies throughout Illinois; and\n       Whereas, The Older Americans Act is a successful federal \n     program, with the U.S. Administration on Aging offering \n     leadership in\n\n[[Page S8264]]\n\n     Washington, D.C., the Illinois Department on Aging (the first \n     state department on aging in the nation) at the State level, \n     the area agencies on aging in 13 regions designated by the \n     State covering all of Illinois, and community-based senior \n     service agencies providing services in every community; and\n       Whereas, The Older Americans Act programs target resources \n     and services to those in greatest economic and social need, \n     promote the dignity and contributions of our senior citizens, \n     support transportation services, provide home care, assist \n     families and individuals with case management, guide those \n     challenged by the legal system through legal assistance, \n     provide for senior community service employment, offer \n     information and assistance, establish multi-purpose senior \n     centers as focal points on aging, serve congregate luncheon \n     and home-delivered meals, provide health promotion and \n     disease prevention activities, involve older persons in \n     nutrition education, reach out to families with respite \n     services for caregivers and small repair and home \n     modifications, provide opportunities, education, and \n     services, connect people in shared housing, and advocate to \n     public and private policy makers on the issues of importance \n     to older persons; and\n       Whereas, The success of this aging network over the past 31 \n     years is marked by the delivery of significant service to \n     older persons in their own homes and community with the \n     following services examples of that success:\n       (1) 374,538 recipients of access services, including \n     235,148 Information and Assistance Services clients and \n     68,493 recipients of Case Management Services;\n       (2) 53,450 recipients of in-home services, including \n     6,460,533 home-delivered meals to 41,305 elders;\n       (3) 185,520 recipients of community services, including \n     3,636,855 meals to 79,012 congregate meal participants at 647 \n     nutrition sites and services delivered from 170 Senior \n     Centers;\n       (4) 760 recipients of employment services, including 760 \n     senior community service employment program participants; and\n       (5) 98,600 recipients of nursing home ombudsman services; \n     and\n       Whereas, The organizations serving older persons employ \n     professionals dedicated to offering the highest level of \n     service and caring workers who every day provide in-home \n     care, rides, educational and social activities, shopping \n     assistance, advice, and hope to those in greatest isolation \n     and need; and\n       Whereas, The organizations serving older persons involve a \n     multi-generational corps of volunteers who contribute to the \n     governance, planning, and delivery of services to older \n     persons in their own communities through participation on \n     boards and advisory councils and in the provision of clerical \n     support, programming, and direct delivery of service to \n     seniors; and\n       Whereas, The Older Americans Act programs in Illinois \n     leverage local funding for aging services and encourage \n     contributions from older persons; and\n       Whereas, The Older Americans Act programs are the \n     foundation for the Illinois Community Care Program which \n     reaches out to those with the lowest incomes and greatest \n     frailty to provide alternatives to long-term care, and the \n     Illinois Elder Abuse and Neglect Interventions Program which \n     assists families in the most difficult of domestic situations \n     with investigation and practical interventions; and\n       Whereas, The Congress of the United States has not \n     reauthorized the Older Americans Act since 1995 and only \n     extends the program each year through level appropriations; \n     and\n       Whereas, Expansion of the Older Americans Act is proposed \n     in reauthorization legislation this year to offer family \n     caregiver support, increased numbers of home-delivered meals, \n     improved promotion of elder rights, consolidation of several \n     programs and sub-titles of the law: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate of the Ninety-first General \n     Assembly of the State of Illinois, the House of \n     Representatives concurring herein, That we urge the Congress \n     of the United States of America to reauthorize the Older \n     Americans Act this year; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be \n     delivered to the President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate, \n     the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and each \n     member of the Illinois congressional delegation.\n       Adopted by the Senate, May 26, 1999.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-245. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Maryland relative to state regulation of \n     self-funded employer-based health plans; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 7\n\n       Whereas, The McCarran-Ferguson Act, passed by the U.S. \n     Congress in 1945, established a statutory framework whereby \n     responsibility for regulating insurance and the insurance \n     industry was left largely to the states; and\n       Whereas, The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n     1974 (ERISA) significantly altered this concept by creating a \n     federal framework for regulating employer-based pension and \n     welfare benefit plans, including health plans; and\n       Whereas, ERISA effectively prohibits states from directly \n     regulating many employer-based health plans because ERISA \n     preempts state regulation of self-insured plans; and\n       Whereas, Available data suggests that self-funding of \n     employer-based health plans is increasing at a significant \n     rate among both small and large businesses; and\n       Whereas, Between 1989 and 1993, the United States General \n     Accounting Office estimates that the number of self-funded \n     plan enrollees increased by about 6,000,000 individuals; and\n       Whereas, Approximately 40% to 50% of employer-based health \n     plans are presently self-funded by employers that retain most \n     or all of the financial risk for their respective health \n     plans; and\n       Whereas, With the growth in the self-funding of health \n     plans, states have lost regulatory oversight over a growing \n     portion of the health market; and\n       Whereas, Recent federal court decisions have struck down \n     state laws regulating insured health plans by expanding \n     ERISA's current preemption of state laws regulating self-\n     insured plans to laws relating to ensured plans; and\n       Whereas, As these phenomena continue, state governments are \n     losing their ability to mange their health care markets; and\n       Whereas, Many state legislatures, such as the Maryland \n     General Assembly, have taken significant actions to increase \n     access to care, to control costs, and to regulate against \n     abuses by health plans; and\n       Whereas, ERISA preemption is a significant obstacle to the \n     states adopting a wide range of health care reform and \n     consumer protection strategies; and\n       Whereas, The states' inability to protect consumers \n     enrolled in self-funded health plans that fail to provide the \n     consumers' anticipated level of health care is gradually \n     eroding the public's confidence in the American health care \n     system because self-funded plans are afforded an unfair \n     advantage over traditional health insurance plans due to a \n     lack of adequate state or federal accountability, regulation, \n     or remedy for the ERISA plan members who are denied coverage; \n     and\n       Whereas, Over the past 24 years, state governments have \n     gradually realized that ERISA is an impediment to ensuring \n     adequate consumer protection for all individuals with \n     employer-based health care coverage and to enacting \n     administrative simplification and cost reduction reforms that \n     could improve the efficiency and equity of their health care \n     markets; and\n       Whereas, ERISA plan participants, their dependents, and \n     their treating physicians believe that they have been denied \n     coverage for medically necessary procedures because ERISA's \n     remedy provisions have been narrowly interpreted and ERISA's \n     preemption provisions have been broadly interpreted, thereby \n     creating substantial economic incentives, with few \n     disincentives for plan administrators to deny medically \n     necessary benefits legitimately covered under ERISA plans; \n     and\n       Whereas, The time has now come for the states to \n     aggressively seek changes in ERISA to give them more \n     flexibility in regulating health plans at the state level, to \n     increase access to health care, and to lower health care \n     costs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of Maryland, That this \n     General Assembly hereby requests the U.S. Congress to amend \n     the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) \n     to authorize each state to monitor and to regulate self-\n     funded employer-based health plans in the interests of \n     providing greater consumer protection and effecting \n     significant health care reforms at the state level through \n     the offices of the various insurance commissioners and \n     states' attorneys general. Additionally, the United States \n     Department of Labor should cooperatively refer complaints to \n     the offices of the various insurance commissioners and \n     states' attorneys general; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Sec. 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA, which currently \n     reads: ``(B) to recover benefits due to him under the terms \n     of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the \n     plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the \n     terms of the plan;'', be amended to read: ``(B) to recover \n     benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to recover \n     from the fiduciary compensatory damages caused by the \n     fiduciary's failure to pay benefits due under the terms of \n     the plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, \n     or to timely authorize assurance of payment and clarify his \n     rights to future benefits under the terms of the plans;''; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, This this General Assembly most fervently urges \n     and encourages each state legislative body in the nation to \n     enact this resolution, or one similar in context and form, as \n     a show of solidarity in petitioning the federal government \n     for greater state authority and responsibility in regulating \n     self-funded employer-based health plans; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be forwarded by \n     the Department of Legislative Services to the Honorable \n     Parris N.

Glendening, Governor of Maryland; The Honorable \n     Thomas V. Mike Miller, Jr., President of the Senate of \n     Maryland; and the Honorable Casper R. Taylor, Jr., Speaker of \n     the House of Delegates; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be forwarded by \n     the Department of Legislative Services to the National \n     Conference of State Legislatures, 444 North Capitol Street, \n     N.W., Suite 515, Washington, D.C. 20001; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be forwarded by \n     the Department of Legislative Services to the President of \n     the United States; the Secretary of the United States \n     Department of Labor; the Speaker and the Clerk of the United \n     States House of Representatives; the President and the \n     Secretary of the United States Senate; and to the presiding \n     officer of each chamber of each state legislature in the \n     nation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be forwarded by \n     the Department of Legislative Services to the Maryland \n     Congressional Delegation: Senators Paul S. Sarbanes and \n     Barbara A. Mikulski, Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. \n     20510; and Representatives Wayne T. Gilchrest, Robert L. \n     Ehrlich, Jr., Benjamin L. Cardin, Albert R. Wynn, Steny \n     Hamilton Hoyer, Roscoe G. Bartlett, Elijah E. Cummings, and \n     Constance A. Morella, House Office Building, Washington, D.C. \n     20515.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-217. A joint resolution adopted by the Assembly of the \n     State of Nevada relative to amending the Wild Free-Roaming \n     Horses and Burros Act; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 2\n\n       Whereas, On December 15, 1971, Congress enacted the \n     provisions of the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act, 16 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1331 et seq.; and\n       Whereas, The purpose of the Act is to preserve the wild \n     horses and burros living on the public lands managed by the \n     Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest \n     Service and to protect those wild horses and burros from \n     capture, branding, harassment and death; and\n       Whereas, Since 1971, the population of wild horses living \n     on the public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management \n     and the United States Forest Service has increased \n     dramatically, particularly in Nevada where the largest \n     population of those wild horses exists; and\n       Whereas, the Act requires the Secretary of the Interior and \n     the Secretary of Agriculture to manage the wild horses living \n     on the public lands administered by the Bureau of Land \n     Management and the United States Forest Service in a manner \n     that will achieve and maintain a natural ecological balance \n     on those public lands; and\n       Whereas, Pursuant to that Act, if the Secretary of the \n     Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture determines that an \n     overpopulation of wild horses exists in an area of the public \n     lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the United \n     States Forest Service, the secretary must remove the excess \n     wild horses from those areas to achieve an appropriate level \n     of management for the wild horses; and\n       Whereas, Although the provisions of the Act address the \n     issue of overpopulation of wild horses, the Act does not \n     require that the population of wild horses be maintained at a \n     particular level, thereby allowing the population of wild \n     horses to expand far beyond the level envisioned by Congress \n     in 1971; and\n       Whereas, Allowing an excessive number of wild horses to \n     live on the public lands managed by the Bureau of Land \n     Management and the United States Forest Service causes those \n     public lands to deteriorate from overuse and contravenes the \n     purposes of the Taylor Grazing Act, 43 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 315 \n     et seq., and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of \n     1976, 43 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1701 et seq., which are intended to \n     protect those public lands from deterioration and overuse; \n     and\n       Whereas, Requiring the Secretary of the Interior and the \n     Secretary of Agriculture to maintain the population of wild \n     horses living on the public lands managed by the Bureau of \n     Land Management and the United States Forest Service at the \n     level established for those wild horses in 1975 will:\n\n[[Page S8266]]\n\n       1. Improve the condition of the ranges used by the wild \n     horses;\n       2. Increase the population and improve the habitat of deer, \n     antelope and other species of wildlife living on those public \n     lands;\n       3. Allow an increased use of the public lands and the \n     development of native flora and vegetation;\n       4. Improve conditions for hunting and other outdoor sports;\n       5. Reduce the amount of money required to shelter, feed and \n     prepare wild horses for adoption; and\n       6. Reduce the risk of deaths of wild horses because of \n     freezing, starvation and drought: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the Nevada Legislature urges Congress to amend \n     the provisions of the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act \n     to require the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture to establish the necessary regulations and \n     procedures whereby horses and burros in excess of the \n     appropriate management levels are gathered in a timely \n     fashion, and unadoptable horses and burros are made available \n     for sale at open market; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Nevada Legislature urges Congress to \n     include provisions in the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros \n     Act directing that the proceeds of sales of unadoptable \n     horses and burros be granted to the state director of the \n     federal land management agency responsible for the horses and \n     burros which were gathered off public lands, prior to sale, \n     and that these proceeds be used to augment wild horse and \n     burro management programs in the state; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the establishment of the appropriate \n     management levels should be based on sound scientific and \n     locally-collected resource information that incorporates and \n     fully acknowledges other existing multiple uses of the land, \n     such as the needs of other wildlife and livestock living on \n     the land; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the establishment of the appropriate \n     management levels should be concluded by the end of the \n     federal fiscal year 2002, and maintained thereafter, \n     irrespective of the outlet capacity of the federal horse \n     adoption programs; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, each member of the \n     Nevada Congressional Delegation and each legislature of the \n     other 49 states; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage and approval.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/12/senate-section/article/S8266-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           REPORTS OF COMMITTEES SUBMITTED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of July 1, 1999, the \nfollowing reports of committees were submitted on July 8, 1999:\n       By Mr. THOMPSON, from the Committee on Governmental \n     Affairs, without amendment:\n       S. 712: A bill to amend title 39, United States Code, to \n     allow postal patrons to contribute to funding for highway-\n     rail grade crossing safety through the voluntary purchase of \n     certain specially issued United States postage stamps (Rept. \n     No. 106-104).\n       By Mr. THOMPSON, from the Committee on Governmental \n     Affairs, without amendment:\n       S. 1072: A bill to make certain technical and other \n     corrections relating to the Centennial of Flight \n     Commemoration Act (36 U.S.C. 143 note; 112 Stat. 3486 et \n     seq.)

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \ncertain interstate conduct relating to exotic animals; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n              CAPTIVE EXOTIC ANIMAL PROTECTION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Captive Exotic \nAnimal Protection Act, which would prohibit the barbaric and unsporting \npractice of ``canned hunts,'' or caged kills. I am pleased to be joined \nby my cosponsors Senators Boxer, Durbin, Feingold, Feinstein, Kennedy, \nKerry, Kohl, Moynihan, Murray, Schumer, and Torricelli.\n  A typical canned hunt operation collects surplus animals from wild \nanimal parks, circuses, and even petting zoos, and then sells the right \nto brutally kill these animals to so-called ``hunters.'' In reality, no \nhunting, tracking or shooting skills are required. For a price, any \n``hunter'' is guaranteed a kill of the exotic animal of his choice--one \nlocated by a guide and blocked from escape. A wild boar ``kill'' may \nsell for $250, a pygmy goat for $400, while a rare Arabian Ibex may \nfetch up to $5000. The actual ``hunt'' of these tame animals occurs \nwithin a fenced enclosure, leaving the animal virtually no chance for \nescape. Fed and cared for by humans, these animals often have lost \ntheir instinctual impulse to flee from the so-called hunters who \n``stalk'' them.\n  The actual killing methods employed by these hunters only compound \nthe cruelty of slaughtering these often trusting animals. In order to \npreserve the animal as a ``trophy,'' hunters will fire multiple shots \ninto non-vital organs, condemning the animal to a slow and painful \ndeath.\n  Canned hunts are condemned by pro-animal and pro-hunting groups alike \nfor being cruel and unethical. Many real hunters believe that canned \nhunts are unethical and make a mockery of their sport. For example, the \nBoone and Crockett Club, a hunting organization founded by Teddy \nRoosevelt, has called canned hunts ``unfair'' and ``unsportsmanlike.'' \nBill Burton, the\n\n[[Page S8267]]\n\nformer outdoors writer for the Baltimore Sun and a hunter, testifying \nin support of this legislation, stated, ``[t]here is a common belief \nthat the hunting of creatures which have no reasonable avenue to escape \nis not up to traditional standards. Shooting game in confinement is not \nwithin these standards.''\n  In addition to being unethical, these canned hunts present a serious \nhealth and safety problem for livestock and native wildlife. Accidental \nescapes of animals from exotic game ranches are not uncommon, posing a \nvery real threat to nearby livestock and indigenous wildlife. John \nTalbott, acting director of the Wyoming Department of Fish and Game, \nhas stated that, ``[t]uberculosis and other disease documented amount \ngame ranch animals in surrounding states,'' pose ``an extremely serious \nthreat to Wyoming's native big game.'' In recognition of this threat, \nWyoming itself has banned canned hunting facilities, as have the States \nof California, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, \nNew Jersey, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin. Unfortunately, \nthe remaining States lack legislation to outlaw canned hunts, and \nbecause interstate commerce in exotic animals is common, federal \nlegislation is essential to control these cruel practices.\n  My bill is similar to legislation I introduced in the 105th Congress, \nS. 995. The legislation I am introducing today will specifically target \nonly canned hunt facilities, and will not affect any animal industries, \nsuch as cattle ranchers, rodeos, livestock shows, petting zoos, horse \nand dog racing, or wildlife hunting. Furthermore, this bill will not \napply to large hunting ranches, such as those over 1,000 acres, which \ngive the hunted animal a greater opportunity to escape. This bill \nmerely seeks to ban the transport and trade of non-native, exotic \nanimals for the purpose of staged trophy hunts.\n  The idea of a defenseless animal meeting a violent end as the target \nof a canned hunt is, at the very least, distasteful to many of us. In \nan era when many of us are seeking to curb violence in our culture, \ncanned hunts are certainly one form of gratuitous brutality that does \nnot belong in our society.\n  I urge my colleagues who want to understand the cruelty involved in a \ncanned hunt to visit my office and view a videotape of an actual canned \nhunt. You will witness a defenseless Corsican ram, cornered near a \nfence, being shot over and over again with arrows, clearly experiencing \nan agonizing death, only to be dealt a final blow by a firearm after \nneedless suffering.\n  Please join me in support of this legislation which will help to put \nan end to this needless suffering.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1345\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to ensure the independence and nonpartisan operation \nof the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration; to the \nCommittee on Small Business.\n\n\n                   independent office of advocacy act\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the \nIndependent Office of Advocacy Act. This bill has been drafted to build \non the success of the Office of Advocacy over the past 23 years. It is \nintended to strengthen the foundation to make the Office of Advocacy a \nstronger and more effective advocate for all small businesses \nthroughout the United States.\n  The Office of Advocacy is a unique office within the Federal \ngovernment. It is part of the Small Business Administration (SBA/\nAgency), and its director, the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, is nominated \nby the President and confirmed by the Senate. At the same time, the \nOffice is also intended to be the independent voice for small business \nwithin the Federal government. It is supposed to develop proposals for \nchanging government policies to help small businesses, and it is \nsupposed to represent the views and interests of small businesses \nbefore other Federal agencies.\n  As the director of the Office of Advocacy, the Chief Counsel for \nAdvocacy has a dual responsibility. On the one hand, he is the \nindependent watchdog for small business. On the other hand, he is also \na part of the President's Administration. As you can imagine, those are \nsometimes very difficult roles to play simultaneously.\n  The Independent Office of Advocacy Act is designed to make the Office \nof Advocacy and Chief Counsel for Advocacy a fully independent advocate \nwithin the Executive Branch acting on behalf of the small business \ncommunity. The bill would establish a clear mandate that the Office of \nAdvocacy will fight on behalf of small businesses regardless of the \nposition taken on critical issues by the President and his \nAdministration.\n  The Office of Advocacy as envisioned by the Independent Office of \nAdvocacy Act will be unique within the executive branch. The Chief \nCounsel for Advocacy will be a wide-ranging advocate, who will be free \nto take positions contrary to the Administration's policies and to \nadvocate change in government programs and attitudes as they impact \nsmall businesses.\n  In 1976, Congress established the Office of Advocacy in the SBA to be \nthe eyes, ears and voice for small business within the Federal \ngovernment. Over time, it has been assumed that the Office of Advocacy \nis the ``independent'' voice for small business. While I strongly \nbelieve that the Office of Advocacy and the Chief Counsel for Advocacy \nshould be independent and free to advocate or support positions that \nmight be contrary to the administration's policies, I have come to find \nthat the Office is not as independent as necessary to do the job \nadequately for small business.\n  For example, funding for the Office of Advocacy comes from the \nSalaries and Expense Account of the SBA's budget. Staffing is allocated \nby the SBA Administrator to the Office of Advocacy from the overall \nstaff allocation for the Agency. In 1990, there were 70 full-time \nemployees working on behalf of small businesses in the Office of \nAdvocacy. Today's allocation of staff is 49, and fewer are actually on-\nboard as the result of the hiring freeze imposed by the SBA \nAdministrator. The Independence of the Office is diminished when the \nOffice of Advocacy staff is reduced to allow for increased staffing for \nnew programs and additional initiatives in other areas of SBA, at the \ndiscretion of the Administrator.\n  In addition, the General Accounting Office (GAO) recently completed a \nreport for me on personnel practices at the SBA (GAO/GGD-99-68). I was \nalarmed by the GAO's finding that Assistant and Regional Advocates \nhired by the Office of Advocacy share many of the attributes of \nSchedule C political appointees. In fact, Regional Advocates are \nfrequently cleared by the White House personnel office--the same \nprocedure followed for approving Schedule C political appointees.\n\n  The facts discussed in the GAO Report cast the Office of Advocacy in \na\n\n[[Page S8268]]\n\nwhole new light--one that had not been apparent until now. The report \nraises questions, concerns and suspicious regarding the independence of \nthe Office of Advocacy. Has there been a time when the Office did not \npursue a matter as vigorously as it might have were it not for direct \nor indirect political influence? Prior to receipt of the GAO Report, my \nresponse was a resounding ``No.'' But now, a question mark arises.\n  Let me take a moment and note that I will be unrelenting in my \nefforts to insure the complete independence of the Office of Advocacy \nin all matters, at all times, for the continued benefit of all small \nbusinesses. However, so long as the Administration controls the budget \nallocated to the Office of Advocacy and controls who is hired, the \nindependence of the Office may be in jeopardy. We must correct this \nsituation, and the sooner we do it, the better it will be for the small \nbusiness community.\n  The Independent Office of Advocacy Act builds a firewall to prevent \nthe political intrustion into the management of day-to-day operations \nof the Office of Advocacy. The bill requires that the SBA's budget \ninclude a separate account for the Office of Advocacy. No longer would \nits funds come from the general operating account of the Agency. The \nseparate account would also provide for the number of full-time \nemployees who would work within the Office of Advocacy. No longer would \nthe Chief Counsel for Advocacy have to seek approval from the SBA \nAdministrator to hire staff for the Office of advocacy.\n  The bill also continues the practice of allowing the Chief Counsel to \nhire individuals critical to the mission of the Office of Advocacy \nwithout going through the normal competitive procedures directed by \nfederal law and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). I beleive \nthis special hiring authority, which is limited only to employees \nwithin the Office of Advocacy, is beneficial because it allows the \nChief Counsel to hire quickly those persons who can best assist the \nOffice in responding to changing issues and problems confronting small \nbusinesses.\n  Mr. Presdient, the Independent Office of Advocacy Act is a sound \nbill. The bill is the product of a great deal of thoughtful, objective \nreview and consideration by me, the staff of the Committee on Small \nBusiness, representatives of the small business community, former Chief \nCouncels for Advocacy and others. These individuals have also devoted \nmuch time and effort in actively participating in a Committee \nRoundtable discussion on the Office of Advocacy, which my Committee \nheld on April 21, 1999. It is my hope the Committee on Small Business \nwill be able to consider the Independent Office of Advocacy Act in the \nnear future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS:\n  S. 1349.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe availability of medical savings accounts; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n            medical savings account improvement act of 1999\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, on behalf of myself and my \ncolleague, Senator Torricelli, I am introducing legislation, the \nMedical Savings Account Improvement Act of 1999, which would make it \npossible for any individual to purchase a medical savings account and \nwhich would liberalize existing law authorizing medical savings \naccounts in a number of other respects.\n  Medical savings accounts are a good idea, Mr. President. They are \nbasically IRAs--an idea everybody understands--which must be used for \npayment of medical expenses.\n  The widespread use of medical savings accounts should have several \nbeneficial consequences.\n  They should reduce health care costs. Administrative costs should be \nlower. Consumers with MSAs should use health care services in a more \ndiscriminating manner. Consumers with MSAs should be more selective in \nchoosing providers. This should cause those providers to lower their \nprices to attract medical savings account holders as patients.\n  Medical savings accounts can also help to put the patient back into \nthe health care equation. Patients should make more cost-conscious \nchoices about routine health care. Patients with MSAs would have \ncomplete choice of provider.\n  Medical savings accounts should make health care coverage more \ndependable. MSAs are completely portable. MSAs are still the property \nof the individual even if they change jobs. Hence, for those with MSAs, \njob changes do not threaten them with the loss of health insurance.\n  Medical savings accounts should increase health care coverage. \nPerhaps as many as half of the more than 40 million Americans who are \nuninsured at\n\n[[Page S8269]]\n\nany point in time are without health insurance only for four months or \nless. A substantial number of these people are uninsured because they \nare between jobs. Use of medical savings accounts should reduce the \nnumber of the uninsured by equipping people to pay their own health \nexpenses while unemployed.\n  Medical savings accounts should promote personal savings. Since pre-\ntax monies are deposited in them, there should be a strong tax \nincentive to use them.\n  Mr. President, our bill would do several things:\n  First, it would repeal the limitations on the number of MSAs that can \nbe established.\n  Second, it stipulates that the availability of these accounts is not \nlimited to employees of small employers and self-employed individuals.\n  Third, it increases the amount of the deduction allowed for \ncontributions to medical savings accounts to 100 percent of the \ndeduction.\n  Fourth, it permits both employees and employers to contribute to \nmedical savings accounts.\n  Fifth, it reduces the permitted deductibles under high deductible \nplans from $1,500 in the case of individuals to $1,000 and from $3,000 \nin the case of couples to $2,000.\n  Finally, the bill would permit medical savings accounts to be offered \nunder cafeteria plans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of our bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1350\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today, along with my \ndistinguished colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, to introduce \nlegislation that will provide Americans more choices and control in \ntheir health care decisions.\n  Since becoming available in 1996, medical savings accounts (MSA's) \nhave proven to be an effective solution for Americans who are self-\nemployed, unsatisfied with their current health plan or working for a \ncompany unable to provide health insurance. By allowing consumers to \nsave money tax-free to cover medical expenses, MSA's have ensured that \npeople who previously were unable to acquire health coverage, such as \nsingle parents, the self-employed, small businesses and their \nemployees, and working families, now have affordable medical coverage. \nIn fact, since MSA's became available, the General Accounting Office \nreports that 37 percent of all MSA's have been purchased by people who \nwere previously uninsured.\n  Due to current restrictions, however, the size of the market is \nlimited. Congress must allow the benefits from MSA's to reach more \nAmericans.\n  Our bill, the Medical Savings Account Effectiveness Act of 1999, will \nmake MSA's a permanent health care option for all Americans by \nexpanding enrollment beyond the current cap. This legislation will \nallow both employers and employees to contribute to an MSA and will \nallow policyholders to fully fund the deductible. In addition, it will \nlower the individual deductible to $1,000 and the family deductible to \n$2,000. Finally, it will allow MSA's to be offered through ``cafeteria \nplans.''\n  By expanding MSA's, this legislation will give policyholders direct \ncontrol over medical expenditures, offer them a new freedom to select \nthe physician or specialist of their choice, and make insurance \naffordable for millions of Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Murkowski, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 1351. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nand modify the credit for electricity produced from newable resources; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 the biomass and wind energy tax credit\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nunfortunate expiration of the section 45 tax credit on June 30 for \nelectricity produced from alternative energy sources. In response, I am \nintroducing legislation to extend and expand the credit to help sustain \nthe public benefits derived from these sources. As many of my \ncolleagues know, I authored the section 45 credit in the Senate and it \nwas included in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. I am being joined in \nthis bipartisan effort today by Senator Murkowski and Senator Harkin.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced S. 414 to extend the wind energy \nportion of section 45, which has been extremely successful. The purpose \nof today's bill is to extend and expand the biomass portion of section \n45 to include technologies such as biomass combustion and cofiring \nbiomass with coal-fired facilities. Formerly, section 45 only allowed \nthe use of closed-loop biomass, which has proven to be unworkable. \nConsequently, the biomass aspect of section 45 has never been utilized. \nThe clean, controlled combustion of biomass, which in layman's terms \nconsists of woodchips, agricultural byproducts, and untreated \nconstruction debris, is another proven, effective technology that \ncurrently generates numerous pollution avoidance and waste management \npublic benefits across the nation.\n\n[[Page S8270]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the 1992 bill restrictively defined qualifying biomass \nprocesses by requiring taxpayers to grow the biomass solely for the \npurposes of combustion. This then-untested theory has since proven to \nbe singularly uneconomic, and taxpayers have never claimed one single \ncent of tax credits. My bill retains this dormant ``closed-loop'' \nbiomass provision in the hopes that some day it may be found feasible.\n  In order to retain the environmental, waste management, and the rural \nemployment benefits that we currently receive from the existing ``open-\nloop'' biomass facilities, by bill rewrites section 45 to allow tax \ncredits for clean combustion of wood waste and similar residues in \nthese unique facilities. These valuable, yet economically vulnerable, \nfacilities that convert 20 million tons of waste into clean electricity \nannually, and which have never received section 45 tax credits, would \nbe eligible for the same ten years of tax credits per facility, \nbeginning at date of enactment.\n  Importantly, we have gone to great lengths to ensure that the \ndefinition of qualifying biomass materials is limited to organic, \nnonhazardous materials that are clearly proven to burn cleanly without \nany pollution risk. Also, to allay any concern that biomass plants \nmight burn paper and thus possibly jeopardize the amount of paper that \nis available to be recycled, I have specifically excluded paper that is \ncommonly recycled from the list of materials that would qualify for the \ncredit.\n  One promising technology that does not yet operate here in the U.S., \nbut has now been proven to be feasible and practical, involves the \ncofiring of biomass with coal. A partial tax credit for cofiring would \nstimulate economic growth in rural areas by creating new markets for \nforage crops. The environmental benefits from reduced coal plant \nemissions would also be substantial.\n  Finally, my bill acknowledges the potential that biomass combustion \nhas to solve the nation's pressing poultry waste problem by making \nelectricity produced from the combustion of poultry litter eligible for \nthe sec. 45 tax credit. As Chairman Roth has recently pointed out, the \nincreased growth of our domestic chicken and turkey industry has \ncreated the need to find a new, creative means for disposing of the \nwaste of some 600 million chickens in the Delaware, Maryland, and \nVirginia peninsula alone.\n  Today, much of the waste from these operations (deposited upon \nbiomass materials) is spread on farmland, resulting in a nutrient \nrunoff that has contaminated streams, rivers and bays, with devastating \neffect on the local environment. Fortunately, scientists in the United \nKingdom have developed a combustion technology that cleanly disposes of \nthe waste and produces clean electricity. While no such plants are \ncurrently operating in the U.S., state and local authorities in the \naffected jurisdictions assure us that, with the enactment of this \ncritical tax credit legislation, action would be taken to build these \nplants immediately.\n  With regard to wind energy, and my involvement in supporting this \ntechnology which goes back to my authorship of the Wind Energy \nIncentives Act of 1992, I am proud to say that this credit is one of \nthe success stories of section 45. The public policy benefits of wind \nenergy are indisputable: it is clean, safe and abundant within the \nUnited States. I understand that every 10,000 megawatts of wind energy \nproduced in the U.S. can reduce carbon monoxide emissions by 33 million \nmetric tons by replacing the combustion of fossil fuels.\n  Mr. President, I believe this bill provides a common sense \ncombination of current and new technologies to help maintain the \neconomic, environmental and waste management benefits derived from wind \nand biomass power.

Res. 29. A joint resolution to grant the consent of Congress to \nthe boundary change between Georgia and South Carolina; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n     granting congressional consent for the georgia-south carolina \n                           interstate compact\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I rise to offer a joint \nresolution to grant congressional consent to an Interstate Compact \nbetween my state of Georgia and the state of South Carolina which \nresolves a border dispute whose origin dates back to the Articles of \nConfederation between the two states. On June 25, 1990, the Supreme \nCourt in Georgia vs. South Carolina (No. 74, Original) ruled that \nGeorgia lost sovereignty over the Barnwell Islands in the Savannah \nRiver to South Carolina. These islands had shifted due to erosion and \naccretion since the time of the first scientifically accurate survey of \nthe area in 1855. The Supreme Court further ordered the two states to \ndetermine a new boundary and submit it to the Court for final approval.\n  During the summer of 1993, the two states with the assistance of the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reached an \nagreement on a common boundary. Subsequently, the agreement was adopted \nby the Georgia General Assembly on April 5, 1994, and by the South \nCarolina General Assembly on May 29, 1996.\n  On May 26, 1999, the agreed boundary was forwarded to Congress for \nits approval in accordance with the U.S. Constitution Article IV, \nSection 10. This Compact once adopted will amend the Beaufort \nConvention of 1787.\n  With passage of this resolution, granting Congress' consent to the \nGeorgia-South Carolina Interstate Compact, Congress will have fulfilled \nits obligation, and the agreed upon boundary will be presented to the \nSupreme Court for its final approval and application. I am pleased to \nhave my colleagues from South Carolina, Senators Thurmond and Hollings, \nand my colleague from Georgia, Senator Cleland, join me in sponsoring \nthis historic piece of legislation. In this day, where members from \nboth sides of the aisle are speaking of the need for more \nbipartisanship, I would like to commend these two great states for \ncoming together and reaching an agreement on such a contentious issue \nand ask for the full Senate's support for this important and necessary \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the following \nchronology be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n GEORGIA-SOUTH CAROLINA BORDER AGREEMENT FOR THE LOWER REACHES OF THE \n            SAVANNAH RIVER TO THE SEA--CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS\n\n       April 28, 1787--The Beaufort Convention: Under the Articles \n     of Confederation of 1778, South Carolina and Georgia agreed \n     that the boundary between the two states would be in the \n     northern branch of the Savannah River, reserving all islands \n     in the river to Georgia.\n       January 30, 1922--Georgia v. South Carolina (No. 16, \n     Original): The U.S. Supreme Court held that where there were \n     no islands in the boundary rivers, the boundary in on the \n     water midway between the main banks when the water is at \n     ordinary stage. When there are islands, the boundary is \n     midway between the banks of the island and the South Carolina \n     shore, with the water at ordinary stage.\n       June 25, 1990--Georgia v. South Carolina (No. 74, \n     Original): The U.S. Supreme Court held that Georgia lost \n     sovereignty over the Barnwell Islands to South Carolina by \n     acquiescence, and that the Beaufort Convention did not \n     control new islands that later emerged in the Savannah River. \n     Accordingly, the Court generally adopted the findings (with \n     some exceptions) of its Special Master, Senior Judge Walter \n     E. Hoffman, with regard to several disputed islands and the \n     headlands of the river. The Court directed the two states to \n     determine the boundary in accordance with the principles in \n     its rulings, and to submit the boundary to the Court for \n     final approval.\n       June 24, 1991--Cooperative Agreement: Both states and the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) \n     entered a cooperative agreement to survey the area and plot \n     the boundary. In order to comply with the requirement that \n     the river be charted as is existed prior to the dredgings and \n     changes in the navigational courses which occurred in the \n     1880's, the parties adopted the Special Master's decision \n     that the main thread of the Savannah River as it existed on \n     the 1855 charts would be used. NOAA flew new aerial surveys \n     of the river and plotted the 1855 thread of the river on the \n     new surveys.\n       Summer, 1993--Joint Meetings and Negotiations: After NOAA \n     completed its work, the states realized that the course of \n     the river had changed so substantially since 1855 that using \n     the 1855 thread of the river was unworkable. Because of \n     recent navigational channel deepening efforts by the U.S. \n     Corps of Engineers, Georgia and South Carolina agreed to use \n     the northern edge of the shipping channel, including any \n     turning basins, as the primary agreed upon boundary. More \n     specifically, the ``new'' boundary would start from the \n     middle of the river above Pennyworth Island, between \n     Pennyworth Island and the South Carolina shore, and then to \n     the tidegate and the northern edge of the Back River turning \n     basin. After following the navigational channel to the buoy \n     nearest the 3-mile territorial limit, the boundary would then \n     depart eastward along the 104 degree bearing adopted by the \n     Court.\n       April 5, 1994--Georgia General Assembly Adopts Agreed \n     Boundary: Georgia adopted the agreed boundary line, using the \n     Annual Survey--1992, Savannah Harbor, as amended by the \n     Savannah Harbor Deepening Project. The line was plotted using \n     the Georgia Plane Coordinate System.\n       May 29, 1996--South Carolina General Assembly Adopts Agreed \n     Boundary: South Carolina adopted the agreed boundary line, \n     but asked NOAA to covert the Georgia coordinates to points of \n     latitude and longitude.\n       November, 1998--Charts assembled: Because only three \n     original copies of the 1992 channel charts were available, a \n     special printing of the color charts was run, with the \n     Savannah Harbor Deepening Project charts bound together.\n       May 26, 1999--Agreed Boundary Forwarded for Congressional \n     Approval: The States submitted the agreed boundary to the \n     Congress for approval as an Interstate Compact pursuant to \n     the United States Constitution, Article IV, Section 10, which \n     amends the Beaufort Convention of 1787.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url":

Mr. Craig, and Ms. Collins) proposed an amendment to \namendment No. 1233 proposed by Mr. Daschle to the bill, S. 1344, supra; \nas folows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word in line three and insert \n     the following:\n\n     SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING THE SCOPE OF A PATIENTS' BILL \n                   OF RIGHTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress agreed that States should have primary \n     responsibility for the regulation of health insurance when it \n     passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945.\n       (2) The States have done a good job in responding to the \n     consumer concerns associated with a rapidly evolving health \n     care delivery system and have already adopted statutory and \n     regulatory protections for consumers in fully-insured health \n     plans and have tailored these protections to fit the needs of \n     their States' consumers and health care marketplaces.\n       (3) 117,000,000 Americans who are enrolled in fully insured \n     plans, governmental plans and individual policies are \n     protected by State patient protections.\n       (4) Forty-two States have already enacted a Patient's Bill \n     of Rights.\n       (5) Forty-seven States already enforce consumer protections \n     regarding gag clauses on doctor-patient communications.\n       (6) Forty States already enforce consumer protections for \n     access to emergency care services.\n       (7) Thirty-one States already enforce consumer protections \n     requiring a prudent layperson standard for emergency care.\n       (8) The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 \n     (referred to in this section as ``ERISA'') expressly \n     prohibits States from regulating the self-funded employer \n     sponsored plans that currently cover 48,000,000 Americans.\n       (9) The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has \n     recommended that Congress should focus its legislative \n     activities on consumers in self-funded ERISA plans, which are \n     under the Federal Government's exclusive jurisdiction, and \n     preserve the State protections that already exist for \n     consumers in fully insured ERISA plans.\n       (10) The National Association of Insurance Commissioners \n     has expressly stated that they do not endorse the concept of \n     a Federal floor with regard to patient protections.\n       (11) Senate bill 6 (106th Congress) would greatly expand \n     the Federal regulatory role over private health insurance.\n       (12) It would be inappropriate to set Federal health \n     insurance standards that not only duplicate the \n     responsibility of the 50 State insurance departments but that \n     also would have to be enforced by the Health Care Financing \n     Administration if a State fails to enact the standard.\n       (13) One size does not fit all, and what may be appropriate \n     for one State may not be necessary in another.\n       (14) It is irresponsible to propose vastly expanding the \n     Federal Government's role in regulating private health \n     insurance at a time when the Health Care Financing \n     Administration is having such a difficult time fulfilling its \n     current and primary responsibilities for Medicare.\n       (15) In August, 1998, the United States Court of Appeals \n     affirmed a district court ruling that the Health Care \n     Financing Administration failed to enforce due process \n     requirements and monitor health maintenance organization \n     denials of medical service to medicare beneficiaries.\n       (16) On April 13, 1999, the General Accounting Office \n     testified that the Health Care Financing Administration \n     failed to use its authority to ensure that medicare \n     beneficiaries were informed of their appeals rights under \n     managed care plans.\n       (17) The General Accounting Office testified at a July, \n     1998 hearing in the Ways and Means Committee of the House of \n     Representatives that the Health Care Financing Administration \n     missed 25 percent of the implementation deadlines for the \n     consumer and quality improvements to the Medicare program \n     under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n       (18) The Health Care Financing Administration should not be \n     given new, broad regulatory authority as they have not \n     adequately met their current responsibilities.\n       (19) The Health Care Financing Administration took 10 years \n     to implement a 1987 law establishing new nursing home \n     standards.\n       (20) The Health Care Financing Administration has yet to \n     update its 1985 fire safety standards for hospitals.\n       (21) The Health Care Financing Administration is utilizing \n     1976 health and safety standards for the treatment of end-\n     stage kidney disease.\n       (22) ERISA preempts State requirements relating to coverage \n     determinations, grievances and appeals, and requirements \n     relating to independent external review.\n       (23) In a recent judicial decision in Texas (Corporate \n     Health Insurance, Inc. V. The Texas Department of Insurance), \n     the lower court held that ERISA does preempt the State's \n     external review law as it relates to group health plans.\n       (b) Deduction for Health Insurance Costs of Self-Employed \n     Individuals Increased.--In General.--Section 162(l)(1) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to special rules for \n     health insurance costs of self-employed individuals) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(1) Allowance of deduction.--In the case of an individual \n     who is an employee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), \n     there shall be allowed as a deduction under this section an \n     amount equal to the amount paid during the taxable year for \n     insurance which constitutes medical care for the taxpayer, \n     the taxpayer's spouse, and dependents.''\n       (c) Clarification of Limitations on Other Coverage.--The \n     first sentence of section 162(l)(2)(B) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to read as follows: \n     ``Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any taxpayer for any \n     calendar month for which the taxpayer participates in any \n     subsidized health plan maintained by any employer (other than \n     an employer described in section 401(c)(4)) of the taxpayer \n     or the spouse of the taxpayer.''\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1998.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 GRAHAM (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1235\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Chafee, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nDurbin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \nBaucus, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Dorgan) proposed an amendment to \namendment No. 1233 proposed by Mr. Daschle to the bill, S. 1344, supra; \nas follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n[[Page S8291]]\n\n     SEC. ____.

Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago, I stood on \nthe floor in recognition of General Chuck Krulak's retirement as \nCommandant of the United States Marine Corps. Since then, I've attended \nthe change of command ceremony at the Marine Barracks, and I must say, \nI was impressed with how General Krulak reminded us once again what \nmakes Marines and the U.S. Marine Corps important.\n  I am equally impressed with the conduct of General James Jones, the \nnew Commandant, and his recognition of the challenge he faces in \nfollowing General Krulak's command. I wish him well and encourage him \nto continue the traditions maintained by his predecessor in dealing \nwith Congress.\n  I come to the floor again today for one final addition to General \nKrulak's record before Congress. Oliver North wrote an excellent \neditorial recently in the Washington Times that captures the \nexceptional performance of the Commandant. I ask consent to have it \nprinted in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                             Semper Fidelis\n\n                  (By Lt. Col. Oliver L. North (Ret.))\n\n       Washington, DC.--One recent morning, an invitation arrived \n     in the mail. It was to a retirement ceremony at the Marine \n     Barracks here in our nation's capital. I've probably been to \n     more than a hundred of these rites of passage since I joined \n     the Corps more than three decades ago. I won't be able to \n     attend and had to send my sincere regrets for the invitation \n     was to the retirement ceremony for a friend--General Charles \n     C. Krulak, the 31st Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n\n[[Page S8293]]\n\n       Now, Marine Lieutenant Colonels, even those of us no longer \n     on active service, aren't in the habit of referring to \n     Generals as friends--particularly when the General in \n     question is the top Marine. And we sure don't offer a public \n     critique of his performance as Commandant of all Marines. It \n     just isn't done.\n       But in this case, somebody needs to do it. Because when \n     Chuck Krulak takes off his Dress Blues with those four stars \n     on the shoulders for the last time as he will at the end of \n     this month, the conscience of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will \n     have retired. And in this town, that kind of moral authority \n     is going to be missed more than most people realize.\n       For four years, Chuck Krulak has been ``the General who \n     tells it like it is''--in public and in private. Whether in \n     testimony on Capitol Hill, in the Pentagon's ``tank'' where \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff meet, or at the White House, Chuck \n     Krulak could be counted upon to tell the truth--whether they \n     wanted to hear it or not. His reputation for integrity in a \n     city that too little values this virtue is unparalleled--and \n     a credit to the Corps of Marines he has led through some of \n     the most tumultuous events in our history. His steadfast \n     devotion to his 174,000 Marines is evident in all that he has \n     said and done as Commandant. And very little of it endeared \n     him to an administration hell bent on downsizing, feminizing, \n     and de-``moralizing'' America's Armed Forces.\n       When General Krulak was appointed Commandant in 1995, the \n     Clinton White House was busy taking an axe to America's \n     defense establishment. By the time these draconian cuts were \n     done, the Army would lose eight active combat divisions. The \n     Air Force and Navy would lose 20 air wings--and 2,000 combat \n     aircraft. Another 232 strategic bombers, 13 ballistic missile \n     submarines, four aircraft carriers, all of our battleships, \n     and more than 100 other combat vessels would be sent to the \n     boneyard. Only the Marine Corps was able to withstand \n     Commander-in-Chief Clinton's quest for a mothballed military.\n       And it didn't stop there. The Marines were badgered to make \n     their boot camps co-ed. General Krulak said no. The Corps was \n     told that it should put women in ground combat assignments in \n     their expeditionary forces. Again, the top Marine said no. \n     When the Pentagon started talking about relaxing the standard \n     on sexual misconduct, Chuck Krulak just said, no. And when a \n     Clinton political appointee responsible for ``feminizing'' \n     the military decried the Marines as ``extremists,'' the \n     Commandant fired back a blistering response that yes, they \n     were, ``extremely fit, extremely faithful and extremely \n     patriotic.'' In every case he was right.\n       And he didn't give an inch when the vaunted Clinton \n     ``National Security Team'' acted as though the Marines had \n     done so much for so long with so little that they could \n     continue to do everything with nothing forever. Faced with \n     unprecedented global commitments and the prospect of \n     declining readiness, Krulak pulled no punches. He told the \n     House and Senate Armed Services Committees that the Marines \n     were ready to perform Mission Impossible--but that they \n     needed to be better armed and equipped. He got what he \n     wanted.\n       While the other branches of our Armed Forces struggle to \n     meet recruiting and retention goals, lower their entrance \n     standards, ease training requirements and try to make \n     military service less ``military''--the Corps has done \n     exactly the opposite. Krulak extended boot camp--adding his \n     ``Crucible Training'' to the already rigorous initiation into \n     the Corps. His Marines loved him for it, and the Corps has \n     thrived.\n       The power brokers in Washington, who favor ``yes men'' over \n     honest men, probably won't miss Chuck Krulak very much. But \n     his Marines will. And I will--mostly because I remember him \n     as a young Captain of Infantry, thirty years ago, when we \n     served together in a corner of hell called Vietnam. He was \n     then, as he is today, a warrior and a man of principle, \n     integrity and character. He embodied then, as he does today, \n     the guiding ethos of the Marines--Semper Fidelis--Always \n     Faithful.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I believe you can see how fitting it is \nthat this article be included in the Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/12/senate-section/article/S8293-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MEREDITH GARDNER\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President. I rise today to pay tribute to \nMeredith Gardner, long unsung contributor to the identification of \nspies. Described by the FBI's Robert Joseph Lamphere as ``the greatest \ncounter-intelligence tool this country has ever known,'' Gardner was \nthe National Security Agency's leading enabler of the reading of \nthousands of enciphered cables intercepted from Soviet foreign \nintelligence in the 1940's. The NSA, under its various names, spent \nfour decades deciphering what Moscow intended to be an unbreakable \nSoviet cipher. Gardner and his team painstakingly worked on these \nmessages in a project which came to be known eventually as ``VENONA.'' \nThe resulting VENONA decrypts, which were finally revealed publicly in \n1995, detail the Soviet's espionage efforts in the United States during \nand after World War II.\n  Gardner has a genius for learning languages, and is fluent in German, \nSpanish, French and Russian and has had courses in Old High and Middle \nHigh German, Old Norse, Gothic, Lithuanian, and Sanskrit. He taught \nlanguages at the Universities of Texas and Wisconsin before being \nrecruited by the U.S. Army's Signals Intelligence Service (the \nprecursor to the National Security Agency) shortly after the Japanese \nbombed Pearl Harbor. The Army wanted people fluent in many languages to \nwork on breaking German and Japanese codes. Until 1955 Gardner worked \nat Arlington Hall, a former girl's school located 10 miles outside \nWashington, which served as the Army's headquarters for code-breaking \noperations. Gardner soon added Japanese to his repertoire of languages. \nBy chance, he became the first American to read in an intercepted \nmessage the Japanese word for atom bomb, ``genshi-bakudan.''\n  When the war with Japan ended, the NSA phased out its Japanese \nsection. Gardner learned that there was a section working on Soviet \nUnion messages (its existence was kept secret) and he transferred into \nit. Gardner insists that the most arduous efforts to make the messages \nreadable had already been done before he came along. First, the \nmessages had to be sorted into at least four varieties, each used by \nrepresentatives of separate Soviet government departments. It had also \nbeen discovered that some messages could be paired as having been \n``randomized'' by the same pad and page carrying random additive digits \n(and hence were solvable).\n  Such mixed pairs were worked on by a small group of women led by \nKaturah ``Katie'' McDonald. This group had already produced a \nremarkable amount of code text, and the code-groups that had appeared \nso far had even been indexed in context by a card machine. The material \nwas just awaiting the appointment of a linguist, and Gardner \n``appointed himself'' to be it. It was the easy stage, but without it \nall the preparatory work would have been for nothing.\n  Gardner's reconstruction of the foreign intelligence (VENONA) code \nbook was slow at first, but gained momentum. Because some recruits were \nnamed in the messages and given cover names, it became obvious that the \nFBI ought to receive translations of the cables. Special agent Robert \nJoseph Lamphere was assigned to be the (very efficient) link between \nthe NSA and FBI. The next is history.\n  Gardner spent 27 years working on the ``Russian problem'' before \nretiring in 1972. He and his wife of 56 years, Blanche, who also worked \nfor the Army Security Agency, now spend part of their time teaching \nLatin to a small group of students. I commend Mr. Gardner for the \ninvaluable assistance he has given to our country, which we are only \nnow beginning to realize and understand. I salute Mr. Gardner for his \ndedicated and important service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/12/senate-section/article/S8293-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8293-S8294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO MR.

Mr. President, I rise today to \nacknowledge and commend Mr. Larry Stolte as he retires from the United \nStates Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  Larry's career in New England began as a fisheries biologist in 1969 \nwith the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department, working on the \nintroduction of Coho salmon in the Great Bay area. In 1975, he joined \nthe United States Fish and Wildlife Service and became the Atlantic \nSalmon Planner for New England. Larry took the lead in developing an \nAtlantic salmon strategic plan for southern New England, and chaired \nthe state committee that developed the Atlantic salmon plan for Maine's \nrivers.\n  While working to restore Atlantic salmon to New England's waterways, \nLarry began researching the ``king of gamefish'' in the Merrimack \nRiver. He documented his research in a book titled ``The Forgotten \nSalmon of the Merrimack,'' which was published in 1981 and is \nrecognized by many as the most accurate record of the history of the \nAtlantic salmon in the Merrimack River.\n  For the past 15 years, Larry has been the Fish and Wildlife Service's \ncoordinator for anadromous fish restoration in the Merrimack River. He \nhas also\n\n[[Page S8294]]\n\nchaired the U.S. Atlantic Salmon Assessment Committee and has been a \nworking member of the International Commission on the Exploration of \nthe Seas' North Atlantic Salmon Working Group.\n  Larry has devoted his entire career to restoring anadromous fish to \nNew England rivers. His dedication and perseverance has been an \ninspiration to those who have worked toward this effort. Upon his \nretirement from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Larry and \nhis wife Tracy will reside in Montana. I would like to thank Larry for \nhis hard work and dedication to the restoration efforts of New England \nRivers. It is an honor to represent Larry in the United States \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/12/senate-section/article/S8294-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           OUR OUTSTANDING AMBASSADOR IN BEIJING--JIM SASSER\n\nMr. KENNEDY.

His able \nleadership has made the American Embassy in Beijing more responsive to \nthe concerns and interests of American business. He has also worked \ntirelessly to promote dialogue with the Dalai Lama.\n  In the aftermath of the tragic, mistaken bombing of China's embassy \nin Belgrade in May, America's embassy in Beijing was under siege, and \nAmbassador Sasser was virtually held hostage in the embassy. During \nthis extraordinarily difficult time, he ensured that American personnel \nwere safe and accounted for. He displayed remarkable courage during \nthis ordeal, and made America proud of him.\n  All of us who worked with Ambassador Sasser in the Senate knew he \nwould excel when President Clinton nominated him for this position. I \ncongratulate him on a job well done.

Despite his injuries, Captain Conroy survived as a \nprisoner of war in Stalag Luft I for sixteen months until the camp was \nliberated by Russian troops.\n  Captain Conroy's list of medals, including the Purple Heart and the \nDistinguished Flying Cross, only begin to tell the story about what \nmakes him a true American hero. After his military career, Captain \nConroy raised and supported a family while building a successful career \nin advertising.

With his determination to succeed \nrooted in this responsibility he will surely continue to be a positive \nrole model for his community.\n  Mr. President, I would like to wish Sy my sincere congratulations and \nbest wishes. While running a successful family business, Sy had \ndedicated much of his time to having a positive impact on his \ncommunity. His accomplishments are truly remarkable. It is an honor to \nrepresent him in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/12/senate-section/article/S8294-5", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AIR FORCE MEDICAL SERVICE\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this month marks the 50th \nanniversary of the Air Force Medical Service. On July 1, 1949, the Air \nForce Medical Service was created, beginning a strong and rich \ntradition of providing health care to military personnel and their \nfamilies.\n  Since the Korean War, the Air Force Medical Service has provided \naerospace medicine support to our aviators. From ensuring pilots are \nphysically fit to stand the rigors of flight to bringing physiological \nexpertise to the design of fighter jet aircraft, aerospace medical \npersonnel have maximized the performance and safety of our pilots.\n  Aeromedical evacuation of casualties proved valuable during World War \nII, and became the preferred mode of casualty evacuation during the \nKorean War. The Air Force Medical Service is responsible for fixed wing \naircraft evacuation and manages a world-wide system for peacetime and \nwartime aeromedical evacuation.\n  Today, the Air Force Medical Service operates 37 medical center and \nhospitals and 41 clinics around the world, providing health care to a \nwide range of beneficiaries. When the Air Force Medical Services was \ncreated, only 4 percent of military troops had dependents. However, \nseventy percent of military personnel serving today have families. \nThese dynamic changes have broadened the needs and expectations for \nmedical services. In recent years, constrained resources and the \ninitiation of TRICARE have added to the challenges. The Air Force \nMedical Service has always found innovative ways to ensure the mission \nwas accomplished.\n  I congratulate the 52,000 men and women of the Air Force Medical \nService on this milestone. I am confident that the proud traditions of \nthe Air Force Medical Service will continue as its men and women \nprovide the best combat medical support, aeromedical evaluation of the \nsick and injured, and health care to Air Force communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/12/senate-section/article/S8294-6", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8294-S8295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNITION OF GENE CLAWSON, JR.\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a great \nMontanan\n\n[[Page S8295]]\n\nwho is a man of extraordinary talents and accomplishments, one of the \nmost notable being President of the Amateur Trapshooting Association. \nThis Association is the largest clay target shooting organization in \nthe world with more than 100,000 members. This year as President, he \nwill preside over the Grand American 100th Anniversary trapshoot in \nVandalia, Ohio from August 12-21, 1999.\n  This past week in Missoula, Montana, July 8 was designated Gene \nClawson, Jr. Day by the Montana State Trapshooting Association to \nrecognize his dedication and service to this sport. Gene's dedication \nstarted over 40 years ago when he began shooting with his father and \nbrother. When Gene started, he dominated state junior competitions and \nearned All-American status. His dedication and love for the sport \npropelled him to win 10 state championships, a national doubles Class \nAA championship. He was selected to the Montana All-State Team thirty-\none times and in 1995 he was inducted into the Montana State \nTrapshooting Association Hall of Fame. One of his more phenomenal \naccomplishments was shooting the amazing ``perfect'' doubles score of \n100 for a total of sixteen times.\n  Gene's service to trapshooting also has been an unusual example of \nunfaltering support and leadership. Gene started out helping his father \nwith the duties of secretary-treasurer of the Missoula Trap and Skeet \nClub. From there his involvement grew to include being on the club's \nboard of directors, Montana's delegate to the Amateur Trapshooting \nAssociation, and the Western Zone Vice-President for the Association in \nwhich he presided over 13 western States and Canadian provinces. Now as \nthe President of the Amateur Trapshooting Association, he deals with \nvirtually all of the Association's business. In all his endeavors, he \nhas gained the respect and admiration of many people as well as to \ninspiring others to participate in the this exciting sport.\n  In addition to being a master of his sport, he is also a successful \nbusinessman. He has been President of the family-owned business, \nClawson Manufacturing, for over 30 years. When his father started the \nbusiness in 1948, they concentrated on unfinished furniture and cut \nstock. Since then, Gene has moved the company into designing, \nproducing, and selling windows and roof trusses worldwide.\n  Gene is also a dedicated family man. Ranging in ages from 12 to 79, \nthe Clawsons are an amazing example of family tradition, devotion, \nsupport, and success. For several years, three generations of Clawsons \nhave hunted elk, waterfowl, and upland birds together. Three of Gene's \nsons (Nick, Bill, and Brad) have followed in their father's footsteps \nin excelling at trapshooting competitions. Now his grandson has joined \nthe firing line. In these days when guns are associated with destroying \nfamilies, it is refreshing to see an example of how the shooting sports \ncan bring a family closer together.\n  Mr. President, I recognize Mr. Gene Clawson, Jr. and congratulate him \nfor his accomplishments as an amateur trapshooter, father, and \nbusinessman. I was him and his family the best and much success in \ntheir future endeavors. Please join with me in recognizing this great \nMontanan and outstanding American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/12/senate-section/article/S8295-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8295-S8297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DEINSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE MENTALLY ILL\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this past Friday (July 9, 1999), the \nWashington Post carried an excellent op-ed piece, \n``Deinstitutionalization Hasn't Worked,'' by E. Fuller Torrey and Mary \nT. Zdanowicz. The authors are the president and executive director, \nrespectively, of the Treatment Advocacy Center. They write about the \ncontinued stigma attached to mental illness. They write about barriers \nto treatment. Most important, they write about the aftermaths of \ndeinstitutionalization, and the seemingly horrific effects this policy \nhas had.\n  In this morning's New York Times (July 12, 1999), Fox Butterfield \nwrites about a Department of Justice report released yesterday which \nstates that some 283,800 inmates in the nation's jails and prisons \nsuffer from mental illness. (This is a conservative estimate.) As \nButterfield puts it, ``. . . jails and prisons have become the nation's \nnew mental hospitals.''\n  Over the past 45 years, we have emptied state mental hospitals, but \nwe have not provided commensurate outpatient treatment. Increasingly, \nindividuals with mental illnesses are left to fend for themselves on \nthe streets, where they victimize others or, more frequently, are \nvictimized themselves. Eventually, many wind up in prison, where the \nlikelihood of treatment is nearly as remote.\n  This is a cautionary tale, instructive of what is possible and also \nwhat we ought to be aware of. I was in the Harriman administration in \nNew York in the 1950s. Early in 1955, Harriman met with his new \nCommissioner of Mental Hygiene, Paul Hoch, who described the \ndevelopment of a tranquilizer derived from rauwolfia by Dr. Nathan S. \nKline at what was then known as Rockland State Hospital (it is now the \nRockland Psychiatric Center) in Orangeburg. The medication had been \nclinically tested and appeared to be an effective treatment of many \npatients. Dr. Hoch recommended that it be used system wide; Harriman \nfound the money.\n  That same year Congress created a Joint Commission on Mental Health \nand Illness with a view to formulating ``comprehensive and realistic \nrecommendations'' in this area which was then a matter of considerable \npublic concern. Year after year the population of mental institutions \ngrew; year after year new facilities had to be built. Ballot measures \nto approve the issuance of general obligation bonds for building the \nfacilities appeared just about every election. Or so it seemed.\n  The discovery of tranquilizers was adventitious. Physicians were \nseeking cures for disorders they were just beginning to understand. \nEven a limited success made it possible to believe that the incidence \nof this particular range of disorders, which had seemingly required \npersons to be confined against their will or even awareness, could be \ngreatly reduced. The Congressional Commission submitted its report in \n1961; it was seen to propose a nationwide program of \ndeinstitutionalization.\n  Late in 1961 President Kennedy appointed an interagency committee to \nprepare legislative recommendations based on the report. I represented \nSecretary of Labor Arthur J. Goldberg on this committee and drafted its \nfinal submission. This included the recommendation of the National \nInstitute of Mental Health that 2,000 ``community mental health \ncenters'' (one for every 100,000 people) be built by 1980. A buoyant \nPresidential Message to Congress followed early in 1963. ``If we apply \nour medical knowledge and social insights fully,'' President Kennedy \nstated, ``all but a small portion of the mentally ill can eventually \nachieve a wholesome and a constructive social adjustment.'' A \n``concerted national attack on mental disorders [was] now possible and \npractical.'' The President signed the Community Mental Health Centers \nConstruction Act on October 31, 1963--his last public bill signing \nceremony. He gave me a pen.\n  The mental hospitals emptied out. The number of patients in state and \ncounty mental hospitals peaked in 1955 at 558,922 and has declined \nevery year since then, to 61,722 in 1996. But we never came near to \nbuilding the 2,000 community mental health centers. Only some 482 \nreceived Federal construction funds from 1963 to 1980. The next year, \n1981, the program was folded into the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental \nHealth block grant program, where it disappeared from view.\n  Even when centers were built, the results were hardly as hoped for. \nDavid Musto has noted that the planners had bet on improving national \nmental health ``by improving the quality of general community life \nthrough expert knowledge [my emphasis], not merely by more effective \ntreatment of the already ill.'' The problem was: there is no such \nknowledge. Nor is there. But the belief there was such knowledge took \nhold within sectors of the profession, which saw institutions as an \nunacceptable mode of social control. These activists subscribed to a \nredefining mode of their own, which they considered altruistic: mental \npatients were said to have been ``labeled,'' and were not to be \ndrugged. So as the Federal government turned to other matters, the \nmental institutions continued to release patients, essentially to fend \nfor themselves. There was no connection made: we're quite capable of \nthat\n\n[[Page S8296]]\n\nin the public sphere. Professor Frederick F. Siegel of Cooper Union \nobserved: ``in the great wave of moral deregulation that began in the \nmid-1960s, the poor and the insane were freed from the fetters of \nmiddle-class mores.'' Soon, the homeless appeared. Only to be defined \nas victims of an insufficient supply of affordable housing. No \nargument, no amount of evidence has yet affected that fixed ideological \nview.\n  I commend these two articles to my colleagues and ask that they be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The articles follow:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, July 9, 1999]\n\n                  Deinstitutionalization Hasn't Worked\n\n\n``We have lost effectively 93 percent of our state psychiatric hospital \n                           beds since 1955''\n\n              (By E. Fuller Torrey and Mary T. Zdanowicz)\n\n       The White House Conference on Mental Health identified \n     stigma and discrimination as the most important barriers to \n     treatment for the mentally ill. For the most severely ill, \n     there are more significant barriers to treatment, such as \n     laws that prevent treating individuals until they become \n     dangerous. These laws and our failure to treat individuals \n     with schizophrenia and manic-depressive illness are, \n     ironically, the leading causes of stigma and discrimination \n     against those with mental illnesses.\n       Stigma is created by the sort of headlines that result when \n     a person is not being treated for mental illness and shoots \n     two Capitol police officers to death, or pushes an innocent \n     victim in front of a speeding subway train. Some 20 years of \n     research has proven this point.\n       A 1996 study published in the Journal of Community \n     Psychology demonstrated that negative attitudes toward people \n     with mental illnesses increased greatly after people read \n     newspaper articles reporting violent crimes by the mentally \n     ill. Henry J. Steadman, an influential public opinion \n     researcher, wrote as far back as 1981: ``Recent research data \n     on contemporary populations of ex-mental patients supports \n     these public fears [of dangerousness] to an extent rarely \n     acknowledged by mental health professionals. . . . It is \n     [therefore] futile and inappropriate to badger the news and \n     entertainment media with appeals to help destigmatize the \n     mentally ill.''\n       Tipper Gore and the White House must tackle 30 years of \n     failed deinstitutionalization policy if they hope to win the \n     battle of mental illness stigma and solve the nation's mental \n     illness crisis. Hundreds of thousands of vulnerable Americans \n     are eking out a pitiful existence on city streets, \n     underground in subway tunnels or in jails and prisons because \n     of the misguided efforts of civil rights advocates to keep \n     the severely ill out of hospitals and out of treatment.\n       The images of these gravely ill citizens on our city \n     landscapes are bleak reminders of the failure of \n     deinstitutionalization. They are seen huddling over steam \n     grates in the cold, animatedly carrying on conversations with \n     invisible companions, wearing filthy, tattered clothing, \n     urinating and defecating on sidewalks or threatening \n     passersby. Worse still, they frequently are seen being \n     carried away on stretchers as victims of suicide or violent \n     crime, or in handcuffs as perpetrators of violence against \n     others.\n       All of this occurs under the watchful eyes of fellow \n     citizens and government officials who do nothing but shake \n     their heads in blind tolerance. The consequences of failing \n     to treat these illnesses are devastating. While Americans \n     with untreated severe mental illnesses represent less than \n     one percent of our population, they commit almost 1,000 \n     homicides in the United States each year. At least one-third \n     of the estimated 600,000 homeless suffer from schizophrenia \n     or manic-depressive illness, and 28 percent of them forage \n     for some of their food in garbage cans. About 170,000 \n     individuals, or 10 percent, of our jail and prison \n     populations suffer from these illnesses, costing American \n     taxpayers a staggering $8.5 billion per year.\n       Moreover, studies suggest that delaying treatment results \n     in permanent harm, including increased treatment resistance, \n     worsening severity of symptoms, increased hospitalizations \n     and delayed remission of symptoms. In addition, persons \n     suffering from severe psychiatric illnesses are frequently \n     victimized. Studies have shown that 22 percent of women with \n     untreated schizophrenia have been raped. Suicide rates for \n     these individuals are 10 to 15 times higher than the general \n     population.\n       Weak state treatment laws coupled with inadequate \n     psychiatric hospital beds have only served to compound the \n     devastation for this population. Nearly half of those \n     suffering from these insidious illnesses do not realize they \n     are sick and in need of treatment, because their brain \n     disease has affected their self-awareness. Because they do \n     not believe they are sick, they refuse medication. Most state \n     laws today prohibit treating individuals over their objection \n     unless they pose an immediate danger to themselves. In other \n     words, an individual must have a finger on the trigger of a \n     gun before any medical care will be prescribed.\n       Studies have proved that outpatient commitment is effective \n     in ensuring treatment compliance. While many states have some \n     form of assisted treatment on the books, the challenge \n     remains in getting them to utilize what is at their disposal \n     rather than tolerating the revolving-door syndrome of \n     hospital admissions, readmissions, abandonment to the streets \n     and incarceration that engulfs those not receiving treatment.\n       Adequate care in psychiatric facilities also must be \n     available. Between 5 and 10 percent of the 3.5 million people \n     suffering from schizophrenia and manic-depressive illness \n     require long-term hospitalization--which means \n     hospitalization in state psychiatric hospitals. This critical \n     need is not being met, since we have lost effectively 93 \n     percent of our state psychiatric hospital beds since 1955.\n       It is time to recognize that feel-good mental health \n     policies have caused grave suffering for those most ill and \n     that real solutions must be developed. The lives of millions \n     of Americans depend on it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times July 12, 1999]\n\n      National Report--Prisons Brim With Mentally Ill, Study Finds\n\n                          (By Fox Butterfield)\n\n       The first comprehensive study of the rapidly growing number \n     of emotionally disturbed people in the nation's jails and \n     prison has found that there are 283,800 inmates with mental \n     illness, about 16 percent of the jail population. The report \n     confirms the belief of many state, local and Federal experts \n     that jails and prisons have become the nation's new mental \n     hospitals.\n       The study, released by the Justice Department yesterday, \n     paints a grim statistical portrait, detailing how mentally \n     ill inmates tend to follow a revolving door from homelessness \n     to incarceration and then back to the streets with little \n     treatment, many of them arrested for crimes that grow out of \n     their illnesses.\n       The report found that mentally ill inmates in state prisons \n     were more than twice as likely to have been homeless before \n     their arrests than other inmates, twice as likely to have \n     been physically or sexually abused in childhood and far more \n     likely to have been using drugs or alcohol.\n       In another reflection of their chaotic lives, the study \n     found that emotionally disturbed inmates had many more \n     incarcerations than other inmates. More than three-quarters \n     of them had been sentenced to jail or prison before, and have \n     had served three or more prior sentences.\n       One of the most striking findings in the study, and the one \n     most likely to be disputed, is that mentally ill inmates in \n     state prisons were more likely than other prisoners to have \n     been convicted of a violent crime. Too, many emotionally \n     disturbed inmates were arrested for little more than bizarre \n     behavior or petty crimes, like loitering or public \n     intoxication, but the report, by the Justice Department's \n     Bureau of Justice Statistics, did not offer any breakdown on \n     this category of convictions.\n       Moreover, once incarcerated, emotionally disturbed inmates \n     in state prisons spend an average of 15 months longer behind \n     bars than others, often because their delusions, \n     hallucinations or paranoia make hem more likely to get into \n     fights or receive disciplinary reports.\n       ``This study provides data to show that the incarceration \n     of the mentally ill is a disastrous, horrible social issue,'' \n     said Kay Redfield Jamison, a professor of psychiatry at the \n     Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. ``There is something \n     fundamentally broken in the system that covers both hospitals \n     and jails,'' said Professor Jamison, the author of ``Night \n     Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide,'' to be published later \n     this year by Knopf.\n       With the wholesale closings of public mental hospitals in \n     the 1960's, and the prison boom of the last two decades, \n     jails are often the only institutions open 24 hours a day and \n     required to take the emotionally disturbed.\n       The hospitals were closed at a time when new antipsychotic \n     drugs made medicating patients in the community seem a humane \n     alternative to long-term hospitalization. From a high of \n     559,000 in 1955, the number of patients in state hospitals \n     dropped to 69,000 in 1995.\n       But drugs work only when taken and many states failed to \n     build a promised network of clinics to monitor patients. To \n     compound the problem, for-profit hospitals began turning away \n     the psychotic, who tend to be more expensive and stay longer \n     than other patients, and are often without health insurance.\n       At the same time, the number of jail and prison beds has \n     quadrupled in the last 25 years, with 1.8 million Americans \n     now behind bars.\n       ``Jails have become the poor person's mental hospitals,'' \n     said Linda A. Teplin, a professor of psychiatry and director \n     of the psycho-legal studies program at Northwestern \n     University.\n       After years of inattention by the Government, the problem \n     has generated a flurry of interest in the Clinton \n     Administration, led by Tipper Gore and Attorney General Janet \n     Reno, whose department is sponsoring a major conference on it \n     next week.\n       All previous estimates of the number of emotionally \n     disturbed inmates have been based on research by Professor \n     Teplin in the Cook County Jail in Chicago. She found that 9.5 \n     percent of male inmates there had experienced a severe mental \n     disorder like schizophrenia, manic depression or major \n     depression, four times the rate in the general population.\n       Professor Teplin said that while she welcomed the Justice \n     Department count, it was\n\n[[Page S8297]]\n\n     open to question because the study relied on reports by the \n     inmates themselves, who were asked whether they had a mental \n     condition or had ever received treatment for a mental \n     problem. People with emotional disorders often are not aware \n     of them or do not want to report them, she said, so the \n     Justice Department estimate of more than a quarter-million \n     inmates with mental illness may actually be too low, \n     Professor Teplin said.\n       In addition, she said, the study was not conducted by \n     mental health professionals using diagnostic tests, so it was \n     impossible to tell what mental disorders the inmates suffered \n     from, and whether they were severe illnesses, like \n     schizophrenia, or generally less severe problems, like \n     anxiety disorders.\n       The study found that 53 percent of emotionally disturbed \n     inmates in state prisons were sentenced for a violent crime, \n     compared with 46 percent of other prisoners. Specifically, \n     13.2 percent of mentally ill inmates in prisons had been \n     convicted of murder, compared with 11.4 percent of other \n     prisoners, and 12.4 percent of mentally ill inmates had been \n     convicted of sexual assault, compared with 7.9 percent of \n     other prisoners.\n       Advocates for the mentally ill have worked hard to show \n     that emotionally disturbed people are no more violent than \n     others, to try to lessen the stigma surrounding mental \n     illness. But recent research, while confirming that mentally \n     ill people may not be more violent than others, suggests that \n     they can become violent in a number of conditions, including \n     when they are off their medications or are taking drugs or \n     alcohol.\n       In another important finding, also subject to differing \n     interpretations, the study found that reported rates of \n     mental illness varied by race and gender, with white and \n     female inmates reporting higher rates than black and male \n     inmates. The highest rates of mental illness were among white \n     female state prisoners, with an estimated 29 percent of them \n     reporting emotional disorders, compared with 20 percent of \n     black female prisoners. Overall, 22.6 percent of white state \n     prisoners were identified as mentally ill, compared with 13.5 \n     percent of black prisoners.\n       Dr. Dorothy Otnow-Lewis, a psychiatrist, said the \n     differences were a result of white psychiatrists ``being very \n     bad at recognizing mental illness in minority individuals.'' \n     Psychiatrists are more likely to dismiss aggressive behavior \n     in men, particularly black men, as a result of their being \n     bad, rather than being mad, said Dr. Lewis, who is a senior \n     criminal justice fellow at the Center on Crime, Communities \n     and Culture of the Soros Foundation.\n       Michael Faenza, the president of the National Mental Health \n     Association, said the study ``shows that the criminal justice \n     system is just a revolving door for a person with mental \n     illness, from the street to jail and back without \n     treatment.''\n       Professor Jamison noted that jails and prisons are not \n     conducive to treatment, even when it is available. ``Inmates \n     get deprived of sleep,'' she said, ``and isolation can \n     exacerbate their hallucinations or delusions.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/12/senate-section/article/S8297-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO CLD CONSULTING ENGINEERS\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Open-market Reorganization \n     for the Betterment of International Telecommunications Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act to promote a fully \n     competitive domestic and international market for satellite \n     communications services for the benefit of consumers and \n     providers of satellite services by fully encouraging the \n     privatization of the intergovernmental satellite \n     organizations, INTELSAT and Inmarsat, and reforming the \n     regulatory framework of the COMSAT Corporation.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that:\n       (1) International satellite communications services \n     constitute a critical component of global voice, video and \n     data services, play a vital role in the integration of all \n     nations into the global economy and contribute toward the \n     ability of developing countries to achieve sustainable \n     development.\n       (2) The United States played a pivotal role in stimulating \n     the development of international satellite communications \n     services by enactment of the Communications Satellite Act of \n     1962 (47 U.S.C. 701-744), and by its critical contributions, \n     through its signatory, the COMSAT Corporation, in the \n     establishment of INTELSAT, which has successfully established \n     global satellite networks to provide member countries with \n     worldwide access to telecommunications services, including \n     critical lifeline services to the developing world.\n       (3) The United States played a pivotal role in stimulating \n     the development of international satellite communications \n     services by enactment of the International Maritime Satellite \n     Telecommunications Act (47 U.S.C. 751-757), and by its \n     critical contributions, through its signatory, COMSAT, in the \n     establishment of Inmarsat, which enabled member countries to \n     provide mobile satellite services such as international \n     maritime and global maritime distress and safety services to \n     include other satellite services, such as land mobile and \n     aeronautical communications services.\n        (4) By statute, COMSAT, a publicly traded corporation, is \n     the sole United States signatory to INTELSAT and, as such, is \n     responsible for carrying out United States commitments under \n     the INTELSAT Agreement and the INTELSAT Operating Agreement. \n     Pursuant to a binding Headquarters Agreement, the United \n     States, as a party to INTELSAT, has satisfied many of its \n     obligations under the INTELSAT Agreement.\n        (5) In the 37 years since enactment of the Communications \n     Satellite Act of 1962, satellite technology has advanced \n     dramatically, large-scale financing options have improved \n     immensely and international telecommunications policies have \n     shifted from those of natural monopolies to those based on \n     market forces, resulting in multiple private commercial \n     companies around the world providing, or preparing to \n     provide, the domestic, regional, and global satellite \n     telecommunications services that only INTELSAT and Inmarsat \n     had previously had the capabilities to offer.\n        (6) Private commercial satellite communications systems \n     now offer the latest telecommunications services to more and \n     more countries of the world with declining costs, making \n     satellite communications an attractive complement as well as \n     an alternative to terrestrial communications systems, \n     particularly in lesser developed countries.\n        (7) To enable consumers to realize optimum benefits from \n     international satellite communications services, and to \n     enable these systems to be competitive with other \n     international telecommunication systems, such as fiber optic \n     cable, the global trade and regulatory environment must \n     support vigorous and robust competition.\n        (8) In particular, all satellite systems should have \n     unimpeded access to the markets that they are capable of \n     serving, and the ability to compete in a fair and meaningful \n     way within those markets.\n        (9) Transforming INTELSAT and Inmarsat from \n     intergovernmental organizations into conventional satellite \n     services companies is a key element in bringing about the \n     emergence of a fully competitive global environment for \n     satellite services.\n       (10) The issue of privatization of any State-owned firm is \n     extremely complex and multifaceted. For that reason, the sale \n     of a firm at arm's length does not automatically, and in all \n     cases, extinguish any prior subsidies or government conferred \n     advantages.\n        (11) It is in the interest of the United States to \n     negotiate the removal of its reservation in the Fourth \n     Protocol to the General Agreement on Trade in Services \n     regarding INTELSAT's and Inmarsat's access to the United \n     States market through COMSAT as soon as possible, but such \n     reservation cannot be removed without adequate assurance that \n     the United States market for satellite services will not be \n     disrupted by such INTELSAT or Inmarsat access.\n        (12) The Communications Satellite Act of 1962, and other \n     applicable United States laws, need to be updated to \n     encourage and complete the pro-competitive privatization of \n     INTELSAT and Inmarsat, to update the domestic United States \n     regulatory regime governing COMSAT, and to ensure a \n     competitively neutral United States framework for the \n     provision of domestic and international telecommunications \n     services via satellite systems.\n\n[[Page S8298]]\n\n     SEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF SATELLITE SERVICES COMPETITION; \n                   PRIVATIZATION.\n\n       The Communications Satellite Act of 1962 (47 U.S.C. 701) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n      ``TITLE VI--SATELLITE SERVICES COMPETITION AND PRIVATIZATION\n\n           ``Subtitle A--Transition to a Privatized INTELSAT\n\n     ``SEC. 601.

(a) Section 202(i) of the District of Columbia \n     Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of \n     1995 (Public Law 104-8) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(i) Reserve.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Beginning with fiscal year 2000, the \n     plan or budget submitted pursuant to this Act shall contain \n     $150,000,000 for a reserve to be established by the Mayor, \n     Council of the District of Columbia, Chief Financial Officer \n     for the District of Columbia, and the District of Columbia \n     Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority.\n       ``(2) Conditions on use.--The reserve funds--\n       ``(A) shall only be expended according to criteria \n     established by the Chief Financial Officer and approved by \n     the Mayor, Council of the District of Columbia, and District \n     of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management \n     Assistance Authority, but, in no case may any of the reserve \n     funds be expended until any other surplus funds have been \n     used;\n       ``(B) shall not be used to fund the agencies of the \n     District of Columbia government under court ordered \n     receivership; and\n       ``(C) shall not be used to fund shortfalls in the projected \n     reductions budgeted in the budget proposed by the District of \n     Columbia government for general supply schedule savings and \n     management reform savings.\n       ``(3) Report requirement.--The Authority shall notify the \n     Appropriations Committees of both the Senate and House of \n     Representatives in writing 30 days in advance of any \n     expenditure of the reserve funds.''.\n       (b) Section 202 of the District of Columbia Financial \n     Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995 (Public \n     Law 104-8) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(j) Positive Fund Balance.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The District of Columbia shall maintain \n     at the end of a fiscal year an annual positive fund balance \n     in the general fund of not less than 4 percent of the \n     projected general fund expenditures for the following fiscal \n     year.\n       ``(2) Excess funds.--Of funds remaining in excess of the \n     amounts required by paragraph (1)--\n       ``(A) not more than 50 percent may be used for authorized \n     non-recurring expenses; and\n       ``(B) not less than 50 percent shall be used to reduce the \n     debt of the District of Columbia.''.\n       Sec. 149.

Wireless Communications. (a) In General.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, not later than 7 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n     of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National \n     Park Service, shall--\n       (1) implement the notice of decision approved by the \n     National Capital Regional Director, dated April 7, 1999, \n     including the provisions of the notice of decision concerning \n     the issuance of right-of-way permits at market rates; and\n       (2) expend such sums as are necessary to carry out \n     paragraph (1).\n       (b) Antenna Applications.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, a Federal agency that receives an \n     application to locate a wireless communications antenna on \n     Federal property in the District of Columbia or surrounding \n     area over which the Federal agency exercises control shall \n     take final action on the application, including action on the \n     issuance of right-of-way permits at market rates.\n       (2) Guidance.--In making a decision concerning wireless \n     service in the District of Columbia or surrounding area, a \n     Federal agency described in paragraph (1) may consider, but \n     shall not be bound by, any decision or recommendation of--\n       (A) the National Capital Planning Commission; or\n       (B) any other area commission or authority.\n       Sec. 151. (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The District of Columbia has recently witnessed a spate \n     of senseless killings of innocent citizens caught in the \n     crossfire of shootings. A Justice Department crime \n     victimization survey found that while the city saw a decline \n     in the homicide rate between 1996 and 1997, the rate was the \n     highest among a dozen cities and more than double the second \n     highest city.\n       (2) The District of Columbia has not made adequate funding \n     available to fight drug abuse in recent years, and the city \n     has not deployed its resources as effectively as possible. In \n     fiscal year 1998, $20,900,000 was spent on publicly funded \n     drug treatment in the District compared to $29,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 1993. The District's Addiction and Prevention and \n     Recovery Agency currently has only 2,200 treatment slots, a \n     50 percent drop from 1994, with more than 1,100 people on \n     waiting lists.\n       (3) The District of Columbia has seen a rash of inmate \n     escapes from halfway houses. According to Department of \n     Corrections records, between October 21, 1998 and January 19, \n     1999, 376 of the 1,125 inmates assigned to halfway houses \n     walked away. Nearly 280 of the 376 escapees were awaiting \n     trial including 2 charged with murder.\n       (4) The District of Columbia public schools system faces \n     serious challenges in correcting chronic problems, \n     particularly long-standing deficiencies in providing special \n     education services to the 1 in 10 District students needing \n     program benefits, including backlogged assessments, and \n     repeated failure to meet a compliance agreement on special \n     education reached with the Department of Education.\n       (5) Deficiencies in the delivery of basic public services \n     from cleaning streets to waiting time at Department of Motor \n     Vehicles to a rat population estimated earlier this year to \n     exceed the human population have generated considerable \n     public frustration.\n       (6) Last year, the District of Columbia forfeited millions \n     of dollars in Federal grants after Federal auditors \n     determined that several agencies exceeded grant restrictions \n     and in other instances, failed to spend funds before the \n     grants expired.\n       (7) Findings of a 1999 report by the Annie E. Casey \n     Foundation that measured the well-being of children reflected \n     that, with 1 exception, the District ranked worst in the \n     United States in every category from infant mortality to the \n     rate of teenage births to statistics chronicling child \n     poverty.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that in considering the District of Columbia's fiscal year \n     2001 budget, the Senate will take into consideration progress \n     or lack of progress in addressing the following issues:\n       (1) Crime, including the homicide rate, implementation of \n     community policing, the number of police officers on local \n     beats, and the closing down of open-air drug markets.\n       (2) Access to drug abuse treatment, including the number of \n     treatment slots, the number of people served, the number of \n     people on waiting lists, and the effectiveness of treatment \n     programs.\n       (3) Management of parolees and pretrial violent offenders, \n     including the number of halfway house escapes and steps taken \n     to improve monitoring and supervision of halfway house \n     residents to reduce the number of escapes.\n       (4) Education, including access to special education \n     services and student achievement.\n       (5) Improvement in basic city services, including rat \n     control and abatement.\n       (6) Application for and management of Federal grants.\n       (7) Indicators of child well-being.\n\n[[Page S8307]]\n\n       Sec. 152. The Mayor, prior to using Federal Medicaid \n     payments to Disproportionate Share Hospitals to serve a small \n     number of childless adults, should consider the \n     recommendations of the Health Care Development Commission \n     that has been appointed by the Council of the District of \n     Columbia to review this program, and consult and report to \n     Congress on the use of these funds.\n       Sec. 153. Gao Study of District of Columbia Criminal \n     Justice System. Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall--\n       (1) conduct a study of the law enforcement, court, prison, \n     probation, parole, and other components of the criminal \n     justice system of the District of Columbia, in order to \n     identify the components most in need of additional resources, \n     including financial, personnel, and management resources; and\n       (2) submit to Congress a report on the results of the study \n     under paragraph (1).\n       Sec. 154. Termination of Parole for Illegal Drug Use. (a) \n     Arrest For Violation of Parole.--Section 205 of title 24 of \n     the District of Columbia Code is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence, by striking ``If the'' and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(a) If the''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), with respect to a \n     prisoner who is convicted of a crime of violence (as defined \n     in Sec. 23-1331) and who is released on parole at any time \n     during the term or terms of the prisoner's sentence for that \n     offense, the Board of Parole shall issue a warrant for the \n     retaking of the prisoner in accordance with this section, if \n     the Board, or any member thereof, has reliable information \n     (including positive drug test results) that the prisoner has \n     illegally used a controlled substance (as defined in Sec. 33-\n     501) at any time during the term or terms of the prisoner's \n     sentence.''.\n       (b) Hearing After Arrest; Termination of Parole.--Section \n     206 of title 24 of the District of Columbia Code is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, \n     with respect to a prisoner with respect to whom a warrant is \n     issued under section 205(b), if, after a hearing under this \n     section, the Board of Parole determines that the prisoner has \n     illegally used a controlled substance (as defined in Sec. 33-\n     501) at any time during the term or terms of the prisoner's \n     sentence, the Board shall terminate the parole of that \n     prisoner.''.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``District of Columbia \n     Appropriations Act, 2000''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/12/senate-section/article/S8307-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JULY 13, 1999\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its business today, it stand in recess until the hour \nof 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, July 13. I further ask unanimous consent that \non Tuesday, immediately following the prayer, the Journal of \nproceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed to have \nexpired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later \nin the day, and the Senate then begin a period of morning business \nuntil 10 a.m. with Senators speaking for up to 5 minutes each with the \nfollowing exceptions:\n  Senator Ashcroft, or his designee, 20 minutes;\n  Senator Daschle, or his designee, 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand \nin recess from the hours of 12:30 to 2:15 p.m. for the weekly policy \nconferences to meet. I finally ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate reconvenes at 2:15 p.m. Senator Smith of New Hampshire be \nrecognized for a point of personal privilege for not to exceed 45 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I say to my \nfriend, the majority whip, that I hope during the evening or in the \nmorning the majority would agree that we can tomorrow, until this bill \nis concluded, alternate the offering of amendments. That way we don't \nhave Senators trying to, in effect, jump ahead of someone else. I think \nit would add to much better movement of this bill. I hope my friend \ncould move that along.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Reid's suggestion. I \nthink it is a good suggestion. It is certainly my intention to \nalternate. I think the unanimous consent request agreement that we have \ncalls for alternating first-degree amendments and says that each side \nshall have a second-degree amendment. It didn't say we would be \nalternating from first-degree to second-degree amendments. I think the \nsuggestion of my colleague from Nevada is a good one, and I will work \nwith him to see that is the normal order of business. We may at some \npoint have a unanimous consent agreement to do that but not at this \ntime. I appreciate his suggestion, and as always, it is a pleasure for \nme to work with him to see if we can keep the Senate working together \nin a collegial and fair manner.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, further reserving the right to object, I \nalso say to my friend that I hope tomorrow the two leaders can work out \na time that we can vote. I assume it would be after the conferences--\nthe problem being now, with Senator Smith being recognized for a point \nof personal privilege, it would be sometime after that. But I hope the \nleaders can work that out as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, again I appreciate the clarification of \nmy colleague from Nevada. I think it would be our intention to vote on \nthe amendments. We now have a substitute offered. We have three \namendments that are pending in line. I expect there will be additional \namendments offered tomorrow and throughout the course of business.\n  For the information of all of our colleagues, we expect to have \nseveral votes in the next few days. With Senator Smith's speech \ntomorrow afternoon, my guess is that we will be voting on the \namendments as previously ordered sometime shortly after Senator Smith's \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/12/senate-section/article/S8307-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.
