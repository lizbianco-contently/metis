Often \nwe present our shopping list of blessings that we have in mind for our \nprojects, many of which we may not have checked out with You. Sometimes \nwe have little time to talk with You or listen to You. The blessings we \nreceive are empty unless we also receive a deeper fellowship with You. \nHelp us to think of prayer throughout this day as simply reporting in \nfor duty and asking for fresh marching orders. We want to be all that \nYou want us to be, and we want to do what You have planned for us. May \nthis opening prayer be the beginning of a conversation with You that \nlasts all through the day. Help us to attempt something we could not do \nwithout Your power. You are our Lord and Saviour.

Mr. President, I say to my friend that the veto message \nfrom the President will not arrive here until this evening sometime. So \nI do not think we can plan on doing anything with that today.\n  I also say to the majority, as soon as a determination is made as to \nhow much time the majority wants, I assume through Senator Murkowski, \nwe will be willing to enter into a time agreement with the proponents \nof this veto override. I hope it will be the majority leader's wish \nthat we can do this sometime tomorrow. As I indicated earlier, the veto \nwill not arrive until sometime this evening.\n  Having said that, I withdraw my objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest allowing morning business until 12 o'clock today.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, 2 weeks ago it was a Michigan nursing \nhome and Monday night it was a shootout at the National Zoo here in \nWashington, D.C. The epidemic of gun violence has become something that \naffects all Americans, not only those living in our inner cities.\n  Whenever we open our morning newspapers and read about these \ntragedies, we are left to wonder whether our loved ones might be the \nnext victims and whether our own community, our own neighborhood, and \nour own home could be tomorrow's headlines.\n  The devastation that guns have brought to our families and to our \ncommunities has been well documented, but the statistics bear \nrepeating. Only with an understanding of the dimensions of the problem \nwill we ever bring real change.\n  In 1997 alone, more than 32,000 Americans were shot and killed, \nincluding 4,000 children.\n  The American Academy of Pediatrics estimates by the year 2006 \nfirearms will become the largest single killer of our own children in \nthe United States.\n  The economic cost of every shooting death in society--if it is \nnecessary to measure it in these cold terms--is $1 million per victim \nin medical care, police services, and lost productivity.\n  The American public has grown tired of hearing of these appalling \nstatistics. And so have I. More importantly, they have grown tired of a \nCongress that does nothing about it, with no real efforts to stop this \nbloodshed.\n  Last April, it seemed that the senseless death of 12 students at \nColumbine High School had finally brought the Nation to a point of \njudgment. It even appeared to me that this Congress had finally had \nenough. The shocking and heartbreaking nature of the tragedy, which was \nreally unlike anything in its dimensions that the Nation had faced \nbefore, appeared to convince the Congress that it could no longer \nignore the problem.\n  Indeed, this Senate, in one of its finer moments since I became a \nMember of this institution, courageously passed a juvenile justice bill \nthat included three basic gun safety measures: It banned the possession \nof assault weapons by minors; it closed the gun show loophole; and it \nmandated safety locks on all firearms.\n  Originally, we had sought a more comprehensive solution that would \nrestrict gun sales to one per month, a reasonable proposal; reinstate \nthe Brady waiting period, proven to be an effective proposal; and \nregulate guns as consumer products, certainly a worthwhile proposal.\n  But we limited ourselves to those other basic provisions in the \ninterests of a consensus, with a belief that they were so sensible and \nso necessary that there could be no reasonable opposition. So before \nthe debate even began, the proposals had been limited to what should \nhave represented a consensus view, leaving the more ambitious but still \nreasonable proposals for another day.\n  But now, with the 1-year anniversary of the Columbine shootings \nhaving passed, it is clear that our confidence, perhaps even our \nstrategy, was misguided. Today, the bill languishes in conference--an \nunfortunate reminder that no gun law is too important or too \nresponsible that it cannot be opposed by the National Rifle \nAssociation.\n\n  In place of changes, the Republican leadership and the NRA have \noffered the American public flimsy rhetoric that blames gun violence on \npoor enforcement of existing gun laws. The NRA erroneously claims that \nprosecutions have plummeted under the Clinton administration when, in \nfact, these prosecutions rose by 25 percent last year.\n  This campaign provides nothing but further evidence that this agenda \nis not aimed at protecting our communities, but it is aimed at \nprotecting the status quo--a status quo that most Americans a long time \nago decided was unacceptable.\n  No one disputes the fact that enforcement is a critical element of \nany response to this problem. That is why, indeed, on this side of the \naisle we have supported 1,000 new ATF agents and 1,000 new prosecutors \nto deal with gun violence.\n  But as much as we have done, we can always do more; while laws are \nbeing enforced, they can be enforced better. But no one can reasonably \nbelieve that enforcement alone constitutes a comprehensive or \nsufficient answer to this national epidemic.\n  Better enforcement of every gun law ever written will not prevent the \n1,500 accidental shootings that are occurring every year. Enforcement \nof every gun law on the books would not prevent a 6-year-old boy from \nbringing his father's gun to school and killing a 6-year-old classmate. \nNor does it address the fact that 43 percent of parents leave their \nguns unsecured, and 13 percent have unsecured guns loaded or with \nammunition nearby. Enforcing gun laws, vigorous prosecutions, would \nanswer none of those problems.\n  These realities point to the need for a broad approach to gun \ncontrol. The provisions contained in the juvenile justice bill are the \nfirst steps, but they are important first steps.\n  The real answer--perhaps the challenge that should have come to this \nCongress last year--is to bring the entire issue to the Senate, and \nbuild upon what is already in the juvenile justice bill by also \nchallenging the Senate to restrict the sale of firearms to one per \nmonth, a simple provision which would help eliminate the problem under \nwhich my State is suffering, where people go to other States and buy \nlarge numbers of firearms and transport them to the cities of New \nJersey, selling them, often to children, out of the trunks of cars.\n  Second, reinstitute the Brady waiting period on handgun purchases to \nprevent individuals in fits of rage and passion from acting upon their \nemotions with a gun. Separate the rage of the individual from the \npurchase of the firearm, giving a cooling off period that can and would \nsave lives. Most important, we must do on the Federal level what \nMassachusetts recently did on the State level: regulate firearms as \nconsumer products. Firearms remain the only consumer product in America \nnot regulated for safety, a strange, inexplicable, peculiar exception \nto the law because they are inherently the most dangerous consumer \nproducts of them all.\n  It is, indeed, an absurd, inexplicable contradiction that a toy gun \nremains regulated but a real gun is not. Consumer regulation would \nensure that, as every other product in America, guns are safely \ndesigned, built, and distributed, not only for the benefit of the \npublic but also for the people who purchase them. Indeed, who has a \ngreater interest in gun safety by design and construction than the \npeople who buy guns? If the materials are imperfect, if they do not \nwork properly, it is the gun owner who is going to be hurt.\n  Together these three measures would make a real difference in ending \ngun violence. Would they end all gun violence? Would they end all \ncrime? Indeed, not. No single provision, no amendment, no law, no \nsingle action could eliminate all gun violence or most gun violence. \nBut if we await a perfect solution, we will act upon no solution. \nEnding the problems of violence and guns in America is not something \nthat will be done by one Congress or one legislative proposal in any \none year or probably in any one decade. It is successive ideas in \nsucceeding Congresses where people of goodwill put the public interest \nfirst and look for real and serious answers to this epidemic of \nviolence.\n  As long as the NRA is allowed to dominate the gun debate in place of \ncommon sense and compassion, the Columbines of the future are sadly, \neven tragically, inevitable. It is time for Congress to finally muster \nthe courage to act responsibly on this issue out of concern for our \nchildren. Out of respect for the memories of those who have died, we \ncan and should do nothing less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/26/senate-section/article/S2891-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2891-S2892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2891]]\n                        THE POWER OF LEADERSHIP\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for \nraising this important issue of gun safety.\n  One of the most important powers of the leadership on Capitol Hill is \nthe power to schedule a hearing, the power to bring a bill to the \nfloor, the power to tell a committee to bring a bill forward so it can \nbe considered.\n  Currently, the Republicans are in control of the Senate as well as \nthe House of Representatives, and they have this awesome congressional \npower and responsibility. Over the last several days, there have been \ncalls from the leadership, the Speaker of the House as well as the \nmajority leader of the Senate, that this Senate and House basically \ndrop what they are doing and start gathering information and \ndocumentation for an emergency hearing on the question of what occurred \nin Miami, FL, last Saturday morning. That is to the exclusion of a lot \nof other things that could be considered by the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  The Hill newspaper and others have talked about this Republican \nfervor over investigating Attorney General Janet Reno and others about \nthe Elian Gonzalez controversy. This is an important issue. It has \ncertainly captured the imagination of many Americans and the attention \nof the press and a lot of politicians. I think it is worth looking into \nto consider the procedures that have been used and could be used. But \nwould we step back and say, when we look at the state of America today, \nthat this is the single most important thing that we should be doing \nright here on Capitol Hill? My guess is, in my home State of Illinois, \nthe State of Ohio, as well as many other States, families might \nsuggest: Before you get into that, could you take a look at education? \nCould you take a look at reducing violent crime in our country? Could \nyou consider a Patients' Bill of Rights so if someone gets sick in my \nfamily, the doctor can make the medical decision instead of the \ninsurance company? And while you are at it, my mother or grandmother is \non Medicare and can't pay for her prescription drugs. Could you take a \nlook at that incidentally? Is that something you could put on your \npriority list?\n  Quite honestly, those things will come out in polls across America as \nthings about which people are concerned. They would like us to drop, \nperhaps, our focus on a 6-year-old boy from Cuba for just a few minutes \nand think about education, think about reducing gun violence in \nAmerica, a Patients' Bill of Rights, a prescription drug benefit. \nSadly, those items are not on the agenda. They don't capture the \nattention of the Republican leadership. Their attention is on this 6-\nyear-old boy.\n  I hope we can focus the attention of Congress on some other issues. I \nhope we can earn our pay for a change and consider some bills and some \nlaws that just might improve the quality of life of families across \nAmerica. I kind of thought that was part of our job. We were elected \nfrom 50 different States to come here to show some leadership and \nrespond to the people back home to make America a better place to live.\n  Senator Torricelli of New Jersey talked about gun safety. We are just \na few days away from the first anniversary, the sad anniversary of the \ntragedy at Columbine High School. That focused America's attention. It \nshocked us to believe that a high school in the suburbs of Denver could \nend up having this tragedy visited upon it and 12 children who got up \nand went to school never came home.\n\n  We saw that the two students who started this rampage got their guns \nfrom gun shows. We decided in Congress we had to do something. So we \nbrought a bill forward, a gun safety bill, that had three basic \nprovisions in it. The bill said, if you buy a gun at a gun show, we \nwant to know whether you are legally disqualified from owning a gun. Of \ncourse, if you buy it from a gun dealer, we already make that inquiry. \nWe want to know if you have a criminal record. We want to know if you \nhappen to be a fugitive, a stalker, a wife beater, someone who is \nineligible because they are too young, someone who has a history of \nviolent mental illness. If we are going to preserve the second \namendment right to own and bear arms, many of us believe we want to \nkeep guns out of the hands of criminals and children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The sportsmen and hunters in the State of Illinois and \nthose I speak to around the country tend to agree. They want to use \ntheir guns legally and safely. They want to keep them away from \ncriminals and children.\n  We put in the provision of this law a background check at gun shows. \nHow frequent are gun shows? Come to downstate Illinois; they are pretty \nfrequent. They have them at civic centers, all sorts of different \nplaces. We are not the leading State for gun shows. The leading State \nfor gun shows is Texas. I will return to that in a moment.\n  Secondly, we said, let's have trigger locks sold with guns. As \nSenator Torricelli said earlier, 43 percent of guns are sitting around \nresidences within easy access of children. How many times do you pick \nup the paper and read about a kid playing with a gun, shooting himself \nor a playmate? How many parents say, we don't have guns in our house \nbecause we think it is dangerous. But do you know whether your \nplaymate's family has guns lying around. Who is so naive to believe \nthat children never find Christmas gifts or guns? They go looking and \nthey find them. Sometimes tragedy results.\n  We want trigger locks so the guns are secure, so a child who picks up \nthat gun can't harm himself or others. Is this a radical idea? I think \nit is as sensible an idea as putting brakes on a car.\n  Finally, Senator Feinstein added an amendment which said we don't \nwant to import high-capacity ammo clips from overseas that can only be \nused for the semiautomatic and automatic weapons to sweep bullets in \nevery direction. I have said that if you need a semiautomatic weapon or \nan assault weapon to shoot a deer, you ought to stick to fishing. Far \ntoo many people in this country think this is an invasion of second \namendment rights. Too many people argue that we shouldn't even have \nthese reasonable regulations in gun ownership.\n\n  We passed this bill that I am talking about on the floor of the \nSenate by one vote. Vice President Gore, as is his right under the \nConstitution, came to this Chair and voted. We passed the bill and sent \nit to the House. That was over 10 months ago. The bill, of course, was \nthen subject to the National Rifle Association and all of the gun lobby \nbeating up on it. They passed a terrible alternative to it. It has now \nbeen sitting in a conference committee month after weary month. We \ncannot summon the political will or courage to bring a gun safety bill \nout here to try to make the streets, the schools, and, yes, the zoos of \nAmerica safe for families and children. No. We want to have an \nemergency hearing on a 6-year-old boy from Cuba. We want to drop \neverything. We want to subpoena all of the documents. This summons is \nmore important. I think they are wrong.\n  When it comes to education, we have tried to focus on smaller class \nsizes so teachers can spend more time with kids who need help. We have \ntried to focus on afterschool programs so during that period of time \nwhen the school let's out before mom and dad get home kids have a \nchance to stay in a supervised situation at school so they can be \ntutored; if they are falling behind, enrichment classes if they are \nkids who are doing well; play a little sports but do something under \nsupervision; summer school for the same reason--so that education \nstarts reflecting the reality of family life.\n  We think we can focus as well on a Patients' Bill of Rights so we can \nsay that doctors will make medical decisions and not insurance company \nclerks. Every medical group in America, nurses and doctors--all of \nthem--support us. We would like to see the decisions on the future of \neach family's health made by health care professionals and not by \npeople looking at the bottom line of an insurance company. We believe a \nprescription drug benefit is a high priority.\n  I had hearings across Illinois, and I have seen it across the Nation. \nThere are people who are literally deciding between food and medicine. \nElderly and disabled people can't afford the\n\n[[Page S2892]]\n\nmedicine their doctors prescribe. So they do not fill the \nprescriptions. They cut the pills in half. They do things they \nshouldn't do, and they get sick. When they get sick, what happens? They \nend up in a hospital. If they end up in a hospital, guess what. \nMedicare will pay the bills now. We wouldn't pay for the pills to keep \nthem out of the hospital but we will pay for the pills when they get \nsick and go to a hospital.\n  We think a prescription drug benefit makes sense. We think that is \nwhat we should be debating on the floor of the Senate. But we do not. \nAnother week passes by. We consider a lot of other things, and families \nacross America return to ask us: Where are your priorities? What are \nyou thinking about?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will conclude. I thank you, Mr. President, for the time \nyou have given me this morning and hope that the leadership on Capitol \nHill will feel the same passion, the same intensity, and have the same \ncommitment to issues that American families care about than they do \nabout one family from Cuban.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to build on the comments of my \ncolleague, Senator Durbin--not in a shrill way but I guess in a \ndetermined way.\n  A good friend of mine has really become a dear friend. I love his \nwork. Jonathan Kozol wrote a book called ``Amazing Grace: The Lives of \nChildren and the Conscience of a Nation.'' He has now written another \nbook. I think people in the country, as is the case with all of \nJonathan's work--and I wouldn't be surprised if the Chair in his \ncommitment to children hasn't read some of his work--have read his work \nbecause it is very important. He sent to me yesterday in the mail--I \ndidn't bring it with me to the floor because I didn't realize I had a \nchance to speak--some data about per pupil expenditures in New York \nCity and surrounding suburbs.\n  The long and the short of it is that the suburbs surrounding the \ncity, because of the wealth of the communities with strong reliance on \nproperty taxes, are able to spend about twice as much per pupil as the \ninner city. Not surprisingly, their teachers are certified and \nqualified, which is not the case necessarily in the city in terms of \nhaving had the experience of certification or expertise in the subject \nmatter. Not surprisingly, therefore, there is tremendous variation in \nterms of those children and their opportunities to succeed.\n  I raise this question because I hope that soon we will have the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act out on the floor. When we do, I \nhope it will be the Senate at its best.\n  I am going to register the same, if you will, grievance or sharp \ndissent from the majority leader. I haven't done it behind his back. He \nknows what my position is about the way we have been operating.\n  I hope when this bill comes to the floor this will not be yet another \ncase of the majority leader essentially saying: Look, only the \nfollowing amendments will be in order. Any other amendments will not \nbe. What happens is there is no agreement, and the majority leader \nfiles cloture. Then cloture is not invoked. Then the bill is pulled. I \nhope we don't see that.\n  Last week, or the week before our recess, we had this debate over the \nmarriage penalty tax. There were a number of us who wanted to bring out \namendments that we thought were terribly important dealing with \nprescription drug costs. Again, the majority leader said: This isn't \nrelevant, and therefore I choose not to go forward. We had a debate \nabout it and cloture was invoked. We will have that debate again. Or \nthere was an effort to invoke cloture, cloture was not obtained, and \nthe bill was pulled.\n  I think that is what happened, and, as a result, I think the Senate \nhas lost its vitality.\n  I was elected in 1991. Honest to goodness, I think it is the truth. I \ndon't think anybody can present evidence to the contrary. The way I \nremember it was that up until fairly recently, this was the pattern: A \nbill would come to the floor. Senators would come with amendments. We \nmight have 60 or 90 amendments. Some would drop off and some of them \nwouldn't. We could go at it. We would start in the morning, go into the \nevening, and take a week, or 10 days, or 2 weeks. But we had debates. \nWe had discussion. We had votes. We dealt with issues that were \nimportant to people's lives. We voted yes. We voted no. We had some \nvitality.\n  I say to the majority leader that I believe we have moved away from \nthat to the detriment of this institution. I think we are sucking the \nvitality out of the Senate by the way we are conducting business. I \nstrongly dissent from the majority leader in the way he has been \nproceeding. It is true that in this way people do not have to vote on \namendments. But what representative democracy is all about is \naccountability. What the Senate is all about is it is an amendment \nbody. It is a debate body. And individual Senators, whether you have a \nlot of seniority or whether you don't, can make a difference in the \nSenate--or could make a difference in the Senate before--because you \ncould bring amendments and have at it.\n  I started out focusing on children and education. I am real \ninterested, as long as we are talking about high standards, in making \nsure every child has the same opportunity to meet those standards. I \nwould like to talk about that.\n  You and I, Mr. President, talked some about early childhood \ndevelopment and how important it is pre-K. Why isn't the Federal \nGovernment more of a player? Why aren't we getting more resources? Your \ncolleague from Ohio feels just as strongly about it. You and I talked \nabout it. Why is it that people working with children ages 3 and 4 do \nsuch important work, and then all of their work is so devalued in terms \nof the pay they make? How can we provide the incentive for men and \nwomen to go into the field?\n  I am concerned, as is Senator Durbin, coming from a State such as \nmine that only one-third of senior citizens in our State have \nprescription drug coverage at all. I see it all the time in terms of \nwhat this has done to people. It is not atypical to talk to a single \nelderly woman whose husband has passed away. She might be 75. Her \nmonthly income might be $600 and $300 of it is for prescription drug \ncosts.\n  I want to come out here to talk about a bill Senator Dorgan and I \nhave worked on that would make a huge difference in terms of costs. \nBut, no, we couldn't have that debate.\n  I am from an agricultural State. We have an economic convulsion in \nagriculture. Many people who I love and respect work so hard. No one \ncan say they don't work hard. It doesn't matter; they can work 19 hours \na day. They can be the greatest managers in the world. They are being \nspit out of the economy and they are losing their farms in this \neconomy. I want to talk about how we can make some changes to the farm \nbill passed in 1996 called Freedom to Farm--some of us call it \n``freedom to fail''--so we can deal with the price crises. I would like \nto talk about whether we can reach an agreement on the antitrust action \nso producers can have a level playing field.\n\n  Mr. President, there are many issues that are important to people's \nlives, whether people live in metro, urban, rural, or suburban \ncommunities. There are many issues that are important to children to \nmake sure that we as a nation at least come closer to reaching our \nnational vow of equal opportunity for every child. There are issues \nthat deal with reform and, God knows, I would think all of us would \nhate the mix of money in politics. I can't stand raising money. I can't \nbear it. I hate getting on the phone. I think, systemically, it creates \ntremendous problems in terms of undercutting representative democracy, \nwhere some people have too much access to both parties at an \ninstitutional level and too many people don't.\n  I would like to see us focus on reform. I have just mentioned some\n\n[[Page S2893]]\n\nissues and I have taken up more than 5 minutes. I make the appeal to \nthe majority leader in particular that we have at it, with the \nopportunity to bring amendments to the floor. Let's debate and operate \nthe Senate at its best. We can be good Senators and be at our best. \nSome Senators can be great Senators if they have the opportunity to \noffer amendments and have adequate debate and vote them up or down and \nvote the legislation up or down.\n  I am speaking in morning business. I am sick of morning business at \nquarter to 11. I want a bill out here. I want amendments. I want \nsubstantive debate and up-or-down votes, and I want us to be \naccountable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, many times I have come to the floor to \nexpress my concerns regarding the threat of illegal drugs to our young \npeople. Today, I want to address one drug in particular, a designer \ndrug called Ecstasy. Although it has been around a long time, its use \nhas exploded recently. As with most such drugs, drug pushers are \nmarketing it as a safe drug. That's a lie.\n  Ecstasy is a Schedule I synthetic drug with amphetamine-like \nproperties that is inexpensive and easy to make. It acts as a stimulant \nand a hallucinogen for approximately 4 to 6 hours and gives its users a \nfalse sense of ease and relaxation. Because of these effects, Ecstasy \nis often found in big city club scenes that specialize in attracting \nyoung people. Recently, however, the nation is experiencing an Ecstasy \nexplosion, which is spreading this dangerous drug into suburban and \nrural areas. With the recent release of a study on substance abuse in \nmid-size cities and rural America by the National Center on Addiction \nand Substance Abuse (CASA), this is particularly disturbing.\n  In January of this year, CASA warned that Americans need to recognize \nthat drugs are not only an urban problem, but a rural problem as well. \nI see this in my own state of Iowa. CASA reports that 8th graders \nliving in rural America are 34 percent more likely to smoke marijuana \nand 83 percent more likely to use crack cocaine, than those in urban \nareas. It also reports that among 10th graders, use rates in rural \nareas exceed those in urban areas for every drug except marijuana and \nEcstasy. The key here is that Ecstasy is not yet, but is quickly \nbecoming a rural drug. It is imperative that parents and kids become \naware of Ecstasy and the dangers of use.\n  Unfortunately, Ecstasy is quickly becoming the drug of choice among \nmany of our young people. It is perceived by many as harmless because \nnegative effects are not immediately noticeable. In fact, Ecstasy is \noften referred to as a recreational drug. For this reason, it is not \nsurprising that Monitoring the Future, an annual study that monitors \nillicit drug use among teenagers, reported Ecstasy use growing. \nLifetime use among 12th graders increased from one in fifteen in 1998 \nto one in twelve in 1999. Past year use went from one in twenty-five in \n1998 to one in fifteen in 1999. This is a disturbing upward trend.\n  Ecstasy is a dangerous drug that can be lethal. Many are unaware that \nit can cause increased heart rate, nausea, fainting, chills, and sleep \nproblems. In addition to physical effects, there are also psychological \neffects such as panic, confusion, anxiety, depression, and paranoia. \nScientists are also learning that Ecstasy may cause irreversible brain \ndamage, and in some cases it simply stops the heart. We need to put an \nend to the spread of Ecstasy into our communities. We need to take away \nits image as safe. We need to counter the arguments, that it is a fun \ndrug.\n  However, with recent reports of rises in Ecstasy seizures by the U.S. \nCustoms Service, it seems we have a long, hard battle ahead of us. In \nfiscal year 1999, Customs seized 3 million doses of Ecstasy. In the \nfirst 5 months of fiscal year 2000, Customs seized 4 million doses. \nEcstasy has become such a threat that Customs has established an \nEcstasy Task Force to gather intelligence on criminal smuggling of \nEcstasy. Customs has also trained 13 dogs to detect Ecstasy among those \ncrossing the border and entering major airports.\n  Although much is being done to stop the flow into our country, we \nneed to play our part and educate the young people in our communities. \nIn my home state of Iowa, Ecstasy is not yet a major problem and this \nmay be the case in your home states as well. However, I am here today \nto tell you that if it isn't a problem now, it may be soon. We need to \nstop the use of Ecstasy before it starts. And the way to do that is to \neducate the parents and young people in our communities on the dangers. \nI don't want to see any more innocent lives cut short or careers ruined \nbecause of bad or no information.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

Mr. President, this morning there is fresh evidence that \nmillions of our older Americans cannot afford their prescription \nmedicine. I have come to the floor of this Senate on more than 20 \noccasions now to make this point. But the news this morning comes at an \nespecially important time. On both sides of Capitol Hill efforts are \nunderway to develop a practical approach to making sure older people \ncan get prescription drug coverage under the Medicare program.\n  I have had the opportunity for many months now to work with \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, and I am especially appreciative \nof the efforts of Senator Daschle to try to bring Members of the Senate \ntogether to find common ground in this session to get prescription drug \ncoverage for older people. Under Senator Daschle's leadership, \nprinciples have been developed that every Member of the Senate would \nfind appealing and attractive to. We have talked, for example, about \nhow this program would be voluntary. No senior citizen who is \ncomfortable with their prescription drug coverage would be required to \ndo anything if they chose not to. That is something that would be \nattractive to both parties.\n  We have talked about making sure this is a market-oriented approach, \nthat we use the kind of forces that are available to individuals \nreceiving coverage in the private sector through private insurance and \nthrough health maintenance organizations. We want to make sure the \nbenefit is available in all parts of the United States. There are areas \nof this country where there may not be big health plans, but as long as \nthere is a telephone, a pharmacy, and a mailbox, we are going to be \nable to get the medicine to those older people in an affordable way.\n  Finally, many of my colleagues and I believe coverage ought to be \nuniversal. It ought to be available to all people on the Medicare \nprogram.\n  The most important point--and it is why I come to the floor today--is \nthat we have fresh evidence that millions of seniors can't afford their \nmedicine. We have to take steps to make the cost of medicine more \naffordable to the elderly. There is a right way to do this and a wrong \nway to do this. The wrong way is to institute a regime of private \ncontrols, a Federal one-size-fits-all approach because that involves a \nlot of cost shifting to other groups of citizens.\n  If we just have Federal price controls for the Medicare program, a \nlot of\n\n[[Page S2894]]\n\nwomen who are 27, single, with a couple of kids will see their \nprescription drug bill go through the roof. We will have to develop a \nmarket-oriented approach along the lines of what Members of Congress \nreceive through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. That way we \ncan give senior citizens the kind of bargaining power that folks have \nin a health maintenance organization or in a private plan. We could do \nit without price controls that produce a lot of cost shifting.\n  This is an important date in the discussion about prescription drugs. \nOur older people don't get prescription drug coverage under the \nMedicare program. That has been the case since it began in 1965. When \nthey walk into a pharmacy and don't have coverage, in effect, they are \nsubsidizing the big buyers--the health maintenance organizations and \nthe private plans.\n  I hope we can come together in the Senate to find common ground. \nSenator Daschle is trying to bring Members of the Senate together. I \nknow there are colleagues on the other side of the aisle who feel \nexactly the same. Let's not let this issue go off as campaign fodder \nfor the 2000 election. Let's not adjourn this session without coming \ntogether and enacting this important benefit for the elderly.\n  I don't believe America can afford not to cover prescription \nmedicine. A lot of these drugs today might cost up to $1,000, such as \nan anticoagulant drug that is so important for the elderly. That is \ncertainly a pricey sum. If a senior citizen can get anticoagulant \nmedicine to prevent a stroke that would cost upwards of $100,000 or \n$150,000, it is pretty clear that prescription drug coverage is a \nsensible and cost-effective approach for the Senate to take.\n  I intend to return to the floor in the future, as I have done on more \nthan 20 occasions, in an effort to bring the Senate together. I am \nespecially appreciative of Senator Daschle's patience in our effort to \ntry to find common ground. I know there are colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle who feel the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the news media is buzzing with speculation \nthat President Clinton will attempt, in his final month in office, to \nstrike a major arms control deal with Russia--including a major ABM \nTreaty that would limit the ability of the United States to defend \nitself against ballistic missile attack.\n  White House officials have openly stated their concern that Mr. \nClinton faces the prospect of leaving office without a major arms \ncontrol agreement to his credit--the first President in memory to do \nso. And from this President--a man uniquely absorbed with his legacy--\nthat perhaps would be, to him, a personal tragedy.\n\n  Mr. Clinton wants an agreement, a signing ceremony, a final photo-op. \nHe wants a picture shaking hands with the Russian President, broad \nsmiles on their faces, large, ornately bound treaties under their arms, \nas the cameras click for perhaps the last time--a final curtain call.\n  I must observe that if the price of that final curtain call is a \nresurrection of the U.S.-Soviet ABM Treaty that would prevent the \nUnited States from protecting the American people against missile \nattack, then that price is just too high.\n  With all due respect, I do not intend to allow this President to \nestablish his legacy by binding the next generation of Americans to a \nfuture without a viable national missile defense.\n  For nearly 8 years, while North Korea and Iran raced forward with \ntheir nuclear programs, and while China stole the most advanced nuclear \nsecrets of the United States, and while Iraq escaped international \ninspections, President Clinton did everything in his power to stand in \nthe way of deploying a national missile defense. Do you want some \nfacts, Mr. President? Let's state some for the record.\n  In 1993, just months after taking office, Mr. Clinton ordered that \nall proposals for missile defense interceptor projects be returned \nunopened to the contractors that had submitted them.\n  In December of that same year, 1993, he withdrew the Bush \nadministration's proposal for fundamentally altering the ABM Treaty to \npermit deployment of national missile defenses at a time when Russia \nwas inclined to strike a deal.\n  By 1996, 3 years after taking office, Mr. Clinton had completely \ngutted the National Missile Defense Readiness Program. He slashed the \nnational missile defense budget by more than 80 percent.\n  In 1997, he signed two agreements to revive and expand the U.S.-\nSoviet ABM Treaty, including one that would expand ABM restrictions to \nprevent not only national missile defense for the American people but \nto constrain theater missile defenses to protect our troops in the \nfield.\n  Then for the next 3 years, the President, heeding some of his \nadvisers, no doubt, refused to submit those agreements to the Senate, \ndespite making a legally binding commitment to submit them. He made \nthat commitment to me in writing. He did not submit them because he was \nafraid the Senate would reject them, while in doing so would clear the \nway for rapid deployment of missile defenses. To this day, he still has \nnot fulfilled his legal requirement to submit those treaties for the \nSenate's advice and consent.\n  In December 1995, Mr. Clinton vetoed legislation that would have \nrequired the deployment of a national missile defense with an initial \noperational capability by the year 2001.\n  Three years later, in 1998, he again killed missile defense \nlegislation--the American Missile Protection Act--which called for the \ndeployment of national missile defense, as soon as its technology was \nready, by threatening a veto and rallying Democratic Senators to \nfilibuster the legislation.\n  Only in 1999 did he at long last sign missile defense legislation \ninto law, but only after it passed both Houses of Congress by a veto-\nproof majority and only after the independent Rumsfeld Commission had \nissued a stinging bipartisan report declaring that the Clinton \nadministration had dramatically underestimated the ballistic missile \nthreat to the United States.\n\n  But while Mr. Clinton was doing all this, costing America almost 8 \nyears in a race against time to deploy missile defenses, our \nadversaries were forging ahead with their missile systems.\n  While Mr. Clinton was dragging his feet, for example, foreign \nballistic missile threats to the United States grew in terms of both \nrange and sophistication. Today, several Third World nations possess, \nor are developing, ballistic missiles capable of delivering chemical, \nbiological, or nuclear warheads against cities in the United States.\n  According to the Rumsfeld Commission, both North Korea and Iran are \nwithin 5 years of possessing viable ICBMs capable of striking the \ncontinental United States, and North Korea may already today have the \ncapacity to strike Alaska and Hawaii. Last month, Communist China \nexplicitly threatened to use nuclear weapons against United States \ncities should the United States take any action to defend democratic \nTaiwan in the event Beijing launched an invasion of Taiwan.\n  So Mr. Clinton is in search of a legacy? La-di-da. He already has \none. The Clinton legacy is America's continued inexcusable \nvulnerability to ballistic missile attack. The Clinton legacy is 8 \nyears of negligence. The Clinton legacy is 8 years of lost time.\n  But in the twilight of his Presidency, Mr. Clinton now wants to \nstrike an ill-considered deal with Russia to purchase Russian consent \nto an inadequate U.S. missile defense--one single site in Alaska to be \ndeployed but not until 2005--in exchange for a new, revitalized ABM \nTreaty that would permanently bar any truly national missile defense \nsystem.\n  The President is attempting to lock this Nation, the United States of \nAmerica, into a system that cannot defend the American people, and the \nPresident is trying to resurrect the U.S.-Soviet ABM Treaty which would\n\n[[Page S2895]]\n\nmake it impossible for future enhancements to U.S. national missile \ndefense in general.\n  The agreement Mr. Clinton proposes would not permit space-based \nsensors; it would not permit sufficient numbers of ground-based radars; \nand it would not permit additional defenses based on alternate missile \ninterceptor systems, such as naval or sea-based interceptors. All of \nthese, and more, are absolutely necessary to achieve a fully effective \ndefense against the full range of possible threats to the American \npeople.\n  Mr. Clinton's proposal is not a plan to defend the United States; it \nis a plan to leave the United States defenseless. It is, in fact, a \nplan to salvage the antiquated and invalid U.S.-Soviet ABM Treaty. That \nis what it is. No more. No less. It is a plan that is going nowhere \nfast in protecting the American people.\n  After dragging his feet on missile defense for nearly 8 years, Mr. \nClinton now fervently hopes he will be permitted in his final 8 months \nin office to tie the hands of the next President of the United \nStates. He believes he will be allowed to constrain the next \nadministration from pursuing a real national missile defense. Is that \nwhat he believes or even hopes?\n\n  Well, I, for one, have a message for President Clinton: Not on my \nwatch, Mr. President. Not on my watch. It is not going to happen.\n  Let's be clear, to avoid any misunderstandings down the line: Any \nmodified ABM Treaty negotiated by this administration will be DOA--dead \non arrival--at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of which, as the \nChair knows, I happen to be the chairman.\n  This administration's failed security policies have burdened America \nand the American people long enough. In a few months, the American \npeople will go to the polls to elect a new President, a President who \nmust have a clean break from the failed policies of this \nadministration. He must have the freedom and the flexibility to \nestablish his own security policies.\n  To the length of my cable-tow, it is my intent to do everything in my \npower to ensure that nothing is done in the next few months by this \nadministration to tie the hands of the next administration in pursuing \na new national security policy, based not on scraps of parchment but, \nrather, on concrete defenses, a policy designed to protect the American \npeople from ballistic missile attack, a policy designed to ensure that \nno hostile regime--from Tehran to Pyongyang to Beijing--is capable of \nthreatening the United States of America and the American people with \nnuclear blackmail.\n  Any decision on missile defense will be for the next President of the \nUnited States to make, not this one. It is clear that the United States \nis no longer legally bound by the U.S.-Soviet ABM Treaty. Isn't it \nself-evident that the U.S.-Soviet ABM Treaty expired when the Soviet \nUnion, our treaty partner, ceased to exist? Legally speaking, I see no \nimpediment whatsoever to the United States proceeding with any national \nmissile defense system we--the American people and this Congress--\nchoose to deploy.\n  That said, for political and diplomatic reasons, the next President--\nthe next President--may decide that it is in the U.S. interest to sit \ndown with the Russians and offer them a chance to negotiate an \nagreement on this matter.\n  Personally, I do not believe a new ABM Treaty can be negotiated with \nRussia that would permit the kind of defenses America needs. As Henry \nKissinger said last year in testimony before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee:\n\n       Is it possible to negotiate a modification of the ABM \n     Treaty? Since the basic concept of the ABM Treaty is so \n     contrary to the concept of an effective missile defense, I \n     find it very difficult to imagine this. But I would be open \n     to argument--\n\n  And let me emphasize these words as Henry Kissinger emphasized them \nwhen he said--\n\n     provided that we do not use the treaty as a constraint on \n     pushing forward on the most effective development of a \n     national and theater missile defense.\n\n  Now then, like Dr. Kissinger, I am open to the remote possibility \nthat a new administration--unencumbered by the current President of the \nUnited States in his desperate desire for a legacy and this \nadministration's infatuation with the U.S.-Soviet ABM Treaty--could \nenter into successful negotiations with the Russians.\n\n  The Republican nominee for President, Mr. Bush of Texas, has declared \nthat on taking office he will give the Russians an opportunity to \nnegotiate a revised--a revised--ABM Treaty, one that will permit the \ndefenses America needs. But Mr. Bush made it clear that if the Russians \nrefuse, he will go forward nonetheless and deploy a national missile \ndefense. And good for him. Mr. Bush believes in the need for missile \ndefense, and he will negotiate from a position of strength.\n  By contrast, President Clinton clearly has no interest whatsoever in \nmissile defense. His agenda is not to defend America from ballistic \nmissile attack but to race against the clock to get an arms control \nagreement--any agreement; he means any agreement--that will prevent his \ngoing down in history as the first President in memory not to do so.\n  So it is obvious, I think, that any negotiations Mr. Clinton enters \ninto in his final months will be from a position of desperation and \nweakness.\n  For this administration--after opposing missile defense for almost 8 \nyears--to attempt at the 11th hour to try to negotiate a revised ABM \nTreaty is too little, too late. This administration has long had its \nchance to adopt a new security approach to meet the new threats and \nchallenges of the post-cold-war era. This administration, the Clinton \nadministration, chose not to do so.\n  So this administration's time for grand treaty initiatives is clearly \nat an end. For the remainder of this year, the Foreign Relations \nCommittee will continue its routine work. We will consider tax \ntreaties, extradition treaties, and other already-negotiated treaties. \nBut we will not consider any new last-minute arms control measures that \nthis administration may negotiate and cook up in its final, closing \nmonths in office.\n  As the chairman of this committee, I make it clear that the Foreign \nRelations Committee will not consider the next administration bound by \nany treaties this administration may try to negotiate in the coming 8 \nmonths.\n  The Russian Government should not be under any illusion whatsoever \nthat any commitments made by this lame-duck administration will be \nbinding on the next administration. America has waited 8 years for a \ncommitment to build and deploy a national missile defense. We can wait \na few more months for a new President committed to doing it--and doing \nit right--to protect the American people.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Few things are more \nimportant to our children's future than the quality of their education.\n  Every child in this country, regardless of race, economic status, or \nwhere that child lives, deserves the opportunity for a quality \neducation. Yet far too many children, especially in our inner cities \nand Appalachia, simply are not getting the quality education they \ndeserve.\n  We need more good teachers. We need safer schools. We need college \naccess for all students who want to go to college.\n  We must, as a nation, attract the smartest and the most dedicated of \nour students to the profession of teaching. Yes, we certainly have to \ninvest in\n\n[[Page S2896]]\n\ncomputers, new books, and new buildings. But we cannot ignore the \nsingle most important resource in any classroom--the teacher.\n  I have recalled before on this Senate floor something that my own \nhigh school principal, Mr. John Malone, told me 37 years ago. We were \nabout to go into a new building. Everyone was excited; everyone was \nhappy.\n  Mr. Malone came in and said to our class: We are about ready to go \ninto this new building. We are all excited about it. It is a great \nthing. We have prepared for this for a long time. I want you to always \nremember one thing: In education, there are only two things that really \nmatter. One is a student who wants to learn; the other is a good \nteacher. Everything else is interesting, maybe helpful. The only thing \nthat really matters is that teacher and that student.\n  What Mr. Malone told our class 37 years ago was right then, and it is \nstill correct today. We all know a good teacher has the power to \nfundamentally change the course of our life. Each one of us, if we are \nlucky, can recall one teacher or two or maybe three or many teachers \nwho fundamentally changed our life, who we think about when we do \nthings, whose voice still comes back to us, whether that is an English \nteacher telling us how to write or maybe something our history teacher, \nmaybe later on a professor, told us. Each of us can recall that teacher \nwho changed our life.\n  Those of us who are parents know how important a good teacher is. We \nknow what happens when occasionally our child gets a teacher who just \ndoesn't want to teach or who is not so good. We know what impact that \nhas on a child as well. When you get right down to it, good teachers \nare second only to good parents in helping children to learn. \nTherefore, any effort to restore confidence and improve quality in \neducation must begin with a national recommitment to teaching as a \nprofession. This bill does that.\n  First, we must recommit ourselves to attracting the best, the most \nmotivated of our students to the teaching profession. That means \noffering teachers the salaries and, yes, the respect they deserve. \nSecond, we must insist our colleges and our university education \ndepartments aggressively reexamine how they prepare our future \nteachers. Some are doing it; some are changing. But all need to \nreexamine what they are doing.\n  Third, our teachers must have the resources available to allow them \nto continue their education after they enter the profession. The \nteaching profession is no different than any other profession. You \ncontinue to learn throughout the years. For example, in my home State \nof Ohio, in Cincinnati, teachers have access to the Mayerson Academy, \nwhich is a partnership with area businesses and the school system to \nprovide teachers with additional training and additional professional \ndevelopment. This kind of support should be available to teachers in \nevery community in this country.\n  That is why, in the bill we will begin debating next week, I have \nincluded a provision that would authorize funding for the creation and \nexpansion of partnerships between schools and communities to create \nteacher training academies such as the Mayerson Academy in Cincinnati. \nIt works in Cincinnati. It will work in other communities. This is the \nkind of initiative that will help our teachers and our communities work \ntogether to improve the quality of teaching and, ultimately then, to \nimprove the quality of education.\n  There are other things we need to do and other things this bill does \naddress. This is a good bill. When Members begin to hear the debate \nnext week, I think they will understand how much work has gone into it \nand how it will impact the quality of education in this country.\n  We need to make it easier to recruit future teachers from the \nmilitary, from industry, and from research institutions, people who \nhave had established careers, who have had real-world experience, and \nthen who decide, at the age of 40 or 45 or 50, that they are going to \nretire from that profession and enter the teaching profession. We need \nto make it easier for them to do it.\n\n  Getting this kind of talent in the classroom is easier said than \ndone. For example, if Colin Powell wanted to teach a high school \nhistory class or if Albert Einstein were alive today and wanted to \nteach a high school physics class, requirements in some States would \nkeep these professionals--I would say in most States--from immediately \ngoing into the classroom, despite their obvious expertise in their \nfields. That is why we have included language in this bill to allow the \nuse of Federal funds under title II for alternative teacher \ncertification programs. This provision will allow States to create and \nexpand different types of alternative certification efforts.\n  Additionally, the committee approved a separate amendment that I \noffered--and that is now part of the bill--that would ensure the \ncontinuation of a specific program designed to assist retired military \npersonnel who are trying to enter the teaching profession. This is a \ngreat program. It is called Troops to Teachers. It simply helps \nretiring members of the military gain the State certification necessary \nto teach. It also helps them to find the school districts in greatest \nneed of teachers. It is a program that has worked. It is a program that \nis improved in this bill, and it is a program that is continued in this \nbill.\n  Troops to Teachers has succeeded in bringing dedicated, mature, and \nexperienced individuals into the classroom. In fact, when school \nadministrators were asked to rate Troops to Teachers participants in \ntheir own schools, most of the administrators said the former military \npersonnel turned teachers were well above the average and were among \nthe best teachers in their schools.\n  Since 1994, over 3,600 service members, by going through the Troops \nto Teachers program, have made the transition from the military into \nthe classroom. When we analyze who those people are, who is going into \nthe classroom, who is going through the Troops to Teachers program, \nwhat we find is they are just the people we need. They are people with \nreal-world experiences. They are people with expertise many times in \nmath and science, something we desperately need in our schools. They \nare disproportionate to the population as far as the minority \npopulation, so it means we are putting more minority teachers into our \nclassrooms. We are also doing something many professionals tell us we \nneed to do; that is, try to get more males into the primary schools. \nTroops to Teachers is doing that as well. It is an exciting program \nthat is continued in this bill. It is improved in this bill. It is one \nof the things that makes this bill a very solid bill. We need to ensure \nthis kind of program, one with proven results, continues well into the \nfuture.\n  Separate from the difficulties of the teacher certification process I \nhave described, I am also concerned about the fact that many of our \nmost experienced teachers, the teachers who in many cases are the most \nsenior, are about to retire. The fact is, these experienced teachers \nare also the best resources in our schools. It is very important that \nwe benefit from their experience before it is too late, before they \nleave the teaching profession. That is why I included language in the \nbill that will allow the use of Federal funds for new and existing \nteacher mentoring programs. New teachers benefit greatly by learning \nfrom the knowledge and the experience of veteran teachers. By pairing \nnew teachers with our schools' most experienced and most respected \nteachers, those who have years of knowledge and expertise and \nexperience in this profession, we can help retain our brightest and \ntalented young teachers.\n\n  Finally, the bill contains my language to expand the mission of the \nEisenhower National Clearinghouse, a national center located at Ohio \nState University that provides teachers with the best teacher training \nand curriculum materials on the subjects of math and science. The \nclearinghouse, which screens, evaluates, and distributes the multiple \ntraining and course materials currently available, makes it easy for \nteachers to quickly and efficiently access material for the classrooms. \nMy provision in title II expands the clearinghouse's mission to go \nbeyond math and science, to now, under this bill, include subjects such \nas history and English.\n  The bill we will consider next week takes a number of positive steps \ntowards improving the quality of those who make the commitment to \nteach.\n\n[[Page S2897]]\n\nWhat this bill is about is expanding the support network available to \nour teachers: support for people in other professions seeking a second \ncareer as a teacher; support for teachers seeking to improve subject \nknowledge or classroom skills; support for teachers seeking new ways to \nteach math or science or history; and finally, support for new teachers \nfrom experienced teachers.\n  In short, with this bill, we provide the kinds of resources that \nenable the teaching profession to build upon its commitment to teaching \nexcellence. Mr. President, as we debate the merits of the Educational \nOpportunities Act, the bottom line, I believe, is that we need to get \nback to basics: good teachers, safe schools. That is what this bill is \nabout--good teachers, safe schools. Parents will not have peace of mind \nunless they know their children's teachers are qualified to teach, that \nthey are good teachers, and that their children's schools provide safe \nlearning environments. It is that simple. That is what parents expect.\n  Today, I have talked about teaching and what this bill does to assist \nthe teaching profession. Tomorrow, I hope to have the opportunity to \ntalk about the second component of this bill which is safe schools. \nGood teachers, safe schools. We need to get back to the basics, and \nthat is what this bill does.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the unfinished business.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 3 proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States to protect the rights \n     of crime victims.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I remind my colleagues of the status now of \nbusiness on the Senate floor. It has been a little confusing, I know, \nparticularly for those who might be watching who aren't familiar with \nSenate procedures. But sometimes we take something up and then lay it \naside, take something else up, and then go back to the original matter, \nand so on. That is what we have been doing.\n  Yesterday, you will recall that we began the debate on S.J. Res. 3, \nwhich is an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would provide \nrights to victims of violent crime. Senator Feinstein of California and \nI are the primary sponsors of that resolution.\n  At the end of yesterday, we went to other matters. We are now going \nto resume debate on the motion to proceed to this resolution.\n  The Senate procedure is that we first have to decide to proceed, and \nthen we can proceed. So later on this afternoon, hopefully, the Senate \nwill vote to proceed to formal consideration of this constitutional \namendment. Technically, for a while this afternoon we are going to be \ndebating on whether or not we should proceed.\n  I am hopeful our colleagues will agree, whether they support the \namendment or not, that they should permit us to proceed to make our \ncase so they can evaluate it and decide at the end of that period \nwhether or not they want to support a constitutional amendment.\n  I think it is a little difficult, given the fact that there hasn't \nbeen a great deal of information, for people who are not on the \nJudiciary Committee to decide what their position is on this until they \nhave heard arguments.\n  Yesterday afternoon, Senator Leahy primarily, but several other \nmembers of the Democratic side and one Republican, came to the floor \nand discussed at length, I think for at least 3, maybe 4 hours, reasons \nwhy they thought that constitutional amendment should not be adopted. \nCertainly there are legitimate arguments that can be adduced on both \nsides of this proposition.\n  But I would like to begin today by explaining a little bit why we \nbelieve that it is important, first, to take the amendment up, and, \nsecond, why we believe, if we do take it up, it should be supported by \nour colleagues.\n  Senator Feinstein will be here shortly, and she will begin her \npresentation by discussing a case, the Oklahoma City bombing case, that \nin some sense is a metaphor for this issue generally, because in the \nOklahoma City bombing case victims were denied their rights. Families \nof people who were killed were not permitted to sit through the trial. \nThey were given a choice over a lunch break during the trial either to \nremain in the courtroom or to leave if they wanted to be present at the \ntime of the sentencing and to say something to the judge at that time. \nThere was enough confusion about the matter that many of them gave up \ntheir right to sit in the courtroom in order to be able to exercise \ntheir right to speak to the judge at the time of the sentencing.\n  Congress was so exercised about that it actually passed a law--it was \nspecifically directed to the Oklahoma City bombing case but it \npertained to other similar cases--so that victims have the right to be \nin courtroom, and they shouldn't have to make a choice between the \ntrial and sentencing. They should be able to appear at both.\n  Senator Feinstein will discuss in a moment the details of how that \ncase proceeded and why it stands for the proposition that we need a \nFederal constitutional amendment.\n  The bottom line is that even the Federal Government passed a statute \ndesigned to pertain to this exact case which was insufficient to assure \nthat those people could exercise what we believe is a fundamental right \nto sit through that trial. They were denied that right.\n  What is worse, because the case was taken up on appeal, and because \nthe U.S. Constitution clearly trumps any Federal statute, or any State \nstatute, or State constitutional provision, it wasn't possible to argue \nthat this Federal statute trumped the defendants' rights if those were \nbases for the rights asserted.\n  So you have at least seven States, or thereabouts, in the Tenth \nCircuit that are now bound by a precedent that says this Federal \nstatute doesn't work, to let you sit in the courtroom during the \ntrial. That has to be changed. There is only one way to change it. That \nis with a Federal constitutional amendment that says to the courts, \nfrom now on, these are fundamental rights and courts must consider \nthese rights.\n\n  As Senator Feinstein will point out, supporters of this amendment \ninclude a wide variety of people who had family and friends involved in \nthe Oklahoma City bombing case. One is Marsha Kight, whose daughter was \nkilled. Marsha has been a strong supporter of the victims' rights \namendment because she had to sit through all that. That is what Senator \nFeinstein will be talking about.\n  We listened to arguments yesterday from Senator Leahy and others \nabout the amendment. I understand they wish to talk this afternoon. I \nwill be paying attention to what they have to say and try to respond as \nbest I can. The arguments fall into two or three general categories. \nOne notion they presented is that this is a complicated amendment, it \nis too long--even longer than the Bill of Rights. It is not longer than \nthe Bill of Rights. We have counted the words. I will have my staff \ntell Members exactly how many words are in the Bill of Rights and how \nmany words are in this amendment.\n  The point is, to find defendants' rights, one has to look all over \nthe Constitution. We have amended the Constitution several times to \ngive people who are accused of crime different rights. If you added up \nall rights of the\n\n[[Page S2898]]\n\naccused and put them into one amendment, it would be much longer than \nthe amendment we have for victims' rights. We have all of our rights in \none place.\n  I don't think it should be an argument against providing victims of \ncrime certain fundamental rights because it takes up several lines of \nthe Constitution. We either mean to give them fundamental rights or we \ndon't. Defendants have all of the rights now. That is fine. We take \nnothing away from the defendants. But this should not be based on \nwhether there are more words describing the defendants' rights than \nthere are describing victims' rights.\n  One reason we take a little longer to describe victims' rights--\nalthough it is shorter than the defendants' rights if we add them up--\nwe have described them with great precision. They are very limited.\n  Defendants' rights are expressed in broad terms. Defendants have a \n``right to trial by jury.'' Does that mean in all cases? Does that mean \njust in felony cases? What kind of a jury? Defendants are protected \nfrom ``unreasonable search and seizure.'' What does that mean? There is \na basic ``fair trial'' right, and a right to counsel. All of these are \nexpressed in very general terms.\n  There are thousands of pages of court decisions interpreting what \n``unreasonable search and seizure'' means. I suppose the Founding \nFathers could have written 10 pages describing exactly what they meant \nby ``unreasonable search and seizure.'' They didn't do that.\n  In our proposal, we have described these victims' rights with great \ncare so that there could be no argument the rights took anything away \nfrom defendants. That is why some of the wording is apparently a little \nbit longer than our friends on the other side desire.\n  I guarantee if they were shorter, if they merely said victims have a \nreasonable right to attend the trial, their argument would be: We \nhaven't nailed this down; This is too broad and subject to \ninterpretation. You have to state exactly what is meant or it might \nconflict with the defendants' rights. Those who oppose this will argue \nit either way. In effect, we are damned if we do and damned if we \ndon't. We have tried to word it carefully.\n\n  I have the exact number of words for anybody who is interested. \nWithout the technical provisions which concern the effective date, the \namendment is 307 words. The victims' rights are described in 179 words. \nDefendants' rights in the U.S. Constitution consume 348 words.\n  OK, so if this is all about how many words there are, we win. \nHowever, that is not what this is about. Let's get serious.\n  The other argument from the opponents was, we have written 63 drafts \nof this amendment. Yes, indeed, we have. In fact, we are proud of it. \nWe have been making the point that this isn't some unthought-through \nproposition, written on the back of an envelope. We have written draft \nafter draft after draft, as a good craftsman would polish a fine piece \nof furniture over and over and over until it was absolutely smooth and \nshiny. We have done the same thing with this amendment.\n  We have talked to prosecutors. We have talked to the U.S. Department \nof Justice. They have written a very nice letter complimenting the \nchanges we made about concerns they expressed. We have accommodated \nmany of their concerns. We talked to law professors; we talked to \nvictims groups; we talked to lots of different people. As a result of \nall of these conversations, we have continued to modify the amendment \nto take into account their wonderful suggestions, to take into account \nconcerns they have raised.\n  We are rather proud of the fact that we have been careful; we haven't \njust tried to slide this through. For 4 years we have been working on \nthis through 63 different drafts. We now have a very carefully crafted, \nhoned constitutional amendment. Frankly, we have written more drafts \nhere than the Bill of Rights. People think that is a pretty good \ndocument. Of course, I would never hope to compete with our Founding \nFathers. Understanding how much thought they put into their amendments, \nwe have tried to be as careful in what we have written.\n  I daresay arguments can be made against our proposed constitutional \namendment. There are some legitimate points to make. However, it is not \nlegitimate to say we have tried to hurry this through, or we have not \ngiven it enough thought, or we have not had enough input, or we have \nnot been willing to make changes. I think the fact we have gone through \nthis number of changes illustrates the fact that we have been very open \nin the process.\n  That is why the amendment passed through the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee with a very strong bipartisan vote of 12-5. Getting anything \nthrough this Judiciary Committee in the form of a constitutional \namendment, I think all of my colleagues would agree, is a pretty sound \ntestament to the care with which we have crafted this particular \nprovision.\n  While there are arguments that can be made about the constitutional \namendment, it is not fair to say we shouldn't do it because of the \nnumber of words in the amendment or we shouldn't do it because we have \ntaken the pains to go through 63 drafts. We have tried to be very \ncareful in what we have done. Those were two of the arguments raised \nagainst this yesterday.\n  A third argument was that we ought to give some time to allow a \nstatutory alternative to work. With all due respect, it was in 1982, \nwhen President Reagan convened a group that was concerned with \nprotecting victims' rights, that the proposal for a constitutional \namendment was first made. It was in 1996 when President Clinton held a \nceremony in the Rose Garden with the Attorney General and many others \nexpressing his strong support for a Federal constitutional amendment to \nprotect the rights of victims of crime. He said: We have experimented \nwith State statutes, Federal statutes, and State constitutional \nprovisions long enough. They just don't work to secure the rights of \nvictims. Well meaning prosecutors and judges have tried hard. In fact, \nthe cause of victims' rights has gained a lot of support over the \nyears. Victims are much better treated in the process now than they \nwere many years ago.\n\n  I read yesterday statement after statement by President Clinton, by \nAttorney General Reno, by associate attorneys general, by law \nprofessors, by Laurence Tribe, a respected professor from Harvard, \ndistrict attorneys and judges, all of whom say, unfortunately, when a \nright is not expressed as a fundamental right in the U.S. Constitution, \nit just isn't protected with the same degree of care and consideration \nand energy as those rights that are protected in the U.S. Constitution.\n  That is why, according to a recent study, 60 percent of the victims \nwho are supposed to get notice of their rights don't receive notice. \nOne cannot exercise a constitutional right if one is not aware of it.\n  With respect to defendants, we have made it the Holy Grail that they \nwill be advised of their rights. This is what the Miranda warning is \nall about. Defendants have a right not to speak and a right to an \nattorney.\n  Victims ought to at least get some reasonable notice of their rights. \nIt does not mean you have to track them all down and stick a statement \nright in front of their faces and tell them orally, but it does mean \nyou at least have to keep them on a mailing list or phone list. \nComputerized telephone messages now can be sent.\n  We have had testimony. For example, the county attorney in the sixth \nlargest county in the country by population has testified it is just no \nproblem to notify victims of their rights. He says the entire cost of \ntaking care of the victims' rights is about $15, from beginning to end. \nIt just is not a valid argument that it is going to be a real problem \nfor prosecutors or the court system to provide this notice and to \nprovide these rights to victims.\n  I have one final comment, since I think Senator Feinstein is now \nready, and I have given the introduction for her comments, I say to \nSenator Feinstein, so our colleagues will be prepared to hear what she \nhas to say. But I have a final comment about these rights.\n  There is a culture in the legal community that has built up over the \nyears that bends over backwards to protect the rights of defendants. We \nhave no quarrel with that. Law school courses,\n\n[[Page S2899]]\n\nLaw Review articles, everything is oriented toward that. When you go to \nlaw school and you are a second- or third-year law student, you can \nparticipate in a legal clinic representing indigent defendants and so \non, but there is no similar culture to protect the rights of victims. \nThat is one reason why you have people reflexively saying: We have to \nmake sure we protect the right of defendants. If we are going to \nprotect the right of victims, we just do not feel real good about that \nbecause it might hurt defendants.\n\n  As we pointed out yesterday and as I think Senator Feinstein is about \nto point out today, nothing in our proposal takes away a constitutional \nright of a person standing accused of a crime. We would not permit that \nand we are willing to include language that makes it clear that the \nrights we enumerate here for victims do not in any way abridge the \nrights of the defendants. That should be clear. So this culture that \nhas grown up in support of defendants' rights should not be an argument \nagainst the protection of victims' rights, which, after all, involve \npeople whom society has failed to protect in the first instance. If \nthere is anyone we want to help through the criminal justice process it \nis these people, these victims of violent crimes.\n  I think that is a shorthand summary of the arguments against some of \nthe things that were said yesterday. I am very pleased, though, that \nSenator Feinstein is here, as I said, to present information that \nspecifically responds to an argument that was made yesterday with \nrespect to the Oklahoma City bombing case. There is a great deal of \nmisunderstanding about that.\n  If she is prepared at this time, I ask her now to supplement what I \nhave said in the presentation of her remarks in that regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from California.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator from California yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I do not want to interrupt the discussion \nof the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from California. I am just \ncurious, so we can have some idea of where we might be; yesterday, we \nhad a problem. I understand the two proponents were out negotiating a \nnew draft of this. But we had a situation where there were few on the \nfloor.\n  I know the two proponents of this amendment, although they are on \nopposite sides from me, would agree that a constitutional amendment is \nfar too consequential to be some kind of place holder on the Senate \nschedule. We have a number of Senators who will want to speak. They \nhave asked me to speak. We have the distinguished dean of our party, my \nfriend, the senior Senator from West Virginia, who will want to speak. \nWe have had others who have.\n  I am just curious if the two Senators have some concept of where we \nmay be on the schedule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will be delighted to respond to the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee. It was my intention to introduce \nSenator Feinstein today. She was on her way over. I knew that. She has \nsome prepared remarks she would like to give.\n  At the conclusion of that, I am fully prepared to allow the Senator \nfrom Vermont and the Senator from West Virginia to proceed. I know they \nboth have statements they want to make.\n  It is true it is much better if we are here. The Senator from Vermont \nyesterday had to step out while I was making some remarks. I understood \nthat completely. He noted we had to step out while he was speaking.\n  Mr. LEAHY. For legitimate reasons, I should say.\n  Mr. KYL. Certainly. We plan to be here for however much time the \nSenator feels is necessary to take on this motion to proceed. We are \nwilling to listen. We are willing to offer comments in reply. I would \nsay Senator Feinstein may have roughly 20 or 30 minutes. I am prepared \nat that point to allow the minority to proceed with whatever comments \nthey may have.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my good friend from Arizona. As always, he is \ncourteous and helpful, as is the Senator from California. That is fine \nwith me. Obviously, they are entitled to all the time they want.\n  I should note, again, in my comments, the distinguished Senator from \nArizona and the distinguished Senator from California were working, \nactually moving the ball forward. The debate was not lost because it \ngave people an opportunity to state their positions. They were working \nin an effort to move us closer to a vote. I appreciate that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member and the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona. I am delighted the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia is here. I will try to be as brief as I can. \nHowever, when I left the Democratic caucus at lunch yesterday, I felt, \nI might say, very lonely; that this, in a sense, was an insurmountable \nquest. As I went back to my office and as I considered what had been \nsaid in the caucus and what had been said on the floor of the Senate, I \nfelt so strongly how worthwhile this fight is and how many people will \nbe touched and protected if, one day, we do succeed.\n  Then I realized we were not alone. Later today, I will be submitting \na raft of letters from a panoply of victims' rights organizations as \nwell as law enforcement organizations that are in support of this \nmeasure. A few of them are up here on the board today: Mothers Against \nDrunk Driving, National Victims' Constitutional Amendment Network, \nNational Organization for Victims Assistance, Parents of Murdered \nChildren; Colorado Organization for Victim Assistance; Stephanie Roper \nFoundation; Mothers Against Violence in America--and on and on and on.\n  Also, a group of 37 State attorneys general, the former U.S. \nAttorneys General, William Barr, Dick Thornburgh, Ed Meese; the Alabama \nAttorney General, and on and on and on; the Law Enforcement Alliance of \nAmerica, the American Correctional Association, American Probation and \nParole Association, Concerns of Police Survivors, the National \nTroopers' Coalition, the International Union of Police Associations, \nLos Angeles County Police Chiefs' Association, and on and on and on. \nMembers can look at this. I will submit later individual letters.\n  However, I thought it might be useful to answer some of the questions \nthat were asked on the floor yesterday. One of them was that we should \nnot be doing this lightly; this is too precipitous; it comes too fast; \nMembers have not had enough of an opportunity to study it. In fact, \nSenator Kyl and I have been working on this for 4 years. We have had \nfour hearings in the Judiciary Committee. We have heard from 34 \nwitnesses. We have taken 802 pages of testimony. The House has had 32 \nwitnesses and has 575 pages of testimony. So this is not a lonely quest \nin the sense that it has lasted for a short period of time, but it is a \nquest that will go on as well.\n  Yesterday, both in the Democratic caucus, as well as on the floor, \none distinguished member of the Judiciary Committee, a Senator whom I \ngreatly respect, made this statement. Hopefully he will be listening \nbecause I want to provide the answer. The statement is:\n\n       I have not received an answer, a good answer, from my \n     colleague from Arizona and my colleague from California as to \n     why not a statute. You can pass it more quickly and more \n     easily. It fits the amendment. It fits what you are trying \n     to do. No court, no Supreme Court, no final authority has \n     thrown it out.\n\n  Let me take the biggest and broadest case and describe to my \ncolleagues why a statute will not work. The reason I use this case is \nit is a case with which we are all familiar. It is a case in which this \nSenate has played a role twice in passing, in fact, two statutes. It is \na case where the defendants had access to attorneys and could mount a \nlegal challenge. It is the treatment of the Oklahoma City bombing \nvictims.\n  I am going to read from a letter from a law professor who was one of \nthe attorneys for the Oklahoma City bombing victims. His name is Paul \nCassell. He is a professor of law at the University of Utah. He says:\n\n       This morning I had the opportunity to listen to the debate \n     on the floor of the Senate concerning the Crime Victims \n     Rights Amendment. During that debate, if I understood it \n     correctly, the suggestion was made that federal statutes had \n     ``worked'' to protect the rights of the Oklahoma City bombing \n     victims. As the attorney who represented\n\n[[Page S2900]]\n\n     a number of victims in that case, I am writing to express my \n     strong view that this suggestion is simply not correct. To \n     the contrary, the events of that case show that statutes \n     failed. To be specific, the statutes failed to assure that \n     all victims who wanted to were able to attend the trial of \n     Timothy McVeigh. Indeed, the Department of Justice \n     prosecutors handling the case advised a number of victims \n     that they should not attend to avoid creating unresolved \n     legal questions about their status in the case. A number of \n     the victims reluctantly accepted that advice. In other words, \n     they sat outside the courtroom despite the presence of two \n     federal statutes specifically designed to make sure that they \n     had an unequivocal right to attend. To add insult to \n     injuries, the other attorneys and I who represented the \n     individual victims were never able to speak a word in court \n     on their behalves. . . .\n       Some might claim that this treatment of the Oklahoma City \n     bombing victims should be written off as atypical. However, \n     there is every reason to believe that the victims here were \n     far more effective in attempting to vindicate their rights \n     than victims in less notorious cases. The Oklahoma City \n     bombing victims were mistreated while the media spotlight has \n     been on when the nation was watching. The treatment of \n     victims in forgotten courtrooms and trials is certainly no \n     better, and in all likelihood much worse. Moreover, the \n     Oklahoma City bombing victims had six lawyers working to \n     press their claims in court, including a law professor \n     familiar with victims rights, four lawyers at a prominent \n     Washington, DC, law firm and a local counsel. In the normal \n     case, it often will be impossible for victims to locate a \n     lawyer willing to pursue complex and unsettled issues about \n     their rights without compensation. One must remember that \n     crime most often strikes the poor and others in a weak \n     position to retain counsel. Finally, litigating claims \n     concerning exclusion from the courtroom or other victims' \n     rights promises to be quite difficult. For example, a victim \n     may not learn that she will be excluded until the day the \n     trial starts. Filing effective appellate actions in such \n     circumstances promises to be practically impossible. It \n     should, therefore, come as little surprise that the Oklahoma \n     City litigation was the first in which victims sought federal \n     appellate court review of their rights under the Victims Bill \n     of Rights, even though that statute was passed in 1990.\n\n  What he is saying is that this was the first time victims under a \nstatute passed 6 years earlier actually tried to use the court to \nenforce their rights.\n  He continues:\n\n       The Oklahoma City bombing victims would never have suffered \n     these indignities if the Victims Rights Amendment had been \n     the law of the land. It would have unequivocally protected \n     their right to attend and their ``standing'' to assert claims \n     on their behalf to protect that right. In short, the federal \n     amendment would have worked to protect their rights.\n\n  Then he goes on to give a chronology, and I think this is very \nimportant because the issue is effectively standing and the fact that \nthey have no standing in the Constitution to have these rights. I think \nit is important that I point out a chronology of exactly what happened. \nI want to take the time to do that:\n\n       During a pre-trial motion hearing in the Timothy McVeigh \n     prosecution, the district attorney . . . issued a ruling \n     precluding any victim who wished to provide victim impact \n     testimony at sentencing from observing any proceeding in the \n     case. The court based its ruling on Rule 615 of the Federal \n     Rules of Evidence the so-called ``rule on witnesses.'' In the \n     hour that the court then gave to victims to make this \n     wrenching decision about testifying, some of the victims \n     opted to watch the proceedings; others decided to leave \n     Denver to remain eligible to provide impact testimony.\n       Thirty-five victims and survivors of the bombing then filed \n     a motion asserting their own standing--\n\n  This is important--\n\n     then filed a motion asserting their own standing to raise \n     their rights under federal law and, in the alternative, \n     seeking leave to file a brief on the issue as amici curiae. \n     The victims noted that the district court apparently had \n     overlooked the Victims Bill of Rights, a federal statute \n     guaranteeing victims the right (among others) ``to be present \n     at all public court proceedings unless the court determines \n     that testimony by the victim would be materially affected if \n     the victim heard other testimony at trial.''\n\n  In other words, the court had flexibility to make that determination.\n  Continuing:\n\n       The District Court then held a hearing to reconsider the \n     issue of excluding victim witnesses. The court first denied \n     the victims' motion asserting standing to present their own \n     claims, allowing them only the opportunity to file a brief as \n     amici curiae. After argument by the Department of Justice and \n     by the defendants, the court denied the motion for \n     reconsideration. It concluded that victims present during the \n     court proceedings would not be able to separate the \n     ``experience of trial'' from ``the experience of loss from \n     the conduct in question,'' and, thus, their testimony at a \n     sentencing hearing would be inadmissible. . . .\n       The victims then filed a petition for writ of mandamus in \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit seeking \n     review of the district court's ruling. Because the procedures \n     for victims appeals were unclear, the victims filed a \n     separate set of documents appealing from the ruling. \n     Similarly, the Department of Justice, uncertain of precisely \n     how to proceed procedurally, filed both an appeal and a \n     petition for a writ of mandamus.\n       Three months later, a panel of the Tenth Circuit rejected--\n     without oral argument--both the victims' and the United \n     States' claims on jurisdictional grounds. With respect to the \n     victims' challenges, the court concluded that the victims \n     lacked ``standing'' under Article III of the Constitution \n     because they had no ``legally protected interest'' to be \n     present at the trial and consequently had suffered no \n     ``injury in fact'' from their exclusion. The Tenth Circuit \n     also found the victims had no right to attend the trial under \n     any First Amendment right of access. Finally, the Tenth \n     Circuit rejected, on jurisdictional grounds, the appeal \n     and mandamus petition filed by the United States. Efforts \n     by both the victims and the Department to obtain a \n     rehearing were unsuccessful, even with the support of \n     separate briefs urging rehearing from 49 members of \n     Congress, all six Attorneys General in the Tenth Circuit, \n     and some of the leading victims groups in the nation.\n       In the meantime--\n\n  And now it gets even more critical--\n\n     the victims, supported by the Oklahoma Attorney General's \n     Office, sought remedial legislation in Congress clearly \n     stating that victims should not have to decide between \n     testifying at sentencing and watching the trial. The Victims' \n     Rights Clarification Act of 1997 was introduced to provide \n     that watching a trial does not constitute grounds for denying \n     the chance to provide an impact statement. The 1997 measure \n     passed the House by a vote of 414 to 13. The next day, the \n     Senate passed the measure by unanimous consent. The following \n     day, President Clinton signed the Act into law, explaining \n     that ``when someone is a victim, he or she should be at the \n     center of the criminal justice process, not on the outside \n     looking in.''\n       The victims then promptly filed a motion with the district \n     court asserting a right to attend under the new law. The \n     victims explained that the new law invalidated the court's \n     earlier sequestration order and sought a hearing on the \n     issue. Rather than squarely uphold the new law, however, the \n     district court entered a new order on victim-impact witness \n     sequestration. The court concluded ``any motions raising \n     constitutional questions about this legislation would be \n     premature and would present issues that are not now ripe for \n     decision.'' Moreover, the court held that it could address \n     issues of possible prejudicial impact from attending the \n     trial by conduct[ing] a voir dire of the witnesses after the \n     trial. The district court also refused to grant the victims a \n     hearing on the application of the new law, concluding that \n     its ruling rendered their request ``moot.''\n       After that ruling, the Oklahoma City victim impact \n     witnesses--once again--had to make a painful decision about \n     what to do. Some of the victim impact witnesses decided not \n     to observe the trial because of ambiguities and uncertainties \n     in the court's ruling, raising the possibility of exclusion \n     of testimony from victims who attended the trial. The \n     Department of Justice also met with many of the impact \n     witnesses, advising them of these substantial uncertainties \n     in the law, and noting that any observation of the trial \n     would create the possibility of exclusion of impact \n     testimony. To end this confusion, the victims filed a motion \n     for clarification of the judge's order. The motion noted that \n     ``[b]ecause of the uncertainty remaining under the Court's \n     order, a number of the victims have been forced to give up \n     their right to observe defendant McVeigh's trial. This \n     chilling effect has thus rendered the Victims Rights \n     Clarification Act of 1997 . . . for practical purposes a \n     nullity.''\n\n  So the effort of this Congress to write one statute, and to clarify \nit with a second statute, was rendered a nullity.\n\n       Unfortunately, the effort to obtain clarification did not \n     succeed, and McVeigh's trial proceeded without further \n     guidance for the victims.\n       After McVeigh was convicted, the victims filed a motion to \n     be heard on issues pertaining to the new law. Nonetheless, \n     the court refused to allow the victims to be represented \n     by counsel during argument on the law or during voir dire \n     about the possible prejudicial impact of viewing the \n     trial. The court, however, concluded (as the victims had \n     suggested all along) that no victim was in fact prejudiced \n     as a result of watching the trial.\n       This recounting of the details of the Oklahoma City bombing \n     litigation leaves no doubt that statutory protection of \n     victims rights did not ``work.'' To the contrary, for a \n     number of the victims, the rights afforded in the Victims \n     Rights Clarification Act of 1997 and the earlier Victims Bill \n     of Rights were not protected. They did not observe the trial \n     of defendant Timothy McVeigh because of lingering doubts \n     about the constitutional status of these statutes.\n       The undeniable, and unfortunate, result of that litigation \n     has been to establish--as the only reported federal appellate \n     ruling [to date]--a precedent that will make effective\n\n[[Page S2901]]\n\n     enforcement of the federal victims rights statutes quite \n     difficult. It is now the law of the Tenth Circuit that \n     victims lack ``standing'' to be heard on issues surrounding \n     the Victims' Bill of Rights and, for good measure, that the \n     Department of Justice may not take an appeal for the victims \n     under either of those statutes. For all practical purposes, \n     the treatment of crime victims' rights in federal court in \n     Utah, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Wyoming has \n     been remitted to the unreviewable discretion of individual \n     federal district court judges. The fate of the Oklahoma City \n     victims does not inspire confidence that all victims rights \n     will be fully enforced in the future. Even in other circuits, \n     the Tenth Circuit ruling, while not controlling, may be \n     treated as having persuasive value. If so, the Victims Bill \n     of Rights will effectively become a dead letter.\n\n  This is the reason we pursue our case with such ardor. We do not \nbelieve it is possible, under any statute drafted to cover victims of \nviolent crimes, to provide them with certain basic rights because any \nFederal statute would only cover 1 to 2 percent of the victims of \nviolent crimes in the United States; and, secondly, because the one \nnoteworthy case, in the sense of public knowledge, in the sense of \nmajor representation of victims by attorneys of major quality, resulted \nin two laws, passed by this Senate and the other House, being rendered \na nullity.\n  That is the reason we pursue our quest here today.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I know Senator Leahy and Senator Byrd want to \nmake a presentation. I would certainly be prepared to yield to them as \nsoon as they are ready to make their remarks. In the meantime, I \nthought perhaps I could engage Senator Feinstein in some conversation \nand maybe make a couple points myself. But as soon as Senator Leahy or \nSenator Byrd arrive, I will be happy to relinquish the floor to them.\n  One of the arguments that has been raised by some opponents of the \namendment, including a prominent columnist whom I respect greatly, \nGeorge Will, derives from a superficial reading of our amendment. It is \nsaid that this kind of an amendment, which grants rights to victims of \ncrime, would be discordant with the general purpose of the \nConstitution, which is not to grant entitlements to people that the \nGovernment would provide but, rather, protects people's natural rights, \nsome of which are enumerated in the Bill of Rights, some of which are \nassumed to exist outside the Constitution and are more expressed in \nterms of prohibitions on bad government conduct.\n  I want to make clear--and seek Senator Feinstein's view on this--that \nin both cases the Constitution has prevented deleterious Government \naction. In neither case does the Constitution grant rights. In our \ncase, for example, the right to attend the trial that we talk about in \nthe Oklahoma City bombing case is really not expressed as the right to \nattend the trial. There is no right to Government access to the trial. \nWe express this as a prohibition on the Government denying access to \nthe trial so if a victim or victim's family is able to get to the \ncourtroom, nobody has to bring them there, but if they are able to get \nthere and they want to attend the trial, the Government may not deny \nthem that right.\n  In this regard, it is the same as the right to free speech. We all \ntalk about the right to free speech. We really don't have an \nentitlement to free speech in the Constitution. We believe that is a \nnatural right. As the Constitution says, the Government shall not \nabridge our right to free speech. It cannot constitutionally enact any \nlaws that would inhibit the free exercise of speech.\n  I urge my colleagues and wise people, such as George Will, to read \nthis carefully. It is just as the existing Constitution. We speak in \ncommon terms of protecting the right of free speech, the right to \nattend the trial about which Senator Feinstein has been talking. But in \nreality, both constitutional provisions are prohibitions on the \nGovernment infringing upon this right.\n  Is that a distinction the Senator finds important in describing the \nOklahoma City case?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I think Senator Kyl has stated it very \nwell. Not only do I find that to be a correct distinction--it is not \nonly Senator Kyl and I--it is legal scholars who we have worked with \nand trusted throughout this process. Let me quote the professor from \nHarvard with whom we worked, Larry Tribe.\n\n       These are the very kinds of rights with which our \n     Constitution is typically and properly concerned, rights of \n     individuals to participate in all those government processes \n     that strongly affect their lives. Congress and the states \n     have already provided a variety of measures to protect the \n     rights of victims.\n\n  Senator Kyl and I have heard that said on this floor and outside of \nthis floor. That certainly is true. Yet, as Professor Tribe goes on, \nthe reports from the field are that they have all too often been \naffected. Rules to assist victims frequently fail to provide meaningful \nprotection whenever they come into conflict with bureaucratic habit, \ntraditional indifference, sheer inertia, or the mere mention of an \naccused's rights, even when those rights are not genuinely threatened.\n  I read the chronology of the Oklahoma City bombing case and the \nrights that those victims were afforded by two statutes, not one \nstatute. We couldn't get it done right in 1990. We tried again 7 years \nlater. Both of those were effectively declared a nullity by the Tenth \nCircuit because the victims had no standing under article III of the \nConstitution. So the question of standing and harm all enter into this. \nEverything I have been able to deduce is, the only way to provide \nstanding to be a party at issue in the situation is through the \nConstitution of the United States. Would my colleague agree with that?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes. I thank Senator Feinstein for that statement. It is a \nconfirmation that scholars of law, not only she and I, have reached \nthis conclusion.\n\n  I was just reminded of another place in which this conclusion is \nfound. The U.S. Department of Justice volume ``New Directions from the \nField, Victims Rights and Services for the 21st Century.'' Among the \nstatements in this report is the following:\n\n       Granting victims of crime the ability to participate in the \n     justice system is exactly the type of participatory right the \n     Constitution is designed to protect and has been amended to \n     permanently ensure. Such rights include the right to vote on \n     an equal basis and the right to be heard when the government \n     deprives one of life, liberty or property.\n\n  What we have provided here is a set of rights, some expressed in \nterms of ``not to be excluded from,'' some expressed as a right such as \na right to vote, as has been noted. In each case, the fundamental basis \nis that the Government cannot deprive one of their ability to \nparticipate in the criminal justice process to the extent we have \ndefined it here. I think that is a very important distinction. As the \nSenator pointed out, without the standing to assert the right, it would \nbe hollow. It would be merely an oratory statement. That is precisely \nwhy the people in the Oklahoma City bombing case couldn't vindicate \ntheir rights. The court said they didn't have any standing.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The point made by the Oklahoma City case is that \nthese were not indigent victims. They had Washington counsel, \ndistinguished counsel of very high quality. They tried to assert the \nrights under the statute, and the court essentially turned them down. \nThis isn't what we think; this is what happens. I will quote a bit more \nfrom Professor Tribe on this very subject, until Senator Byrd, who is \nnext, comes to the Chamber.\n  Larry Tribe makes this statement:\n\n       Beginning with the premise that the Constitution should not \n     be amended lightly and should never be amended to achieve \n     short-term partisan or purely policy objectives, I would \n     argue that a constitutional amendment is appropriate only \n     when the goal involves (1) a needed change in government \n     structure, or (2) a needed recognition of a basic human \n     right, where (a) the right is one that people widely agree \n     deserves serious and permanent respect, (b) the right is one \n     that is insufficiently protected under existing law, (c) the \n     right is one that cannot be adequately protected through \n     purely political action such as state or federal legislation \n     and/or regulation, (d) the right is one whose inclusion in \n     the United States Constitution would not distort or endanger \n     basic principles of the separation of powers among the \n     federal branches . . . (e) the right would be judicially \n     enforceable without creating open-ended or otherwise \n     unacceptable funding obligations.\n\n  Professor Tribe goes on to say:\n\n       I believe that S.J. Res. 3 meets these criteria. The rights \n     in question--rights of crime\n\n[[Page S2902]]\n\n     victims not to be victimized yet again through the processes \n     by which government bodies and officials prosecute, punish, \n     and/or release the accused or convicted offender--are \n     indisputably basic human rights against government, rights \n     that any civilized system of justice would aspire to protect \n     and strive never to violate.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am happy to yield when I have concluded my thought. \nI am in the middle of a quote from a very distinguished law professor, \nwhom I know Senator Schumer respects greatly.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I do, and I know him well. I thought the quote was \nfinished. His quotes do go on.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. They do go on. And once more, they are worth \nlistening to.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Indeed.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Continuing the quote:\n\n       To protect these rights of victims does not entail \n     constitutionalizing the rights of private citizens against \n     other private citizens; for it is not the private citizen \n     accused of crime by state or federal authorities who is the \n     source of the violations that victims' rights advocates hope \n     to address with a constitutional amendment in this area. \n     Rather, it is the government authorities themselves, those \n     who pursue (or release) the accused or convicted criminal \n     with insufficient attention to the concerns of the victim, \n     who are sometimes guilty of the kinds of violations that a \n     properly drawn amendment would prohibit.\n\n  I think that well states what we are trying to do.\n  I am delighted to yield to Senator Schumer.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague. Before I ask my question, I \ncommend Senator Feinstein. We strongly disagree on the proposal before \nus. But I know that for years and years she has been concerned about \nvictims. I know also of the passion, hard work, and diligence she \nbrings to the debate. I commend her for that. Our strong disagreement \non the issue does not in any way lessen my respect for her or the \nSenator from Arizona for the job they have done in moving this \namendment to the floor.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. We are eagerly awaiting the ``but.''\n  Mr. SCHUMER. There is no ``but'' about my respect for the Senator. \nHowever, there is a ``but'' about Professor Tribe's remarks in the \nwhole. What bothers me most about this amendment--and I have expressed \nthis to the Senator--is as follows. Of the five criteria Professor \nTribe lays out, I think I would agree with four of them. I think that \namendments should not be done lightly. But I think there are times when \nwe have to amend the Constitution, although reluctantly. I certainly \nbelieve the rights of victims are extremely important. As the Senator \nknows, we worked on the crime bill of 1994 together. I worked \ndiligently in the House to add the right of allocution and other things \nto the bill. I understand why the statute didn't work in Oklahoma City \nalthough I would like to debate another point.\n  But Professor Tribe, I think, goes off base when he says a statute \nwould not take care of this problem. So I have a two-part question. \nFirst, why is it not better, if this particular statute does not work, \nto redesign it? Why is it not better to take the basic amendment that \nthe Senator from Arizona and the Senator from California have offered \nand make it a statute, given the fact that we have not had a single \nState supreme court--in some States, such as mine, they are not called \na supreme court--but the highest court of any of the 50 States throw \nout a victims' rights amendment on the basis of unconstitutionality. \nGiven the fact that the Supreme Court has not rejected such an \namendment, it seems to me that given that the language proposed--which \nis still being worked on, so it may change--is longer than the entire \nBill of Rights and is not the language of a constitutional amendment--\nat least any that I have seen--why don't we try to refine the statute \nrather than move to a constitutional amendment with such alacrity?\n  Professor Tribe said a statute would not work. I have not seen that. \nI have seen, in my State and many others, victims' rights statutes work \nand work very well. That is my question to the Senator from California. \nI thank the Senator for her graciousness.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. First, I think the Senator knows I have very deep \nrespect for him. If I am fighting a battle, he is certainly one I would \nlike to have in the trench with me.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. And usually I am there.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. There is always room in the trench to change his \nmind, if the Senator cares to. I do appreciate his concern and his \ntestimony does carry weight with me. As a matter of fact, it was \nSenator Schumer's comment in the Record that I referred to last night \nwhen I addressed and talked with the attorneys in Oklahoma City today \nwho represented the victims--Professor Cassell was one of them--and got \nthat chronology.\n  To me, the reason the statute won't work is because it hasn't worked. \nBoth Houses of Congress, and even the redoubtable intelligence of the \nSenator in working on both the 1990 and the 1997 statute, rendered both \na nullity by the Tenth Circuit. Therefore, they were victims in that \nentire circuit and are effectively left without a remedy, and the \nbelief is that it would be difficult in that circuit, based on the \nprecedent that has been set, without providing standing for victims in \nthe Constitution under article III, to have a successful statute.\n\n  Now, I don't believe many victims have the wherewithal to get a \nprofessor of law at a distinguished university and a Washington law \nfirm. The people who are going to be the most impacted by this are \npoor, are minorities, where most of the crime victims, after all, \nreally are in the Nation. So the ability for them to get redress under \na statute, I think, is effectively quite limited.\n  Addressing the second part about the drafting of this article, we \nhave been at this for 4 years. There are 800 pages of testimony, as I \nhave mentioned. I ask Senator Kyl, how many meetings does the Senator \nbelieve we have had with the Justice Department in the last 4 years \nover the wording in this?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if you count all of the informal meetings and \nvarious meetings back and forth with staff, certainly it would be well \nover a dozen.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. So we have had at least a dozen meetings with \nJustice. The concepts are the authors', and much of the writing is \nactually a product of those meetings with the Justice Department. In \nfairness, staff has changed over the years. We worked with one \nassistant U.S. Attorney General, and that person has changed, and so on \nand so forth. We have also worked with White House staff. The basics of \nthe amendment that the Senator questions as being burdensome in \nverbiage is really very simple: to reasonable notice of, and not to be \nexcluded from any public proceedings relating to the crime; to be \nheard, if present; to submit a statement at all such proceedings to \ndetermine a conditional release from custody and acceptance of a \nnegotiated plea or sentence.\n  I might say that this was gone over with precision and detail with \nJustice as to whether a plea bargain would be effected; the foregoing \nrights in a parole proceeding that is not public to the extent these \nrights are afforded to the convicted offender; the reasonable notice of \nand an opportunity to submit a statement concerning any proposed pardon \nor commutation; reasonable notice of escape or release from custody. I \nwill say the pardon has not been worked out with Justice, and there are \nsome negotiations going on about that right now. But notice of release \nor escape; consideration for the interest of the victim; that any trial \nbe free from unreasonable delay--there was considerable discussion \nthrough Senator Kyl, ourselves, attorneys for the victims, victims' \nrights groups, as to not to create a problem there. And the words ``to \nconsideration of the interest'' were added to avoid any problem. To \norder restitution, to consideration for the safety of the victim in \ndetermining any conditional release from custody, and to notice of the \nrights: that is essentially the bulk of the basic rights. The rest sets \nup a vehicle.\n  Now, we have heard two Senators come to the floor and say: ``Who \nwould define a victim?'' We have to write in this that the Congress \nshall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate \nlegislation. So the Congress would enforce the article. And some of \nthat language, by way of clarification, is added.\n  This is not 1791; it is the year 2000. Fortunately, since 1791, there \nis court precedent. There is now definition of\n\n[[Page S2903]]\n\nlanguage in the law that has been predetermined, and it is much more \ncomplicated, I think, to write this kind of language than it was way \nback when.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her answer, and I \nsimply make three points. Before I do, I want to refer to a letter from \nChief Justice Rehnquist in opposition saying that a statute would be \nfar preferable to a constitutional amendment. This letter is to Judy \nClarke, President of the National Association of Criminal Defense \nLawyers. I will read it:\n\n       I have received the letter of March 21, commenting on \n     various measures pending in Congress relating to the \n     judiciary. The Judicial Conference has recently taken a \n     position in favor of making provision for victims' rights by \n     statute, rather than by constitutional amendment; this would \n     have the virtue of making any provisions in the bill which \n     appeared mistaken by hindsight to be amended by a simple act \n     of Congress.\n\n  It makes the very point. The Senator admitted that negotiations are \nstill ongoing. We are debating a constitutional amendment that must be \npassed by two-thirds of each Chamber and then three-quarters of the \nStates. We are still debating the language.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator permit me to respond?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will in one second. I want to finish my statement.\n  First, the kind of definitions that the Senator has talked about of \nappeals procedures has never been in the U.S. Constitution. In fact, \nwhat happened before is there would be a two- or three-line sentence \nthat the rights of victims should be protected, and then we would work \nout by statute what the details were.\n  I have never seen a constitutional amendment such as this. It is the \n21st century. I agree with that. But that doesn't mean the elegance of \nthought and language in the Constitution of the 18th century should be \nthrown out the window, and we are doing that here.\n  I ask the Senator, why, if she believes in a constitutional amendment \nwith a two- or three-line amendment talking about victims' rights, \nwould she not be far more in keeping with constitutional thought and \ntheory than a 15-page document which clearly is written in statutory \nand not constitutional language? Second, if the detailed definitional \nlanguage that the Senator is talking about works, it will work as a \nstatute.\n  The reason the Oklahoma City case didn't work is the statute was \npoorly drafted, at least in terms of what the Senator is saying. I will \nhave more to say about that later. I don't want to occupy her time on \nthis, but if the language works as a constitutional amendment, the very \nlanguage that we have before us admittedly being rephrased or \nredrafted, why doesn't it work as a statute?\n\n  The problem that is pointed to in the Oklahoma City case is not the \namendment. If the very same language were a constitutional amendment, \nGod forbid, it still wouldn't have been applied because the judge \ndidn't throw it out on an unconstitutional basis. He basically ignored \nit, which meant it wasn't clear enough.\n  No. 1, do we have any amendment in the Constitution that compares in \ndetail and outlines procedurally what we have here?\n  No. 2, if this language works as a constitutional amendment, why \nwouldn't it work as a statute?\n  No. 3, if a constitutional amendment is necessary, although again it \nhas not been thrown out by the Supreme Court, or any lower court, why \nwouldn't we have a simple, elegant three-line statement talking about \nthe rights of victims, and then let the details of legislative \nengineering be worked out in statute as it has been done in this \ncountry, regardless of whether Democrats, Republicans, Whigs, or Free-\nSoilers, or anybody else has been in charge?\n  I thank the Senator for her patience. I feel as passionately on our \nside as she does on her side.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am going to defer to the distinguished Senator from \nArizona to give the opening response, and then I would like to finish \nup, if I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, before she arrived at noon, I had shared some \nspecific comments that go directly to Senator Schumer's questions. I \nthought I would repeat what I said here in brief.\n  The first objection is that this is too wordy. It is not 15 pages. It \nis about 2\\1/5\\ pages. But the total number of words that describe \nvictims' rights is 179. The total number of words in the amendment, \nexcept for the technical provisions regarding the effective date, is \n307. If you add them all up, it is 394 words. Again, 179 of those words \ndescribe the victims' rights. The defendants' rights consume 348 words \nin the U.S. Constitution. The Bill of Rights is 462 words. If you add \nit up word for word, we win, as I said this morning. But that, \nobviously, is hardly a way to evaluate.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It shouldn't be 2\\1/5\\ pages, it should be 2\\1/5\\ lines \nin keeping with the way the Constitution is written.\n  Mr. KYL. That is the second point. We are criticized on two accounts. \nWe literally can't win. On one hand, the Senator from New York and \nothers have said it is subject to interpretation. What does \n``reasonable'' mean? On the other hand, we have written too much. We \nought to just say ``reasonable rights'' and then flesh it out in \nstatute. We can't win, if that is the argument.\n  What we have done, I submit, is the compromise that the Founding \nFathers did. They expressed general terminology in order to keep it \nshort and succinct, understanding that it would have to be fleshed out. \nBut what we have done is to describe in enough additional detail to \nensure that there could never be a contention that we are infringing on \na defendant's rights and to be sure there would never be a criticism \nthat we weren't specific enough about what these rights were. So we \nhave actually enumerated these eight specific rights. But I think we \nhave struck the right compromise in that regard.\n\n  Two other quick points, if I may: The Senator correctly pointed out \nthat it appears one of the reasons for the judge's decision in the \nOklahoma City bombing case was that he just ignored it. I think it is \nhard to figure out exactly why he didn't apply it. He couldn't ignore a \nU.S. constitutional provision as he could ignore a Federal statute, \nwhich is precisely why we need a Federal constitutional amendment. It \nmay also be that the Oklahoma City statute was not well enough drafted. \nI think that is exactly correct as well. It is no answer to say that a \nstatute would be the way to go here, that it is better than a \nconstitutional provision.\n  The bottom line is this: In words somewhat similar to those words \nthat protect the rights of the accused, we have identified eight \nspecific rights. I have yet to see anybody say those eight specific \nrights should not be guaranteed. Rather, the argument is that they \nshould be put in statute. Senator Schumer has just pointed out why \nputting it in statute doesn't work.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If the Senator will yield, I think this should be a \ndebate that goes on for some time. That is what we are having here as \nopposed to everyone making speeches periodically. I very much \nappreciate that and would be happy when I come to the floor to yield \ntime to opponents of the bill to continue this debate.\n  But I would simply say to my good friend from Arizona that a statute \nis no less the law of the land than a constitutional amendment. The \nidea that a constitutional amendment should be taken into account more \nthan a statute doesn't hold up in terms of jurisprudence. I am sure \neven my good, mistaken friend in this case, Larry Tribe, would agree \nwith that. But for whatever reason, one judge ignores a statute. The \nSenator is right. It is murky. It is hard to figure out why. We then \nleap to a constitutional amendment, one with almost as many words as \nthe entire Bill of Rights. It doesn't make any sense to me.\n  I ask the Senator: Because a judge in Oklahoma City, a case I care \nvery much about, ignored statutory language, why don't we try once \nagain? Why don't we try, whether that case was on appeal, or in another \nway, to make sure that judges can't? You could easily write a statute \nthat says the right of allocution is not granted. You can't proceed \nwith sentencing. If some judge somewhere--I doubt there would be one--\nshould refuse to apply that law, you would win on appeal, pardon my \nsaying, in a ``New York minute.'' A constitutional amendment doesn't \ngive any more authority for a judge to apply than a statute. The whole \nreason\n\n[[Page S2904]]\n\nwe have constitutional amendments, as laid out by Larry Tribe, is for \nrestructuring the Government. It is guaranteeing a basic right that \ncouldn't be guaranteed otherwise.\n  I yield to the Senator from California to answer. But because a judge \nignores a statute in one case, how do we then leap to a constitutional \namendment?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I think that is a very important question. I am sure \nI cannot answer as adequately, but let me try. I think any statute \nlasts a ``New York minute.'' Let me state why.\n\n  I think there is bureaucratic inertia. At our caucus yesterday, to be \nvery frank, I was amazed at Members' reactions. We are trying to give \nvictims certain basic rights. I almost came out of the caucus feeling \nsomewhat un-American because I am trying to do something that can stand \nthe test of universal time to improve a very convoluted, difficult \nadministration of justice process in this country, to ensure victims a \ncertain participation in the process.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. We all want to do that. The question is the method. The \nissue is not whether we want to give victims' rights or not.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I grant that the 1997 clarification act, which, as I \nunderstand it, meant to say that a victim could both be present in \ncourt and make a statement, was simply not answered; it was ignored.\n  The 1990 victims' rights amendment was a more considered bill, \ndeveloped over a period of time, and was the one with which the Tenth \nCircuit essentially said that victims lack standing under article III \nbecause they had no legally protected interest to be present at the \ntrial and had suffered, therefore, no injury.\n  I don't know how one remedies by statute to withstand the test of \ntime, the bureaucratic inertia, the equivocation that goes on.\n  From 1850, we have a century and a half in this country where victims \nhave had no rights in the process. The process has locked itself. The \nSenator is right, some district attorneys don't want to be responsible \nto send a victim or say, Give me your address and phone number if you \nwant to come to court; I will notify you. Then it is up to the victim \nto provide that and be there at the appropriate time. Many don't want \nto do that.\n  What makes me very suspect is, that reaction is disproportionate to \nwhat we are trying to achieve, which is basically status rights. It is \nnot like the right to counsel, not like a right of a jury of your \npeers, it is not like protection against double jeopardy or \nunreasonable search and seizure. Those are very ``meaty'' rights that \ndefendants have that should be provided, including the right to be \npresent, the right to make a statement--pretty simplistic rights.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. No question; I agree with the Senator, those are \nsimplistic and they should be enshrined in law. I have spent a good \nnumber of years in the other body trying to make that happen.\n  When the Senator asks, why is there such passion against this \namendment, please do not mistake it for the substance of the amendment. \nThere may be some who believe that, but not me, and I don't think that \nis the mainstream of the opposition for both Republican and Democrat.\n  Mr. KYL. If I might interrupt, all of this is on my time, which is \nfine with me. It is a good exchange, and I agree with the Senator from \nNew York, this is the right way to debate the subject. I am happy to \nhave the Senator finish his thought, but I want to respond to a \nquestion asked some time ago.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to respond using \n3 minutes of my time.\n  Mr. KYL. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, passion is passion. \nThere is not a lack of passion for victims' rights but a passion for \nthis wonderful, noble document, the Constitution of the United States. \nI say this in all due respect.\n  I think if this amendment were added, it would cheapen the \nConstitution--not cheapen the issue of victims' rights, which is \nimportant, but we have never done this before. The passion goes to the \nbeauty of the Constitution, to the fact that we have never added a \nconstitutional amendment, because two judges failed.\n  The Senator was good enough to mention that 1990 case. One lower \ncourt judge said it might not fit with article III. Again, don't leap \nto a constitutional amendment. If we were to have constitutional \namendments every time a lower court judge ruled that something was \nunconstitutional, we would have a Constitution of the United States \nthat would be 10 volumes long. We would spend all of our time revising \nthat Constitution. I daresay the structure of government could fall \nbecause we need two-thirds, two-thirds, three-quarters to do it.\n  The passion here is on a fundamental difference about what the \nConstitution of the United States means. I would be the first to join \nthe Senator if the U.S. Supreme Court said the same thing that lower \ncourt said in 1990. But one lower court in 1990, one lower court in \n1997, and now we say let's double virtually.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Circuit court.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. A circuit court in 1990, two lower courts, but no U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  I would join the Senator if the Supreme Court said the same thing. I \nagree with her that victims' rights should receive a higher elevation \nin the pantheon of criminal justice. But now the issue is not ripe. The \nSupreme Court hasn't ruled defendants' rights trump victims' rights. We \nhave had two poor attempts to draft legislation.\n\n  To their credit, the Senator from California and the Senator from \nArizona have come up with a better proposal. They have still not \naddressed, to my satisfaction, why we need to do a constitutional \namendment when I think a statute would do exactly the same job and \ncould be passed more quickly. One would not need the two-thirds. We \ncould get this done. If then someone fought the statute and the Supreme \nCourt of the United States ruled it unconstitutional, we would all be \non the floor supporting this amendment.\n  The passion, to answer the Senator, was a passion for the way of the \nConstitution, a passion that we do not amend the Constitution unless we \nabsolutely have to. That does not go to the need to give victims more \nrights. That goes to the fact that none of these victims' rights laws \nhas been declared unconstitutional by the highest court of this land or \nwhere it would still be legitimate by State supreme courts.\n  I think my 3 minutes have expired. I will continue the debate with \nthe Senator from Arizona and the Senator from California. Again, I \nrespect their motivations, I respect their substantive position, but \nplease, God--please, God--let us not be precipitous in amending this \ngreat U.S. Constitution when there is another, quicker, and just as \nefficacious way to accomplish the well-thought-out goal of our \nSenators.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think the Senator from New York has made an \nexcellent presentation. As a matter of fact, that is the presentation I \nmade about 4 years ago when a very fine attorney in Arizona came to me \nand said these State constitution provisions in statute are not \nworking, we need a Federal constitutional amendment. I made essentially \nthe same argument, probably not as eloquently as the Senator from New \nYork.\n  I share with the Senator both the concern for victims' rights and a \nconcern for the U.S. Constitution not being unduly tampered with. We \nall acknowledge that it can and sometimes should be amended. However, \nit should be done only when necessary. In that we all agree.\n  He made the case to ask the question, Why not a statute? I respond to \nthat in three quick ways.\n  First, let's get one thing out of the way. We do not want to amend \nthe Constitution only when there has been a finding by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt that some action we want to take is unconstitutional. Of course, \nthere are not findings that State constitutional provisions or statutes \nare unconstitutional. There would be no reason for that. None of them \nconflicts with defendants' rights. That is the only basis on which I \ncan think they would be declared unconstitutional. No one wants to \nconflict with or hurt defendants' rights.\n\n[[Page S2905]]\n\n  There is no reason to expect any provision will be declared \nunconstitutional. There is a problem with respect to precedent, and \nthat is, the Tenth Circuit has held there is no standing to enforce a \nFederal statute that the Senator from New York helped to draft. That is \na problem.\n  Now I believe in seven different States victims do not have the \nstanding to assert rights we provided in a Federal statute.  That is \nbad. That is a precedent we need to overturn and can overturn with a \nconstitutional amendment.\n\n  The third point in this respect is that the problem is not that there \nhas been or ever would be a finding of unconstitutionality with respect \nto these statutes or provisions. It is, rather, that they are just not \nenforced. As somebody said, they are enforced more in the breach than \nin the observance. That is the problem. Not that there is \nunconstitutionality.\n  Let me do the other two things I wanted to do. I see the Senator from \nVermont is standing.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I wonder if the Senator will be willing to yield just for \na moment to the Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. KYL. I yield to the Senator from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to yield my time under the present \nmeasure to the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. KYL. As soon as I conclude these two points, again I am happy to \nallow the Senator from Vermont to speak. I was waiting for this last \nhour or so and thought we would take up the time, and Senator Schumer \nhas provided a very important challenge. Why not a statute? I provided \nthe first answer.\n  Second, let me provide the answer from a piece Paul Cassell wrote, \noffered earlier by Senator Feinstein. He said:\n\n       In theory victims' rights could be safeguarded without a \n     constitutional amendment. It would only be necessary for \n     actors within the criminal justice system--judges, \n     prosecutors, defense attorneys, and others--to suddenly begin \n     respecting victims' interests. The real world question, \n     however, is how to actually trigger such a shift in the \n     Zeitgeist. For nearly two decades, victims have obtained a \n     variety of measures to protect their rights. Yet, the \n     prevailing view from those who work in the field [including \n     the Justice Department in this fine volume, New Directions \n     from the Field] is that these efforts ``have all too often \n     been ineffective.'' Rules to assist victims ``frequently fail \n     to provide meaningful protection whenever they come into \n     conflict with bureaucratic habit, traditional indifference, \n     or sheer inertia . . . '' The view that state victims \n     provisions have been and will continue to be disregarded is \n     widely shared, as some of the strongest opponents of the \n     Amendment seem to concede the point. For example, Ellen \n     Greenlee, President of the National Legal Aid and Defender \n     Association, bluntly and revealingly told Congress that the \n     State victims' amendments ``so far have been treated as mere \n     statements of principle that victims ought to be included and \n     consulted more by prosecutors and courts. A state \n     constitution is far . . . easier to ignore than the federal \n     one.''\n\n  A fortiori, as we lawyers say, a statute is far easier to ignore than \nthe Federal Constitution.\n  Just citing a couple of more points in Paul Cassell's piece, he \nquotes from the Department of Justice, the Attorney General herself. \nThe Department finding that these various efforts--the State and \nFederal and statutory and constitutional provisions:\n\n       . . . have failed to fully safeguard victims' rights. These \n     significant state efforts simply are not sufficiently \n     consistent, comprehensive, or authoritative to safeguard \n     victims' rights.\n  I would intersperse that a Federal statute, of course, is in the same \ncategory. In fact, it is of a slightly lower category than a State \nconstitutional amendment in the State courts. In any event, with \nrespect to the number of crimes of violence in the Federal system, you \nare only talking about approximately 1 percent of the crimes. So \nclearly a Federal statute does not give you anything that these State \nstatutes do not.\n  But here is the point, and I continue to quote here:\n\n       Hard statistical evidence on non-compliance with victims' \n     rights confirms these general conclusions about inadequate \n     protection.\n\n  In other words, now let's go to the tape. Let's look at the numbers, \nnot just the conclusions reached by scholars.\n\n       . . . the National Institute of Justice found that many \n     crime victims are denied their rights and concluded that \n     ``enactment of State laws and State constitutional amendments \n     alone appears to be insufficient to guarantee the full \n     provision of victims' rights in practice.''\n\n  Here are the statistics. For example:\n\n       . . . even in several States identified as giving ``strong \n     protection'' to victim's rights [like my State of Arizona and \n     Senator Feinstein's State of California] fewer than 60 \n     percent of the victims were notified of the sentencing \n     hearing and fewer than 40 percent were notified of the \n     pretrial release of the defendant.\n\n  Fewer than 40 percent. Would we consider that a good enough job in \nnotifying defendants of their right to counsel? Would we consider, if \nthe police in 40 percent of the cases remembered to give the Miranda \nwarnings, that that would be OK? Absolutely not. That is the \nfundamental difference between a constitutional right and a statute, or \na State constitutional provision. They just are not enforced with the \nsame degree of vigor and consistency and care as the U.S. Constitution \nmust be and is. So we find that 40 percent of the people who ought to \nbe notified that their assailant is about to be released from prison \nnever get the notice. That is in the good States. That is not good \nenough. After 18 years of experience with this, we ought to appreciate \nthat statutes and State constitutional provisions just have not done \nthe job.\n  That is the second reason. I will get to the third one. But that is \nthe second key reason why the Senator's question, Why not a State \nstatute or State constitutional amendment or Federal statute? just has \nnot worked. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Just a quick question. One thing we obviously do, and we \nhave gotten much better enforcement on a whole lot of Federal statutes, \nis say that they will lose all Federal crime money if they do not \nnotify the victim.\n  Mr. KYL. I am sorry?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. What I was proposing--I think the present statutes are \nnot working. I think they were poorly done. One way to get enforcement, \na good way that we have used in this body over and over again, which \nhas not even been tried yet, is to say the State would not get crime \nmoney, whether it be for Cops on the Beat, for building prisons, for \nByrne money for the DAs, if they don't notify the victims. The State \nwould do much better than 40 percent.\n  The reason this statute has not worked is no one has put any teeth \ninto it. Why do we not put some teeth into it before jumping to the \nConstitution? I yield.\n  Mr. KYL. First of all, the Federal statute applies to Federal crimes \nwhich constitute about 1 percent of what we are talking about. Even if \nyou could put good teeth in the Federal statute, you would be dealing \nwith 1 percent of the cases. That leaves, what, 59 percent to go, by my \ncalculation.\n  Second, these State constitutional provisions are very well written. \nThe one that we have in Arizona was adopted with between 70 and 80 \npercent of the vote, the one that has been adopted in California and \nthese other States--they are very good. It is not that they are not \nwell written. The question is, Why should you have to have a penalty \nfor somebody, for a judge who fails to provide the notice, for example? \nWhy should we deny Federal law enforcement support when everybody knows \nthat is really needed? It is not a good enforcement mechanism. The best \nenforcement mechanism, of that which we consider to be fundamental \nrights, is the recognition that they are embodied in the U.S. \nConstitution and nobody wants to deny those. If 40 percent of the \npeople who should get notice under State constitutional provisions get \nnotice, something is drastically wrong. Until you put that in the U.S. \nConstitution, it is not going to change.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If the Senator will permit me, because I think he so \nwell outlined that, I want to add one thing. No matter what we craft--\nwe have taken two cracks at it and missed. Maybe the third time will \neither be another strike or a home run. I don't know. But, nonetheless, \nno matter how the statute is crafted, it will affect just 1 to 2 \npercent of the victims of violent crime all across this great land. For \nme, that is a very great problem.\n\n[[Page S2906]]\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If the Senator will yield for a second, we have crafted \nmany other criminal justice laws where we told the States, unless they \ndid A, B, and C, we would take away their Federal money, and they did \nit. Drunk driving laws, sex offender laws--we can affect all 100 \npercent by using the tool of Federal money.\n  I yield back.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Then I think it is the wrong tool for what is a basic \nhuman right against government because it is government that refuses \nthese people access. I think then you have to monitor government, and \nit would take a whole new bureaucracy to monitor government to see \nevery notice was sent out and every change of address and that kind of \nthing. But I want to read a statement from someone who you do respect. \nI know you respect Professor Tribe. In addition, I know you respect the \nAttorney General of the United States. Just before you leave, I want to \nread a statement:\n\n       Unless the Constitution is amended to ensure basic rights \n     to crime victims, we will never correct the existing \n     imbalance in this country between defendants' irreducible \n     constitutional rights and the current haphazard patchwork of \n     victims' rights. While a person arrested or convicted of a \n     crime anywhere in the United States knows he is guaranteed \n     certain basic protection under our Nation's most \n     fundamental law, the victim of that crime has no guarantee \n     of rights beyond those that happen to be provided and \n     enforced in the particular jurisdiction where the crime \n     occurred.\n\n  This is similar to the discussion of how many angels dance on the \nhead of a pin. I supported the first State constitutional amendment in \n1982. It is now 18 years later. Even by constitutional amendments, what \nSenator Kyl said about 60 percent and 40 percent of victims being \nresponded to is really correct. We believe it is never going to be \nenforceable, it is never going to be carried out. The bureaucratic \ninertia is too great, the system is too ingrained, and the Constitution \nof the United States should not be so static and so immutable that \npeople who have suffered violence do not have a right in a court of \nlaw. That is what we are about. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I wish to start by \nacknowledging the outstanding statements that were made during the \ncourse of yesterday's debate. Senators Dorgan, Feingold, Schumer, \nDurbin, Moynihan, and Thompson each made a significant contribution to \nthis debate. I thank them for sharing their views on the Constitution.\n  Before we go on in this debate, and before we get to the actual vote \non the motion to proceed, I want to mention a couple issues that need \nto be considered:\n  One, who is a victim for purposes of the proposed constitutional \namendment, and secondly, what does the amendment mean to prosecutions?\n  We asked the Congressional Research Service. This is what they said:\n\n       [S.J. Res. 3 leaves] to another day the definition of \n     ``victim'' for purposes of the amendment. . . . It is yet \n     unclear whether S.J. Res. 3 . . . will wipe the slate clean \n     or simply supplement existing law and whether it will trump \n     conflicting defendant constitutional rights or if the need to \n     accommodate both will in rare instances preclude prosecution \n     in order to avoid conflict.\n\n  Think about that. CRS says under this amendment there are times when \none might not be able to prosecute at all because of a conflict in its \nwording.\n  I do not know how stopping a prosecution with this amendment helps a \nvictim in any way, shape, or manner.\n  What I wish instead is for those who share the concerns as I do for \nthe victims of crime to join with me in finding a way to achieve \nprogress without damaging our Constitution. I hope that even the most \nardent proponents of this proposed constitutional change will try to \nfind the best language possible. As Senator Torricelli said during \ndebate on the so-called balanced budget amendment in 1997: ``Good is \nsimply not good enough when we are amending the Constitution of the \nUnited States.'' I agree. Constitutional amendments should be held to a \nmuch higher standard than simply what is good.\n  Every one of us begins a Congress by swearing that we ``will support \nand defend the Constitution and bear true faith and allegiance to the \nsame.'' We are honored by the constituents of our States. They allow us \nto serve here. We have that duty, if they allow us to serve, to honor \nand defend the Constitution.\n  But the oath does more than that. It recognizes our obligation to the \ngreat constitutional tradition of the United States and for those who \nforged this wonderful document. Our oath recognizes our responsibility \nto those who sacrificed to protect and defend our Constitution, but it \nis also our legacy to those who will succeed us.\n  No Member of this body owns a seat in the Senate. One-hundred of us \nare privileged to represent 250 million Americans. In days and years to \ncome, others will take our places. Not only do we have to honor the \ncommitment of those who put us here now, but we have to make sure we \npreserve the legacy for those who come after us.\n  I am afraid, as we see more and more constitutional amendments come \ndown the pike--we have had 11,000 proposed since this country began--\nthat we run the risk of our Constitution, which has served this Nation \nso well for over 200 years, being treated by the Senate as a rough \ndraft rather than as the fundamental charter of this great and good \nNation.\n  Over the last 6 years, this institution, the Senate, has been acting \nas though the Constitution is no longer serviceable, as though it needs \nsome kind of major overhaul, as if we fortunate few who have been \nchosen to represent the people of our States since coming to Washington \nhave acquired some special wisdom that makes us smarter than all the \npatriots and all the public servants who preceded us and wiser than the \nlegislatures of all of our States, and certainly more knowledgeable \nthan the founders of this Nation.\n\n  In 1995, the Senate debated and rejected three proposed \nconstitutional amendments--H.J. Res. 1 on budgeting, S.J. Res. 21 on \ncongressional term limits, on which cloture was immediately filed but \nwas not invoked, and S.J. Res. 31 regarding the flag. Since that time, \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee has continued to report proposed \namendments at a record clip, and the Senate has been called upon to \nreaffirm its rejection of a proposed constitutional amendment on \nbudgeting and to debate and vote on a proposed constitutional amendment \non campaign finance.\n  Last year, the Senate devoted several weeks to an event of truly \nconstitutional magnitude. That was the impeachment trial of the \nPresident. This year the pace of constitutional proposals has \naccelerated again. This is the third proposal to amend the Constitution \nthat the Senate has been asked to debate in the last 30 days alone--the \nthird constitutional amendment in the last 30 days. We could turn \nourselves into another country, as referred to on this floor yesterday \nwhen the distinguished senior Senator from New York said that country's \nconstitution changes so rapidly that the libraries should find it under \nperiodicals.\n  In 1995, when he was to cast the decisive vote against a \nconstitutional amendment on budgeting, Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon \ncame to the Senate floor to explain how he would vote. My dear friend \nof over 20 years said:\n\n       The debate on the balanced budget amendment is not about \n     reducing the budget deficit, it is about amending the \n     Constitution of the United States with a procedural gimmick. \n     . . . As I stated during the debate on a balanced budget \n     amendment last year, a vote for this balanced budget \n     amendment is not a vote for a balanced budget, it is a vote \n     for a fig leaf.\n\n  Then Senator Hatfield concluded by saying:\n\n       Voting for a balanced budget amendment is easy, working to \n     balance the budget will not be. The Congress should not \n     promise to the people that it will balance the Federal budget \n     through a procedural gimmick. If the Congress has the \n     political will to balance the budget, it should simply use \n     the power that it already has to do so. There is no \n     substitute for political will and there never will be.\n\n  My friend from Oregon was right. But the same could be said about \ncrime victims' rights. Supporting a crime victims' rights \nconstitutional amendment is easy, but working to ensure that crime \nvictims are afforded their rights and that the protective provisions of \nlaw are implemented, that is something else again. That takes real \neffort. It takes on-the-ground implementation and the dedication of the \nnecessary resources and effort.\n\n[[Page S2907]]\n\n  We have had profiles in courage on constitutional amendments on this \nfloor. Last month, the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, \nSenator Robert C. Byrd, showed courage and commitment to constitutional \nprinciples when he voted against S.J. Res. 14, a constitutional \namendment regarding the flag. I was fortunate to be present during his \nextraordinary statement on March 29. During that statement he counseled \nthe Senate, but he also counseled the Nation on how to approach \nproposals to amend the Constitution.\n  I said then that his statement was a great history lesson and example \nof political courage because Senator Byrd was reconsidering his vote. I \nmust admit, much as I enjoyed his observations, much as I learned from \nthem, I did not know they would be so instructive again so soon.\n  With respect to this proposed constitutional amendment on crime \nvictims' rights, there is an open secret in this body; and that is, a \nnumber of Senators have begun conceding privately, many over the last \nseveral weeks, that they have personal misgivings about voting for this \nproposed amendment. They know that it is not necessary. They know that \nit does not meet the standard of Article V of the Constitution to \njustify constitutional amendments. It is not that necessary amendment \nof which Article V speaks.\n  Some of these Senators, people I respect greatly, on both sides of \nthe aisle, admit they joined as cosponsors because it is popular, \nbecause there seemed little reason not to, or because another one of \nthe sponsors had persistently urged them to do so.\n  But as one who has served a long time, as one who has certainly made \nhis share of mistakes in votes or positions, but as one who has had the \nprivilege to vote on this floor more than 10,000 times, I say to each \nof those Senators, including those who cosponsor this proposed \nconstitutional amendment, that you have succeeded by your efforts in \nbringing this matter to debate before Congress. I say this most \nsincerely to the cosponsors, this debate can result in greater \nrecognition of crime victims' rights. They could do that without \namending the Constitution.\n  I also say, respectfully, that now it is time to debate and to \nconsider that debate and decide how you will vote, whether you are a \ncosponsor or not, because how each of us votes and how the Senate acts \nis what is now the question. Each Senator is responsible for his or her \nown vote. Nobody can tell any one of us how we must or must not vote.\n  But for each of us, we should understand that if we vote on a \nconstitutional amendment, that is one of the most important \nresponsibilities we will ever exercise as an elected representative. It \nis a significant factor in the Senate legacy that each of us creates, \nbut it is also what contributes to the lasting legacy of our \nConstitution.\n  As Senators--the 100 of us--we are custodians of the Constitution. It \nis a responsibility we should allow to weigh heavily on our shoulders, \nnot to be exercised lightly. Each of us  should take seriously our \nresponsibility to defend the Constitution.\n\n  I have often said that rather than amending the Constitution we \nshould conserve the Constitution. No Senator should rely on 34 others \nto do the right thing and preserve the Constitution. Senators should \ncast their votes only for a constitutional amendment that they can \nwholeheartedly support, that they can honestly say they understand, and \nwhose implementation and impact they are confident they can fully \nanticipate. I say to my colleagues, with all due respect, very few of \nus could answer that challenge and vote for this constitutional \namendment.\n  The Constitution is not a bulletin board. It is not an automobile \nbumper on which to affix currently popular slogans. A vote on a \nconstitutional amendment is not something to be cast blithely. When it \ncomes to amending the Constitution, the popular vote is not necessarily \nthe right vote. The founders of this Nation knew that. That is why they \nput various hurdles before us to amend the Constitution.\n  Let us not sacrifice the traditional guarantee against an \noverreaching Federal Government that our Constitution provides and \nsacrifice it to a popular siren song. Rather, let us turn to the work \nneeded to be done to provide those rights that crime victims need in \nthe Federal system and provide the incentives for their implementation \nin the States' criminal justice systems. There is no need for a \nconstitutional amendment to achieve these goals. We can achieve these \ngoals without amending our Constitution.\n  A constitutional amendment is not like an ordinary statute. A statute \nyou can revisit. You can say next year: We were a little bit wrong in \nthat. Let's redo it. You can tweak it. You can revise it. You can amend \nit. You can change it. You can repeal it.\n  It is not so with an amendment to the Constitution. Here we are \ndealing with something else. This is not a commemorative resolution. \nThis is not one of those things we rush down to the floor and say to \nsomebody: Which amendment is this? Oh. And then voting yes or no. This \nis a constitutional amendment.\n  I think if we are going to change the fundamental charter of this \ngreat Nation, we ought to step back a little bit, step back from the \npolitical passions of the moment. We are debating a constitutional \namendment. We are not endorsing the popularity of a notion or a goal.\n  The Constitution of the United States is a good document. It is not a \nsacred text. But I would say in a democracy it is as good a law as has \never been written. That is probably why our Constitution is the oldest \nexisting Constitution today. It has survived as the supreme law of this \nland with very few alterations over the last 200 years.\n  Just think, more than 11,000 amendments have been proposed--many very \npopular at the time--but only 27 have been adopted; only 17 since the \nBill of Rights was ratified over 200 years ago.\n  What have we gotten out of this? We have a Constitution that binds \nthis country together rather than pushes it apart. It contains the \nGreat Compromise that allowed small States, such as my State of \nVermont, and large States, such as the State of the distinguished \nSenator from California, to join together in a spirit of mutual \naccommodation and respect.\n  I believe the State of Vermont may have had more population when it \nwas admitted than the State of California. How much changes over time. \nThat Great Compromise guaranteed that every State would have a voice in \nthis wonderful body, the Senate, this place I love so much and will \nmiss so greatly when I leave.\n  The Constitution embodies the protections that make real the \npronouncements in our historic Declaration of Independence and give \nmeaning to our inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness.\n  These are not just simply words we hear in Fourth of July speeches. \nThese are the words that make up the bedrock of this great Nation.\n  The Constitution requires due process. It guarantees equal protection \nof the law. It protects our freedom of thought and expression, our \nfreedom to worship as we want, or not, if we want. It also protects our \npolitical freedom. It is the basis for our fundamental right of privacy \nand for limiting Government's intrusions and burdens in our lives.\n  The provisions incorporated in the Bill of Rights ensure that \nGovernment power is not used unfairly against anyone. These provisions \nhave protected us for over 200 years.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I first commend the Senator from Vermont for his \nleadership on the Senate Judiciary Committee and the fact that he has \ntaken this debate over this proposed constitutional amendment so \nseriously. Senator Leahy has been a leader not just in terms of the \nDemocratic side but in terms of the Senate, to make certain that \nalthough a handful of Members have come to the floor to consider a \nmatter of this gravity, he has been here day in and day out.\n  My question to him goes to a point he has made so eloquently today in \nhis statement and before. It is about the nature of this amendment. Is \nit true that this proposed constitutional amendment before us is longer \nin length, has more words in it, than the entire first 10 amendments to \nthe Constitution known as the Bill of Rights?\n  Mr. LEAHY. It comes very close to those first 10 amendments. The \nexample I used: When we look at copies of\n\n[[Page S2908]]\n\nthe Constitution, going to the Bill of Rights, the 4 or 5 lines in the \nfirst amendment, this goes 66 or 67 lines. This is a long, complicated \nstatute. This should not be a constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is it true that the handiwork of James Madison and Thomas \nJefferson in crafting the first 10 amendments to the Constitution, the \nBill of Rights, the wisdom that has endured for over two centuries, is \ngoing to be rivaled, or is at least close to being rivaled, in length \nby this one amendment that is being proposed?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely correct. That has \nbeen the case through the 63, 64, or 65 drafts of it, as it has worked \nits way through here.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I further ask the Senator from Vermont, it is my \nunderstanding that at least 63 different drafts of this amendment have \nbeen circulated around the Senate before it came to the floor today. \nWord has it that draft No. 64 is on the way, which we might get a \nchance to see before we vote on it. My question to the Senator is, in \nterms of victims' rights, does this not suggest that it would be better \nfor us to have a statute rather than to amend the Constitution of the \nUnited States, if it takes so many pages of wording to address the \nconcerns of the sponsors of this amendment?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would much prefer a statute because, as the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois and the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia know, a statute could be easily changed. It could easily \nbe repealed, if we are wrong. In fact, if the Senator from Illinois \nwill bear with me, I want to follow up on what he was  saying. As an \nold printer's son, I made sure we had the same typeface on both sides \nof this chart. On the left side is the Bill of Rights; on the right \nside is the proposed constitutional amendment. Here is the Bill of \nRights, all 10, and here is the constitutional amendment. They are just \nabout the same length.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Despite the length of this amendment, the fact that it \nhas been through 63 or 64 different versions, it is characterized as a \nconstitutional amendment to protect the rights of crime victims. In \nthis proposed amendment to the Constitution, is the word ``victim'' \ndefined? Do we know what we are talking about in terms of what is a \ncrime victim or who is a crime victim?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Illinois, there is \nno definition of the word ``victim.'' I must admit, as a former \nprosecutor, that is the first thing I look for. We all know that \n``victim'' means different things to different people. It is not in \nhere.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Vermont, is it not true that under \nFederal statute there are at least two or three different definitions \ncurrently of what ``crime victim'' might be?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Illinois again is absolutely correct. \nThey are defined very carefully in the statute because you have \ndifferent remedies for different situations. You have different \nsituations in which victims are defined differently. That is why we \nneed a statute.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is it not interesting that if we are going to give a \nconstitutional right to a crime victim without defining who that victim \nmight be, we are giving, under this proposed amendment, such things as \nthe right to notice of criminal proceedings, so that the Government has \na responsibility to notify people, without a definition of who those \npeople might be or what class of people might be included?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely right. It is one \nof the reasons why so many prosecutors have opposed this, but also why \nmany victims groups have opposed this. They believe it is unworkable.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Vermont also give me his thinking \nabout section 1 of this proposed constitutional amendment which \noutlines and specifies the constitutional right to ``consideration of \nthe interest of the victim that any trial be free from unreasonable \ndelay''?\n  People such as George Will, a conservative commentator, have asked \nwhat in the world this could mean, to give to a victim \n``consideration.'' My question is, if you are going to add wording to \namend the Constitution, if I am not mistaken, since the passage of the \nBill of Rights, which would be the 18th or 19th amendment we have \nenacted in Congress, whether such vague wording as ``consideration'' of \nvictims is adequate to stand the test of time and trial before the \nFederal court system.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I say to my friend, you could probably have 25 \nconstitutional experts who would give you 25 different interpretations \nof what that word means.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Vermont. Most people, when they \nthink of a crime victim, can obviously identify the victim of an \nassault or battery or robbery, of course. In a murder situation, does \nthe victim of the crime include the family of the murder victim? You \nmight think it would. But if it is going to include family and \nrelatives of the actual victims of crimes, how large of a net is being \ncast here to require the Government to give notice of trial to \naccommodate the scheduling of trials and hearings for this group, that \nmay be rather large if you consider everyone affected by a crime?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I say to my friend from Illinois, in different cases I \nprosecuted, especially sometimes in family crimes of incest, rape, of \nbeatings, of murders, sometimes we have a little bit of difficulty to \nmake at least an initial determination of who the victim was and who \nthe perpetrator was. It creates all kinds of problems.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is it not true that every State in the Union has at least \na statute or a provision in their constitution protecting the rights of \ncrime victims?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes. I say to my friend from Illinois, we may consider \nsometimes as necessary, under Article V, a constitutional amendment, if \nthe States or Federal Government are unable to do these things \notherwise. The fact is, they are doing it very well without a \nconstitutional amendment. Thus, it removes the test of necessity we see \nin Article V.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Exactly the question I was going to ask. If we are going \nto amend the Constitution of the United States to take on this awesome \nresponsibility, a document which all of us have sworn to uphold and \ndefend, should we not be in a situation where there is no other \nrecourse, where we have a situation where State statutes are being \nstricken, where there is some controversy at hand as to whether or not \ncrime victims across the United States are being accommodated? The test \nof necessity seems to me to be the threshold test which we should meet \nbefore we come together on the floor of the Senate to consider an \namendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n  Would the Senator from Vermont comment on that, please?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I say to my friend from Illinois that they should meet the \ntest of necessity. I have always felt it meant in the Constitution that \nthe test of necessity should be a high bar. In this case, I don't even \nthink it is a low bar. There is no test of necessity here.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator aware Mr. Will reported in a column \nrecently that this is the fourth time in 29 days that Congress is \nvoting on an amendment to the Constitution of the United States?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, absolutely; one in the Senate and three in the House.\n  Mr. President, I know the Senator from Nebraska wishes to yield his \ntime to the Senator from Arizona. I yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my 1 hour of \ndebate be allocated to the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my dear friend from Illinois for \nthe questions he has asked. He has worked so hard on this. He has \nspoken, as I said, brilliantly on this matter and I appreciate him \ncoming here.\n  Earlier this week, I was honored to join in a Dear Colleague letter \nwith the senior Senator from West Virginia. I have referred to Senator \nByrd as the Senate's constitutional sage. Senator Byrd has played a \nleading role in protecting our Constitution over the last several years \nas it has weathered assault after assault. He counseled the Senate on \nthe so-called balanced budget amendment, which would have been\n\n[[Page S2909]]\n\na travesty. He was right. He has preserved the protection of our \nseparation of powers against the line-item veto. Again, he was right. \nHe showed great courage and wisdom with his vote and statement on the \nflag amendment on March 29. As I said, I was fortunate enough to join \nwith the distinguished Senator from West Virginia on a Dear Colleague \nletter. We sent it out on April 24.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this Dear Colleague letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 24, 2000.\n       Dear Colleague: On Tuesday, April 25, 2000, the Senate will \n     begin its consideration of S.J. Res. 3, the proposed victims' \n     rights amendment to the United States Constitution. We are \n     writing to urge you to consider this matter carefully and \n     protect the Constitution by voting against this unnecessary \n     amendment.\n       Article V of the Constitution establishes the process for \n     constitutional amendment. The process is cumbersome because \n     the Framers intended it to be. Under Article V, Congress \n     shall only propose an amendment to the States if two-thirds \n     of both Houses deem it ``necessary.'' James Madison, one of \n     the principal architects of the Constitution, cautioned that \n     constitutional amendment should be reserved for ``certain \n     great and extraordinary occasions,'' when no other \n     alternative is available.\n       Of the more than 11,000 constitutional amendments \n     introduced in Congress, only 27 have been adopted. The first \n     10 were ratified as our Bill of Rights in 1791, 209 years \n     ago. There have been just 17 additional amendments. Despite \n     all of the political, economic, and social changes this \n     country has experienced over the course of more than two \n     centuries; despite the advent of electricity and the advent \n     of the internal combustion engine; despite one civil war and \n     two world wars and several smaller wars; despite the \n     discovery of modes of communication and transportation beyond \n     the wildest fancies of the most visionary framers, this \n     document, the Constitution of the United States, has been \n     amended only 17 times since the Bill of Rights.\n       No ``great and extraordinary'' occasion calls for passage \n     of this proposed amendment, S.J. Res. 3. Tremendous strides \n     have been made in the past 20 years toward ensuring better \n     and more comprehensive rights and services for victims of \n     crime. Today, there are over 30,000 laws nationwide that \n     define and protect victims' rights, as well as over 10,000 \n     national, State, and local organizations that provide \n     assistance to people who have been hurt by crime. There is no \n     evidence that these laws and organizations are failing to \n     protect victims.\n       The Constitution creates no impediment to the enactment of \n     State and Federal laws to protect crime victims. Indeed, the \n     proponents of this constitutional amendment cannot cite a \n     single judicial decision that was not eventually reversed in \n     which a victims' rights statute or State constitutional \n     amendment was not given effect because of a right guaranteed \n     to the accused in the Federal Constitution. Moreover, given \n     the extraordinary political popularity of the victims' \n     movement, there is every reason to believe that the \n     legislative process will continue to be responsive to \n     enhancing victims' interests.\n       Tinkering with the careful system of Federalism established \n     by the Constitution can have far reaching and unexpected \n     consequences. When it comes to our founding charter, history \n     demands our utmost prudence.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Robert C. Byrd,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senator from South Carolina has asked \nthat I ask unanimous consent, on his behalf, that he may yield his hour \nof debate to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from \nConnecticut. I yield to him.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will speak briefly, as I know our \ncolleague from West Virginia is going to return to the floor to speak \nmomentarily. As soon as he arrives, I will be glad to yield \nimmediately. At some later point, I will take a little more time to \nexpress my views on this issue.\n  I want to begin with these brief remarks by, first of all, commending \nmy colleague from Arizona and my colleague from California. This is a \nlegitimate issue, in my view. I don't know how many of my colleagues \nlast evening--or in the last two evenings--I can't remember whether it \nwas last night or the night before--saw a news program about the \nfamilies of the victims in the Starbucks shootings in this city. It was \nvery moving to see these families being considered and their presence \nduring the court proceedings in the disposition of this matter. It was \nheartwarming for me to see the families have an opportunity to express \nhow they felt about what had happened and what the sentences were going \nto be regarding those charged with this crime. It is not something that \nwe have seen with great frequency over the years, but it exists because \nthere is a provision within the law in the District of Columbia that \ngives victims some rights.\n  To that extent, I begin these brief remarks by saying to my good \nfriends from Arizona and California, I have great respect for the issue \nthey are trying to address--that victims of crime be given the \nopportunity to be involved in the proceedings where loved ones, family \nmembers, people they cared about deeply, who have been victimized, are \ngoing to have a chance to be heard and to be involved.\n  The concern I have is not that they have failed to identify a \nproblem. They have. My concern is with the solution to the problem they \nhave sought. The solution that my good friends from Arizona and \nCalifornia have offered to address this issue is to amend the \nConstitution of the United States before considering the opportunity of \nwriting statutory language, which might achieve the very same result \nwithout amending the cornerstone, the most fundamental document each \nand every one of us cherish as Americans.\n  A statute can be changed in a minute if there are problems with it, \nas time may prove. When you consider the Constitution of the United \nStates, our Founding Fathers wrote the document and made it difficult \nto amend because they didn't want this to become a statute, an \nordinance, a collection of wishes, a place where we would write party \nplatforms. They wanted it to be the embodiment of the fundamental \nprinciples we embrace as Americans, and to change it would take \nherculean efforts.\n  My concern is that there are already on the books numerous statutes \nthat give victims the right to be heard in this process, as we saw just \nlast evening in the case of the Starbucks crime here in this city. And \nacross the country, such statutes exist. I happen to revere, as I know \nmy colleagues do, the Constitution of the United States. I carry with \nme every day in my pocket a copy of the Constitution. It was given to \nme by my seatmate, the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. \nI carry it with me every single day everywhere I go. I constantly \nremind myself of what I was elected to do, what purpose I am supposed \nto serve as a Member of the Senate.\n  The first and foremost of my responsibilities is to protect and \ndefend this Constitution. That is my first responsibility. So when \nefforts are made to change this document--this thin document which--to \nprotect and defend this Constitution is, in my view, our primary \nresponsibility. We have before us a proposal for a constitutional \namendment, which is represented on the left side of this chart. Here is \nthe proposed constitutional amendment.\n  It is nearly longer than the entire Bill of Rights. The first 10 \namendments--the Bill of Rights is shorter than this proposed \nconstitutional amendment. That in and of itself ought to give us pause \nand cause us to be concerned, to wait and ask: Are we really going to \nadd a provision, given the one issue, and write it into the cornerstone \ndocument of this country which has more sections and more words than is \nincluded in the Bill of Rights on which all of our individual freedoms \nare grounded?\n  I say to my good friends from Arizona and California that I could not \nagree with them more in identifying for the country in this forum the \nissue of victims' rights. It deserves and it demands attention, from \nState legislatures to the United States Congress. But the solution I \nsuggest must first be sought in statutory language. If at the end of \nthe day the statutory language is found to be unconstitutional, then \nyou might consider amending the Constitution. But you don't seek the \nsolution to that problem by amending the cornerstone document of our \nNation first. Try the statute first. Let's see if we cannot address \nthis problem through that vehicle and through that process, and if that \nfails, then come to the Constitution. But don't begin the process \nthere. That, to me, is too dangerous.\n\n[[Page S2910]]\n\n  We have an obligation to protect victims. We also have an obligation \nto protect the Constitution of the United States.\n  For those reasons, with all due respect to my colleagues whom I \nhighly respect and have a great regard for--I have worked with my \ncolleague from California on numerous issues, and with my colleague \nfrom Arizona, not as many, but I have a high regard for him, for his \nabilities, and for his contribution to the Senate--I urge them to take \nthe language they proposed, and let's work with it. Let's see if we \ncan't draft a statute that would allow us to address the legitimate \nconcerns of victims. Write it into the ordinances of our land. Test it \nin the courts, if you will, but do not tamper at this juncture with the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  I see the arrival of my good friend whom I just referred to by \nthanking him publicly for giving me my copy of the Constitution, which \nI carry with me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier I put into the Record the letter \nthat I was honored to sign with the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia explaining why we should not go forward with this amendment to \nthe Constitution.\n  Let me say one last thing on this. Ours is a powerful Constitution. \nIt is inspiring because of what it allows. It is inspiring because it \nprotects the liberty of all of us.\n  Think of the responsibility the 100 of us here have. Let us be good \nstewards. Let's keep for our children and our children's children the \nConstitution with protections as well considered as those bequeathed to \nus by the founders, the patriots, and the hard-working Americans who \npreceded us. Work together to improve crime victims' rights in \nlegislation. Let the States do the same. But let us remember that the \n100 of us are the ones who must reserve constitutional amendments for \nthose matters for which there are no other alternatives available, and \nthis is not such a matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/26/senate-section/article/S2910-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. KYL.

The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield my time to \nthe distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have listened to the comments by my \ncolleagues, those who are proponents of the proposed constitutional \namendment before the Senate, and I have listened to the comments of \nmany of my colleagues who have spoken in opposition to the proposed \namendment. I compliment both sides on the debate. I think it is an \nenlightening debate.\n  I will have more to say if the motion to proceed is agreed to.\n  In view of the statements that have been made by several of those who \nare opposed to the amendment--the Senator from New York (Mr. Schumer), \nthe Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin), and the Senator from \nConnecticut (Mr. Dodd), and others, they have cogently and succinctly \nexpressed my sentiments in opposition to the amendment.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, on his statements \nin opposition thereto, as well as the leadership he has demonstrated \nnot only on this proposed constitutional amendment but also in \nreference to other constitutional amendments before the Senate in \nrecent days and in years past. He is a dedicated Senator in every \nrespect. He certainly is dedicated to this Federal Constitution and \nvery ably defends the Constitution.\n  I do not say that our Constitution is static. John Marshall said it \nwas a Constitution that was meant for the ages. I will go into that \nmore deeply later. At a later date, I will address this particular \namendment.\n  But having been a Member of the Congress now going on 48 years, I may \nnot be an expert on the Constitution, but I have become an expert \nobserver of what is happening in this Congress and its predecessor \nCongresses, and an observer of what is happening by way of the \nConstitution. I consider myself to be as much an expert in that regard \nas anybody living because I have been around longer than most people. I \nhave now been a Member of Congress, including both Houses, longer than \nany other Member of the 535 Members of Congress today.\n  I must say that I am very concerned about the cavalierness which I \nhave observed with respect to the offering of constitutional \namendments. There seems to be a cavalier spirit abroad which seems to \nsay that if it is good politically, if it sounds good politically, if \nit looks good politically, if it will get votes, let's introduce an \namendment to the Constitution. I am not saying that with respect to \nproponents of this amendment, but, in my own judgment, I have seen a \nlot of that going on.\n  I don't think there is, generally speaking, a clear understanding and \nappreciation of American constitutionalism. I don't think there is an \nunderstanding of where the roots of this Constitution go. I don't think \nthere is an appreciation for the fact that the roots of this \nConstitution go 1,000 years or more back into antiquity. I do not \naddress this proposed constitutional amendment as something that is \nnecessary, nor do I address this, the Constitution today, as something \nthat just goes back to the year 1787, 212 years ago.\n  The Constitution was written by men who had ample experience, who \nbenefited by their experience as former Governors, as former members of \ntheir State legislatures, as former members of the colonial \nlegislatures which preceded the State legislatures, as former Members \nof the Continental Congress which began in 1794, as Members of the \nCongress under the Articles of Confederation which became effective in \n1781. Some of the members of the convention came from England, from \nScotland, from Ireland. Alexander Hamilton was born in the West Indies. \nThese men were very well acquainted with the experiences of the \ncolonialists. They were very much aware of the weaknesses, the flaws in \nthe Articles of Confederation. They understood the State constitutions. \nMost of the 13 State constitutions were written in the years 1776 and \n1777. Many of the men who sat in the Constitutional Convention of 1787 \nhad helped to create those State constitutions of 1776 and 1777 and \nsubsequent thereto. Many of them had experience on the bench. They had \nexperiences in dealing with Great Britain during and prior to the \nAmerican Revolution. Some of them had fought in Gen. George \nWashington's polyglot, motley army. These men came with great \nexperience. Franklin was 81 years\n\n[[Page S2911]]\n\nold. Hamilton was 30. The tall man with the peg leg, Gouverneur Morris, \nwas 35. Madison was 36. They were young in years, but they had \ntremendous experience back of those years.\n  So the Constitution carries with it the lessons of the experiences of \nthe men who wrote it. They were steeped in the classics. They were \nsteeped in ancient history. They knew about Polybius. They knew how he \nwrote about mixed government. They knew what Herodotus had to say about \nmixed government. They knew what other great Greek and Roman authors of \nhistory had learned by experience, centuries before the 18th century. \nThey knew about the oppression of tyrannical English monarchs. They \nknew the importance of the English Constitution, of the Magna Carta, of \nthe English Bill of Rights in 1689. They knew about the English \nPetition of Right in 1628. All of these were parts of the English \nConstitution, an unwritten Constitution except for those documents, \nsome of which I have named--the Petition of Right, the Magna Carta, the \ndecisions of English courts, and English statutes.\n  So to stand here and say, in essence, that the Constitution reflects \nthe viewpoints of the men who wrote that Constitution in 1787, or only \nreflects the views of our American predecessors of 1789, or those who \nratified the Constitution in 1790 or in 1791, is only a partial truth. \nThe roots of this Constitution--a copy of which I hold in my hand--go \nback 1,000 years, long before 1787, long before 1791 when the first 10 \namendments which constitute the American Bill of Rights were ratified. \nThat was only a milestone along the way--1787, 1791. These were mere \nmilestones along the way to the real truths, the real values that are \nin this Constitution, a copy of which I hold in my hand. Those are only \nmilestones along the way, far beyond 1787, far beyond 1776 or 1775 or \n1774. Why was that revolution fought? Why did our forbears take stand \nthere on the field of Lexington, on April 19, and shed their blood? Why \nwas that revolution fought? It was fought on behalf of liberty. That is \nwhat this Constitution is all about--liberty, the rights of a free \npeople, the liberties of a free people. Liberty, freedom from \noppression, freedom from oppressive government, that is why they shed \ntheir blood at Lexington and at Bunker Hill and at Kings Mountain and \nat Valley Forge, down through the decades and the centuries. The blood \nof Englishmen was spilled centuries earlier in the interests of \nliberty, in the interests of freedom: Freedom of the press, freedom to \nspeak, freedom to stand on their feet in Parliament and speak out \nagainst the King, freedom from the oppression of the heavy hand of \ngovernment. That is what that Constitution is about.\n\n  There are those who think that the Constitution sprang from the great \nminds of those 39 men who signed the Constitution at the Convention, of \nthe 55 who attended the meetings of the Convention--some believe that \nit sprang from their minds right on the spot. Some believe that it \ncame, like manna from Heaven, fell into their arms. It sprang like \nMinerva from the brain of Jove. That is what they think.\n  No, I say a miracle happened at Philadelphia, but that was not the \nmiracle. The miracle that occurred at Philadelphia was the miracle that \nthese minds of illustrious men gathered at a given point in time, at \nPhiladelphia, and over a period of 116 days wrote this Constitution. It \ncould not have happened 5 years earlier because they were not ready for \nit. Their experiences of living under the Articles of Confederation had \nnot yet ripened to a point where they were ready to accept the fact \nthat there had to be a new government, a new constitution written. And \nit could not have happened 5 years later because the violence that they \nsaw in France, as the guillotine claimed life after life after life, \nhad not yet happened. Some 5 years later, they would have seen that \nviolence of the French Revolution, and they would have recoiled in \nhorror from it.\n  The writing of this Constitution happened at the right time, at the \nright place, and it was written by the right men. That was the miracle \nof Philadelphia.\n  Here we are today talking about amending it, this great document, the \ngreatest document of its kind that was ever written in the history of \nthe world. There is nothing to compare it with, by way of man-made \ndocuments. Who would attempt to amend the Ten Commandments that were \nhanded down to Moses? Not I. Yet, we, little pygmies on this great \nstage, before the world, would attempt to pit our talents and our \nwisdom against the talents and wisdom, the experience and the \nviewpoints of men such as George Washington, James Madison, Alexander \nHamilton, Gouverneur Morris, Benjamin Franklin, John Dickenson, James \nWilson, Roger Sherman? In article V of this Constitution, they had the \nforesight to write the standard. If we want to find the standard for \nthis Constitutional amendment, or any other Constitutional amendment \nhere is the standard in the Constitution itself.\n\n       The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem \n     it necessary--\n\n  The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it \nnecessary--\n\n       shall propose Amendments. . . .\n  I don't say that the Constitution is static. I don't say it never \nshould be amended. I would vote for a constitutional amendment if I \ndeemed it ``necessary.'' Certainly, I do not see this proposed \namendment as necessary, but I will have more to say about that later.\n  I don't say that the Constitution is perfect. I do say that there is \nno other comparable document in the world that has ever been created by \nman. And when that Constitution uses the word ``necessary,'' it means \n``necessary,'' because no word in that Constitution was just put into \nthat document as a place filler.\n  I do think this is a time that I might speak a little about the \nconstitutionalism behind the American Constitution. I think it might be \nwell for anyone who might be patient enough or interested enough, to \nhear what I am going to say, because I don't think enough people \nunderstand the Constitution. I am sure they don't understand the roots \nof the Constitution. They don't understand American constitutionalism. \nIt is a unique constitutionalism, the American constitutionalism. I \ndon't think most people understand it.\n  In response to a recent nationwide poll, 91 percent of the \nrespondents agreed with this statement: ``The U.S. Constitution is \nimportant to me.''\n  Mr. President, 91 percent of the respondents agreed to that: ``The \nU.S. Constitution is important to me.'' Yet only 19 percent of the \npeople polled knew that the Constitution was written in 1787; only 66 \npercent recognized the first 10 amendments to the Constitution as the \nBill of Rights--only 66 percent. Only 58 percent answered correctly \nthat there were three branches of the Federal Government; 17 percent \nwere able to recall that freedom of assembly is guaranteed by the first \namendment to the Constitution--17 percent, 17 percent. Yet you see them \nout here all the time, on the Capitol steps, assembling, petitioning \nthe Government for a redress of what they conceive to be grievances. \nThey know they have that right, but only 17 percent were able to recall \nthat freedom of assembly is guaranteed by the first amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  Only 7 percent remembered that the Constitution was written at the \nConstitutional Convention; 85 percent believed that the Constitution \nstated that ``All men are created equal''--or failed to answer the \nquestion; and only 58 percent agreed that the following statement is \nfalse: ``The Constitution states that the first language of the U.S. is \nEnglish.''\n\n  The American people love the Constitution. They believe the \nConstitution is good for them collectively and individually, but they \ndo not understand much about it. And the same can be said with respect \nto constitutionalism. The same can be said with respect to the Members \nof Congress; that means both Houses. Not a huge number, I would wager, \nof the Members of the Congress of both Houses know a great deal about \nthe Constitution. How many of them have ever read it twice?\n  Each of us takes an oath to support and defend the Constitution of \nthe United States every time we are elected or reelected. We stand \nright up at that desk with our hand on the Bible--at least that is the \nimage people have of us--and we swear in the presence of men and \nAlmighty God to support and defend that Constitution. How many of us \nhave read it twice? How many of us\n\n[[Page S2912]]\n\nreally know what is in that Constitution? And yet we will suggest \namendments to it.\n  With 91 percent of the people polled agreeing that the U.S. \nConstitution is important to themselves, it is a sad commentary that \nthis national poll would reveal that so many of these same Americans \nare so hugely ignorant of their Constitution and of the American \nhistory that is relevant thereto.\n  Let us think together for a little while about this marvelous \nConstitution, its roots and origins and, in essence, the genesis of \nAmerican constitutionalism--a subject about which volumes have been \nwritten and will continue to be written. It is with temerity that I \nwould venture to expound upon such a grand subject, but I do so with a \nfull awareness of my own limited knowledge and capabilities in this \nrespect, which I freely admit, and for which I just as freely \napologize. Nonetheless, let us have at it because the clock is running \nand time stops for no one, not even a modern day Joshua.\n  Was Gladstone correct in his reputed declaration that the \nConstitution was ``the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given \ntime by the brain and purpose of man''? Well, hardly.\n  In 1787, the only written constitutions in the world existed in \nEnglish-speaking America, where there were 13 State constitutions and a \nconstitution for the Confederation of the States, which was agreed upon \nand ratified in 1781. That was our first National Constitution. \nAmericans were the heirs of a constitutional tradition that was mature \nby the time of the Convention that met in Philadelphia. Americans had \ntested that tradition between 1776 and 1787 by writing eleven of the \nState constitutions and the Articles of Confederation. Later, with the \nwriting of the United States Constitution, they brought to completion \nthe tradition of constitutional design that had begun a century and a-\nhalf or two centuries earlier.\n  So when someone stands here and says that this Constitution just \nrepresents what those people of 1789 or 1787 or 1791 believed, what \nthey thought, then I say we had better stop, look, and listen. The work \nof the Framers brought to completion the tradition of constitutional \ndesign that had begun a century and a half or two centuries earlier \nright here in America.\n  Let us move back in point of time and attempt to trace the roots of \nwhat is in this great organic document, the Constitution of the United \nStates. Looking back, the search--we are going backward in time now--\ntakes us first to the Articles of Confederation. A lot of people in \nthis country do not know that the Articles of Confederation ever \nexisted. They have forgotten about them. They never hear about them \nanymore. And then to the earliest State constitutions, and back of \nthese--going back, back in point of time--were the colonial foundation \ndocuments that are essentially constitutional, such as the Pilgrim Code \nof Law, and then to the proto-constitutions, such as the Fundamental \nOrders of Connecticut and the Mayflower Compact. As one scholar, Donald \nS. Lutz, has noted:\n\n       The political covenants written by English colonists in \n     America lead us to the church covenants written by radical \n     Protestants in the late 1500's and early 1600's, and these in \n     turn lead us back to the Covenant tradition of the Old \n     Testament.\n\n  It is appropriate, for our purposes here to focus for a short time on \nthose Old Testament covenant traditions because they were familiar not \nonly to the early settlers from Europe--your forebears and mine--but \nalso to the learned men who framed the United States Constitution.\n  In the book of Genesis we are told that the Lord appeared to Abram \nsaying: ``Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from \nthy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee: and I will make \nof thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name \ngreat;'' (Genesis 12:1,2)\n  In Chapter 17 of Genesis, verses 4-7, God told Abram: ``As for me, \nbehold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many \nnations. Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name \nshall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee. . . . \nAnd I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. And \nI will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after \nthee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto \nthee, and to thy seed after thee.''\n  Again, speaking to Abraham, God said: ``This is my covenant, which ye \nshall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child \namong you shall be circumcised.'' (Genesis 17:10)\n  The Abrahamic covenant was confirmed upon subsequent occasions, one \nof which occurred after Abraham had prepared to offer Isaac, his son, \nas a burnt offering in obedience to God's command, at which time an \nangel of the Lord called out from heaven and commanded Abraham, ``Lay \nnot thine hand upon the lad, . . . for now I know that thou fearest \nGod.'' (Genesis 22:12)\n  The Lord then spoke to Abraham saying, ``I will bless thee, and in \nmultiplying, I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and \nas the sand which is upon the sea shore . . . because thou hast obeyed \nmy voice.'' (Genesis 22:17,18)\n  God's covenant with Abraham was later confirmed in an appearance \nbefore Isaac, saying: ``Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which \nI shall tell thee of.'' Sojourn (see Gen. 26:3-5)\n  God subsequently confirmed and renewed this covenant with Jacob, as \nhe slept with his head upon stones for his pillows and dreamed of a \nladder set upon the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven, with \nangels of God ascending and descending on it. God spoke, saying: ``I am \nthe Lord God of Abraham, . . . and the God of Isaac: the land whereon \nthou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall \nbe as the dust of the earth . . . and in thee and in thy seed shall all \nthe families of the earth be blessed.'' (Genesis 28:11-14)\n  At Bethel, in the land of Canaan, Jacob built an altar to God, and \nGod appeared unto Jacob, saying: ``Thy name is Jacob; thy name shall \nnot be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name.'' And God \nsaid unto him, ``I am God almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation \nand a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of \nthy loins; and the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will \ngive it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.'' (Genesis \n35:10,11)\n  The book of Exodus takes up where Genesis leaves off, and we find \nthat the descendants of Jacob had become a nation of slaves in Egypt. \nAfter a sojourn that lasted 430 years, God then brought the Israelites \nout of Egypt that he might bring them as his own prepared people into \nthe Promised Land. Exodus deals with the birth of a nation, and all \nsubsequent Hebrew history looks back to Exodus as the compilation of \nthe acts of God that constituted the Hebrews a nation.\n  Thus far, we have seen the successive covenants entered into between \nGod and Abraham and between God and Isaac and between God and Jacob; we \nhave seen the creation of a nation through what might be described as a \nfederation--there is the first system of federalism--a federation of \nthe 12 tribes of Israel, the 12 sons of Jacob having been recognized as \nthe patriarchs of their respective tribes.\n  Joshua succeeded Moses as leader of the Israelites. Then came the \nprophets and the judges of Israel, and the turmoils of the divided \nkingdoms of Judah and Israel. Samuel anointed the first king--Saul, and \nthe kingship of David followed. Thus we see the establishment of a \nmonarchy.\n  God covenanted with David, speaking to him through Nathan the \nprophet, and God promised to raise up David's seed after his death, \naccording to which a son would be born of David, whose name would be \nSolomon. Furthermore, Solomon would build a house for the Lord and \nwould receive wisdom and understanding. The Ark of the Covenant of the \nLord, and the holy vessels of God, would be brought into the sanctuary \nthat was to be built to the name of the Lord.\n  Now I have spoken of the creation of the Hebrew nation, and not \nwithout good reason. The American constitutional tradition derives much \nof its form and much of its content from the Judeo-Christian tradition \nas interpreted by the radical Protestant sects to which belonged so \nmany of the original European settlers in British North America.\n  Donald S. Lutz, in his work entitled ``The Origins of American \nConstitutionalism'', says: ``The tribes of Israel\n\n[[Page S2913]]\n\nshared a covenant that made them a nation. American federalism \noriginated at least in part in the dissenting Protestants' familiarity \nwith the Bible''.\n  The early Calvinist settlers who came to this country from the Old \nWorld brought with them a familiarity with the Old Testament covenants \nthat made them especially apt in the formation of colonial documents \nand state constitutions.\n  Winton U. Solberg tells us that in 17th-century colonial thought, \ndivine law, a fusion of the law of nature in the Old and New \nTestaments, usually stood as fundamental law. The Mayflower Compact--we \nhave all heard of that--the Mayflower Compact exemplified the Doctrine \nof Covenant or Contract. Puritanism exalted the biblical component and \ndrew on certain scriptural passages for a theological outlook. Called \nthe Covenant or Federal Theology, this was a theory of contract \nregarding man's relations with God and the nature of church and state. \nMan was deemed an impotent sinner until he received God's grace, and \nthen he became the material out of which sacred and civil communities \nwere built.\n  Another factor that contributed to the knowledge of the colonists and \nto their experience in the formation of local governments, was the \ntypical charter from the English Crown. These charters generally \nrequired that the colonists pledge their loyalty to the Crown, but left \nup to them, the colonists, the formation of local governments as long \nas the laws which the colonists established comported with, and were \nnot repugnant to, the laws of England. Boards of Directors in England \nnominally controlled the colonies. The fact that the colonies were \noperating thousands of miles away from the British Isles, together with \nthe fact that the British Government was so involved in a bloody civil \nwar, made it possible for the American colonies to operate and evolve \nwith much greater freedom and latitude than would otherwise have been \nthe case. The experiences gained by the colonists in writing documents \nthat formed the basis for local governments, and the benefits that \nflowed from experience in the administration of those colonial \ngovernments, contributed greatly to the reservoir of understanding of \npolitics and constitutional principles developed by the Framers.\n  Although the Constitution makes no specific mention of federalism, \nthe federal system of 1787 was not something new to the Framers. \nCompacts had long been used as a device to knit settlements together. \nFor example, the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, 1639, established a \nCommon government for the towns of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield, \nwhile each town government remained intact. In 1642, the towns of \nProvidence, Pocasset, Portsmouth, and Warwick in Rhode Island devised a \ncompact known as the Organization of the Government of Rhode Island, a \nfederation which became a united colony under the 1663 Rhode Island \nCharter. The New England Confederation of 1643 was a compact for \nuniting the colonies of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Plymouth, and New \nHaven, each of which was comprised of several towns that maintained \ntheir respective governments intact.\n  Thus, the Framers were guided by a long experience with federalism or \nconfederalism, including the Articles of Confederation--an experience \nthat was helpful in devising the new national federal system.\n  Lutz says that the states, in writing new constitutions in the 1770s, \n``drew heavily upon their respective colonial experience and \ninstitutions. In American constitutionalism, there was more continuity \nand from an earlier date than is generally credited.''\n  That is why I am here today speaking on this subject. Let it be \nheard. Let it be known that the roots of this Constitution go farther \nback than 1787, farther back than its ratification in 1791--farther \nback. They were writing based on historical experiences that went back \n1,000 years, before the Magna Carta, back to the Anglo-Saxons, back \nanother 2,000 years, back another 1,500 years, back to the federalism \nof the Jewish tribes of Israel and Judah. Wake up. This Constitution \nwasn't just born yesterday or in 1787. Let us go back to history. Let \nus study the history of American constitutionalism, its roots, how men \nsuffered under oppressive governments. Then we will have a little \nbetter understanding of this Constitution. No, the Constitution is not \nstatic. History is not static. The journey of mankind over the \ncenturies is not static. We can always learn from history.\n\n  To what extent were the Framers influenced by political theorists and \nrepublican spokesmen from Britain and the Continent? According to \nSolberg, republican spokesmen in England constituted an important link \non the road to the realization of a republic in the United States.\n  I hear Senators stand on this floor and say that we live in a \ndemocracy. This is not a democracy. This is a republic. You don't have \nto believe Robert C. Byrd. Go to Madison, go to ``The Federalist \nPapers,'' Federalist Paper No. 10 or Federalist Paper No. 14--those of \nyou who are listening--and you will find the definition of a democracy \nand the definition of a republic. You will find the difference between \nthe two.\n  John Milton, whose literary accomplishments and Puritanism assured \nhim of notice in the colonies, was significant for the views expressed \nin his political writings. He supported the sovereign power of the \npeople, argued for freedom of publications, and justified the death \npenalty for tyrants.\n  English political thinkers who influenced American constitutionalism \nand who exerted an important influence in the colonies were \nBolingbroke, Addison, Pope, Hobbes, Blackstone, and Sir Edward Coke. \nAnd there were others.\n  John Locke may be said to have symbolized the dominant political \ntradition in America down to and in the convention of 1787.\n  Locke equated property with ``life, liberty, and estate'' and was the \ncrucial right on which man's development depends. Nature, Locke \nthought, creates rights. Society and government are only auxiliaries \nwhich arise when men consent to create them in order to preserve \nproperty in the larger sense, and a community calls government into \nbeing to secure additional protection for existing rights. As \nrepresentatives of the people, the legislature is supreme but is itself \ncontrolled by the fundamental law. Locke limits government by \nseparating the legislative and administrative functions of government \nto the end that power may not be monopolized. That is assured by our \nConstitution also. The people possess the ultimate right of resisting a \ngovernment which abuses its delegated powers. Such a violation of the \ncontract justified the community in resuming authority.\n\n  David Hume dealt with the problem of faction in a large republic, and \npromoted the device of fragmenting election districts. Madison, when \nfaced with the same problem in preparing for the federal convention, \nsupported the idea of an extended republic--drawing upon Hume's \nsolution.\n  Blackstone's view was that Parliament was supreme in the British \nsystem and that the locus of sovereignty was in the lawmaking body. His \nabsolute doctrine was summed up in the aphorism that ``Parliament can \ndo anything except make a man a woman or a woman a man.''\n  His ``Commentaries on the Laws of England'' was the most complete \nsurvey of the English legal system ever composed by a single hand. The \ncommentaries occupied a crucial role in legal education, and many of \nBlackstone's ideas were uppermost on American soil from 1776 to 1787, \nwith vital significance for constitutional development both in the \nstates and in Philadelphia. Although delegates to the convention \nacknowledged Blackstone as the preeminent authority on English law, \nthey, nevertheless, succeeded in separating themselves from some of his \nother views.\n  James Harrington's ``Oceana'' presented a republican constitution for \nEngland in the guise of a utopia. He concluded that since power does \nfollow property, especially landed property, the stability of society \ndepends on political representation reflecting the actual ownership of \nproperty. The distinguishing feature of Harrington's commonwealth was \n``an empire of laws and not of men.'' Harrington proposed an elective \nballot, rotation in office, indirect election, and a two-chamber \nlegislature.\n  This goes back a long way, doesn't it?\n\n[[Page S2914]]\n\n  Harrington proposed legislative bicameralism as a precaution against \nthe dangers of extreme democracy, even in a commonwealth in which \nproperty ownership was widespread. He argued that a small and \nconservative Senate should be able to initiate and discuss but not \ndecide measures, whereas a large and popular house should resolve for \nor against these without discussion.\n  These were novel but significant ideas that became influential in \nAmerica, in this country, before 1787. John Adams was an ardent \ndisciple of Harrington's views.\n  James Harrington was the modern advocate of mixed government most \ninfluential in America. That is what ours is. The government of his \n``Oceana'' consisted of a Senate which represented the aristocracy; a \nhuge assembly elected by the common people, thus representing a \ndemocracy; and an executive, representing the monarchical element, to \nprovide a balancing of power.\n  Harrington's respect for mixed government was shared by Algernon \nSidney, who declared: ``There never was a good government in the world \nthat did not consist of the three simple species of monarchy, \naristocracy, and democracy.''\n  The mixed government theorists saw the British king, the House of \nLords, and the House of Commons as an example of a successful mixed \ngovernment.\n  The notion of mixed government goes all the way back to Herodotus, \nand who knows how far beyond. It was a notion that had been around for \nseveral centuries. Herodotus in his writings concerning Persia had \nexpounded on the idea, but it had lost popularity until it was revived \nby the historian Polybius who lived between the years circa 205-125 \nB.C. It was a governmental form that pitted the organs of government \nrepresenting monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy against each other to \nachieve balance and, thus, stability. The practice of mixed government \ncollapsed along with the Roman Republic, but the doctrine was revived \nin 17th century England--now we are getting closer--from which it \npassed to the New World. Those who wrote the Constitution weren't just \nwriting based on the experiences of their time.\n\n  Let us turn now to a consideration of the renowned French philosopher \nand writer, Montesquieu. Montesquieu had a considerable impact upon the \npolitical thinking of our constitutional Framers. They were conversant \nwith the political theory and philosophy of Montesquieu, who was born \n1689--a hundred years before our Republic was formed--and died in 1755. \nHe died just 32 years before our constitutional forebears met in \nPhiladelphia.\n  Americans of the Revolutionary period were well acquainted with the \nphilosophical and political writings of Montesquieu in reference to the \nseparation of powers, and John Adams was particularly strong in \nsupporting the doctrine of separation of powers in a mixed government.\n  Montesquieu advocated the principle of separation of powers. He \npossessed a belief, which was faulty, that a huge territory did not \nlend itself to a large republic. He believed that government in a vast \nexpanse of territory would require force and this would lead to \ntyranny.\n  He believed that the judicial, executive, and legislative powers \nshould be separated. If they were kept separated, the result would be \npolitical freedom, but if these various powers were concentrated in one \nman, as in his native France, then the result would be tyranny.\n  Montesquieu visited the more important and larger political divisions \nof Europe and spent a considerable time in England. His extensive \nEnglish connections had a strong influence on the development of his \npolitical philosophy.\n  We are acquainted with his ``Spirit of the Laws'' and with his \n``Persian Letters,'' but perhaps we are not so familiar with the fact \nthat he also wrote an analysis of the history of the Romans and the \nRoman state. This essay, titled ``Considerations on the Causes of the \nGreatness of the Romans and their Decline,'' was produced in 1734.\n  Considering the fact that Montesquieu was so deeply impressed with \nthe ancient Romans and their system of government, and in further \nconsideration of his influence upon the thinking of the Framers and \nupon the thinking of educated Americans generally during the period of \nthe American Revolution, let us consider the Roman system as it was \nseen by Polybius, the Greek historian, who lived in Rome from 168 B.C., \nfollowing the battle of Pydna, until after 150 B.C., at a time when the \nRoman Republic was at a pinnacle of majesty that excited his admiration \nand comment.\n  Years later, Adams recalled that the writings of Polybius ``Were in \nthe contemplation of those who framed the American Constitution.''\n  Polybius provided the most detailed analysis of mixed government \ntheory. He agreed that the best constitution assigned approximately \nequal amounts of power to the three orders of society and explained \nthat only a mixed government could circumvent the cycle of discord \nwhich was the inevitable product of the simple forms.\n  Polybius saw the cycle as beginning when primitive man, suffering \nfrom violence, privation, and fear, consented to be ruled by a strong \nand brave leader. When the son was chosen to succeed this leader, in \nthe expectation that the son's lineage would lead him to emulate his \nfather, the son, having been accustomed to a special status from birth, \nwas lacking in a sense of duty to the public and, after acquiring \npower, sought to distinguish himself from the rest of the people. Thus, \nmonarchy deteriorated into tyranny. The tyranny then would be \noverturned by the noblest of aristocrats who were willing to risk their \nlives. The people naturally chose them to succeed the king as ruler, \nthe result being ``ruled by the best,''--an aristocracy.\n  Soon, however, aristocracy deteriorated into oligarchy because, in \ntime, the aristocrats' children placed their own welfare above the \nwelfare of the people. A democracy was created when the oppressed \npeople rebelled against the oligarchy. But in a democracy, the wealthy \ncorrupted the people with bribes and created faction in order to raise \nthemselves above the common level in the search for status and \nprivilege and additional wealth. Violence then resulted and ochlocracy \n(mob rule) came into being.\n  As the chaos mounted to epic proportions, the people's sentiment grew \nin the direction of a dictatorship, and monarchy reappeared. Polybius \nbelieved that this cycle would repeat itself over and over again \nindefinitely until the eyes of the people opened to the wisdom of \nbalancing the power of the three orders. Polybius considered the Roman \nRepublic to be the most outstanding example of mixed government.\n\n  Polybius viewed the Roman Constitution as having three elements: the \nexecutive, the Senate, and the people; with their respective shares of \npower in the state regulated by a scrupulous regard to equality and \nequilibrium.\n  Let us examine this separation of powers in the Roman Republic as \nexplained by Polybius. The consuls--representing the executive--were \nthe supreme masters of the administration of the government when \nremaining in Rome. All of the other magistrates, except the tribunes, \nwere under the consuls and took their orders from the consuls. The \nconsuls brought matters before the Senate that required its \ndeliberation, and they saw to the execution of the Senate's decrees. In \nmatters requiring the authorization of the people, a consul summoned \nthe popular meetings, presented the proposals for their decision, and \ncarried out the decrees of the majority. The majority rules.\n  In matters of war, the consuls imposed such levies upon manpower as \nthe consuls deemed appropriate, and made up the roll for soldiers and \nselected those who were suitable. Consuls had absolute power to inflict \npunishment upon all who were under their command, and had all but \nabsolute power in the conduct of military campaigns.\n  As to the Senate, it had complete control over the treasury, and it \nregulated receipts and disbursements alike. The quaestors (or \nsecretaries of the treasury) could not issue any public money to the \nvarious departments of the state without a decree of the Senate. The \nSenate also controlled the money for the repair and construction of \npublic works and public buildings throughout Italy, and this money \ncould not be obtained by the censors, who oversaw the contracts for \npublic works and public buildings, except by the grant of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S2915]]\n\n  The Senate also had jurisdiction over all crimes in Italy requiring a \npublic investigation, such as treason, conspiracy, poisoning, or \nwillful murder, as well as controversies between and among allied \nstates. Receptions for ambassadors, and matters affecting foreign \nstates, were the business of the Senate.\n  What part of the Constitution was left to the people? The people \nparticipated in the ratification of treaties and alliances, and decided \nquestions of war and peace. The people passed and repealed laws--\nsubject to the Senate's veto--and bestowed public offices on the \ndeserving, which, according to Polybius, ``are the most honorable \nrewards for virtue.''\n  Polybius, having described the separation of powers under the Roman \nConstitution, how did the three parts of state check and balance each \nother? Polybius explained the checks and balances of the Roman \nConstitution, as he had observed them first hand. Remember, he was \nliving in Rome at the time.\n  What were the checks upon the consul, the executive? The consul--\nwhose power over the administration of the government when in the city, \nand over the military when in the field, appeared absolute--still had \nneed of the support of the Senate and the people. The consul needed \nsupplies for his legions, but without a decree of the Senate, his \nsoldiers could be supplied with neither corn nor clothes nor pay. \nMoreover, all of his plans would be futile if the Senate shrank from \ndanger, or if the Senate opposed his plans or sought to hamper them. \nTherefore, whether the consul could bring any undertaking to a \nsuccessful conclusion depended upon the Senate, which had the absolute \npower, at the end of the consul's one-year term, to replace him with \nanother consul or to extend his command or his tenure.\n  The consuls were also obliged to court the favor of the people, so \nhere is the check of the people against the consuls, for it was the \npeople who would ratify, or refuse to ratify, the terms of peace. But \nmost of all, the consuls, when laying down their office at the \nconclusion of their one-year term, would have to give an accounting of \ntheir administration, both to the Senate and to the people. It was \nnecessary, therefore, that the consuls maintain the good will of both \nthe Senate and the people.\n  What were the checks against the Senate? The Senate was obliged to \ntake the multitude into account and respect the wishes of the people, \nfor in matters directly affecting the Senators--for instance, in the \ncase of a law diminishing the Senate's traditional authority, or \ndepriving Senators of certain dignities, or even actually reducing the \nproperty of Senators--in such cases, the people had the power to pass \nor reject the laws of the Assembly.\n  In addition, according to Polybius, if the tribunes imposed their \nveto, the Senate would not only be unable to pass a decree, but could \nnot even hold a meeting. And because the tribunes must always have a \nregard for the people's wishes, the Senate could not neglect the \nfeelings of the multitude.\n  But as a counter balance, what check was there against the people? We \nhave seen certain checks against the consul; we have described some of \nthe checks against the Senate. What about the people? According to \nPolybius, the people were far from being independent of the Senate, and \nwere bound to take its wishes into account, both collectively and \nindividually.\n  For example, contracts were given out in all parts of Italy by the \ncensors for the repair and construction of public works and public \nbuildings. Then there was the matter of the collection of revenues from \nrivers and harbors and mines and land--everything, in a word, that came \nunder the control of the Roman government. In all of these things, the \npeople were engaged, either as contractors or as pledging their \nproperty as security for the contractors, or in selling supplies or \nmaking loans to the contractors, or as engaging in the work and in the \nemploy of the contractors.\n  Over all of these transactions, says Polybius, the Senate ``has \ncomplete control.'' For example, it could extend the time on a contract \nand thus assist the contractors; or, in the case of unforeseen \naccident, it could relieve the contractors of a portion of their \nobligation, or it could even release them altogether if they were \nabsolutely unable to fulfill the contract. Thus, there were many ways \nin which the Senate could inflict great hardships upon the contractors, \nor, on the other hand, grant great indulgences to the contractors. But \nin every case, the appeal was to the Senate.\n  Moreover, the judges were selected from the Senate, at the time of \nPolybius, for the majority of trials in which the charges were heavy. \nConsequently, the people were cautious about resisting or actively \nopposing the will of the Senate, because they were uncertain as to when \nthey might need the Senate's aid. For a similar reason, the people did \nnot rashly resist the will of the consuls because one and all might, in \none way or another, become subject to the absolute power of the consuls \nat some point in time.\n  Polybius had spoken of a regular cycle of constitutional revolution, \nand the natural order in which constitutions change, are transformed, \nand then return again to their original stage. Plato on the same line, \nhad arranged six classifications in pairs: kingship would degenerate \ninto tyranny; aristocracy would degenerate into oligarchy; and \ndemocracy would degenerate into violence and mob rule--after which, the \ncycle would begin all over again. Aristotle had had a similar \nclassification.\n  According to Polybius, Lycurgus--the Spartan lawgiver of, circa, the \n9th century B.C.--was fully aware of these changes, and accordingly \ncombined together all of the excellences and distinctive features of \nthe best constitutions, in order that no part should become unduly \npredominant and be perverted into its kindred vice; and that, each \npower being checked by the others, no one part should turn the scale or \ndecisively overbalance the others; but that, by being accurately \nadjusted and in exact equilibrium, ``the whole might remain long steady \nlike a ship sailing close to the wind.''\n  Polybius summed it up in this way:\n\n       When any one of the three classes becomes puffed up, and \n     manifests an inclination to be contentious and unduly \n     encroaching, the mutual interdependency of all the three, and \n     the possibility of the pretensions of any one being checked \n     and thwarted by the others, must plainly check this tendency. \n     And so the proper equilibrium is maintained by the \n     impulsiveness of the one part being checked by its fear of \n     the other.\n\n  Polybius' account may not have been an exact representation of the \ntrue state of the Roman system, but he was on the scene, and he was \nwriting to tell us what he saw with his own eyes, not through the eyes \nof someone else. What better witness could we have?\n  Mr. President, before the Convention was assembled, Madison studied \nthe histories of all these ancient people--the different kinds of \ngovernments--aristocracy, oligarchy, monarchy, democracy, and republic. \nHe prepared himself for this Convention. And there were others in that \nConvention who were very well prepared also--James Wilson, Dr. William \nSamuel Johnson, and others.\n  The theory of a mixed constitution had had its great measure of \nsuccess in the Roman Republic. It is not surprising then, that the \nFounding Fathers of the United States should have been familiar with \nthe works of Polybius, or that Montesquieu should have been influenced \nby the checks and balances and separation of powers in the Roman \nconstitutional system, a clear and central element of which was the \ncontrol over the purse, vested solely in the Senate in the heyday of \nthe Republic.\n  Were the Framers influenced by the classics?\n  Every schoolchild and student in the universities learned how to read \nand write Greek and Latin. Those were required subjects.\n  The founders were steeped in the classics, and both the Federalists \nand the Anti-federalists resorted to ancient history and classical \nwritings in their disquisitions. Not only were classical models \ninvoked; the founders also had their classical ``antimodels''--those \nindividuals and government forms of antiquity whose vices and faults \nthey desired to avoid.\n  Classical philosophers and the theory of natural law were much \ndiscussed during the period prior to and immediately following the \nAmerican Revolution. It was a time of great political ferment, and \nthousands of circulars,\n\n[[Page S2916]]\n\npamphlets, and newspaper columns displayed the erudition of Americans \nwho delighted in classical allusions.\n  Our forbears were erudite. They circulated their pamphlets and their \nnewspaper columns. They talked about these things. Who today studies \nthe classics? Who today studies the different models and forms of \ngovernment? Who today writes about them?\n  The 18th-century educational system provided a rich classical \nconditioning for the founders and immersed them with an indispensable \ntraining. They were familiar with Ovid, Homer, Horace, and Virgil, and \nthey had experienced solid encounters with Tacitus, Thucydides, Livius, \nPlutarch, Suetonius, Eutropius, Xenophon, Florus, and Cornelius Nepos, \nas well as Caesar's Gallic Wars. They were undoubtedly influenced by a \nthorough knowledge of the vices of Roman emperors, the logic of \norations by Cicero and Demosthenes, and the wisdom and virtue of the \nscriptures.\n  They freely used classical symbols, pseudonyms, and allusions to \ncommunicate through pamphlets and the press. To persuade their readers \nthey frequently wrapped themselves and their policies in such venerable \nclassical pseudonyms as ``Aristides,'' ``Tully'', ``Cicero'', \n``Horatius'', and ``Camillus.'' The Federalist essays, 85 of them in \nnumber were signed by ``Publius.''\n  Some of the Anti-federalists dubbed themselves ``Cato,'' while others \ncalled themselves ``Cincinnatus'' or ``A Plebeian.'' The appropriation \nof classical pseudonyms was sometimes used in private discourse for \nsecret correspondence. George Washington's favorite play was Joseph \nAddison's ``Cato'' in which Cato committed suicide rather than submit \nto Caesar's occupation of Utica.\n  In the words of Carl J. Richard, in his book ``The Founders and the \nClassics''\n\n       It is my contention that the classics exerted a formative \n     influence upon the founders, both directly and through the \n     mediation of Whig and American perspectives. The classics \n     supplied mixed government theory, the principal basis for the \n     U.S. Constitution. The classics contributed a great deal to \n     the founders' conception of human nature, their understanding \n     of the nature and purpose of virtue, and their appreciation \n     of society's essential role in its production. The classics \n     offered the founders companionship and solace, emotional \n     resources necessary for coping with the deaths and disasters \n     so common in their era. The classics provided the founders \n     with a sense of identity and purpose, assuring them that \n     their exertions were part of a grand universal scheme. The \n     struggles of the Revolutionary and Constitutional periods \n     gave the founders a sense of kinship with the ancients, a \n     thrill of excitement at the opportunity to match their \n     classical heroes' struggles against tyranny and their sage \n     construction of durable republics. In short, the classics \n     supplied a large portion of the founders' intellectual tools.\n\n  Now, what about the Declaration of Independence?\n\n  It was on June 7, 1776, that Richard Henry Lee introduced the \n``Resolve'' clause, which was as follows:\n       Resolved, that these United States Colonies are and of \n     right ought to be free and independent states, that they are \n     absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that \n     all political connection between them and the state of Great \n     Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved.\n       That it is expedient forthwith to take the most effectual \n     measures for forming foreign alliances.\n       That a plan of confederation be prepared and transmitted to \n     the respective colonies for their consideration and \n     approbation.\n\n  Following the introduction of Lee's resolution, postponement of the \nquestion of independence was delayed until July 1. Nevertheless, on \nJune 11, Congress appointed a committee made up of Jefferson, John \nAdams, Franklin, Roger Sherman, R.R. Livingston, to prepare a \ndeclaration. The committee reported on June 28, and, at last, on July \n2, Congress decided for independence without a dissenting vote. The \ndelegates considered the text of the declaration for two additional \ndays, and adopted changes on July 4 and ordered the document printed. \nNews that New York had approved on July 9 (the New York Delegates, \nhaving been prevented by instructions from assenting, had theretofore \nrefrained from balloting) reached Philadelphia on July 15. Four days \nlater, Congress ordered the statement engrossed. On August 2, \nsignatures were affixed, although all ``signers'' were not then \npresent. Inasmuch as the Declaration was an act of treason--for which \nany one of those signers or all collectively could have been hanged--\nthe names subscribed were initially kept secret by Congress. The text \nitself was widely publicized.\n  Those forebearers of ours who had the courage and the fortitude and \nthe backbone to write the Declaration of Independence, committed an act \nof treason for which their properties could have been confiscated, \ntheir rights could have been forfeited, and their lives could have been \ntaken from them. That is what we are talking about in this \nConstitution. Men who not only understood life in their times, but also \nunderstood the cost of liberty, so they pledged their lives, their \nfortunes, their sacred honor.\n  Those were not empty words. Would we have done so?\n  Much of the Declaration of Independence was derived directly from the \nearly state constitutions. The things have roots. They didn't come up \nlike the prophet's gourd overnight. The Declaration contained twenty-\neight charges against the English king justifying the break with \nBritain. At least 24 of the charges had also appeared in state \nconstitutions. New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Virginia, in that \norder, adopted the first constitutions of independent states, and these \nthree state constitutions contained 24 of the 28 charges set forth in \nthe Declaration. Lists of grievances against George III had appeared in \nmany of the newspapers, and as far back as May 31, 1775, the \nMecklenburg (North Carolina) Resolves contained the following:\n\n       Resolved: that we do hereby declare ourselves a free and \n     independent people; are and of right ought to be a sovereign \n     and self-governing association, under the control of no \n     power, other than that of our God and the general government \n     of the Congress: to the maintenance of which independence we \n     solemnly pledge to each other our mutual cooperation, our \n     lives, our fortunes, and our most sacred honor.\n\n  Note that the last sentence of the Declaration of Independence says, \n``And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm Reliance on the \nProtection of divine Providence, [we are not supposed to teach those \nthings in our schools today] we mutually pledge to each other our \nLives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.''\n  Therefore, many of the phrases that were used by Jefferson had \nalready appeared in various forms in the public print. Jefferson also \nborrowed from the phraseology of Virginia's Declaration of Rights \nwritten by George Mason, and adopted by the Virginia Constitutional \nConvention in June 1776. In the opening Section of that document, the \nfollowing words appear:\n\n       That all men are by nature equally free and independent and \n     have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into \n     a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive or \n     divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and \n     liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, \n     and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.\n  Mason also stated in the Virginia Declaration of Rights, ``That all \npower is vested in, and consequently derived from the people,'' and \nthat, ``when any government shall be found inadequate or contrary to \nthese purposes, a majority of the community has and indubitable, \ninalienable, and indefeasible right to reform, alter, or abolish it in \nsuch manner as shall be judged most conducive to the public weal.''\n  Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence, stated that ``All men \nare created equal'' and that they were ``endowed by their creator with \ncertain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness--that to secure these rights, governments are \ninstituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of \nthe governed, that whenever any form of government becomes destructive \nof these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, \nand to institute new government, laying its foundation on such \nprinciples, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall \nseem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.''\n  The last paragraph of the Declaration of Independence states that the \nrepresentatives of the United States of America, in general Congress, \nassembled, ``Appealing to the supreme judge of the world for the \nrectitude of our intention, do, in the name, and by authority of the \ngood people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these \nUnited Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent\n\n[[Page S2917]]\n\nstates; . . .'' Lutz, whose name I mentioned a few times already, makes \nthe following comment:\n\n       Any document calling on God as a witness would technically \n     be a covenant. American constitutionalism had its roots in \n     the covenant form that was secularized into the compact. One \n     could argue that with God as a witness, the Declaration of \n     Independence is in fact a covenant. The wording is \n     peculiar, however, and the form of an oath is present, but \n     the words stop short of what is normally expected. But the \n     juxtaposition of a near oath and the words about popular \n     sovereignty is an intricate dance around the covenant-\n     compact form. The Declaration of Independence may be a \n     covenant; it is definitely part of a compact.\n\n  As to the words, ``All men are created equal,'' American political \nliterature was full of statements that the American people considered \nthemselves and the British people equal. Lutz states, with reference to \nthis paragraph: `` `Nature's God' activates the religious grounding; \n`laws of nature' activate a natural rights theory such as Locke's. The \nDeclaration thus simultaneously appeals to reason and to revelation as \nthe basis for the American right to separate from Britain, create a new \nand independent people, and be considered equal to any other nation on \nearth.''\n  Now, as to the State Constitutions--I am talking about the roots, the \nroots of this Constitution. This Federal Constitution which we are \ntalking about amending--what about the State Constitutions? Does the \nFederal Constitution have any roots in the State Constitutions?\n  Throughout the spring of 1776 some of the colonies remained \nrelatively immune to the contagion which prompted others to move toward \nindependence. This prevented the Continental Congress from breaking \nwith Britain. To spread the virus, John Adams and Richard Henry Lee \ninduced the Committee of the Whole to report a resolution which \nCongress unanimously adopted on May 10. The resolving clause of that \nresolution recommended to the respective assemblies and conventions of \nthe United Colonies, that, ``where no government sufficient to the \nexigencies of their affairs had been hitherto established, to adopt \nsuch government as shall, in the opinion of the representatives of the \npeople, best conduce to the happiness and safety of their constituents \nin particular, and America in general.''\n  State constitutions were of great significance in the development of \nour Federal Constitution and our Federal system of government. When the \nFramers met in Philadelphia, they were familiar with the written \nconstitutions of 13 states, and, as a matter of fact, many of those \nFramers had served in the State legislatures and conventions that \ndebated and approved the State constitutions. Not only were they, the \nFramers, conversant with the organic laws of the 13 states, but they \nwere also knowledgeable of the colonial experience under colonial \ngovernment. As was ably stated by William C. Morey, in the September \n1893 edition of ``Annals of the American Academy'' of Political and \nSocial Science:\n\n       The state constitutions were linked in the chain of \n     colonial organic laws and they also formed the basis of the \n     federal constitution. The change had its beginning in the \n     early charters of the English trading companies, which were \n     transformed into the organic laws of the colonies, which, in \n     their turn, were translated into the constitutions of the \n     original states, which contributed to the constitution of the \n     federal union.\n\n  The Pennsylvania Constitution of 1701 appears to have been the last \nwritten form of government that appeared in colonial times. There had \nbeen two previous Pennsylvania Constitutions--1683 and 1696--and these, \ntogether with the Massachusetts Charter of 1691, constitute the most \nadvanced colonial forms and provide the nearest approach in the \ncolonial period towards the final goal of the national constitution.\n  The original 13 colonies became 13 States during the decade preceding \nthe 1787 Convention, and all but Connecticut and Rhode Island wrote new \nconstitutions in forming their state governments. These new state \nconstitutions would provide important innovations in American \nconstitutionalism, and the Framers at Philadelphia would benefit \nhugely, not only from the substantive material and form contained in \nthe Constitutions but also from the experience gained under the \nAdministration of the new governments.\n  Let us examine some of these new constitutions, noting particularly \nthose features in the State constitutions which would later appear, \neven if varying degree, in the Federal Constitution. Thus we shall see \nthe guidance which these early State constitutions provided to the men \nat Philadelphia in 1787.\n  Let us first examine article I of the Constitution and observe the \namazing conformity therein with the equivalent provisions of the \nvarious State constitutions written a decade earlier in 1776 and 1777. \nTake section 1, for example, in which the U.S. Constitution vests all \nlegislative powers in a Congress, consisting of a Senate and House. At \nleast nine of the State constitutions have similar provisions--so you \nsee, our constitutional Framers just did not pick this out of thin \nair--perhaps varying somewhat in form, which vest the lawmaking powers \nin a legislature consisting of two separate bodies, the lower of which \nis generally referred to as an assembly or House of Representatives or \nHouse of Delegates--as in the case of West Virginia, which was not in \nexistence at that time, of course--or, as in the case of North \nCarolina, a House of Commons. The upper body is generally referred to \nas a Senate, but it varies, likewise, being sometimes referred to as a \nCouncil.\n\n  Section 2 provides that the U.S. House of Representatives shall \nchoose their speaker and other officers and shall have the sole power \nof impeachment, and at least a half-dozen states provided that the \nlegislative bodies should choose their speaker and other officers.\n  Section 3 provides for a rotation of Senators, two from each state, \nso that two-thirds of the Senate is always in being. Many of the state \nsenators were to represent districts consisting of several counties or \nparishes or other political units, and several of the States, including \nDelaware and New York, provided for a rotation of the members of the \nupper body so that a supermajority of the Senate were always holdovers. \nThe Great Compromise--which was worked out at the 1787 Convention and \nagreed to on July 16, 1787, providing that the Senate would represent \nthe States, while the House of Representatives' representation would be \nbased on population--may well have benefited from the examples set by \nDelaware and New York.\n  At least eight of the State constitutions provided for impeachment by \nthe lower house. Massachusetts and Delaware provided for the trial of \nimpeachments by the upper body, as does the U.S. Constitution, and \nMassachusetts required that senators be on oath or affirmation. The New \nYork constitution required a vote of two-thirds of the members present \nfor a conviction in trials of impeachment. Here again, the Framers of \nthe U.S. Constitution had examples before them which would guide them.\n  Conviction, in cases involving impeachment, would, in the instance of \nNew York, not ``extend farther than to removal from office, and \ndisqualification to hold or enjoy any place of honor, trust, or profit \nunder the state, but the party so convicted shall be, nevertheless, \nliable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment, and punishment, \naccording to the laws of the land''--almost the identical language that \nappeared a decade later in the U.S. Constitution relative to penalties \nfollowing conviction in impeachment cases, and almost identical to the \nlanguage in the unwritten English Constitution which appeared 200 years \nbefore.\n  At least nine of the State constitutions provided that each House \nshould be the judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of \nits own members, with a majority to constitute a quorum and with \nprovisions for a minority (of senators) to compel the attendance of \nabsent senators--the equivalent of language which appears in article I, \nsection 5, of the U.S. Constitution.\n  The provisions of article I, section 5, of the U.S. Constitution \nallowing each House to determine the rules of its own proceedings could \nwell have been copied from the state constitutions of Maryland, \nVirginia, Delaware, Georgia, and Massachusetts, and the provision for \nexpulsion of members in the U.S. Constitution could also have been \ntaken from the state constitutions of Delaware, Maryland, and \nPennsylvania.\n\n[[Page S2918]]\n\n  The constitutional requirement that revenue bills originate in the \nHouse of Representatives was prefigured by the State constitutions of \nNew Hampshire, New Jersey, Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, \nand South Carolina. Massachusetts permitted the senate to propose or \nconcur with amendments to revenue bills as was later provided in the \nU.S. Constitution.\n  The presentment clause of article I, section 7, that is what the \nCongress tripped over when it passed the nefarious Line-Item Veto Act \nof 1995, the presentment clause.\n  The presentment clause of article I, section 7, of the U.S. \nConstitution has been very much in the news lately in reference to the \nline item veto. The State constitutions of Massachusetts and New York \nare very revealing and instructive in this regard. The Massachusetts \nConstitution stated that no bill of the senate or house of \nrepresentatives should become a law until it ``shall have been laid \nbefore the Governor'' and if he approved thereof, ``he shall signify \nhis approbation by signing the same. But if he has any objection to the \npassing of such bill, he shall return the same, together with his \nobjections thereto, in writing, to the Senate or House of \nRepresentatives, in whichever the same shall have originated; who shall \nenter the objections sent down by the Governor, at large, on their \nrecords, and proceed to reconsider the said bill.''\n  That is what we are about to do very soon with respect to the most \nrecent veto of the President. So one can see these provisions that \nappear in our own Constitution had their roots in various other \ndocuments and experiences that long preceded the writing of the U.S. \nConstitution.\n\n       But, if after such reconsideration, two-thirds of the said \n     senate or house of representatives, shall, notwithstanding \n     the said objections, agree to pass the same, it shall, \n     together with the objections, be sent to the other branch of \n     the legislature, where it shall also be reconsidered, and if \n     approved by two-thirds of the members present, shall have the \n     force of the law. But in all such cases, the votes of both \n     Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays.\n\n  The language in the Massachusetts State Constitution is strikingly \nsimilar to that which appeared a decade later in the U.S. Constitution \nconcerning Presidential vetoes of bills and the requirement that such \nbills be presented to the President for his signature or for his \napproval or rejection.\n\n  The U.S. Constitution's language concerning vetoes and the \npresentment of legislation to the Chief Executive for his approval or \ndisapproval is again exceptionally reminiscent of the language in the \nNew York State Constitution, which provides for a council of revision \nof all bills. Note, however, the New York State Constitution language:\n\n       All bills which have passed the Senate and assembly shall \n     before they become laws, be presented to the said council for \n     their consideration, and if it should appear improper that \n     the said bill should become a law of this state, that they \n     return the same, together with their objections thereto in \n     writing, to the Senate or House of Assembly (in which so ever \n     the same shall have originated) who shall enter the objection \n     sent down by the council at large in their minutes, and \n     proceed to reconsider the said bill. But if, after such \n     reconsideration, two-thirds of the said Senate or House of \n     Assembly shall, notwithstanding the said objections, agree to \n     pass the same, it shall, together with the objections, be \n     sent to the other branch of the legislature, where it shall \n     also be reconsidered, and, if approved by two-thirds of the \n     members present, shall be a law.\n       And in order to prevent any unnecessary delays, be it \n     further ordained, that if any bill shall not be returned by \n     the council within ten days after it shall have been \n     presented, the same shall be a law, unless the legislature \n     shall, by their adjournment, render a return of the said bill \n     within ten days impracticable; in which case, the bill shall \n     be returned on the first day of the meeting of the \n     legislature after the expiration of the said ten days.\n\n  The similarity of the language in the U.S. Constitution's veto and \npresentment clause to the equally complex language of the Massachusetts \nand New York State Constitutions is enough to make one sit up and take \nnotice. Except for some slight variations, the U.S. Constitution \nappears to copy, almost verbatim, the text set forth in the two State \nconstitutions. It cannot be said with a straight face that this is a \nmatter of mere coincidence. It seems to me that one can easily see the \nfine hand and the eloquent voice of Alexander Hamilton, in the case of \nNew York, and Elbridge Gerry, Nathaniel Gorham, and Rufus King, in the \ncase of Massachusetts, in the behind-the-scenes discussions that \nprobably occurred in the Convention with respect to these and other \nclauses in the Constitution which appeared to have been copied, almost \nword for word, from various State constitutions.\n  The President's State of the Union Message, which grows out of \narticle II, section 3, of the U.S. Constitution, was likely \nforeordained by the New York Constitution which stated that it was the \nduty of the Governor ``to inform the legislature, at every session, of \nthe condition of the state, so far as may respect his department; to \nrecommend such matters to their consideration as shall appear to him to \nconcern its good government, welfare, and prosperity;\n. . .''\n  Nine of the States provided that the Governor should have the title \nof commander in chief, thus prefiguring section 2 of article II of the \nU.S. Constitution which states that the President ``shall be commander \nin chief'', and at least five of the State constitutions gave the chief \nexecutive of the State the power to grant reprieves and pardons, except \nin cases of impeachment, just as we find in article II, section 2, of \nthe U.S. Constitution with respect to the President's powers.\n  Other similarities between some of the State constitutions and the \nU.S. Constitution--in varying degrees, of course--have to do with the \nrequirement to assemble at least once in every year; legislators' \nprivilege from arrest; the requirement that a census be taken for the \npurpose of the apportionment of representatives; the laying and \ncollection of taxes by the legislative branch; the taking of an oath \nbefore entering upon the office of Governor and other high State \noffices, as in the case of the President and other officials at the \nnational level; provisions in the State and National constitutions for \namendments thereto; and prohibitions against bills of attainder and ex \npost facto laws.\n  Many of the States, obviously remembering British history--you see, \nthe roots go back, they go back and farther back--expressly prohibited \nthe governor from proroguing, adjourning, or dissolving the \nlegislature, but did provide that the Governor could, under \nextraordinary circumstances, convene the legislature in advance of the \ntime to which it had previously adjourned.\n  That the States were very wary of strong and overbearing executives \ncould be seen in the fact that in at least seven of them, the Governor \nwas limited to a 1-year term--that is what they though of their chief \nexecutives--2 years, in the case of South Carolina; and 3 years in \nDelaware and New York. Prohibitions against eligibility for reelection \nwere also prevalent in several of the State constitutions.\n  In at least eight of the States, the constitutions provided for the \nselection of the Chief Executive by the legislative branch.\n  In at least three States--Delaware, New Jersey, and New York--the \ncommon law of England was to remain in force. And some of the States, \nsuch as South Carolina, appeared to have copied in their constitutions, \nor their Bills of Rights which were annexed thereto that language from \nthe Magna Carta which, in the language of the South Carolina \nconstitution, states:\n\n       That no freeman of this state be taken or imprisoned, or \n     disseized of his freehold, liberties, or privileges, or \n     outlawed, exiled or in any manner destroyed or deprived of \n     his life, liberty, or property, but by the judgment of his \n     peers or by the law of the land.\n\n  In all of the State constitutions, the Governor was commander-in-\nchief, and the Federal constitution also makes use of the term, as I \nsay, in relation to the President. In all of the States except \nConnecticut, Rhode Island, and Georgia, and in South Carolina, the \nState constitutions before 1787 had granted the pardoning power to the \nGovernor, and, in the Federal Constitution, the President's pardoning \npower was drawn from this example of the states.\n  Almost every State prescribed in its constitution a form of oath for \nits officers, and the oath required of the President of the United \nStates appears in the last paragraph of section 1, article II, of the \nU.S. Constitution.\n  The framers provided for the choice of President to be indirect. In \nthe Constitution of Maryland (1776) we find an almost exact counterpart \nof the electoral college by whom the President is\n\n[[Page S2919]]\n\nchosen, in which the Senators from Maryland were to be selected by a \nbody of electors, chosen every 5 years by the inhabitants of the State \nfor this particular purpose and occasion.\n  This method of choosing the President may have been suggested from \nthe manner of choosing Senators under the Constitution of Maryland.\n  An examination of these early State constitutions clearly indicates a \nvast wealth of knowledge concerning constitutional principles and a \ngradual evolution leading up to the convention based on the experience \ngained from the administration of governments under the new State \nconstitutions. I see the constitutions of the States as tributaries--\ntributaries--to a mighty stream of American constitutionalism flowing \nto the mighty ocean of events that culminated in the grand handiwork of \nthe framers at the 1787 Convention.\n  Between the completion of State constitutions and the Philadelphia \nConvention that produced the United States Constitution stood the \nArticles of Confederation which went into effect on March 1, 1781, from \nthe substance and experience of which Madison and Hamilton and Franklin \nand others at the Convention gained so much guidance.\n  Let us now turn our attention to the Articles of Confederation.\n  Mr. President, I see others on the floor. They may wish to speak. I \nwill be happy to yield the floor at this point if I can regain it later \nand continue my statement.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I say to my friend from West Virginia, I \nhave already been on this floor speaking for a couple days. I took a \nmoment to go back to the office. But I was watching the Senator on the \nmonitor, and I just wanted to come over and listen to him in person. I \nhave no intention of wanting to ask him to yield the floor. I \nappreciate the courtesy he has offered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  I see the Senator from California. Also, if she wishes to have the \nfloor, I will be happy to yield it for a while.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I appreciate the courtesy of the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  I say to the Senator, please, continue on and conclude. I am just \nfine. I enjoy listening.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, what impact did the Articles of Confederation have \nupon the Constitution of the United States?\n  On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee of Virginia introduced a \nresolution in the Continental Congress resolving:\n\n       That these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, \n     free and independent states, that they are absolved from all \n     allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political \n     connection between them and the state of Great Britain is, \n     and ought to be, totally dissolved.\n       That is expedient forthwith to take the most effectual \n     measures for forming foreign alliances.\n       That a plan of confederation be prepared and transmitted to \n     the respective colonies for their consideration and \n     approbation.\n\n  In accordance with this resolution, Congress appointed a committee of \n12 on June 12--which happens to be my lovely wife's birthday, June 12, \nalthough she does not go that far back--1776, to prepare a form of \nconfederation. A month later, on July 12, a draft plan was reported by \nthe committee, written by John Dickinson of Delaware. The document, \nalthough reported to Congress on August 20, was delayed in its final \nconsideration, and after having undergone modifications, was finally \napproved by the last holdout State of Maryland in February 1781, and \nthe Congress, then, first met under the Articles of Confederation on \nMarch 1, 1781.\n  It had been a long time aborning.\n  New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland had demanded that the States that \nhad large claims to western lands renounce them in favor of the \nConfederation. Maryland was the last State to ratify the Articles, but \nfinally went along when she became satisfied that the western claims \nwould become the expected treasure of the entire Nation.\n  The Articles of Confederation were the direct predecessor of the \nConstitution of the United States, and the Articles contained within \nthemselves the fatal flaws which doomed the success of the \nconfederation. It was a ``league of friendship'' only, of which the \nCongress was the unique organ and in which ``each state shall have one \nvote.'' The votes of nine States were required before important action \ncould be taken by Congress, and the consent of the legislature of each \nState was necessary to any amendment of the fundamental law.\n  Congress was given no commercial control and, most unfortunately, no \npower to raise money, but could only make requisitions on the States \nand then hope and pray that the States would respond affirmatively and \nadequately. They seldom if ever did. Control over foreign affairs was \nvested in Congress, but it was without means of making the States obey \ntreaty requirements. The Congress had responsibility but without power \nto carry out its responsibility. It dealt with the people, not \nindividually, but over their heads through the States.\n  Several efforts were made to get the States to amend the articles, by \nadding the right to levy import duties, but these efforts failed \nbecause it was impossible to get the unanimous consent of the \nlegislatures of the 13 States to any amendment of the fundamental law.\n  It became increasingly difficult to secure a quorum of attendance in \nCongress, and even when a quorum of Members attended, important \nmeasures were blocked by the requirement for the votes of nine States. \nA State frequently lost its single vote--that is all it had--because of \ndifferences among its delegates. It was a time of experimentation, of \nlearning a hard lesson that would be remembered. But the experience \ngained from learning these hard lessons helped to prepare the way for a \nbetter national government. It should also be remembered that at least \none substantial act of legislation--the ordinance for the government of \nthe Northwest Territory, was created by the government under the \nArticles of Confederation.\n  Under the Articles of Confederation, no State could be represented in \nCongress by less than two, nor by more than seven, members; and no \nperson could serve as a delegate for more than three years in any term \nof six years. There were limited terms. Each State had only one vote. \nAll charges of war and other expenses incurred for the common defense \nor general welfare, if allowed by the United States in Congress \nassembled, were to be defrayed out of a common treasury, which would be \nsupplied by the several States in proportion to the value of all lands \nwithin each State, and the taxes for paying a State's proportion were \nto be laid and levied by the authority of the legislatures of the \nseveral States within the time agreed upon by the Congress.\n  Under a very complex arrangement--I say to the former Attorney \nGeneral of the State of Alabama, who presently presides over this \naugust body--the Congress under the Confederation was denominated as \nthe last resort on appeal in all disputes and differences arising \nbetween two or more States ``concerning boundary jurisdiction or any \nother cause whatever.''\n  The business of Congress was to be carried on during a recess by ``a \ncommittee of the states,'' to consist of one delegate from each State.\n  When it came to the armed forces, requisitions were to be made from \neach State for its quota, in proportion to the number of white \ninhabitants in such States, which requisitioned would be binding. Each \nState would appoint the regimental officers, raise them in and clothe \nand arm and equip them at the expense of the United States.\n  However, if the Confederation Congress should determine, based on \ncircumstances, that any State should raise a smaller number than its \nquota and that any other State should raise a greater number of men \nthan its quota called for, the extra number was to be raised, clothed, \nand equipped as the quota allowed, unless the legislature of that State \nshould judge that such extra number could not be safely spared. The \nState would be permitted to raise ``as many of such extra number'' as \nthe State judged could be safely spared.\n\n  What a flawed approach! It is little wonder that George Washington, \nas Commander in Chief of the Revolutionary forces, was constantly \nfrustrated in his efforts to build an effective fighting force. It was \nalmost a miracle that the fledgling Nation managed to carry on and win \nthe war under such conditions, but we can only guess\n\n[[Page S2920]]\n\nthat Providence was on our side. We know for sure that the situation in \nEngland was such that that country's preoccupation with its own \ninternal problems rendered impossible the full concentration of its \nresources and strength to be brought to bear against us. We were lucky \nin that regard.\n  Under the Articles, the ``Union shall be perpetual'' nor could any \nalteration be made in the Articles--there could be no amendment to that \nConstitution--unless such alteration was agreed upon in Congress \nassembled and afterwards confirmed by the legislature of every state.\n  The Articles of Confederation contained the phrase ``The United \nStates of America,'' for the first time in American documentary \nhistory. The Articles were America's first national constitution. \nCongress was elected by the State legislatures. There was only one body \nof Congress, not two, back then, as we see today. And Congress was the \nexecutive, the legislative branch, and the judiciary in many respects. \nThere was no man living downtown at the White House who was President.\n  Now let us examine the parallels between the Articles of \nConfederation and the U.S. Constitution.\n  I am here showing where the roots of the Constitution go. It is like \ntracing the roots of a tooth, if one is having a root canal, let us \nfind where those roots go.\n  Article II of the Articles of Confederation provided that each State \nwould retain its sovereignty and every power and right ``which is not \nby this confederation expressly delegated to the United States, . . .'' \nWhere do we find that in the Constitution? The tenth amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution provided that the powers not delegated to the United \nStates by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States ``are \nreserved to the states respectively, or to the people.''\n  Article IV of the Articles of Confederation provided that the people \nof the different States would ``be entitled to all privileges and \nimmunities of free citizens in the several states'', that ``full faith \nand credit'' should be given in each of the States to the records, \nacts, and judicial proceedings of the courts and magistrates of every \nother state; and that any person guilty of a felony in any state who \nfled from justice and was found in any other state, would ``upon demand \nof the Governor or executive power of the state from which he fled,'' \nbe delivered up ``to the state having jurisdiction of his offense.''\n  The ``privileges and immunities'' clause of the Articles of \nConfederation, found in article IV thereof, appears in the U.S. \nConstitution in article IV, section 2.\n  The ``full faith and credit'' clause of the Articles of Confederation \nis to be found in the U.S. Constitution, article IV, section 1.\n  The delivering up of persons charged with felonies to another state \non demand of the executive authority thereof, found in article IV of \nthe Articles is also found in article IV, section 2, paragraph 2, of \nthe U.S. Constitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Chair notes that the \nSenator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield 40 \nminutes of my 60 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota for his characteristic courtesy.\n  Article 5 of the Articles provided for the meeting of Congress on the \nfirst Monday in November in every year. Under the U.S. Constitution, \narticle I, section 4, paragraph 2, Congress ``shall assemble at least \nonce in every year, and such meeting was originally to have been on the \nfirst Monday in December, but this was changed to provide that Congress \ncould by law appoint a different day from that of Monday in December.\n  Under article V of the Articles of Confederation, freedom of speech \nand debate in Congress could not be impeached or questioned in any \ncourt or place out of Congress. Under the U.S. Constitution, article I, \nsection 6, members of Congress, for any speech or debate in either \nHouse, ``shall not be questioned in any other place.''\n  Article V of the Articles protects members of Congress from arrests \nduring the time of their going to and from, and attendance in Congress, \nexcept for treason felony, or breach of the peace.\n  Members of Congress are likewise protected under article I, section \n6, paragraph 1, of the U.S. Constitution.\n  Article VI of the Articles precludes any person holding office of \nprofit or trust under the United States from accepting any present, \nemolument, office or title of any kind whatever from any king, prince \nor foreign state. Nor could Congress grant any title of nobility.\n  In almost identical language, the U.S. Constitution, in article I, \nsection 9, paragraph 7, prohibits members of Congress from accepting \nany present, emolument, office, or title, from any king, prince or \nforeign state.\n  Under the Articles of Confederation no vessels of war or any body of \nforces could be kept up in time of peace without the consent of \nCongress. The same prohibition against the states was included in the \nU.S. Constitution in article 1, section 10, paragraph 2.\n  Provisions concerning state militias are contained in article VI of \nthe Articles, and in article I, section 8, of the U.S. Constitution.\n  Article IX of the Articles vested the power of declaring war, \nestablishing rules for captures on land or water, and granting letters \nof marque and reprisal. The equivalent provisions are to be found in \narticle I, section 8, of the U.S. Constitution.\n  So, you see, these provisions are not something new that just came \nfrom the minds, from the heads of our constitutional forebears and the \nConstitutional Convention in 1787. They were already written down in \nother places. Thank God for that and for their guidance, as it were.\n  Both the Articles of Confederation and the U.S. Constitution provide \nfor the trail of piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, in \narticle IX of the Articles and in article I, Section 8 of the \nConstitution.\n  Article IX of the Articles of Confederation gave Congress the sole \nand exclusive right and power of regulating the alloy and value of \ncoin, fixing the standard of weights and measures throughout the United \nStates, and regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the \nIndians. Congress under the Constitution was given the same powers in \narticle I, section 8.\n  The power to establish and regulate post offices, and the power to \nmake rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval \nforces was given to the Congress by the Articles of Confederation in \narticle IX. The same powers to establish post offices and to make rules \nfor the government and regulation of the land and naval forces were \ngiven to the Congress in article I, section 8, of the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  Article IX of the Confederation Articles provided that the yeas and \nnays of members of Congress were to be entered on the journal when \ndesired by any member of the Congress. The U.S. Constitution article I, \nsection 5 provided for the yeas and nays of members to be entered on \nthe journal when desired by one-fifth of those members present.\n  The admission of other colonies into the confederation was provided \nfor in article 11 of the Articles of Confederation, while, under the \nConstitution new States may be admitted by Congress into the Union, \nunder Section 3 of article IV.\n  So, you see, we had a good roadmap in the Articles of Confederation, \nwhich went before the U.S. Constitution.\n  Congress was given power under the Articles of Confederation to \nborrow money on the credit of the United States, to build and equip a \nnavy, to agree upon the number of land forces. Under the Constitution, \narticle I, section 8, Congress was given the power to borrow money on \nthe credit of the United States; to raise and support armies; and to \nprovide and maintain a navy.\n  In article XIII of the Articles of Confederation, every state was \nrequired to abide by the determination of Congress, and the Articles of \nConfederation were to be inviolably observed by every state. The \ncounterpart of these provisions is to be found in the U.S. \nConstitution, article VI, paragraph 2, where it is provided that the \nConstitution and the laws of the United States, and all treaties made, \n``shall be the supreme law of the land''; and the judges in every state \nwere to be bound thereby.\n\n[[Page S2921]]\n\n  Article V of the U.S. Constitution provides for amendments to that \ndocument when proposed by two-thirds of both Houses of Congress or upon \nthe application of two-thirds of the state legislatures. Amendments to \nthe Articles of Confederation required approval by the Congress, \nfollowed by confirmation by the legislature of all the states.\n  The Articles set up what amounts to a national court system (article \nIX), but the system functioned only to adjudicate disputes between \nstates, not individuals. Congress could pass no laws directly affecting \nindividuals, and thus the national court had no jurisdiction over \nindividuals. But when Congress was given such power in the 1787 \nConstitution, the notion of dual citizenship was revolutionized. The \ninvention of dual citizenship in the Articles of Confederation, and \nthen the transfer of this concept to the national constitution in \narticle VI, section 2, was the legal basis for the operation of \nfederalism in all of its many manifestations.\n\n  Aside from the narrower grant of power to Congress, and a unicameral \nlegislature in which each state had one vote, the Articles differed \nfrom the U.S. Constitution mainly in placing the court directly under \nCongress and in having the committee of the states (one delegate from \neach state) instead of a single executive. Characteristic of state \nconstitution were a weak executive, often under the sway of a committee \nappointed or elected by the legislature, and a court system directly \nunder the legislature. The Articles of Confederation in these respects \nwas not the result of independent theorizing about the best \ninstitutions. It was a straightforward extension of Whig political \nthought to national government.\n  The Constitution of the United States provided, in article VII, for \nits ratification by the conventions of nine states. The ratification of \nany new Constitution, under the Articles of Confederation, required the \napproval of Congress and the unanimous confirmation by the legislatures \nof all states.\n  The Framers of the U.S. Constitution devised an ingenious way of \ngetting around this insuperable requirement of unanimity by the state \nlegislatures, and we can be thankful for that. Otherwise, we would \nstill be governed by the unworkable Articles of Confederation--if, \nindeed, we had been able to survive as a nation. Ours might have been \nthe balkanized States of America instead of the United States of \nAmerica. This was done by circumventing the legislatures altogether, \nand securing ratification directly by the people in state conventions.\n  Why did the Founders require nine states to ratify the Constitution \nrather than 13 or a majority of seven? Experience, and the likelihood \nthat Rhode Island would not ratify, made unanimity an impractical \nalternative. A simple majority of seven might not have included the \nlarge states, and the new nation would have been crippled from the \nstart. There was, however, considerable experience with a nine-state \nrequirement in the Continental Congress. You see how these Framers \nbenefited by the experience that had gone before them. Nine states \nconstituted a two-thirds majority. Although such a majority was at \ntimes extremely difficult to construct, a provision that satisfied nine \nstates invariably satisfied more than nine. This was a litmus test that \nthe Framers understood, and the two-thirds majority required by the \nArticles led them to adopt a similar requirement for ratifying the \nconstitution.\n\n  Without the Articles of Confederation, the extended republic would \nhave had to be invented out of the writings of Europeans as a rank \nexperiment that a skeptical public would likely not have accepted. On \nthe other hand, Americans had learned that government on a continental \nbasis was possible, in certain respects desirable, and that a stable \neffective national government required more than an extended republic--\nit needed power that could be applied directly to individuals. \nExperience also convinced them that the national government should have \nlimited powers, and that state governments could not be destroyed. \nThere was a logic to experience that no amount of reading and political \ntheory could shake.\n  Providing for an amendment process was one of the most innovative \naspects of both national constitutions. Equally innovative was the \nprovision for admitting new states. History had demonstrated that a \nnation adding new territory almost invariably treated it as conquered \nland, as did the ancient Romans, the Greeks, the Persians, and so on. \nThe founders proposed the future addition, on an equal footing, of new \nstates from territories now sparsely settled, if settled at all. The \nArticles of Confederation is of major historical importance for first \ncontaining this extraordinarily liberal provision, which became part of \nthe U.S. Constitution. It guaranteed the building of an extended \nrepublic.\n  The general impression of the people today is that the Articles of \nConfederation were wholly replaced in 1787, but, in fact, as I have \nshown, much of what was in the Articles showed up in the 1787 \nConstitution. As a matter of fact, few Americans today, relatively \nspeaking, know much if anything about the Articles of Confederation or \nare even aware that such Articles ever existed.\n  But not only did the Framers of the Constitution copy into that \ndocument a great deal of what was contained in the Articles of \nConfederation, but by virtue of the fact that they had lived under the \nArticles for over 6 years, they benefited from the experience gained \nthereby and were thus able to avoid many of the faults and flaws of the \nArticles by including in the Constitution corrective provisions for \nsuch avoidance. In other words, many of the provisions of the U.S. \nConstitution which have worked so well over these 212 years probably \nwould never have been included in the Constitution, or even thought of, \nwithout having had the experience of living under the Articles. It \ncould perhaps better be said that the Framers profited by the mistakes \nor negative experiences of living under the Articles. In other words, \nhindsight provided a 20/20 vision to the Framers.\n  Mr. President, as we examine the roots of our Constitution, how could \nwe avoid taking a look at the British Constitution?\n  What part did the British Constitution play in the formulation of our \nown fundamental organic national document? Perhaps not as much directly \nas did the state constitutions and the Articles of Confederation. Yet, \nindirectly, woven into the experience of living under the colonial \ngovernments and the early state constitutions and the Articles of \nConfederation there were, running throughout, important threads of the \nancient British Constitution that are often overlooked and were \naccepted as a practice in the early colonial documents and state \nconstitutional forms without conscious attribution. Nevertheless, \nconsciously or not, various rudiments of the American system can be \ntraced back to developments that had occurred in England and even as \nfar back as the Anglo-Saxon period which found their way into the \nfabric of American constitutionalism. Let us examine some of these \nantecedents.\n  Many of the principles imbedded in American constitutionalism look \nback to the annals of the motherland for their sources and explanations \nand were carried forward by the political development of many \ngenerations of men.\n  To begin with, our nation was founded by colonists of whom the great \nmajority, let us not forget, were of the English branch of the Teutonic \nrace. For the most part, they were of one blood and their language and \nsocial usages were those of Great Britain. It is where my forebearers \nare from. The same can be said by others here. They brought with them \nto these North American shores the English law itself, and, for a \ncentury or more, they continued in political union with England as \nmembers of one empire, often referring to themselves as ``Englishmen \naway from home'', claiming all of the rights and liberties of British \nsubjects.\n  Read your history. Forget those modern social studies. Go back to the \nhistory. Follow the taproots of our Constitution.\n  Their institutions were mainly of an English nature, and they \npossessed in common with their English brethren a certain stock of \npolitical ideas. For example, a single executive, a legislative branch \nconsisting of two houses--the British House of Lords, and the British \nHouse of Commons--the upper of which\n\n[[Page S2922]]\n\nwas conservative and the lower of which was representative of the \npeople at large. There were also general principles such as trial by \njury, taxation by the elected representatives of the people, and a \nsystem of jurisprudence based upon custom and the precedents of the \nEnglish common law.\n  These liberties and these rights had been wrenched from tyrannical \nmonarchs over centuries at the cost of blood--the blood of Englishmen, \nthe people of the British Isles, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales.\n  The earliest representative legislative assembly ever held in America \nwas convened in 1619 at Jamestown and was composed of 22 \nrepresentatives from several towns and counties. This was the germ of \nhundreds of later local, town, and state assemblies throughout America.\n  It also imitated the British Parliament, with the legislative power \nlodged partly in a Governor who held the place of the sovereign and who \nwas appointed by the British Crown, partly in a council named by a \nBritish trading company, and partly in an assembly composed of \nrepresentatives chosen by the people. Of course, no law was to be \nenforced until it was ratified by the company in England, and returned \nto the colony under that company's seal. Other representative \nlegislative assemblies developed throughout the colonies, and laws were \nallowed to be made as long as such laws were not contrary or repugnant \nto the laws of England. There were, of course, variation in the systems \nof government throughout colonial America, but as we will note in the \nearly state constitutions that were developed in 1776, as has already \nbeen noted, the repetition in many details of the political systems was \nevidence of the unanimity with which the colonies followed a common \nmodel. Of course the power over the purse--we have talked about that \nmany times, and I will just touch upon it here--is the central strand \nin the whole cloth of Anglo-American liberty. Let us engage in a \nkaleidoscopic viewing of the larger mosaic as it was spun on the loom \nof time. Let us trace a few of the Anglo-Saxon and later English \nfootprints that left their indelible imprint on our own constitutional \nsystem. We have too often forgot and it seems to be a fetish these \ndays, that we ought to forget our roots.\n\n  Several developments in the course of British history served as \nguideposts in the formation of the American Constitution. Many of the \nprinciples underlying the British Constitution were the result of \nlessons learned through centuries of strife and conflict between \nEnglish monarchs and the people they ruled. The rights and liberties \nand immunities of Englishmen had been established by men who, like the \nauthors of our Declaration of Independence, were willing to risk their \nlives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor for those rights.\n  The U.S. Constitution was in several ways built upon a foundation \nfrom which the colonies themselves had never really departed but had \nonly adjusted to local needs and conditions and social republican \nforces that were at play in American colonial life.\n  The English Constitution was an unwritten constitution, but it \nincludes many written documents such as Magna Carta (1215), the \nPetition of Right (1628), and the English Bill of Rights (1689), all of \nwhich had some part in influencing the formulation and contents of our \nown Constitution. There were various other English charters, court \ndecisions, and statutes which were components of the English \nconstitutional matrix and which, in one way or another, were reflected \nin our own organic law framed at Philadelphia.\n  Among these great English pillars of liberty, for example, as the \nPresiding Officer knows, were the writ of habeas corpus: ``you shall \nhave the body.'' Habeas corpus was one of the most celebrated of Anglo-\nAmerican judicial procedures and has been called the ``Great Writ of \nLiberty''. The name ``habeas corpus'' derives from the opening words of \nthe ancient English Common law writ that commanded the recipient to \n``have the body'' of the prisoner present at the court, there to be \nsubject to such disposition as the court might order. In Darnel's Case \n(1627), during the struggle for Parliamentary supremacy, if a \ncustodian's return to a writ of habeas corpus asserted that the \nprisoner was held by ``special command'' of the king, the court \naccepted this as sufficient justification. This case precipitated three \nHouse of Commons Resolutions and the Petition of Right, to which \nCharles I--who later lost his head as well as his throne--gave his \nassent, declaring habeas corpus available to examine the underlying \ncause of a detention and, if no legitimate cause be shown, to order the \nprisoner released. But even these actions did not resolve the matter. \nFinally, under Charles II, the habeas corpus act of 1679 guaranteed \nthat no British subject should be imprisoned without being speedily \nbrought to trial, and established habeas corpus as an effective remedy \nto examine the sufficiency of the actual cause for holding a prisoner.\n  Although the Act did not extend to the American colonies, the \nprinciple that the sovereign had to show just cause for detention of an \nindividual was carried across the Atlantic to the colonies and was \nimplicitly incorporated in the federal constitution's Article 1 \nprovision prohibiting suspension of the writ of habeas corpus ``unless \nwhen in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require \nit.''\n  Another English statute that made its imprint on our federal \nconstitution was the Act of Settlement. Until the late 17th century, \nroyal judges held their offices ``during the king's good pleasure.'' \nUnder the Act of Settlement of 1701, however, judges were to hold \noffice for life instead of at the king's pleasure and could be removed \nonly as a result of charges of misconduct proved in Parliament. This \nwas a crucial step in insuring the independence of the American \njudiciary. The Constitutional Convention of 1787 adopted the phrase \n``during good behavior'' in Article 3, to define the tenure of federal \njudges in America.\n  William the Conqueror had brought with him from Normandy the sworn \ninquest, the forerunner of our own grand jury, to which the fifth \namendment of the Constitution refers. According to the Assize of \nClarendon in 1166, Henry II ordered the formation of an accusing or \npresenting jury to be present at each shire court to meet the king's \nitinerant justices. This was a jury of ``12 of the more competent men \nof a hundred and by four of the more competent men of each vill'' who \nwere to be put ``on oath to reply truthfully'' about any man in their \nhundred or vill ``accused or publicly suspected'' of being a murderer, \nrobber, or thief. This accusing jury--like the sworn inquest under \nWilliam I--was the antecedent of our own modern grand jury.\n  Like the presentment jury, the trial jury had Continental origins, \nand by 1164, there was a clear beginning of the use of petit juries in \nCrown proceedings. It was mostly used in the reign of Henry II (1154-\n1189) to determine land claims and claims involving other real \nproperty. By 1275, in the reign of Edward I, it was established that \nthe petit jury of 12 neighbors would try the guilt of an accused. Five \ncenturies later, jury trial in federal criminal cases was required by \nArticle 3 of the United States Constitution, and was repeated in the \nsixth amendment of the U.S. Constitution. My, what a long time--five \ncenturies. The seventh amendment provided for a jury trial in civil \nmatters.\n  The fountainhead of English liberties--those are your liberties and \nmine--was Magna Carta, signed by King John on June 15, 1215, in the \nMeadow of Runnymede on the banks of the Thames, and during the next 200 \nyears, the Magna Carta was reconfirmed 44 times. It is one of the \nenduring symbols of limited government and the rule of law. Consisting \nof 63 clauses, it proclaimed no abstract principles but simply \nredressed wrongs. Simple and direct, it was the language of practical \nmen. Henceforth, no freeman was to be ``arrested, imprisoned, \ndispossessed, outlawed, exiled, or in any way deprived of his standing \n. . . except by the lawful judgment of his equals and according to the \nlaw of the land.'' The phrase ``law of the land'' would become the \nphrase ``due process of law'' in later England and in our own Bill of \nRights.\n  Other provisions also anticipated principles that would likewise be \nreflected five centuries later in the U.S. Constitution. There was \nlanguage, for example, relating to abuses by royal officials in the \nrequisitioning of private\n\n[[Page S2923]]\n\nproperty and thus are the remote ancestor of the requirement of ``just \ncompensation'' in the fifth amendment in our own Bill of Rights. Other \nclauses required that fines be ``in proportion to the seriousness'' of \nthe offense and that fines not be so heavy as to jeopardize one's \nability to make a living--thus planting the seed of the ``excessive \nfines'' prohibition in the American Bill of Rights' 8th amendment.\n  In 1368, more than 600 years ago, more than 400 years before the case \nof Marbury v. Madison (1803), a statute of Edward III commanded that \nMagna Carta ``be holden and kept in all Points; and if there be any \nStatute made to the contrary, it shall be holden for none.''\n  So here was an early germ of the principle contained in the supremacy \nclause of the U.S. Constitution's article VI.\n  Having observed several elements of our own Constitution that have \ntheir roots in English history, let us now look at the English \nbeginnings of some of the liberties and immunities secured to us by the \nAmerican Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. President, I think this might be a good time for me to take a \nbreak, inasmuch as I have something like 8 minutes left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator has 6 minutes \nleft.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at such time as I regain \nthe floor, I be able to continue my prepared statement, and that it be \njoined to the statement that has just preceded my yielding the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. And, since I have 5 remaining minutes, let me say again \nthat what I am doing here is attempting to show that the U.S. \nConstitution is the result of the struggles of men in centuries before \nour own, this last year of the 20th century. Forget what the media \nsays, forget what politicians say, this is not the first year of the \n21st century, nor is it the first year of the third millennium. Anybody \nwho can count, whether they use the old math or the new math, knows \nbetter than that. This is the last year of the 20th century.\n  But I want to show that these liberties, which were assured to us by \nour Federal Constitution, did not just spring up overnight like the \nprophet's gourd at Philadelphia. They had their roots going back \ndecades, centuries--1,000 years or more, and that those roots and those \ndocuments--the Articles of Confederation, the State constitutions, the \ncolonial documents, the covenants--the Mayflower Compact and all of \nthese things--were known by the framers and they were guided in their \nwriting of the Federal Constitution by the experience that had been \ngained by living under the articles, by living in the colonies, and by \nthe lessons taught by the British experience which had come at the \npoint of a sword and through the shedding of blood through many \ncenturies before. This is not just something that sprang up there \nbetween May 25 and September 17, a total of 116 days in 1787.\n  I think it is good for us, as Members of the House and Senate, to \njust stop once in a while and draw back, take a look at the forest, try \nto see the forest and not just the trees, and restudy our history, \nrestudy our roots, and establish ourselves again in the perspective of \nthose Framers and their experiences, and understand that Marshall had \nit right when he said that the Constitution was meant to endure for \nages.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague from \nWest Virginia. For over 25 years, he has been my mentor in the Senate. \nI probably learned more about the Constitution's history and certainly \nthe procedures of the Senate from him than from anything I have read or \nanybody else I have known. He is like my late father, one who reveres \nhistory because history to him is not just a compilation of dates and \nfacts, but it is the roots of what we are and who we are and where we \nwill go.\n  The distinguished Senator from West Virginia has cast well over \n15,000 votes. I know he could tell me exactly how many he has cast, but \nit has been well over 15,000 votes. It is the record. I have been \nprivileged to cast over 10,000 votes, and I appreciate the kind words \nhe said when I cast that 10,000th. But those 10,000 votes, those 15,000 \nvotes, many were in serious matters. Some were in procedural matters. \nMost were on legislation, statutes, laws, amendments--some on treaties. \nBut it is so rare to be actually coming to vote on the issue of a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  As important as all the statutes, all the treaties, even all the \nprocedural matters are--because the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia knows better than anybody else here, a procedural vote often \nis the determining vote--I think he would agree with me that the two \nmost important votes you might cast would be on a declaration of war or \non a constitutional amendment. In many ways, the country may be \naffected more by a constitutional amendment than by a declaration of \nwar.\n  The distinguished Senator from West Virginia, my dear friend, has \ndone the Senate and I think the country a service by saying let us \npause a moment and ask how we got here. Actually, not only how we got \nhere but why we got here. The answers to those two questions reveals \nthat we should not amend the Constitution this way. It does not even \nbegin to reach that article V level of necessity.\n  I thank my friend. I don't wish to embarrass him. I know he has been \nin some discomfort from a procedure on his eye. As one who, for other \nreasons, is very sensitive to that, I know he did this at some \ndiscomfort, but he said something that we should all hear.\n  I thank him and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, before I yield, if I may, before I yield to \nthe distinguished Senator from Minnesota who has already been so very \ngracious and considerate to me, I thank my friend from Vermont. I have \nlearned a lot of lessons from him. We can learn from one another. It is \neasy, very easy if we try.\n  I appreciate his friendship. I appreciate his statesmanship. I am \nvery grateful for his being a stalwart defender of this great \nConstitution and one who has voted, alongside me, in many what I \nconsider to be pretty critical votes that we have cast in this Senate.\n  I close my statement today with these words from Henry Clay:\n\n       The Constitution of the United States was made not merely \n     for the generation that then existed, but for posterity--\n     unlimited, undefined, endless, perpetual posterity.\n\n  Clay made those remarks in a Senate speech on January 29, 1850.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the close of my \nremarks, when I have finally brought them to a close this day, the \nfollowing articles be printed in the Record:\n  A Washington Post editorial of Monday, April 24, titled ``Victims and \nthe Constitution;'' a Washington Post column by George Will titled \n``Tinkering Again;'' an item from the National Journal of April 22 \ntitled ``Victims' Rights: Leave the Constitution Alone,'' by Stuart \nTaylor, Jr.; and an editorial from the New York Times of Saturday, \nApril 3, titled ``Don't Victimize the Constitution.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 24, 2000]\n\n                      Victims and the Constitution\n\n       The Senate is expected soon to take up a victims rights \n     amendment to the Constitution. The laudable goal is to \n     protect the interests of victims of violent crime in \n     proceedings affecting them. But the amendment by Sens. Jon \n     Kyl (R-Ariz.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), now gaining \n     support, threatens both prosecutorial interests and the \n     rights of the accused. It should be rejected.\n       The measure would give victims the right to be notified of \n     any public proceedings arising from the offense against them, \n     to be present at such hearings and to testify when the issues \n     are parole, plea agreements or sentencing. Victims would be \n     notified of the release or escape of a perpetrator or any \n     consideration of executive clemency. They would also be \n     entitled to orders of restitution and to consideration of \n     their interest in speedy trials.\n       Many of these protections already exist in statute. But the \n     rights of victims properly are bounded under the Constitution \n     by the need to guarantee defendants a fair trial. A \n     defendant's right to a fair trial, for example, should not \n     depend on a victim's interest in seeing justice swiftly done. \n     It may sound perverse to elevate the rights of defendants \n     often correctly accused of crimes above those of their \n     victims. But rights of the accused flow out of the fact that \n     the government is seeking to deprive them of liberty--\n\n[[Page S2924]]\n\n     or, in some cases, life. In doing so, it already is \n     representing the interests of their victims in seeing justice \n     done.\n       The Clinton administration backs a constitutional amendment \n     (though it has troubles with the specific language in the \n     current proposal), but it is also worth noting that some \n     prosecutors believe the amendment would hurt law enforcement. \n     Beth Wilkinson, one of the prosecutors in the Oklahoma City \n     bombing case, wrote in these pages last year that ``our \n     prosecution could have been substantially impaired had the \n     constitutional amendment now under consideration been in \n     place.'' The fundamental right of victims is to have \n     government pursue justice on their--and the larger \n     society's--behalf. To interfere with that in the victims' own \n     name would be wrongheaded in the extreme.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 23, 2000]\n\n                            Tinkering Again\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       Congress's constitutional fidgets continue. For the fourth \n     time in 29 days there will be a vote on a constitutional \n     amendment. The House failed to constitutionalize fiscal \n     policy with an amendment to require a balanced budget. The \n     Senate failed to eviscerate the First Amendment by empowering \n     Congress to set ``reasonable limits'' on the funding of \n     political speech. The Senate failed to stop the epidemic of \n     flag burning by an amendment empowering Congress to ban flag \n     desecration. And this week the Senate will vote on an \n     amendment to protect the rights of crime victims.\n       Because many conservatives consider the amendment a \n     corrective for a justice system too tilted toward the rights \n     of the accused, because liberals relish minting new rights \n     and federalizing things, and because no one enjoys voting \n     against victims, the vote is expected to be close. But the \n     amendment is imprudent.\n       The amendment would give victims of violent crimes rights \n     to ``reasonable'' notice of and access to public proceedings \n     pertaining to the crime; to be heard at, or to submit a \n     statement to, proceedings to determine conditional release \n     from custody, plea bargaining, sentencing or hearings \n     pertaining to parole, pardon or commutation of sentence; \n     reasonable notice of, and consideration of victim safety \n     regarding, a release or escape from custody relating to the \n     crime; a trial free from unreasonable delay; restitution from \n     convicted offenders.\n       Were this amendment added to the Constitution, America \n     would need more--a lot more--appellate judges to handle \n     avalanches of litigation, starting with the definition of \n     ``victim.'' For example, how many relatives or loved ones of \n     a murder victim will have victims' rights? Then there are all \n     the requirements of ``reasonableness.'' The Supreme Court--\n     never mind lower courts--has heard more than 100 cases since \n     1961 just about the meaning of the Fourth Amendment's \n     prohibition of ``unreasonable'' searches.\n       What is the meaning of the right to ``consideration'' \n     regarding release of a prisoner? And if victims acquire this \n     amendment's panoply of participatory rights, what becomes of, \n     for example, a victim who is also a witness testifying in the \n     trial, and therefore not entitled to unlimited attendance? \n     What is the right of the victim to object to a plea bargain \n     that a prosecutor might strike with a criminal in order to \n     reach other criminals who are more dangerous to society but \n     are of no interest to the victim?\n       Federalism considerations also argue against this \n     amendment, and not only because it is an unfunded mandate of \n     unknowable cost. States have general police powers. As the \n     Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed, the federal \n     government--never mind its promiscuous federalizing of crimes \n     in recent decades--does not. Thus Roger Pilon, director of \n     the Center for Constitutional Studies at the Cato Institute, \n     says the Victims' Rights Amendment is discordant with ``the \n     very structure and purpose of the Constitution.''\n       Pilon says the Framers' ``guarded'' approach to \n     constitutionalism was to limit government to certain ends and \n     certain ways of pursuing them. Government, they thought, \n     existed to secure natural rights--rights that do not derive \n     from government. Thus the Bill of Rights consists of grand \n     negatives, saying what government may not do. But the \n     Victims' Rights Amendment has, Pilon says, the flavor of \n     certain European constitutions that treat rights not as \n     liberties government must respect but as entitlements \n     government must provide.\n       There should be a powerful predisposition against \n     unnecessary tinkering with the nation's constituting \n     document, reverence for which is diminished by treating it as \n     malleable. And all of the Victims' Rights Amendment's aims \n     can be, and in many cases are being, more appropriately and \n     expeditiously addressed by states, which can fine-tune their \n     experiments with victims' rights more easily than can the \n     federal government after it constitutionalizes those rights.\n       The fact that all 50 states have addressed victims' rights \n     with constitutional amendments or statutes, or both, \n     strengthens the suspicion that the proposed amendment is (as \n     the Equal Rights Amendment would have been) an exercise in \n     using--misusing, actually--the Constitution for the \n     expressive purpose of affirming a sentiment or aspiration. \n     The Constitution would be diminished by treating it as a \n     bulletin board for admirable sentiments and a place to give \n     special dignity to certain social policies. (Remember the \n     jest that libraries used to file the French constitution \n     under periodicals.)\n       The Constitution has been amended just 18 times (counting \n     ratification of the first 10 amendments as a single act) in \n     211 years. The 19th time should not be for the Victims' \n     Rights Amendment. It would be constitutional clutter, \n     unnecessary, and because it would require constant judicial \n     exegesis, a source of vast uncertainty in the administration \n     of justice.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the National Journal, Apr. 22, 2000]\n\n             Victims' Rights: Leave the Constitution Alone\n\n                        (By Stuart Taylor, Jr.)\n\n       Chances are that most Senators have not really read the \n     proposed Victims' Rights Amendment, which is scheduled to \n     come to the floor for the first time on April 25. After all, \n     it's kind of wordy--almost as long as the Constitution's \n     first 10 amendments (the Bill of Rights) combined. And you \n     don't have to go far into it to understand two key points.\n       The first is that a ``no'' vote would open the way for \n     political adversaries to claim that ``Senator So-an-so sold \n     out the rights of crime victims.'' This helps explain why the \n     proposed amendment has a chance of winning the required two-\n     thirds majorities in both the Senate and the House. Sponsored \n     by Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., it has 41 cosponsors (28 \n     Republicans and 13 Democrats), including Dianne Feinstein, D-\n     Calif., and has garnered rhetorical support from President \n     Clinton, Vice President Gore, and Attorney General Janet \n     Reno. (The Justice Department has hedged its endorsement of \n     the fine print because of the deep misgivings of many of its \n     officials.)\n       The second point is that even though the criminal justice \n     system often mistreats victims, this well-intentioned \n     proposal is unnecessary, undemocratic, and at odds with \n     principles of federalism. Unnecessary because victims' groups \n     like Mothers Against Drunk Driving have far more political \n     clout than do accused criminals. Victims' groups can and have \n     used this influence to push their elected officials to \n     augment the victims' rights provisions that every state has \n     already adopted. These include both statutes and (state) \n     constitutional amendments, not to mention federal \n     legislation, such as the Violence Against Women Act. \n     Undemocratic and inconsistent with federalism because this \n     proposal--like others currently in vogue--would shift power \n     from voters and their elected officials (state and federal \n     alike) to unelected federal judges, whose liberal or \n     conservative predilections would often influence how they \n     resolve the amendment's gaping ambiguities.\n       None of this is to deny that many victims--especially in \n     poor and minority communities--are still given short shrift \n     by prosecutors, judges, and parole officials, or that further \n     legislation may be warranted. But would enshrining victims' \n     rights in the Constitution be more effective than enumerating \n     them in ordinary statutes?\n       Consider the proposed amendment's specific provisions. They \n     would guarantee every ``victim of a crime of violence'' the \n     right to be notified of and ``not to be excluded from'' \n     trials and other public proceedings ``relating to the \n     crime,'' as well as the right ``to be heard'' before critical \n     decisions are made on pre-trial release of defendants, \n     acceptance of plea bargains, sentencing, and parole. In \n     addition, courts would be required to consider crime victims' \n     interests in having any trial be ``free from unreasonable \n     delay,'' and to consider their safety ``in determining any \n     conditional release from custody relating to the crime.'' \n     Other provisions would entitle victims to ``reasonable notice \n     of a release or escape from custody relating to the crime'' \n     and ``an order of restitution from the convicted offender.''\n       All very worthy objectives. But rights are enumerated in \n     the Constitution mainly to protect powerless and vulnerable \n     minorities--such as criminal defendants, who face possible \n     loss of their liberty or even loss of life--from abuse by \n     majoritarian governments. Amending the Constitution to \n     promote popular causes is rarely a good idea, and advocates \n     of the proposed Victims' Rights Amendment have failed to \n     identify any legitimate interests of victims that cannot be \n     protected legislatively, or any constitutional rights of \n     defendants that stand in the way.\n       Moreover, to think that putting into the Constitution such \n     benignly vague language as ``free from unreasonable delay'' \n     will have some magical effect--such as cutting through the \n     bureaucratic inertia and resistance that some say have \n     blunted the effect of victims' rights statutes--is both \n     fatuous and belied by our history. And any effort to add \n     enough detail to eliminate ambiguities would distend our \n     fundamental charter into something more like the Code of \n     Federal Regulations.\n       Of course, at some point the objective of promoting \n     victims' rights bumps up against other worthy goals. They \n     include protecting defendants' rights to due process of law \n     and other procedural protections against wrongful conviction, \n     and giving prosecutors discretion to negotiate plea bargains \n     with some defendants when necessary to get evidence against \n     others.\n       If the courts were to construe the proposed amendment so \n     narrowly as to leave such traditional rules and practices \n     undisturbed, it would amount to vain tokenism. If, on the \n     other hand, they were to construe the\n\n[[Page S2925]]\n\n     amendment broadly, it could foment legal confusion; set off \n     torrents of new litigation by and among people claiming to be \n     ``victims'' (a term that the amendment does not define); \n     saddle the legal system with new costs and delays; and even \n     increase the risks that innocent defendants would be \n     convicted, that some of the guilty would escape punishment, \n     and that some victims would be further victimized.\n       The most obvious risks the amendment poses to innocent \n     defendants--and as President Clinton has discovered, we are \n     all potential defendants--have been detailed by the American \n     Civil Liberties Union. Courts could use the amendment to deny \n     defendants and their counsel enough time to gather evidence \n     of innocence before trial. They might also allow all victim-\n     witnesses to be present when other witnesses are on the \n     stand, even when this could compromise the reliability of the \n     victim-witnesses' own testimony. (Current rules often require \n     sequestering witnesses to prevent them from influencing one \n     another's testimony.)\n       The risk of a guilty person's escaping punishment would be \n     enhanced if courts used victims' objections as a basis for \n     blocking prosecutors from entering legitimate plea bargains \n     or for requiring them to justify such plea bargains by \n     disclosing their strategies and any weaknesses in their \n     evidence. Consider, for example, what might have happened \n     to the Justice Department's effort to bring now-convicted \n     Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh to justice if the \n     Victims' Rights Amendment had been in effect in 1995.\n       Hundreds of victims--the injured and the survivors of the \n     168 people who died--could have invoked the amendment. \n     Crucial evidence, provided by a witness named Michael \n     Fortier, which helped convict McVeigh and co-defendant Terry \n     Nichols, might have been unavailable if victims who opposed \n     the prosecution's plea bargain with Fortier had been able to \n     derail it, according to congressional testimony by Beth A. \n     Wilkinson, a member of the prosecution team. Emmett E. Welch, \n     whose daughter Julie was among those killed by McVeigh's \n     bomb, testified at another hearing that ``I was so angry \n     after she was killed that I wanted McVeigh and Nichols killed \n     without a trial. . . . I think victims are too emotionally \n     involved in the case and will not make the best decisions \n     about how to handle the case.''\n       Of course, victims' interests would hardly be served by \n     convicting the innocent or by making it harder to bring the \n     guilty to justice. And some victims could be hurt more \n     directly--for example, battered wives who complain to \n     authorities only to be accused of assault by their \n     victimizers, who can then invoke their own ``victims' \n     rights.''\n       In short, the proposed constitutional amendment would do \n     little or nothing more for crime victims than would ordinary \n     state or federal legislation, and might in some cases be bad \n     for them. That's why even some victims' groups, including the \n     National Network to End Domestic Violence, are against it.\n       Most of us agree, of course, that prosecutors and judges \n     should be nice to crime victims (as they usually are). Most \n     of us also agree that parents should be nice to their \n     children. But would we adopt a constitutional amendment \n     declaring, ``Parents shall be nice to their children''? Or \n     ``Parents shall give their children reasonable notice and an \n     opportunity to be heard before deciding whether and how to \n     punish older children who have pushed them around''? Would we \n     leave it to the courts to define the meaning of terms like \n     reasonable and nice? A ban on spanking, perhaps? A minimum of \n     one candy bar per day? Would we let the courts override all \n     state and federal laws that conflict with their \n     interpretations?\n       We don't need constitutional amendments to embody our broad \n     agreement on such general principles. And we should leave it \n     to the states (and Congress) to detail rules for applying \n     such principles to the messy realities of life, as the states \n     do in laws dealing with child abuse and neglect. Legislatures \n     periodically revise and update such laws--as they revise and \n     update victims' rights laws--to correct unwise judicial \n     interpretations, fix unanticipated problems, resolve \n     troublesome ambiguities, and incorporate evolving social \n     values. It would be far, far harder to revise or update a \n     constitutional amendment.\n       James Madison wrote that the Constitution's cumbersome \n     amendment process was designed for ``great and extraordinary \n     occasions.'' This doesn't come close.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 3, 2000]\n\n                    Don't Victimize the Constitution\n\n       Some bad ideas keep recycling back. The latest version of \n     the so-called ``victims' rights amendment'' to the \n     Constitution, a pandering and potentially disruptive measure, \n     is being readied for a full Senate vote by the end of the \n     month.\n       There is no question that victims of violent crime deserve \n     respect and sympathy in the criminal process, and programs to \n     help them recover from their trauma. But adding this \n     amendment to the nation's bedrock charter could alter the \n     Constitution's delicate balance between accuser and accused, \n     and even end up subverting the victims' main interest--timely \n     and fair prosecution and conviction of their assailants.\n       To protect victims from insensitive treatment as their \n     cases move through the criminal system, the amendment would \n     establish a new constitutional mandate that victims be \n     notified and allowed to participate in prosecutorial \n     decisions and judicial proceedings. There is widespread \n     concern among the defense bar, the law enforcement community \n     and even some victims' rights groups that the amendment would \n     undermine defendants' rights, give rise to litigation that \n     delays trials and interfere with legitimate plea bargain \n     deals and other aspects of prosecutorial discretion. States \n     are already experimenting to find practical ways to address \n     victims' complaints, consistent with the demands on \n     prosecutors and constitutional protections for defendants. To \n     the extend improvements are needed, the answer is to pass \n     laws to fine-tune the system, not clutter the Constitution.\n       The bill's two main sponsors--Senators Jon Kyl, an Arizona \n     Republican, and Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat--have \n     been busily rounding up new co-sponsors. All are supporting \n     an amendment that could inflict unintended consequences on \n     victims, the justice system and the Bill of Rights.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I shall have more to say along this line. I \nshall wait until another date to address this particular amendment that \nis before the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and again thank the Senator from Minnesota and \nthank my friend from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am more than pleased to give the Senator from West \nVirginia a good deal of my time. His words are profoundly important. I \ndo not think there is anybody else in the Senate who can speak on this \nquestion the way Senator Byrd can, and I hope Senators hear him.\n  After hearing Senator Byrd, I am going to be very brief. I do not \nknow what I can add to what has been said by other Senators. The way I \nwant to make my argument in just a couple of minutes, actually, is to \nsay this: Senator Feinstein asked me: Do you need to be down on the \nfloor and is it going to be one of these back-and-forth slugfest \ndebates? I said: No, not at all. I do not have any disrespect for what \nyou and Senator Kyl are doing, two colleagues whom I like; it is just \nthat, for me, I am reluctant to support any constitutional amendments.\n  The bar is very high. It is a high threshold test to me. Even for \nsuch a noble purpose as campaign finance reform, when Senator Hollings \noffered his amendment, I did not vote for it. I did not vote for a \nconstitutional amendment to ban the desecration of the flag. I believe \nthere have to be compelling reasons to vote for a constitutional \namendment, and I do not think my colleagues have made a compelling \ncase.\n  I point out that States have moved forward with their own victims' \nrights legislation or constitutional amendments and, to my knowledge, \ntheir work has not been successfully challenged in the courts. I point \nout that Senators Leahy and Kennedy have legislation that gives victims \nmore rights. They want to do it statutorily.\n  As I see it--and I am not a  lawyer--first we go this route and see \nwhat the States do. We can also say this is a national concern, a \nnational question. Certainly that is my framework. I do not want to be \ninconsistent. First we try it statutorily. We pass our law. If the \nSupreme Court judicial review declares the law to be null and void, \nthen at that point in time we may, indeed, want to come forward and say \nthere is no alternative but to amend the Constitution.\n\n  The Chair will smile but I am conservative about this question, for \nall the reasons Senator Byrd has so ably explained to all of us.\n  The second point I wish to make is a little different, and it is my \nown way of thinking about it. I do believe, if we are going to talk \nabout victims' rights, there is a whole lot I want us to do. I want us \nout here legislating. I made this argument this morning, and I do not \nknow that I need to make it again.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New Mexico for a moment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota. I \nyield a half hour from the time I have under cloture to Senator \nDaschle, the leader on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will withhold, I wonder, \njust from a discussion I have had since I last spoke with him, would \nthe Senator be willing to yield that half hour to the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I so yield the time to the Senator from \nWest Virginia. I thank the Senator from Minnesota and yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S2926]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my second argument is that I want, to \nthe best of my ability, to represent the people in Minnesota, for that \nmatter the people in the country, and I can think of a lot of \nlegislation we could be working on that will give victims more rights.\n  I have legislation I have been trying to get out on the floor which \ndeals with violence against women and children--they are victims--that \nprovides more protection, that can prevent this violence, that can save \nlives. Let's get at it legislatively. I do not say it so much in \nresponse to this effort on the part of my colleagues from California \nand Arizona, but, again what I was saying this morning, I hope soon we \nwill get back to the vitality of the Senate, which is we go at it; we \nhave legislation; we have vehicles; and we have amendments. We bring \nlegislation to the floor, we debate, and we vote up or down. That is \nwhat we are here to do.\n  I say to my colleagues who are concerned about victims' rights, I \nhave legislation I want to bring to the floor that I believe does a \nwhole lot by way of protecting victims, by way of making sure people do \nnot become victims, in particular women and children.\n  My third point is, of course, one of the problems with a \nconstitutional amendment as opposed to a statutory alternative is that \nit is very difficult to undo what is done. There are some questions I \nhave about this effort. A lot of the work I do with my wife Sheila \ndeals with violence directed at women and children, what some call \ndomestic violence. I ask unanimous consent that letters from the \nNational Clearinghouse For The Defense of Battered Women and the \nNational Network to End Domestic Violence be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    National Clearinghouse For The\n\n\n                                     Defense of Battered Women\n\n                                 Philadelphia, PA, April 14, 2000.\n     Senator Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: We are writing to you to express \n     our strong opposition to S.J. Res. 3, the proposed victims' \n     rights amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n       The National Clearinghouse for the Defense of Battered \n     Women has opposed each version of the proposed victims' \n     rights amendments that has been introduced over the past four \n     years. After reviewing S.J. Res. 3, the National \n     Clearinghouse for the Defense of Battered Women stands firm \n     in our opposition. Although the current proposed amendment \n     addresses some of the issues we raised in the past, we \n     continue to have grave concerns about the new proposal and \n     continue to oppose it.\n       We have attached the position paper of the National \n     Clearinghouse for the Defense of Battered Women opposing S.J. \n     Res. 3. We believe that our arguments remain compelling and \n     relevant to the newly proposed amendment.\n       In the interests of ensuring justice for battered women and \n     children, we urge you to vote ``no'' to the amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Sue Osthoff,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Network To End\n\n\n                                            Domestic Violence,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 1999.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: I write to apprise you of our \n     continued opposition to the proposed constitutional amendment \n     to protect the rights of crime victims. After careful review \n     and consideration of S.J. Res. 6, we find that despite some \n     minor changes since the 105th Congress our concerns with this \n     proposed constitutional amendment have not changed.\n       The National Network to end Domestic Violence is a \n     membership organization of state domestic violence coalitions \n     from around the country, representing nearly 2,000 domestic \n     violence programs nationwide. As you may be aware, many of \n     our member coalitions and programs have supported the various \n     state constitutional amendments and statutory enactments \n     similar to the proposed federal constitutional amendment. And \n     yet, we view the proposed federal constitutional amendment as \n     a different proposition, both in kind and in process.\n       For a victim of domestic violence, the prospect of \n     participating in a protracted criminal proceeding against an \n     abusive husband or father of her children is difficult enough \n     without the added burden of an unforgiving system. \n     Prosecutors, police, judges, prison officials and others in \n     the criminal justice system may not understand her fear, may \n     not have provided for her safety, and may be unwilling to \n     hear fully the story of the violence she's experienced and \n     the potential impact on the impending criminal proceeding \n     sentencing and release of the defendant. Each of these \n     potential failures in the system underscore the need for the \n     criminal justice system to pay closer attention to the needs \n     of victims. Unfortunately, S.J. Res. 6 promises much for \n     victims, but guarantees little on which victims can count to \n     address these practicalities.\n       Let me outline some of our concerns.\n       First, if a constitutional right is to mean anything at \n     all, it must be enforceable fully by those whose rights are \n     violated. The proposed amendment expressly precludes any such \n     enforcement rights during a proceeding or against any of \n     those who are charged with securing the constitutional \n     rights. The lack of such an enforcement mechanism is a fatal \n     flaw--a mere gift at the leisure of federal, state and local \n     authorities.\n       Secondly, the majority of the existing similar state \n     statutes and constitutional amendments have been on the books \n     fewer than 10 years. Thus, given our very limited experience \n     with their implementation, it will be many years before we \n     have sufficient knowledge to craft a federal amendment that \n     will maintain the delicate balance of constitutional rights \n     that ensure fairness in our judicial process. Without \n     benefiting from the state experience, we run the risk of \n     harming victims. We must explore adequately the effectiveness \n     of such laws and the nuances of the various provisions before \n     changing the federal constitution. State constitutions are \n     different--they are more fluid, more amenable to adjustments \n     if we need to ``fix'' things. A change in the federal \n     constitution would allow no such flexibility, thus \n     potentially harming victims by leaving no way to turn back.\n       And, lastly preserving constitutional protections for \n     defendants, ultimately protects victims. This is especially \n     true for domestic violence victims. The distinctions between \n     defendant and victim are sometimes blurred by circumstance. \n     For a battered woman who finds herself thrust into the \n     criminal justice system for defending herself or having been \n     coerced into crime by her abuser, a justice system that \n     fairly guarantees rights for a defendant may be the only \n     protection she has. Her ultimate safety may be jeopardized in \n     a system of inadequate or uneven protections for criminal \n     defendants, as is likely with the enactment of S.J. Res. 6.\n       Chairman Hatch, these are concerns that compel us to \n     exercise restraint before proceeding with a constitutional \n     amendment. As you know, in this country each year, too many \n     fall victim to violent crime. These crimes cause death and \n     bodily injury, leaving countless victims--women, men, boys \n     and girls--to pick up the pieces. Tragically, the criminal \n     justice system is less a partner and more an obstacle to the \n     crime victim's ability to attain justice. A constitutional \n     amendment is not the answer for this problem. But, improving \n     policies, practices, procedures and training in the system \n     would help tremendously.\n       Like you, we are committed to ensuring safety for domestic \n     violence victims through strong criminal justice system \n     enforcement and critical services for victims. However, the \n     resources that must be invested into the process of passing \n     such an amendment and getting it ratified by the states could \n     be better invested in training and education of our \n     judiciary, prosecutors, police, parole boards and others who \n     encounter victims and in changing the regulations and \n     procedures that most adversely impact victims. For those of \n     us working in the field of domestic violence, we know the \n     harm that can be caused directly to victims when policies are \n     pushed without some experience to know whether they will \n     work. And, while this may seem an inconsequential concern, \n     for a battered woman whose safety may be jeopardized by such \n     swift but uncertain action, the difference may be her life.\n       Please understand that our opposition to S.J. Res. 6 is not \n     opposition to working through the traditional legislative \n     channels to deliberate these issues and to support \n     legislative changes that will allow us to explore various \n     ways in which we can provide victims the voice they deserve \n     in the criminal justice system.\n       Thank you for your consideration. If you have additional \n     questions, please do not hesitate to be in touch with me at \n     202/543-5566. We have appreciated your leadership on issues \n     concerning domestic violence over the years and look forward \n     to continuing to work with you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Donna F. Edwards,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there is a tremendous amount of concern \nthat what will happen is that batterers--and it is happening all too \noften right now--can accuse those whom they have battered as being the \nbatterers, basically saying they are the victims, which then, in turn, \ntriggers all sorts of rights that are in this amendment.\n  There is tremendous concern, and I will not read through all of it, \nwhen it comes to a particular part of the population--women and \nchildren who are, unfortunately, the victims of this violence in the \nhomes--that, in fact, this constitutional amendment will have precisely \nthe opposite effect that is intended, especially when it comes to\n\n[[Page S2927]]\n\nprotection for women and children; it will lessen that protection for \nwomen and children.\n  I quote from the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund:\n\n       While many women are victims of violent crime, women are \n     also criminal defendants. Self-defense cases, dual arrest \n     situations, or the abuse of mandatory arrest and mandatory \n     prosecution policies by batterers who allege abuse by the \n     victim, exemplify contexts in which women victimized by \n     violence may need the vital constitutional protections \n     afforded defendants.\n\n  There is a whole question of how this gets implemented, what happens \nto these women and children. Given the fact this is a big part of my \nwork in the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that this NOW Legal Defense \nFund position paper be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             NOW Legal Defense and\n\n\n                                               Education Fund,\n\n                                        New York, NY, April, 2000.\n\n        Position Statement on Proposed Victims' Rights Amendment\n\n       Legislators in the 106th Congress plan to introduce a \n     proposal to amend the U.S. Constitution by adding a \n     ``Victims' Rights Amendment.'' Because NOW Legal Defense and \n     Education Fund (NOW LDEF) chairs the National Task Force on \n     Violence Against Women, and, as an organization that works \n     extensively on behalf of women who are victims of violent \n     crime, including our fight against domestic violence, sexual \n     assault, and all forms of gender-based violence, we have been \n     asked to analyze this proposal.\n       NOW LDEF agrees with sponsors of victims' rights \n     legislative initiatives that many survivors of violent crime \n     suffer additional victimization by the criminal justice \n     system. We appreciate the injustices and the physical and \n     emotional devastation that drives the initiative for \n     constitutional protection. Nonetheless, we do not agree that \n     amending the federal Constitution is the best strategy for \n     improving the experience of victims as they proceed through \n     the criminal prosecution and trial against an accused \n     perpetrator. Any such amendment raises concerns that outweigh \n     its benefits. After considering the potential benefits and \n     hardships, and particularly considering the circumstances of \n     women who are criminal defendants, NOW LDEF cannot endorse a \n     federal constitutional amendment elevating the legal rights \n     of victims to those currently afforded the accused. However, \n     we fully endorse companion efforts to improve the criminal \n     justice system, including initiatives to ensure consistent \n     enforcement of existing federal and state laws, and enactment \n     and enforcement of additional statutory reform that provide \n     important protections for women victimized by gender-based \n     violence.\n     The need to improve the criminal justice system's response to \n         women victimized by violence\n       It is true that survivors of violence often are pushed to \n     the side by the criminal justice system. They may not be \n     informed when judicial proceedings are taking place or told \n     how the system will work. Although many jurisdictions are \n     working on improving their interactions with victims, many \n     victims still experience the judicial system as an ordeal to \n     be endured, or as a forum from which they are excluded. They \n     often experience a loss of control that exacerbates the \n     psychological impact of the crime itself. Certainly women \n     victimized by violence face the persistent gender bias in our \n     criminal justice system, which includes courts and \n     prosecutors that fail to prosecute sexual assault, domestic \n     violence, and other forms of violence against women as \n     vigorously as other crimes. All too often, criminal justice \n     officials blame the victims for ``asking for it'' or for \n     failing to fight back or leave. these negative experiences \n     make it more difficult for women victimized by violence to \n     recover from the trauma and may contribute to reduced \n     reporting and prosecution of violent crimes against women.\n       As amendment proponents have stressed, increased efforts to \n     promote victims' rights potentially could have a strong and \n     positive impact on women who are victims of crime. The entire \n     public relations and educational campaign mounted on behalf \n     of the amendment can be very informative. Criminal justice \n     system reform can give victims a greater voice in criminal \n     justice proceedings and could increase their control over the \n     impact of the crime on their lives. For example, notice of \n     and participation in court proceedings, including the ability \n     to choose to be present and express their views at \n     sentencing, could be psychologically healing for victims.\n       More timely information about release or escape and \n     reasonable measures to protect the victim from future \n     stalking and violence could improve women's safety. Women \n     could benefit economically from restitution. Nevertheless, \n     because statutory protections and state constitutional \n     provisions already may provide some or all of these \n     improvements, because additional statutory and state-level \n     reform can be enacted, and because no reform will be \n     effective absent strict enforcement, we do not support a \n     federal constitutional amendment to address the problems \n     facing women crime victims.\n     Why a Federal Victims' Rights constitutional amendment is \n         problematic\n       Supporters of a federal victim's rights constitutional \n     amendment begin with the fundamental premise that survivors \n     of violence deserve the same protections that our judicial \n     system affords to an accused perpetrator, and that their \n     interests merit equal weight in the eyes of the state. They \n     urge amending the U.S. Constitution to balance treatment of \n     victims and defendants, positing that other protections, \n     whether granted by statute, or implemented through policy, \n     custom, training or education, could be limited at some point \n     by the rights guaranteed to defendants under the Fourth, \n     Fifth, Sixth and Eighth Amendments to the federal \n     Constitution. However, adding constitutional protections that \n     could offset the fundamental constitutional protections \n     afforded defendants marks a radical break with over two \n     hundred years of law and tradition carefully balancing the \n     rights of criminal defendants against the exercise of state \n     and federal power against them.\\1\\ It is our belief that the \n     proposed reforms can be afforded under statutes and state \n     constitutions. The constitutional amendment proposal contains \n     complex requirements that are far better suited for statutory \n     reform.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of statement.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The position of a survivor of violence can never be deemed \n     legally equivalent to the position of an individual accused \n     of a crime.\\2\\ The accused--who must be presumed innocent, \n     and may in fact be innocent--is at the mercy of the \n     government, and faces losing her liberty, property, or even \n     her life as a consequence. While the crime victim may have \n     suffered grievous losses, she, unlike the defendant, is not \n     subject to state control and authority. A victims' rights \n     constitutional amendment could undercut the constitutional \n     presumption of innocence by naming and protecting the victim \n     as such before the defendant is found guilty of committing \n     the crime. Amendment proposals leave undefined numerous \n     questions ranging from the definition of a ``victim'' to \n     whether victims would be afforded a right to counsel, or how \n     victims' proposed right to a speedy trial would be balanced \n     against defendants' due process rights. Proposals also inject \n     an additional party (the victim and her attorney), to the \n     proceedings against a defendant as a matter of right, \n     increasing the power of the state and potentially diminishing \n     the rights of the accused, particularly in the eyes of a \n     jury.\n       The demonstrated existing inequalities of race and class in \n     the modern American criminal justice system only increase the \n     importance of defendants' guaranteed rights. Affording \n     alleged and actual crime victims a constitutional right to \n     participate in criminal proceedings could provide a basis for \n     challenge to those bedrock principles that assure justice and \n     liberty for all citizens.\n       While many women are victims of violent crime, women are \n     also criminal defendants. Self-defense cases, dual arrest \n     situations, or the abuse of mandatory arrest and mandatory \n     prosecution policies by batterers who allege abuse by the \n     victim, exemplify contexts in which women victimized by \n     violence may need the vital constitutional protections \n     afforded defendants. These cases highlight the need for \n     constitutional protection for criminal defendants belonging \n     to groups historically subject to discrimination.\n     Proposed alternatives to address the needs of women \n         victimized by violence\n       NOW LDEF supports efforts to improve the experience of \n     victims in the criminal justice process. Many statutes and \n     state constitutions already contain the reforms contained in \n     amendment proposals. Additional mechanisms for change include \n     enhanced implementation and enforcement of existing state and \n     federal legislation, enacting new statutory protections, \n     increased training for judicial, prosecutorial, probation, \n     parole and police personnel, and improved services for \n     victims such as the more widespread use of victim-witness \n     advocates. Funding available under the Violence Against Women \n     Act can continue to be directed to crucial training and \n     victims' services efforts. Additional statutory reform and \n     funding for program implementation, particularly targeted to \n     eliminate gender bias in all aspects of the criminal justice \n     system can go a long way toward assisting women who have \n     survived crimes of violence.\n       Statutory reform requiring prosecutors and other criminal \n     justice system officials to take such measures as requiring \n     timely notice to victims of court proceedings are modest and \n     relatively inexpensive steps that would have a great impact. \n     We must work to provide better protection for victims--\n     through consistent enforcement of restraining orders, and by \n     training law enforcement officials and judges about rape, \n     battering and stalking, so that arrest and release decisions \n     accurately reflect the potential harm the defendant poses. \n     NOW LDEF hopes the attention drawn to this issue will promote \n     greater dialogue about the problems that victims face in the \n     criminal justice system, and will increase the criminal \n     justice system's responsiveness to women victimized by \n     gender-motivated violence.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Reported litigation under state constitutional amendments \n     is limited, but illustrates the potential conflicts in \n     balancing the rights of victims and the rights of the \n     defendants. While in some cases the victim's state rights did \n     not infringe on the defendant's federal rights, see, e.g., \n     Bellamy v. State of Florida, 594 S.2d 337, 338 (Fla. App. 1st \n     Dep't 1992) (mere\n\n[[Page S2928]]\n\n     presence of the victim in the courtroom in a sexual battery \n     case would not prejudice the jury against the defendant), in \n     others the defendant's federal rights took primacy. See. \n     e.g., State of New Mexico v. Gonzales, 912 P.2d 297, 300 \n     (N.M. App. 1996) (sexual assault victim's rights to fairness, \n     dignity and privacy under state amendment did not allow her \n     to prevent disclosure of medical records to defendant); State \n     of Arizona ex rel Romely v. Superior Court, 836 P.2d 445, 449 \n     (Ct. App. Ariz. 1992) (despite victim's right to refuse \n     deposition in this case where defendant claimed she stabbed \n     her husband in self-defense, she would be unable to present a \n     sufficient defense without the deposition and thus she could \n     force him to be deposed).\n     \\2\\ It may be less legally problematic to recognize the \n     interests of victims by affording them a voice at sentencing \n     or at another post-trial proceeding, after a defendant's \n     guilt has been determined.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their effort. \nAgain, the threshold has to be very high. I speak in opposition.\n  With the indulgence of my colleagues, since I have been out here for \na good period of time, I ask unanimous consent that I may have 5 more \nminutes for morning business to cover two matters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wellstone pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2465 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I yield 30 minutes of my time to the Democratic leader, \nSenator Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to correct the Record with \nrespect to the effectiveness of the Victims Rights Clarification Act of \n1997.\n  In the course of this debate on this proposed constitutional \namendment, the two principal sponsors of this constitutional amendment, \nmy friends Senator Kyl and Senator Feinstein, have spoken at some \nlength about the Oklahoma City bombing cases. They have repeatedly \ncited that case as evidence that Federal statutes are not adequate for \nprotecting crime victims, and that nothing but a constitutional \namendment will do the trick.\n  They have said that ``the Oklahoma City case provides a compelling \nillustration of why a constitutional amendment is necessary to fully \nprotect victims' rights in this country'' and that the case shows ``why \na statute won't work.''\n  I have a very different take on the lessons to be learned from the \nOklahoma City bombing cases. In my view, what happened in that case is \na textbook example of how statutes can and do work, and why the \nproposed constitutional amendment is wholly unnecessary.\n  For many years, the proponents of this amendment have pointed to one \nparticular ruling to support their cause. On June 26, 1996, during the \nfirst Oklahoma City bombing case, the Timothy McVeigh case, the trial \njudge, Chief Judge Richard Matsch, issued what I and many other \nSenators thought was a bizarre pretrial order. He held that any victim \nwho wanted to testify at the penalty hearing, assuming McVeigh was \nconvicted, would be excluded from all pretrial proceedings and from the \ntrial. Judge Matsch's reasoning, as I understand it, was that victims' \ntestimony at sentencing would be improperly influenced by their \nwitnessing the trial.\n  The U.S. Attorneys who were prosecuting the case promptly consulted \nwith the victims and concluded that Judge Matsch's ruling failed to \ntreat the victims fairly, so they moved for reconsideration. But Judge \nMatsch denied the U.S. Attorneys' motion and reaffirmed his ruling on \nOctober 4, 1996.\n  As I mentioned, I, like the prosecutors, thought that Judge Matsch's \norder was wrong. I did not believe that anything in the Constitution or \nin Federal law required victims to make the painful choice between \nwatching a trial and providing victim impact testimony.\n  The issue during the trial phase is whether the defendant committed \nthe crime. The issue on which victims testify at the sentencing is what \nthe effects of the crime have been. There is nothing that I know of, in \ncommon sense or in American law, that suggests that allowing a mother \nwho has lost her child to hear the evidence of how her child was \nmurdered would somehow taint the mother's testimony about the \ndevastating effects of the murder on her and her family's lives.\n  So on March 14, 1997, I joined Senator Nickles, Senator Inhofe, \nSenator Hatch, and Senator Grassley in introducing the Victims Rights \nClarification Act of 1997. This legislation clarified that a court \nshall not exclude a victim from witnessing a trial on the basis that \nthe victim may, during the sentencing phase of the proceedings, make a \nstatement or present information in relation to the sentence. This \nlegislation also specified that a court shall not prohibit a victim \nfrom making a statement or presenting information in relation to the \nsentence during the sentencing phase of the proceedings solely because \nthe victim has witnessed the trial.\n  In addition, and just as importantly, the Victims Rights \nClarification Act preserved a judge's discretion to exclude a victim's \ntestimony during the sentencing phase if the victim's testimony would \nunfairly prejudice the jury. It allowed for a judge to exclude a victim \nif he found a basis--independent of the sole fact that the victim \nwitnessed the trial--that the victim's testimony during the sentencing \nphase would create unfair prejudice.\n  My cosponsors and I worked together to pass the Victims Rights \nClarification Act within a timeframe that could benefit the victims in \nthe Oklahoma City bombing case. The Senate passed this bill by \nunanimous consent on March 18, 1997, and President Clinton signed it \ninto law the very next day. I am very proud of how we worked together, \nRepublicans and Democrats, the Senate and the House, the Congress and \nthe President, to pass the Victims Rights Clarification Act in record \ntime, and I believe that its speedy passage speaks volumes about our \nshared commitment to victims' rights.\n  More important for this debate than how fast Congress acted, however, \nis how fast Judge Matsch responded. One week after the President signed \nthe Victims Rights Clarification Act, Judge Matsch reversed his \npretrial order and permitted victims to watch the trial, even if they \nwere potential penalty phase victim impact witnesses. In other words, \nJudge Matsch did what the statute told him to do. Not one victim was \nprevented from testifying at Timothy McVeigh's sentencing hearing on \nthe ground that he or she had observed part of the trial.\n  Senator Kyl has said that the statute did not work; he suggested that \nwe are now stuck with a judicial precedent that somehow prevents \nvictims from sitting in the courtroom during a trial. Sen. Feinstein \nhas said that the Victim Rights Clarification Act is ``for practical \npurposes a nullity.'' It's just not true.\n  Beth Wilkinson, a member of the Government team that successfully \nprosecuted Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, told our Committee how \nwell the Victim Rights Clarification Act worked. I can do no better \nthan to quote her words, because she was there, in the trenches; she \ndevoted 2\\1/2\\ years of her life to obtaining justice for the victims \nof the Oklahoma City bombing. Here is what Ms. Wilkinson, one of the \nlead prosecutors in the case, told the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       What happened in [the McVeigh] case was once you all passed \n     the statute, the judge said that the victims could sit in, \n     but they may have to undergo a voir dire process to determine \n     . . . whether their testimony would have been impacted . . . \n     I am proud to report to you that every single one of those \n     witnesses who decided to sit through the trial . . . survived \n     the voir dire, and not only survived, but I think changed the \n     judge's opinion on the idea that any victim impact testimony \n     would be changed by sitting through the trial. . . . [T]he \n     witnesses underwent the voir dire and testified during the \n     penalty phase for Mr. McVeigh.\n\n  Ms. Wilkinson went on to say:\n\n       It worked in that case, but it worked even better in the \n     next case. Just 3 months later when we tried the case against \n     Terry Nichols, every single victim who wanted to watch the \n     trial either in Denver or through closed-circuit television \n     proceedings that were provided also by statute by this \n     Congress, were permitted to sit and watch the trial and \n     testify against Mr. Nichols in the penalty phase.\n       That operated smoothly. The defendant had no objection, and \n     the judge allowed every one of those witnesses to testify \n     without even undergoing a voir dire process in the second \n     trial. . . .\n       I think that proves . . . [that] you do not want to amend \n     the Constitution if there are\n\n[[Page S2929]]\n\n     some statutory alternatives. And I saw the Victim Rights \n     Clarification Act work. Within a year of passage, it had been \n     tried two times and I believe by the second time it had \n     operated smoothly and rectified an interest and a right that \n     I think the victims were entitled to that had not been \n     recognized until passage of that statute.\n\n  Senator Feinstein said that Judge Matsch ``ignored'' the Victim \nRights Clarification Act. But Ms. Wilkinson was there, and she says the \njudge did not ignore the statute, he did apply it, and that any initial \nuncertainty about the constitutionality of the statute was resolved in \nthe McVeigh case, and not a problem in the second trial, against Terry \nNichols. In addition, I am unaware of any subsequent case in which the \nVictim Rights Clarification Act has been less than fully effective.\n  I hope this lays to rest, once and for all, the repeated assertions \nof the proponents of this constitutional amendment that the Oklahoma \nCity bombing cases proved that victims cannot be protected by ordinary \nlegislation. There was one very unfortunate ruling that went against \nvictims' rights at the start of the McVeigh case. That ruling was \npromptly opposed by prosecutors, swiftly corrected by Congress in the \nVictims Rights Clarification Act, and duly reversed by the trial judge \nhimself before the trial began. The Victims Rights Clarification Act is \nworking.\n  After Ms. Wilkinson testified before the Committee, I asked one of \nour other witnesses, Professor Paul Cassell, to comment on what Ms. \nWilkinson had said about the Victims Rights Clarification Act. \nProfessor Cassell represented some of the victims of the Oklahoma City \nbombing, and he advised Senators in connection with the formulation of \nthat legislation.\n  Knowing that Professor Cassell is now one of the leading advocates of \nthe proposed victims' rights amendment, I wanted to give him an \nopportunity to explain what he thought the proposed constitutional \namendment would have provided the Oklahoma City bombing victims that \nthe Victims Rights Clarification Act did not provide.\n  The only thing that Professor Cassell could think of was that the \namendment would have given the victims ``standing''. In other words, in \naddition to enabling the victims to watch the trial and testify at the \nsentencing hearing, which the statute admittedly accomplished, the \namendment would have entitled Paul Cassell and other lawyers for the \nvictims, and the victims themselves, to demand additional hearings and \nto argue before Judge Matsch.\n  If standing is the only thing that was missing in the Victims Rights \nClarification Act, then we have to ask ourselves two things. First, \nassuming that we want to provide standing for victims and their lawyers \nto make legal arguments as well as to testify in criminal cases, do we \nneed a constitutional amendment to achieve that? None of the sponsors \nof the constitutional amendment have explained why that could not be \ndone by statute.\n  Second, and more importantly, do we really want to give standing to \nvictims and their lawyers, and allow them to raise claims and challenge \nrulings during the course of a criminal case?\n  Remember, we are not arguing about whether victims are entitled to \nattend the trial, whether they are entitled to testify, or whether they \nare entitled to restitution. Of course they should be, and they already \nare in most States. The ``standing'' question is a procedural one, \nabout whether victims' rights and the interests of an efficient and \neffective criminal justice system are best protected by allowing \nprosecutors to run the prosecution, or by bringing in teams of \nplaintiffs' lawyers--or, I guess, they would now be called victims' \nlawyers--to argue over how the case should be conducted.\n  I am committed to giving victims real and enforceable rights. But I \nam not convinced that prosecutors are so incapable of protecting those \nrights, once we make them clear, that every victim needs to get their \nown trial lawyer. Indeed, from my own experience as a prosecutor, and \nfrom what I have seen of Ms. Wilkinson and the dedicated team that \nprosecuted the Oklahoma City cases, I am confident that prosecutors \nhave victims' interests at heart.\n  Senators Kyl and Feinstein mentioned that some of the victims of the \nOklahoma City tragedy support their proposed constitutional amendment. \nI think the point needs to be made that some of those victims do not \nsupport the amendment. They were satisfied with the way that Ms. \nWilkinson and her colleagues handled the case, and pleased and relieved \nwith the results they achieved.\n  One of the victims even testified before Congress in opposition to \nthis proposed amendment. Emmett E. Walsh, who lost his daughter in the \nbombing, told the House Judiciary Committee the following:\n\n       I know that many people believe that a constitutional \n     amendment is something that crime victims want. However, I \n     want you to know that as a crime victim, I do not want the \n     Constitution amended. . . . I believe that if this \n     constitutional amendment had been in place it would have \n     harmed, rather than helped, the prosecution of the Oklahoma \n     City Bombing case.\n\n  In the Timothy McVeigh case, the trial judge got the law of victims' \nrights wrong in an initial pretrial ruling. Through the normal \nlegislative process, we fixed the problem before the trial began. What \nthat history shows is not that statutes don't work; it shows precisely \nwhy they do. If we got the law of victims' rights wrong in a \nconstitutional amendment, or the Supreme Court interpreted a \nconstitutional victims' rights amendment wrongly, a solution would not \ncome so swiftly. That is why Congress should be slow to \nconstitutionalize new procedural rights that can be provided by \nstatute.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nof the rights of crime victims and of all Americans. In the last few \nyears, Congress has passed laws to increase the rights of crime victims \nand their families. Congress has provided crime victims the right to \nattend and to speak at court proceedings, the right to be notified of a \ncriminal's parole or escape, and the right to receive restitution.\n  Congress has been able to expand victims' rights by doing what we do \noften--pass laws. Today, we are asked to do something we do very \nrarely--to amend the United States Constitution.\n  I support crime victims. I want to expand their protections, but I \ndon't believe that amending the Constitution is the best way to do it. \nAs the examples I mentioned have shown, we can expand and clarify \nvictims' rights significantly--without tampering with the Constitution. \nA constitutional amendment is not necessary to help crime victims.\n  Any time we think about changing the Constitution, we must consider \nthe words of James Madison, its principal author. Madison explained \nthat amending the Constitution should only be reserved for ``certain \ngreat and extraordinary occasions,'' when no other alternatives are \navailable.\n  Despite all the changes in our country over the last 213 years, we've \nonly amended the Constitution on 27 occasions, 10 of which were the \nBill of Rights. Most of these constitutional amendments were passed to \nreflect fundamental changes in the attitudes of Americans such as \nensuring the rights of minorities and the right of women to vote.\n  This is not a ``great and extraordinary occasion.'' In the last 20 \nyears, we in Congress and the states have done a good job of ensuring \nbetter and more comprehensive rights and services for crime victims. \nThere are more than 30,000 laws nationwide that define and protect \nvictims' rights. There are tens of thousands of organizations that \nprovide assistance to people who have been victims of crime.\n  Thirty-two States have passed constitutional amendments in their own \nstate constitutions to protect the rights of crime victims. My own home \nState of Washington has both laws on the books and provisions in our \nstate constitution that provide crime victims and their families the \nright to attend trial, the right to be informed of court proceedings, \nthe right to make a statement at sentencing or any proceeding where the \ndefendant's release is considered, and the right to enter an order of \nrestitution. There is no evidence that the laws in my state and others \nlike it are failing to protect victims.\n  Not only is this not a ``great and extraordinary occasion,'' but this \namendment could actually erode the rights of Americans rather than \nexpand on them. Defendants in criminal proceedings in this country are \npresumed to be innocent. This amendment would\n\n[[Page S2930]]\n\ngive victims and their families the right to be heard at all critical \nstages of the trial. This amendment could allow victims to sway the \ntrial against a defendant before they have been convicted, thus \nseriously compromising the presumption of innocence.\n  The amendment could also compromise a defendant's right to a fair \ntrial. Judges have enormous discretion in determining which witnesses \nshould be able to attend the proceedings in their courtroom. Many \ntimes, a witness' testimony could be compromised if that witness hears \nthe testimony of others. For example, if the victim is allowed to hear \nthe testimony of the defendant, the victim could change his or her \ntestimony based on what the defendant said. Even worse, if a victim \nattends the testimony of the accused, the trauma or intimidation they \nexperience could damage their subsequent testimony.\n  The judge should have discretion over who can be excluded from the \ncourtroom at particular stages of the trial to ensure that the \ndefendant has a fair trial. This amendment would give victims the right \nto attend the entire criminal trial regardless of whether the judge \nbelieves their presence could taint the fairness of the proceeding. \nJudges help ensure that defendants have a fair trial. This amendment \nwould jeopardize that protection.\n\n  The amendment could also affect defendants and the prosecutors' \nability to present their case. The amendment would give victims a right \nto intervene and assert a constitutional right for a faster disposition \nof the matter. In many cases, the defendants and prosecutors need time \nto develop their arguments. This amendment could force a premature \nconclusion to cases that may require additional deliberation.\n  In some cases, the victims are actually defendants. This happens many \ntimes in domestic violence cases when the abused victims finally defend \nthemselves from their attacker. In these cases, the abuser could \nactually be granted special rights that could place a domestic violence \nvictim at greater risk. Why should the abuser get special rights? This \nis one reason why many domestic violence victims' advocates oppose this \namendment.\n  Finally, the proposed victims' rights amendment could hurt effective \nprosecutions and would place enormous burdens on the criminal justice \nsystem. The amendment gives victims the right to be notified and to \ncomment on negotiated pleas or sentences. More than 90 percent of all \ncriminal cases do not go to trial but are resolved through negotiation. \nGiving victims a right to obstruct plea agreements could backfire by \nrequiring prosecutors to disclose weaknesses in their case. It could \nalso compromise the ability of a prosecutor to gain the cooperation of \none defendant to improve the chance of convincing others. In the end, \nguilty defendants could better present their case if they are privy to \nstrategy and details of the prosecutions' case. The rights of \nnotification could also result in large burdens on the criminal justice \nsystem, compromising resources to effectively prosecute criminals.\n  An amendment to the Constitution is not the right approach. We should \ncontinue to do the things that have worked in the past without taking \nthis drastic step. Current State and Federal laws give victims \nextensive rights at trial.\n  For these reasons, I have cosponsored a proposal by Senators Leahy \nand Kennedy. This statutory change would give crime victims the right \nto be heard and be notified of proceedings and the right to a speedy \ntrial. It would also enhance participatory rights at trial and do other \nthings to give victims and their families a greater ability to get \ninvolved in the prosecution of the criminals that harmed them. All of \nthese rights would be subject to the judge's discretion. We in Congress \nshould not be in the business of telling judges how to balance the \nrights of the accused and those of the victims.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Leahy/Kennedy compromise and \nreject the constitutional amendment that may do more to compromise the \nrights of Americans rather than expand them.\n  Before, I close, I want to make one final point. If we really want to \ndo something for crime victims, we should reauthorize the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, VAWA, which expires this year. If we do not act, we \njeopardize funding and we miss a vital opportunity to strengthen this \nhistoric act.\n  Even using conservative estimates, one million women every year are \nvictims of violent crimes by an intimate partner. We know that one in \nthree women can expect to be the victim of a violent crime at some \npoint in her life. The chance of being victimized by an intimate \npartner is ten times greater for a woman than for a man. Domestic \nviolence is statistically consistent across racial and ethnic lines--it \ndoes not discriminate based on race or economic status. Eighty-eight \npercent of victims of domestic violence fatalities had a documented \nhistory of physical abuse and 44 percent of victims of intimate \nhomicide had prior threats by the killer to kill the victim or self. \nThese are frightening statistics and show us that violence against \nwomen is a real threat. How will a Constitutional amendment prevent \nthese crimes or even provide safety and support to the victims?\n  VAWA changed the entire culture of violence against women and \nempowered communities to respond to this devastating plague. Since 1995 \nwe have provided close to $1.8 billion to address violence against \nwomen. VAWA funding supports well over 1,000 battered women shelters in \nthis country. The National Domestic Violence Hotline enacted as part of \nVAWA, fielded 73,540 calls in 1996 alone, and in 1998 the hotline \nfielded 109,339 calls. We have many success stories and we know what \nworks.\n  There is no reason to delay reauthorization. We still have so much \nmore to do. We know the demand for services and assistance for victims \nis only increasing. As a result of more outreach and education, women \nno longer feel trapped in violent homes or relationships. Domestic \nviolence is no longer simply a family problem but a public health \nthreat to the community. While we have seen an explosion in funding for \nbattered women's shelters, we also know that hundreds of women and \nchildren are still turned away from overcrowded shelters. We have heard \nreports that individual states had to turn away anywhere from 5,000 to \n15,000 women and children in just one year. I know that limited safe \nshelter space is a growing problem in Washington state. What can we do \nfor these victims? What rights do they have? The reauthorized \nlegislation, S. 51, provides much greater hope to these victims than \neven federal and state laws to protect the rights of victims in the \ncourt process. The bill currently has 47 cosponsors.\n  If we are concerned about victims and the rights of victims we should \nbe acting to reauthorize and strengthen VAWA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/26/senate-section/article/S2930-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2930-S2931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SUPPORTING THE CAPITOL HILL POLICE OFFICERS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have decided now to start speaking \nabout this subject again on the floor of the Senate. I think I will \ndevote only 10 minutes a week on it. But I am going to do it every \nweek. I must say, though, if we continue to operate the way we have \nbeen operating, I might as well speak about it much more because while \nwe are dealing with a very serious question now, we are not about the \nbusiness of legislating. I call on the majority leader to start getting \nlegislation out and going at it on amendments. Let's bring some \nvitality back to the Senate.\n  I do want to, one more time, say to my colleagues that most all of us \nattended a service for Officers Chestnut and Gibson. These were two \npolice officers who were murdered. They were murdered in the line of \nduty. They were protecting us. They were protecting the public.\n  I say to my colleagues one more time, I believe Senator Bennett and \nSenator Feinstein on the Senate side are very supportive of doing \nwhatever they can. But up to date, including today again, we have \nstations here where you have one police officer for lots of people \ncoming through. That police officer is not safe. That police officer \ncannot do his or her job.\n  We made a commitment to do everything we possibly could to make sure \nwe would never experience again the loss of a police officer's life. We \ncan never be 100 percent sure, but we ought to live up to the \ncommitment to have two police officers at every station.\n\n[[Page S2931]]\n\n  I say this on the floor of the Senate--and I will pick up the pace of \nthis later--if we cannot do that, then we ought to start shutting these \ndoors, really. If we cannot have two officers per station and give them \nthe support they deserve--I am talking about appropriations--then we \nbasically ought to just close the doors.\n\n  I think on the Senate side we have bipartisan support. I do not know \nwhat is happening on the House side. I must say, today I am \npessimistic, in terms of what I have heard, that we might even be \nlooking at cuts. But whatever we need to do, whether it be paying \novertime or hiring additional officers, we need to do it so we do not \nlose any lives and we give the Capitol Hill police officers the support \nthat we promised to give them.\n  I say to my colleagues that I am worried that on the House side, in \nparticular, we are not going to get the support. I think it should be \nbipartisan. I do not think anybody should have any question about this. \nEverybody says they are for police officers, and everybody says they \nare for protection and safety, and everybody says they will never \nforget the two fine officers whose lives were lost, and yet when it \ncomes to digging in our pockets and doing it through appropriations, we \nare not there. Something is amiss.\n  I will try to keep bringing this up every week and hopefully we can \nget this work done.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have to take issue with the extreme \nrhetoric that some are using to attack our Federal law enforcement \nofficers who helped return Elian Gonzalez to his father.\n  For example, one of the Republican leaders in the House of \nRepresentatives was quoted as calling the officers of the U.S. \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, the U.S. Border Patrol, and the \nU.S. Marshals Service: ``jack-booted thugs.'' The mayor of New York \nCity, a man who is seeking election to this body, called these \ndedicated public servants ``storm troopers.''\n  I know both men who made these remarks. I hope they will reconsider \nwhat they said because such intemperate and highly charged rhetoric \nonly serves to degrade Federal law enforcement officers in the eyes of \nthe public. That is something none of us should want to see happen.\n  Let none of us in the Congress, or those who want to serve in \nCongress, contribute to an atmosphere of disrespect for law enforcement \nofficers. No matter what one's opinion of the law enforcement action in \nsouth Florida, we should all agree that these law enforcement officers \nwere following orders, doing what they were trained to do, and putting \ntheir lives on the line, something they do day after day after day.\n  Let us treat law enforcement officers with the respect that is \nessential to their preserving the peace and protecting the public. I \nhave said many times on the floor of this body that the 8 years I \nserved in law enforcement are among the proudest and most satisfying \ntimes of my years in public service.\n  Thus, this harsh rhetoric bothers me even more. I do not know if I am \nbothered more as a Senator or as a former law enforcement official. But \nI am reminded of similar harsh rhetoric used by the National Rifle \nAssociation. In April 1995, the NRA sent a fundraising letter to \nmembers calling Federal law enforcement officers ``jack-booted thugs'' \nwho wear ``Nazi bucket helmets and black storm trooper uniforms.''\n  Apparently, the vice president of the NRA was referring to Federal \nBureau of Investigation and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms \nagents involved in law enforcement actions in Idaho and Texas.\n  President George Bush, a man who is a friend of ours on both sides of \nthis aisle, was correctly outraged by this NRA rhetoric, and he \nresigned from the NRA in protest. At the time in 1995, President Bush \nwrote to the NRA:\n\n       Your broadside against federal agents deeply offends my own \n     sense of decency and honor. . . . It indirectly slanders a \n     wide array of government law enforcement officials, who are \n     out there, day and night, laying their lives on the line for \n     all of us.\n\n  I praised President Bush in 1995 for his actions, and I praise him \nagain today.\n  President Bush was right. This harsh rhetoric of calling Federal law \nenforcement officers ``jack-booted thugs'' and ``storm troopers'' \nshould offend our sense of decency and honor. It is highly offensive. \nIt does not belong in any public debate on the reunion of Elian \nGonzalez with his father.\n  We are fortunate to have dedicated women and men throughout Federal \nlaw enforcement in this country. They do a tremendous job under \ndifficult circumstances, oftentimes at the risk of their lives and, \nunfortunately, too often losing their lives. They are examples of the \nhard-working public servants who make up the Federal Government, who \nare too often maligned and unfairly disparaged. It is unfortunate that \nit takes high-profile incidents to put a human face on Federal law \nenforcement officials, to remind everyone that these are people with \nchildren and parents and friends, spouses, brothers and sisters. They \ndeserve our respect. They don't deserve our personal insults.\n\n  In countless incidents across the country every day, we ask Federal \nlaw enforcement officers who are sworn to protect the public and \nenforce the law to place themselves in danger, in danger none of us has \nto face. These law enforcement officers deserve our thanks and our \nrespect. They do not deserve to be called jack-booted thugs and storm \ntroopers. I proudly join the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation in condemning these insults against our Nation's law \nenforcement officers. The public officials who used this harsh rhetoric \nowe our Federal law enforcement officers an apology.\n  I also want to note the misplaced swiftness in those calling to \ninvestigate the law enforcement action needed to reunite Elian Gonzalez \nwith his father. The same congressional leaders who broke speed records \ncalling Attorney General Reno to Capitol Hill and now call for Senate \nJudiciary Committee hearings to investigate this law enforcement action \nare the same congressional leaders who stalled the juvenile justice \nconference for nearly a year. With just a word, these congressional \nleaders can order politically charged meetings and hearings, though \nthey remain silent when it comes to moving a comprehensive youth crime \nbill toward final passage into law. Unfortunately, we are in a Congress \nthat is quick to investigate but slow to actually legislate a solution \nthat could improve the quality of our constituents' lives. I think this \nis a misplaced priority on politics over commonsense legislation. I \nhope we will calm down the rhetoric.\n  There are those who feel strongly about where Elian Gonzalez should \nbe, either with relatives in Miami or with his father. I am one who has \nstated from the beginning that the little boy should be with his \nfather. The fact is, he is with his father. I hope we can all just let \nthem be alone, let them reestablish the bonds that a father and child \nnaturally have. Let him enjoy the company of his new brother. Let him \nbe out of the TV cameras. Let's stop seeing this little boy paraded out \nseveral times a day before crowds, even adoring crowds. Let him be a \nnormal little 6-year-old. Let him hug his father. Let his father hug \nhim back. Let them read stories. Let them do things together.\n  I ask his family, his relatives in Miami--I have to assume they love \nhim--let them have this time alone. Back away. Don't let your own egos \nor feelings get in the way of what is best for this little child. Let \nhim be with his father. There will be a time where all of them will be \ntogether again. Right now, this little boy needs his dad.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n[[Page S2932]]\n\n  Mr. MACK.

Mr. President, in the early morning hours of Holy Saturday, \na little piece of America died. America's shining beacon of freedom \nfaded in the Florida sky as many of us grieved over the astounding \nactions of the United States Government. This administration betrayed \nAmerica's past and joined history's inglorious list of governments that \nhave chosen to use excessive force against its own law-abiding \ncitizens.\n  Our founding fathers believed in a Government of, for, and by, the \npeople, a Government designed to serve and benefit the people, not to \nserve and benefit the needs of Government, and certainly not to \nsubstitute brute force for the rule of law. These are reminiscent of \nthe tactics used by tyrants and despots. The decisions by this \nadministration that led to the events of last Saturday will be \nremembered as a day of shame in our American history.\n  My comments today are not directed toward the law enforcement \nofficers who carried out the operation; I understand they are charged \nwith a duty and must follow the directives of the Attorney General and \nthe President of the United States. My comments today are not directed \nat the ultimate disposition of Elian's residency or custody, and they \nare not intended to be partisan or political, but they do go directly \nto the heart of who we are as a Nation and what we expect of our \nGovernment.\n  As most people know, the Elian Gonzalez matter is pending in Federal \ncourt. Just last Wednesday, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals \nordered that Elian Gonzalez must remain in the United States during the \nreview of his Federal court case. The opinion of the court suggests the \nINS and the Department of Justice were wrong in not granting Elian an \nasylum hearing. In the final footnote of the opinion, the court \nencouraged the parties to avail themselves voluntarily of the Eleventh \nCircuit's mediation services. The court believed that mediation was an \nappropriate avenue to resolve this heart gripping situation.\n  The Attorney General did not listen to the court. She was obsessed \nwith reuniting Elian with his father at any cost. Perhaps she would \nhave been wise to listen to the words of Daniel Webster: ``Liberty \nexists in proportion to wholesome restraint.'' Perhaps she should have \nlistened to her own words: ``I'm trying to work through an \nextraordinary human tragedy. And the importance of working through it \nis that we do so in good faith, without violence, without having to \ncause further disruption to the little boy.'' This statement was made \nnine days before the raid.\n  The night before the raid, mediation between the Department of \nJustice, the Miami family and Juan Miguel Gonzalez had gone on all \nnight and into the wee hours of Saturday morning. Even as the \nnegotiations continued on the telephone with all parties, agents of the \nadministration dressed in fatigues and masks exploded into the home of \nLazaro Gonzalez with machine guns drawn--and one machine gun that was \npointed dramatically in the face of a screaming child.\n  The Government held all the power, and the Government used \nintimidation to force a family, a loving caring family, into a corner. \nRemember this is the family originally selected by the Attorney General \nto care for Elian.\n  The administration offered ultimatums when fair mediation was needed. \nThis administration resorted to the power of a machine gun to \nintimidate an American family. What possible benefit could come from \nthis act?\n  Tactics such as these deserve a full explanation. Why would the \nDepartment of Justice stage a raid when mediator Aaron Podhurst stated \nthat a deal between the parties was ``minutes to an hour away''? Why \nwould they be so impatient with a solution so near? The Attorney \nGeneral said that they had a window during which to conduct the raid of \nSaturday through Monday. Why could they not have waited for \nnegotiations to play out.\n\n  What credible information existed to suggest this level of force \nneeded to be used?\n  Another question that deserves fuller explanation speaks to the \nimpact of the raid on the boy. Wouldn't any psychologist or \npsychiatrist who actually examined the child say this action would \nfurther traumatize the boy? But sadly, the INS team of experts never \ndid examine the boy to make an informed evaluation.\n  How could such tactics possibly be in the best interests of a child \nwho has suffered so much? What right did this administration have to \nadd this trauma to the terrible loss Elian has already suffered? And \nwhy did he have to suffer at the hands of the people who are supposed \nto defend the rule of law, the INS, the DoJ, and the President of the \nUnited States.\n  Let's think for a moment about the decision the father and the \nJustice Department made in putting Elian's life at risk with the plans \nfor the pre-dawn raid. I have never questioned the father's love for \nthe boy, but I cannot imagine any father would choose to put his son's \nlife at risk a second time. But it is not an unloving father who put \nhis son in harm's way-the father is as much a victim as Elian in many \nways. The father had a simple choice: travel to a safe house in Miami \nand have Elian voluntarily transferred into his custody or insist on \nremaining in Washington and have the U.S. government seize his son in a \nviolent, dangerous raid. Just as it wasn't the father's decision not to \ncome to his boy's side for the first four months of this ordeal, it was \nnot his decision to remain in Washington, forcing a raid at gunpoint. \nCastro would not allow the father to travel then and he would not allow \nhim to travel last weekend.\n  President Clinton promised my colleague Senator Graham that Elian \nwould not be seized in the middle of the night, and now we must ask \nagain, why did he promise one thing and yet do another?\n  Elian deserves access to all of his legal options, Elian deserves an \nasylum hearing, and he deserves the protection of U.S. law. Yet that is \nfor another day. The use of force must be dealt with today. Does the \nend justify the means? Will these means ever be justified?\n  There have been accusations of playing politics with this issue.\n  But perhaps we ought to recognize what several of the Attorney \nGeneral's long-time supporters have said. The four mediators from Miami \nthat were involved in the negotiations with Janet Reno have clearly \nchallenged the administration's characterization of the events of last \nSaturday. They said they were close to an agreement and felt confident \na peaceful solution could have been reached.\n  We cannot simply sweep these issues away and dispense of them in the \nname of politics. This is a long, sad story and I'm sure many would \nwish it would simply fade away. But if we accept and commend the \nactions of our government for acting hastily in choosing excessive \nforce over peaceful mediation, we have traveled down a very troubling \nroad. We dare not condone such use of force to settle legal disputes. \nThis strikes at the very heart of the balance of power and the \nintegrity of our judicial process.\n  This child and no child should face the intimidation and trauma of an \nautomatic weapon in his face--especially when perpetrated by the \nAmerican government--a government that has always stood for freedom and \nhuman rights throughout the world. As a father and grandfather, I am \nheartbroken for the frightened, vulnerable child in that photograph. My \nhope is that no other administration official utter the words, ``I am \nproud of what we did'' and instead express regret and sorrow for the \ntrauma and pain suffered by the entire Gonzalez family.\n  What happened saddens me as an American, a father, and a Senator. Mr. \nPresident, last Saturday morning, a little bit of America died in that \nraid and I hope we never again dim the light of freedom for those who \nlook to us for hope.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of the \n1.5 million ethnic Armenians that were systematically murdered at the \nhands of the Ottoman Empire from 1915-1923. The 85th anniversary of the \nbeginning of this brutal annihilation was marked on April 24.\n  During this nine year period, a total of 1.75 million ethnic \nArmenians were either slaughtered or forced to flee their homes to \nescape the certain death that awaited them at the hands of a \ngovernment-sanctioned force determined to extinguish their very \nexistence. As a result, fewer than 80,000 ethnic Armenians remain in \nwhat is present-day Turkey.\n  I have come to the floor to commemorate this horrific chapter in \nhuman history each year I have been a member of this body, both to \nhonor those who died and to remind the American people of the chilling \ncapacity for violence that, unfortunately, still exists in the world. \nIt is all too clear from the current ethnically and religiously \nmotivated conflicts in such places as the Balkans, Sierra Leone, and \nSudan that we have not learned the lessons of the past.\n  Recently, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, of which I am a \nmember, had the honor of hearing the testimony of one of the most well-\nknown survivors of the Holocaust, Dr. Elie Wiesel. His eloquent words \nremind us that the same capacity for hate that drove the Ottoman Empire \nto murder ethnic Armenians and the Nazis to murder Jews is still \npresent in the world. At the hearing, Dr. Wiesel said, ``violence is \nthe language of those who can no longer express themselves with \nwords.''\n  This hate manifests itself in many ways, from extreme nationalism to \nso-called ``ethnic cleansing'' to violations of the basic human rights \nof ethnic and religious minorities. And, in some cases, those filled \nwith hate attempt to mimic the horrific events and beliefs of times \npast. For example, I am deeply disturbed by the apparent resurgence of \nright wing and anti-Semitic movements in Europe.\n  Dr. Wiesel also said, ``to hate is to deny the other person's \nhumanity.'' Today, let us take a moment to remember the Armenians who \ndied at the hands of the Ottoman Empire, and all of the other innocent \npeople who have lost their lives in the course of human history simply \nfor who they were. Our humanity may depend on it.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to join with Armenians throughout the \nUnited States, in Armenia, and around the world in commemorating the \n85th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.\n  On the night of April 24, 1915 in Constantinople, nationalist forces \nof the Ottoman Empire rounded up more than 200 Armenian religious, \npolitical, and intellectual leaders and murdered them in a remote \ncountryside location. This atrocity began an eight year campaign of \ntyranny that would affect the lives of every Armenian in Asia Minor.\n  Armenian men, women, and children of all ages fell victim to murder, \nrape, torture, and starvation. By 1923, an estimated 1.5 million \nArmenians had been systematically murdered and another 500,000 were \nexiled. With the world community consumed in the events of World War I \nand the subsequent period of recovery, the plight of the Armenian \npeople went unanswered.\n  Today, this tragic episode in history serves to unite the Armenian \npeople as they struggle to build an independent nation committed to \ndemocracy and peace in the Caucasus region. Despite the unresolved \nconflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, the ongoing blockade by Turkey and the \nviolent attack on the Armenian Parliament last October, Armenians \ncontinue to build on these principles. It is this indomitable spirit \nthat has kept the hope of Armenians alive through centuries of \npersecution.\n  The madness and cruelty which led to the tragic events of the \nArmenian genocide are not forgotten. Last year, when hundreds fled \ntheir homes in Kosovo, fearing for their lives, America and its NATO \nallies reacted quickly and decisively. We, as a nation, must continue \nto respond to such acts of oppression so that the deaths of all victims \nof hatred and prejudice are not in vain.\n  Therefore, on the 85th anniversary of the terrible tragedy of the \nArmenian genocide we remember the past and rededicate ourselves to \nsupporting Armenia as it looks to the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/26/senate-section/article/S2933-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

\n\n  IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LEGEND OF CASEY JONES\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nhistorical significance of April 30th to the State of Tennessee and the \nNation. Casey Jones, a legendary Tennessee railroad engineer, made \nhistory when his engine collided with another train on April 30, 1900. \nCasey's infamous ride and his selfless actions to save the lives of \ninnocent bystanders have been lauded in folk music and drama throughout \nthe past century. It is in his memory and the spirit of his efforts \nthat I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Casey Jones' bravery \nand heroism.\n  Americans have been fascinated by the life of Casey Jones not merely \nfor his heroism but also for his personification of the American dream. \nCasey's legendary life is a universal tale, and one that was guided by \nthe foundations of this great nation: diligence, perseverance, \ndetermination, and sacrifice. Casey began as a cub operator for the \nrailroads, then worked as a fireman, and eventually became an engineer \nin 1891, an accomplishment that was rarely seen in those days. He moved \nhis family anywhere he could find employment, but he never neglected \nhis role as a caring father and devoted husband.\n\n[[Page S2935]]\n\nCasey had a reputation as a trusted and capable engineer, and he soon \nfound himself in charge of regularly scheduled passenger trains.\n  On the night of April 29, 1900, Casey departed Memphis aboard Engine \n382 with six passenger cars one hour and thirty-five minutes late. \nProtocol demanded that engineers make their arrival time regardless of \nthe tardiness of their departure. Casey was renowned throughout the \nregion for his ability to make time, and he was doing an excellent job \nuntil he arrived at Vaughn Station, only eleven miles from his final \ndestination. While attempting to maintain his scheduled arrival, Casey \nmissed a flag signal warning that a freight train was still on the \ntracks ahead of him. Casey's engine collided with the caboose, but \ninstead of abandoning his engine as instructed, he stayed behind in the \nhope that the lives of his passengers could be saved. Due to Casey's \nheroic attempts to stop and slow the train, none of Casey's passengers \nwere injured and he was the only one killed in the crash.\n  Throughout this year, Casey Jones' hometown of Jackson, Tennessee, \nwill celebrate the centennial of his gallant ride and recognize his \ncontributions to American history. The events will culminate on the \nanniversary of the crash with a celebration sponsored by the Casey \nJones Village, the Casey Jones Home and Railroad Museum, and the City \nof Jackson. I encourage everyone to take part in these events and \nremember the legacy of Casey Jones--an American folk hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/26/senate-section/article/S2935-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ARIAIL PULITZER NOD\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS.

This is the second time he has \nmade the Pulitzer shortlist, having also been a 1995 finalist. Since \njoining The State newspaper in Columbia, SC in 1984, Mr. Ariail has \ninformed and charmed South Carolina readers with a collection of \noriginal, insightful and finely-crafted cartoons. Having been a subject \nof his satire, I can personally attest to his talent. His work has \nearned him numerous national and international awards including the \nOverseas Press Club's Thomas Nast Award, the National Headliner Award \nand the national Sigma Delta Chi Award. I have faith that three times \nwill be the charm for Robert Ariail and the Pulitzer; this prestigious \naward could not go to a more deserving person.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/26/senate-section/article/S2935-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE 150TH BIRTHDAY OF GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of the City \nof Grand Rapids, Michigan, which on May 1, 2000, will celebrate its \n150th birthday. Residents of the city have been invited to commemorate \nthe occasion with Mayor John Logie at the Grand Rapids Sesquicentennial \nCommunity Party, an event which will highlight the growth and \ndevelopment of a city that is still on the ascent.\n  When a group of fur trappers, explorers, loggers, and sod busters \ntook a break from their daily activities on May 1, 1850, to make Grand \nRapids an incorporated city, the estimated population was 2,686 \npersons. The number of square miles that the city encompassed stood at \nfour, the estimated number of city officials was sixteen, there were \nthirty two miles of road within city limits, and there was neither a \npolice force nor a fire department. To be sure, the first mayor of \nGrand Rapids, Mr. Henry R. Williams, had his work cut out for him.\n  Today, I think Mr. Williams would be extremely proud to see how far \nthe city of Grand Rapids has come in its 150 years. Its population now \nstands at 192,000 persons, and, when surrounding metropolitan areas are \nadded to this, the figure grows to 1,021,200. This makes Grand Rapids \nthe second largest city in Michigan and the 58th largest city in the \nNation. The city encompasses 45 square miles, employs over 2,000 city \nofficials, has 562.81 miles of road within its limits, a police force \nof 379 officers and a fire department of 260 firefighters. Mr. \nPresident, I think it goes without saying that Mayor Logie also has a \nlot of work on his hands.\n  The City of Grand Rapids has planned many events to be included as \npart of its Sesquicentennial Celebration. All elementary schools, \npublic, private, and charter, will be served birthday cake on May 1. \nThe original city boundary will be marked with special historic 1850 \nsigns. City officials have commissioned the designing of a parade float \nto participate in area parades, which depicts the Grand River and is \nfully equipped with jumping fish, fireworks, and depictions of historic \nbuildings and neighborhoods. Free coloring books entitled ``The City of \nGrand Rapids: Then and Now,'' will be distributed on April 29, 2000.\n  In addition, officials from the four sister cities of Grand Rapids--\nOmihachiman, Japan; Bielsko-Biala, Poland; Perugia, Italy; and Ga \nDistrict, Ghana--will join in the celebration. A time capsule, to be \nbuilt into the new Archive Center, will receive its first items. One \nhundred and fifty trees will be planted throughout the community to \ncommemorate the birthday celebration. A beginning list of 150 \nhistorical sites in Grand Rapids will be released on April 29, 2000, \nand will be completed throughout the year. And finally, the Grand \nRapids Press will publish four essays, submitted by Grand Rapids \nresidents, as a tribute to the birthday, with the topics of these \nessays ranging from diversity to the city's quality of life.\n  Mr. President, in one hundred and fifty years, residents of Grand \nRapids have experienced their fair share of both prosperity and \ndecline. At the end of World War II, the future of Grand Rapids looked \nbleak. Through the incredible efforts of thousands of individuals in \nthe years since, though, the city has managed to turn the tables full \ntilt. As we enter the new millennium, Grand Rapids is enjoying the \ngreatest economic boom in its history. With this economic prosperity \nhas come a remarkable turn in the overall quality of life that \nresidents enjoy. Also, it should be noted that Grand Rapids is one of \nMichigan's most diverse cities, diversity which increases everyday as \nmore and more jobs are created within city limits. The turnaround of \nGrand Rapids serves as a model, and an inspiration, to other cities, \nnot only in Michigan, but throughout the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I extend greetings to all those participating in the \nGrand Rapids Sesquicentennial Community Party, and the many other \nevents that have been planned for the celebration of the anniversary. \nOn behalf of the entire United States Senate, I wish the City of Grand \nRapids a happy 150th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/26/senate-section/article/S2935-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2935-S2936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DIABETES RESEARCH\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Diabetes \nCaucus, I am concerned with the need for further research for a cure \nfor diabetes. Recently, I had several meetings with constituents from \nPortland, Eugene, and Lake Oswego, Oregon concerning diabetes research \nfunding. All of these constituents are young children or young adults \nliving with this disease. One young woman told me that she has already \nlost three friends to this disease.\n  For fiscal year 2000, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) \nreceived a $13.3 million increase over last year's funding for \ndiabetes. This increase brings the total amount for diabetes research \nto $462.3 million. For those who have to live every day with diabetes \nand for those who are the parents of a child living with disease, and \nwho have to worry every day about the long-term toll diabetes disease \ntakes on their child, this is not enough.\n  Diabetes can destroy nerves, harm eyesight, and cause a host of other \ndeleterious effects on the body. While I am pleased that there was an \nincrease in the funding of NIH for diabetes research last year, I \nbelieve we can and should do more to assure that we find a cure.\n  While funding has increased from $134 million in fiscal year 1980, \nthis only represents approximately 2 percent growth per year when \nadjusted for inflation. Considering the widespread and devastating \neffects of this disease, we should continue to support the funding \nincreases for NIH research of diabetes.\n  I know that many of my colleagues feel strongly about this issue as \nwell. I\n\n[[Page S2936]]\n\nhope we can work in a bipartisan manner to assure an increase in \nresearch funding to find a cure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/26/senate-section/article/S2936-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO OHIO COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nstudents at Ohio County High School for their First Place finish in the \nKentucky competition of the ``We the People . . . The Citizen and the \nConstitution'' program and for their advancement to the national \ncompetition.\n  I am proud to share with my colleagues that the class from Ohio \nCounty High School in Hartford, Kentucky will represent our State in \nthe national competition of ``We the People . . . The Citizen and the \nConstitution'' program. These young scholars have worked diligently to \nreach the national finals and through their hands-on experience have \ngained knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles and \nvalues of our constitutional democracy.\n  I wish to acknowledge each of the winning students: Amber Albin, Kyle \nAllen, Rebecca Ashby, Susanna Ashby, Jamie Barnard, Nicole Bellamy, \nBrian Canty, Susan Fields, Sam Ford, Amanda Gilstrap, Crystal Goff, \nChris Hunt, Leslie Johnson, Andrea Leach, Jason Martin, Jason Mayes, \nLacey Patterson, Sarah Phillips, Dexter Reneer, Ann Shrewsbury, Luke \nSims, Keegan Smith, Erika Underwood, Tara Ward, Michelle Westerfield.\n  I also would like to recognize and thank their teacher, John Stofer, \nwho taught these students and provided the leadership which brought \nthem to the final competition of this year's program.\n  The ``We the People . . .'' program is designed to educate young \npeople about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. During the final \ncompetition, the students will be challenged in a three-day program \nmodeled after Congressional hearings. The students will make oral \npresentations and testify as constitutional experts to a panel of adult \njudges, and then will be questioned and judged on their knowledge and \ngrasp of the Constitution. As a strong advocate for the Constitutional \nrights of all Americans, I applaud the efforts of these young people to \nunderstand and apply Constitutional law to real-life situations.\n  My colleagues and I congratulate these Ohio County High School \nstudents in their Kentucky victory, and wish them all the best in their \nupcoming competition May 6-8, 2000, in Washington, D.C.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/26/senate-section/article/S2936-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CALIFORNIA'S VETERANS APPRECIATION MONTH\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in recognition of \nCalifornia's Veterans Appreciation Month, which is celebrated in May \n2000. The people of our state and our nation owe more to our veterans \nthan we can ever repay. The world is a safer place, and our Democracy \nhas thrived because of their heroism.\n  This year, as in years past, the State of California is making an \nextra effort to assist its veterans who suffer from a lack of suitable \nemployment. California calculates that about 40,000 of its veterans are \nunemployed or underemployed. This is a tragic situation for these fine \nmen and women who have given so much to America.\n  During the month of May, California's Employment Development \nDepartment will focus special effort to find jobs for these veterans. \nLocal Veterans Employment Representatives and Disabled Veterans \nOutreach Program staff will be contacting employers, organized labor \nand government leaders to promote hiring veterans, and they will \nprovide job training and job-search training to former military \npersonnel. Quite simply, the goal of California's Veterans Appreciation \nMonth is to show the appreciation of a grateful nation by providing the \nemployment opportunities that veterans so richly deserve.\n  I commend the California Employment Development Department for all \nits fine efforts on this program and I encourage all Americans to \nsupport similar efforts in their states.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/26/senate-section/article/S2936-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNITION OF STILLWATER HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, on May 6-8, 2000, more than 1200 \nstudents from across the United States will be in Washington, D.C. to \ncompete in the national finals of the We the People . . . The Citizen \nand the Constitution program. It is an honor for me to announce that a \nclass from Stillwater Area High School will represent the state of \nMinnesota in this national event. These young scholars have worked very \nhard to reach the national finals and through their experience have \ngained a deep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles \nand values of our constitutional democracy.\n  The names of the students are: Chad Anderson, Ellen Andersen, Luke \nAnderson, Sara Apel, Rob Cole, Alexis DuPlessis, Melissa Ellis, Kim \nGarvey, Elissa Green, Kyle Knoepfel, Joey Korba, Amy Kruchowski, \nKirsten Lindquist, Beth Manor, Emily Michnay, Alex Nelson, Steve \nPeterson, Chris Richter, Chris Siver, Stefan Tatroe, Melissa Zanmiller.\n  I would also like to recognize their teacher, Kathleen Ferguson, who \ndeserves much of the credit for the success of the class.\n  The We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program is \nthe most extensive educational program in the country developed \nspecifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights. The three-day national competition is modeled after \nhearings in the United States Congress. These hearings consist of oral \npresentations by high school students before a panel of adult judges. \nThe students testify as constitutional experts before a panel of judges \nrepresenting various regions of the country and a variety of \nappropriate professional fields. The students' testimony is followed by \na period of questioning by the simulated congressional committee. The \njudges probe students for their depth of understanding and ability to \napply their constitutional knowledge. Columnist David Broder described \nthe national finals as ``the place to have your faith in the younger \ngeneration restored.''\n  The program provides students with a working knowledge of our \nConstitution, Bill of Rights, and the principles of democratic \ngovernment. Members of Congress and their staff enhance the program by \ndiscussing current constitutional issues with students and teachers and \nby participating in other educational activities.\n  I am confident the class from Stillwater High School will represent \nMinnesota well and I wish these young ``constitutional experts'' all \nthe best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/26/senate-section/article/S2936-4", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2936-S2937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EAGLE SCOUT AWARD\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to salute a \ndistinguished young man from Troop 66 in Garden City, Rhode Island who \nhas attained the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America.\n  Not every young American who joins the Boy Scouts earns the \nprestigious Eagle Scout Award. In fact, only 2.5 percent do. To earn \nthe award, a Boy Scout must fulfill requirements in the areas of \nleadership, service, and outdoor skills. A scout must earn twenty-one \nMerit Badges, eleven of which are required from areas such as \nCitizenship in the Community, Citizenship in the Nation, Citizenship in \nthe World, Safety, Environmental Science, and First Aid.\n  As one progresses through the Boy Scout ranks, a scout must \ndemonstrate participation in increasingly more responsible service \nprojects. An Eagle Scout candidate must also demonstrate leadership \nskills by holding one or more specific Troop leadership positions. \nErnest Rheaume has distinguished himself in accordance with these \ncriteria.\n  For his service project, Ernest organized a bicycle and child safety \nfair at Gladstone Street School in Cranston.\n  Mr. President, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in saluting \nErnest Rheaume. In turn, we must duly recognize the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica for establishing the Eagle Scout Award and the strenuous \ncriteria its aspirants must see. This program has through its eighty-\nfive years honed and enhanced the leadership skills and commitment to \npublic service of many outstanding Americans.\n  It is my sincere belief that Ernest will continue his public service \nand in\n\n[[Page S2937]]\n\nso doing will further distinguish himself and consequently better his \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/26/senate-section/article/S2937-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO BEDFORD SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT DENNIS POPE\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

This honor was awarded \nto Mr. Pope by the New Hampshire School Administrators Association, and \nboth Mary Jo and I applaud the hard work and dedication that has earned \nhim such high esteem.\n  Dennis Pope was chosen from eleven other nominees, and it was \nultimately his actions and the respect of his peers that elevated him \nover the competition. He has dedicated nearly three decades of his life \nto education, the past eleven years of which have been as the Bedord, \nNew Hampshire, Superintendent of Schools. Dennis Pope's goal has always \nbeen to make a difference in the lives of his students and in the \neducation process, and he has succeeded. Mr. Pope's efforts exemplify \nthe Association's motto ``Champions for Children.'' Dennis is a \nchampion of both our children and New Hampshire school systems.\n  Dennis Pope's presence in the Bedford community extends far beyond \nthe walls of its schools. Dennis is an individual who leads by example. \nHe has been a member of the Rotary club, numerous town committees and \nis currently the Vice-Chairman of the Visitation Committees for the \nNEASC.\n  Dennis has illustrated that one can't be a passive participant and \nprosper. He has taken the initiative of reforming the scholastic \ncurriculum, and he has encouraged community involvement in school \naffairs. He has shown that being fiscally conservative doesn't detract \nfrom an academically rich school system.\n  Again, I commend Dennis Pope on this very special honor and on his \nservice to the Bedford School System. His work is greatly beneficial to \nthe Town and the State, and I wish him all of the best as he continues \nto make a difference in his community and in the lives of its young \ncitizens.

RAPHAEL CHURCH\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the \n75th anniversary of St. Raphael Church in Bridgeport, Connecticut. I \ncommend the church and its devoted members for their long tradition of \nfaithfulness and service. This anniversary is, rightfully, cause for \ncelebration among St. Raphael's parishioners, and it is a pleasure to \nrecognize their enduring commitment to the Bridgeport community.\n  The 1920s and 1930s saw a great influx of Italian immigrants into \nthis country generally and into the City of Bridgeport, Connecticut \nspecifically. These immigrants brought hope and courage to America, and \nthey also brought with them a strong religious faith. A new Roman \nCatholic parish, St Raphael's, was soon established in Bridgeport to \nminister to their needs.\n  While the church that everyone in Bridgeport recognizes as St. \nRaphael's was being built, masses were held in the old Caruso Theater. \nAn altar was carried in on Sundays to make the theater more like a \nsanctuary. Services were modest, but they drew the parish together. On \nChristmas Day, 1925 the faithful celebrated the first mass in their new \nchurch. From that day forward the church has prospered and grown. A \nconvent was added to the parish in 1937 and the sisters who lived there \nled religious instruction for six hundred public school children every \nweek.\n  During World War II, hundreds of young men from this church bravely \nwent overseas to fight for their country, and fifty of them never \nreturned.\n  Despite these losses, the 1940s were a time of expansion for the \nchurch. New land was acquired and new buildings were raised. The \nchurch's current appearance is a result of the work done primarily \nduring this period.\n  St. Raphael's is one of the most beautiful churches in Bridgeport, \nand I believe, in the entire state of Connecticut. What was once a \nyellow Spanish-style mission has undergone many renovations. Now a \nGregorian Romanesque building overlooking a school, convent, and \nrectory, much of the property surrounding it belongs to the Church. The \naltar inside was imported to this country from Italy. Some of the \nwoodwork around the altar was carved by Italian artists, while most of \nthe renovations to this building have been the product of devoted \nparishioners throughout the past seven decades. From the marble steps \nto the artwork contained within the Church, this place of worship is a \nproud combination of traditional Italian style and modern American \nworkmanship and dedication.\n  As St. Raphael's celebrates its 75th Anniversary, it is fitting to \nremember the rich history and the important role that this parish has \nhad in the community and for the many generations of Italian-Americans \nthat have lived in Bridgeport. It has persisted through the years as a \nsource of spiritual guidance and communal strength, and I applaud their \nlegacy and wish the parish well at the dawn of this new \ncentury.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/26/senate-section/article/S2937-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ELMENDORF AIR FORCE BASE ENVIRONMENTAL AWARD\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to recognize a \nrecent achievement of the men and women at Elmendorf Air Force Base in \nAnchorage, Alaska. Today, they received the Air Force's 1999 General \nThomas D. White Environmental Award for Restoration. This award \nreflects the commitment of the Air Force in Anchorage to making \nElmendorf Air Force Base and the surrounding community a better place \nto live.\n  Mr. President, the men and women who serve our nation at Elmendorf \nhave always been sensitive to the needs of the communities surrounding \nthe base. Indeed, all of the Air Force installations in Alaska, have \ngone out of their way to ensure that the environment is not permanently \nharmed by any military presence. Innovative approaches to cleanup have \nresulted in Elmendorf being projected to reach Air Force cleanup goals \na full ten years ahead of schedule.\n  Several measures are in place to improve and speed up the cleanup of \nany future environmental hazards, all at a cost savings of over $1 \nmillion to the taxpayers. All of these efforts have ensured a long \nstanding positive relationship with the civilian community and \npreserved the beautiful lands in Alaska for future generations to \nenjoy. For this reason, the Air Force today rewarded the men and women \nat Elmendorf for their diligence.\n  Today, the people of Elmendorf can be proud of the fact that they are \nan example by which other Air Force installations around the nation, \nindeed the world, will measure themselves for environmental awareness. \nI join the Air Force in commending those at Elmendorf, like Lieutenant \nGeneral Thomas R. Case and Colonel Duncan H. Showers, who have made \nthis possible. I also look forward to continued work with the Air Force \nin Alaska to maintain their excellent relationship with the rest of the \ncommunities in Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/26/senate-section/article/S2937-4", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2937-S2938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LUCAS MOLLER\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I bring your attention to the recent \naccomplishments of Lucas Moller. Lucas is 11 years old, a student of \nRussell Elementary School in Moscow, Idaho, and is currently helping \nNASA scientists develop sensitive and complex space equipment.\n  In December of 1999, Lucas was selected by the Planetary Society to \nhave his invention used by NASA scientists on the Mars Surveyor 2001 \nmission. Mr. President, I know you join Idaho and myself in extending \nto Lucas congratulations on this achievement.\n  The Planetary Society asked kindergarten through 12th-grade students \nto design an experiment that would enhance the Mars Surveyor mission. \nAfter learning of this contest, Lucas studied the mission to determine \nwhat he could build. What Lucas came up with was both simple and \ningenious. He constructed a thimble-sized cylinder designed to help \nscientists test the angle at which Martian dust falls off space \nequipment. This invention will allow scientists to learn what angle to \nposition their equipment to prevent dust collecting and interfering \nwith experiments.\n\n[[Page S2938]]\n\n  When Lucas is not working with the Nation's top scientists on space \nexploration, he is developing his character with such distinguished \norganizations as the Boy Scouts. He excels at math and science and is \ninvolved in the gifted and talented program at school.\n  Mr. President, Lucas Moller is an outstanding example of what Idaho \nstudents can do with the proper encouragement and dedication. He is a \nrole model for students and scientists of all ages and I am proud that \nhe will represent his family and state in future space exploration. I \nknow you and my colleagues in the Senate join me in offering our \ncongratulations to Lucas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/26/senate-section/article/S2938-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2938-S2940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-8583.

A bill to institute a moratorium on the imposition of the \ndeath penalty at the Federal and State level until a National \nCommission on the Death Penalty studies its use and policies ensuring \njustice, fairness, and due process are implemented; to the Commission \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n             national death penalty moratorium act of 2000\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nDeath Penalty Moratorium Act of 2000. This bill would place an \nimmediate pause on executions in the United States while a national, \nblue ribbon commission reviews the administration of the death penalty. \nBefore one more execution is carried out, jurisdictions that impose the \ndeath penalty have an obligation to ensure that the sentence of death \nwill be imposed with justice, fairness, and due process. I am pleased \nthat my distinguished colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, has \njoined me as a cosponsor of this important initiative.\n  If a particular aircraft crashed one out of every eight flights, \nCongress would act immediately to ground it. But as New York public \ndefender Kevin Doyle says in the book, Actual Innocence, that is about \nwhat is happening now with the death penalty in this country. Since the \nreinstatement of the modern death penalty, 87 people have been freed \nfrom death row because they were later proven innocent. That is a \ndemonstrated error rate of 1 innocent person for every 7 persons \nexecuted. When the consequences are life and death, we need to demand \nthe same standard for our system of justice as we would for our \nairlines.\n  Both supporters and opponents of the death penalty should be \nconcerned about the flaws in the system by which we impose sentences of \ndeath. More than 3,600 inmates sit on State and Federal death rows \naround the country, while it becomes increasingly clear that innocent \npeople are being put to death.\n  A 1987 study found that between 1900 and 1985, 350 people convicted \nof capital crimes in the United States were innocent of the crimes \ncharged. Some escaped execution by minutes. Regrettably, according to \nresearchers Radelet and Bedau, 23 had their lives taken from them in \nerror.\n  In Illinois, since 1973, 13 innocent people have been freed from \ndeath row in the time that 12 were executed. Governor George Ryan, a \nsupporter of the death penalty, has done two things in response: He has \neffectively imposed a moratorium on executions and established a blue \nribbon commission to review the administration of capital punishment in \nIllinois. Governor Ryan and I are from different political parties, but \nwe both recognize that the system by which we impose the death penalty \nis broken.\n  Modern DNA testing of forensic evidence led to the exoneration of 5 \nof the 13 innocents freed from Illinois' death row and 8 of the 87 men \nand women who have been freed from death row nationwide since the \n1970's. But Illinois and New York are the only states that currently \nprovide some measure of access to DNA testing for death row inmates. My \ndistinguished colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, has introduced a \nbill, the Innocence Protection Act, of which I am a co-sponsor, that \nwould ensure access to DNA testing for all inmates on death row in the \nFederal system and the 38 States that impose the death penalty. That \nbill is an important initiative to help ensure that innocents are not \ncondemned to death. I hope my colleagues will join Senator Leahy in \nmoving this bill forward.\n  But, as Governor Ryan and others have recognized, flaws in our system \nunfortunately go well beyond access to DNA testing. As Barry Scheck, \nPeter Neufeld and Jim Dwyer note in their book, ``Actual Innocence,''\n\n       Sometimes eyewitnesses make mistakes. Snitches tell lies. \n     Confessions are coerced or fabricated. Racism trumps truth. \n     Lab tests are rigged. Defense lawyers sleep.\n\n  Indeed, Scheck and Neufeld note that eyewitness error is the single \nmost important cause of wrongful convictions.\n\n[[Page S2941]]\n\nAs important as DNA testing is, it is only the first step in addressing \nthe host of problems in the administration of capital punishment.\n  It is time for the Congress to take the lead and declare once and for \nall that it is unacceptable to execute an innocent man or woman. It is \na central pillar of our criminal justice system that it is better that \nmany guilty people go free than that one innocent should suffer. Sadly, \nhistory has demonstrated that time and again, America has brought \ninnocence itself to the bar and condemned it to die. That history now \ndemonstrates that even in America, innocence itself has provided no \nsecurity from the ultimate punishment.\n  Most insidiously, the ghosts of institutional racism still haunt our \ncourthouses. They intrude when lawyers select jurors, during the \npresentation of evidence, when the prosecutor contrasts the race of the \nvictim and defendant, and when juries deliberate. The evidence mounts \nthat the United States applies the death penalty differently to people \nof different races.\n  The numbers tell the story: Although African-Americans constitute \nonly 13 percent of the American population, since the Supreme Court \nreinstated the death penalty in 1976, African-Americans account for 35 \npercent of those executed, 43 percent of those who wait on death row \nnationwide, and 67 percent of those who wait on death row in the \nFederal system. Although only 50 percent of murder victims are white, \nfully 84 percent of the victims in death penalty cases were white. \nSince 1976, America has executed 11 whites for killing an African-\nAmerican, but has executed 144 African-Americans for killing a white.\n  Governor Ryan and Illinois serve as a model for the Congress and the \nNation. The flaws in the Illinois criminal justice system are not \nunique. Problems like convicting the innocent, racial disparities in \nthe application of the death penalty, and inadequacy of defense counsel \nhave plagued the administration of capital punishment across the \nNation. That is why we need a national review of the death penalty and \na suspension of executions until we can be sure that death row inmates \nacross the country have been given the full protections of justice, \nfairness, and due process.\n  Governor Ryan is not alone in questioning the state of the death \npenalty. In the last few months, people of all political stripes have \nbeen stepping forward to say there is a problem and it is time to do \nsomething about it.\n  Columnist George Will recently wrote that serious defects exist in \nthe criminal justice system by which we impose capital punishment. In a \nrecent column in The Washington Post, George Will wrote that accounts \nof the wrongly convicted compel the conclusion that ``many innocent \npeople are in prison, and some innocent people have been executed.'' He \nalso wrote that even though he continues to believe that capital \npunishment may be a deterrent to crime, it can only be an effective \ndeterrent if the criminal justice system operates properly to convict \nand sentence those who actually committed the offense, not innocent \npeople.\n\n  The Reverend Pat Robertson, a founder of the Christian Coalition and \na long-time supporter of the death penalty, has also recognized that \nsomething is terribly amiss in the administration of the death penalty. \nAt a recent conference at the College of William and Mary, Reverend \nRobertson noted that the death penalty has been administered in a way \nthat discriminates against minorities and the poor who cannot afford \nhigh-priced defense attorneys. Reverend Robertson said, ``these are all \nreasons to at least slow down.'' He also said, ``I think a moratorium \nwould indeed be very appropriate.''\n  Around the country, other State and local legislative bodies have \nalso urged pause and reflection. At least 17 city and county \ngovernments have now passed resolutions supporting a moratorium on \nexecutions. And resolutions have been offered in the legislatures of \nseveral states, including Alabama, Maryland, New Jersey, Oklahoma, \nPennsylvania and Washington state. In 1997, the American Bar \nAssociation adopted a resolution calling for a nationwide moratorium on \nexecutions. Recently, the U.S. Catholic Conference, the Union of \nAmerican Hebrew Congregations and a number of other religious \norganizations called on the President to suspend the scheduling of \nexecutions and initiate a review of the administration of capital \npunishment at the Federal level. These local governments and \norganizations have recognized that a little time and a little \nreflection are not much to ask when the lives of innocent people may \nhang in the balance.\n  Congress, too, should recognize that a little time and reflection are \nnot too much to ask. That is why I ask my colleagues to support the \nbill I introduce today. This bill simply calls on the Federal \nGovernment and all States that impose the death penalty to suspend \nexecutions while a national commission reviews the administration of \nthe death penalty. The Commission would study all matters relating to \nthe administration of the death penalty at the Federal and State levels \nto determine whether it comports with constitutional principles and \nrequirements of fairness, justice, equality and due process. Congress \nwould review the Commission's final report and then enact or reject its \nrecommendations. Those jurisdictions that impose capital punishment \ncould resume executions only after Congress considers the Commission's \nfinal report and repeals the suspension of executions provision of the \nbill.\n  This means that before executing even one more person, the Federal \nGovernment and the States must ensure that not a single innocent person \nwill be executed, eliminate discrimination in capital sentencing on the \nbasis of the race of either the victim or the defendant, and provide \nfor certain basic standards of competency of defense counsel.\n  Questions about the administration of the death penalty can only be \nanswered with an impartial, independent review.\n  The blue-ribbon commission called for in my bill would include \nprosecutors, defense attorneys, judges, law enforcement officials, and \nother distinguished Americans with experience or expertise in the \nissue. It would be a balanced commission, not chock full of death \npenalty foes or death penalty supporters representing different \nviewpoints on the issue. Other nations, including some of our closest \nallies, have also established national commissions to review the death \npenalty.\n  In the 1950s, Great Britain created the Royal Commission on Capital \nPunishment, and the Canadian Parliament established a joint committee \nof their Senate and House to review capital punishment. Now, almost 50 \nyears later, I believe it is time for the United States to undertake a \nnational review. We should be the leader on issues of justice.\n  It has been almost 25 years since the reinstatement of the death \npenalty, and we still don't know how innocent people got on death row \nor how to prevent it from happening again. That is embarrassing, at the \nleast, for the world's greatest democracy. My bill is a step in the \nright direction. And the time is now. Our Nation has come to the point \nwhere the machinery of death is well greased, and the pace of \nexecutions has accelerated. Last year, our Nation hit an all-time high \nfor total executions in any 1 year since 1976. We had 98 executions \nlast year in America. This year, we are already on track to meet or \nexceed that same high rate.\n  Before our Government takes the life of even one more citizen, it has \na solemn responsibility to every American to prove that its actions are \nconsistent with our Nation's fundamental principles of justice, \nequality, and due process. Before carrying out an irreversible \npunishment, the Government must carefully consider the tough questions \nsurrounding capital punishment.\n  Mr. President, let us slow the machinery of death to ensure we are \nbeing fair. Let us reflect to ensure that we are being just. Let us \npause to be certain we do not kill a single innocent person. This is \nreally not too much to ask for a civilized society. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me and my distinguished colleague, Senator Levin, in \nsponsoring the National Death Penalty Moratorium Act of 2000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON:\n  S. 2464. A bill to amend the Robinson-Patman Antidiscrimination Act \nto protect American consumers from foreign\n\n[[Page S2942]]\n\ndrug price discrimination; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     PRESCRIPTION DRUG FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, yesterday, a group of 22 Washington State \nsenior citizens boarded a bus in Seattle and drove to British Columbia \nin Canada to purchase their prescription medicine. Collectively, those \n22 individuals saved $12,000 by taking that bus ride--an average of \nmore than $550 per individual. It is stories like this that have taken \nplace over the last 2 or 3 years that bring me here today.\n  Every day, all across our northern and southern borders, Americans \nleave the U.S. in order to purchase products discovered, developed, \nmanufactured, and sold in the United States, but substances, \nprescription drugs, that are far less expensive in Canada, Mexico, and \nfor that matter, in the United Kingdom and across Europe than here in \nthe United States.\n  My own office did an informal survey and found that for the ten most \ncommonly prescribed drugs, prices in British Columbia average 60-\npercent less than prices for the identical drugs in the identical \nquantities in the State of Washington. These lower prices don't apply \nonly in Washington State or in our northern border States. For example, \nProzac, to treat depression, is 95 cents a pill in Mexico and $2.21 in \nthe United States. The allergy drug, Claritin, costs almost $2 a pill \nin the United States and 41 cents in the United Kingdom. Rilutek, to \ntreat Lou Gehrig's disease, costs $9,000 in the United States and \n$5,000 in France.\n  Now, it is simply unfair to impose these higher prices on citizens of \nthe United States at the drugstore cash register, when the same drugs \nare being sold by the same companies at wholesale, at so much lower \nprices almost everywhere else in the world.\n  What is the reason for this price differential? It is a simple one. \nEach of these other countries imposes price controls on the price for \nwhich they allow their purchasers to pay. The American company, on the \nother hand, looks at the situation and says that price is too low to \ncover my costs of research and development, but I can impose all of the \ncosts of research and development on American citizens. The marginal \ncost of manufacturing more pills and selling them in France, Mexico, or \nin Canada is really very small. So I can sell for half the price in \nCanada that I charge in the United States and still make a profit.\n  The company makes out just fine. The American citizen pays the price. \nThe American citizen pays the price more than once because the American \ncitizen has already paid roughly 50 percent of the cost of developing \nthat drug through our tax system, either through direct appropriations \nat the National Institutes of Health or through various research and \ndevelopment tax credits.\n  Just on Sunday morning, the New York Times had an extensive article \non a drug called Xalatan, which is used for glaucoma, an eye condition, \ndeveloped by an NIH grant in the original instance at Columbia \nUniversity, sold to an American drug company which did the rest of the \nresearch and development but sold today for one-third of the American \nprice in Hungary, and barely half or a third of the American price in \nFrance and Canada and in the rest of the world. That is all due to the \nfact that these other countries are getting a free ride on the backs of \nAmerican citizens, American purchasers, for the research, development, \nmarketing, and sale of these drugs.\n\n  Now, I have labored for the last 5 months to find an answer to this \nquestion, and my favorite answer to this question at this point is \nincluded in the bill. The bill is very simple. It builds on an almost \n65-year-old precedent, which is the Robinson-Patman Act. In 1936, this \nCongress passed the Robinson-Patman Act and prohibited price \ndiscrimination, with very minor exceptions, in sales to U.S. purchasers \nfrom manufacturers and from wholesalers, designed originally to prevent \nthe big chain company from getting such a price break from the \nmanufacturer that it could drive its smaller competitors out of \nbusiness. It simply prohibited that kind of price discrimination.\n  My bill amends that 65-year-old Robinson-Patman Act by extending that \nnondiscriminatory provision from interstate commerce to interstate and \nforeign commerce with respect to prescription drugs. Remember, this law \nhas applied to our American drug manufacturers for 65 years, as far as \ntheir sales within the United States are concerned. Now, if my bill \npasses, it will apply to their sales overseas, outside of our country. \nThat will spread the cost of research and development fairly across all \nof the purchasers, not just the American purchasers, and will \ninevitably result in lower prices for American prescription drug users, \nwhich is exactly what we ought to do. We will give the drug \nmanufacturers not only the opportunity, but the requirement that they \ntreat their American purchasers fairly, just as they have been required \nnot to discriminate among American purchasers for more than six \ndecades.\n  As you know, we are in the midst of a national debate over \nprescription drugs and, most particularly, over whether or not we \nshould grant a prescription drug benefit to at least certain senior \ncitizens who are the beneficiaries of our Medicare system. Just 2 weeks \nago in this body, we voted on a budget resolution that authorizes up to \n$40 billion for such a drug benefit over the course of the next 5 \nyears. I supported that budget resolution, and I will support what our \nproper committees report to us in response to that resolution.\n  That will benefit one distinct group of senior citizens, those whose \nincome levels are low enough to benefit from this assistance in \npurchasing their prescription drugs. It will do absolutely nothing for \nother seniors. It will do nothing for the 44 million uninsured in the \nUnited States. It will do nothing for the costs of health care \ninsurance--for those policies that prescribe prescription drug benefits \nand, therefore, have that cost reflected in the insurance premiums at \nall. In other words, as important as it is to certain seniors, it won't \ngo to the heart of the problem--the high and increasing cost of \nprescription drugs.\n  Part of those high costs are due to the great success of our drug \ncompanies. More and more, a greater share of our health care dollars go \nto the prescription drug feature every year because they are now \nsuccessful in treating conditions that previously could not be treated \nat all or required hospitalization. We should hail that progress. We \ncertainly should support drug companies' research and development of \nnew medicines, but we should not countenance discrimination against \nAmerican citizens and against American purchasers by allowing those \ncompanies to sell precisely the same prescription in almost every other \ncountry in the world at prices half or less than half of what they sell \nthem for in the United States.\n  I have been working on this proposition ever since a November 1999 \ncover story in Time magazine which first illustrated the stark nature \nof this problem and its costs. With all of this work and with my \nconsultation over the last month with the drug companies themselves, \nwhich do not like my bill one bit, I have sought a goal. I am not \nwedded to a particular means. I think this bill is a good way to reach \nthat goal, but it is not necessarily the only goal. I want the drug \ncompanies themselves to come up with an answer to this question.\n  Members on both sides of the aisle have introduced so-called \n``reimportation'' bills, which I find relatively attractive though \nrather bizarre. At the present time, my senior citizens can go up to \nCanada, as they did yesterday, and buy a 3-month supply of \nprescriptions for their own personal use and bring them back to the \nUnited States. But the pharmacy in Bellingham, WA, can't go up to a \nwholesaler in Canada and get the lower Canadian price and pass it on to \nthat pharmacy's customers in the State of Washington. That kind of \nreimportation is barred, even though we are talking about precisely the \ndrug that the Bellingham pharmacy is now required to buy directly from \nthe manufacturer.\n  Reimportation bills with certain limitations would lift that \nrestriction and would allow the bizarre situation where the drugstore \nin the United States could purchase an American-manufactured drug in \nCanada for less than it could buy it for in the United States. I think \nthat solution may very well be the direction in which we ought to go. I \nam also convinced that there are other ways of doing it. I will say\n\n[[Page S2943]]\n\nthat the drug companies made a reasonable suggestion to me for a tiny \nbit of the problem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 2465.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation today, \nthe Prescription Drug Price Equity Act of 2000. My colleague, Pete \nStark, a Representative for the State of California in the House of \nRepresentatives--I want to give him full credit for having introduced \nthis legislation in the House. I am proud to be a partner with him.\n  The long and the short of it is this bill amends the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986 to deny tax benefits for research conducted by \npharmaceutical companies where U.S. consumers pay higher prices for the \nproducts of that research than consumers in certain other countries, \nsuch as Canada. I could go into this in great detail, but I think the \noperational definition is of 5 percent more.\n  I tell you right now, in my State of Minnesota, seniors and others \nare in a state of outrage by the fact they can go and buy the same \ndrug--produced in this country, FDA approved--for half the price in \nanother country.\n  If we are going to be giving these tax benefits to these \npharmaceutical companies, I think they are going to have to be more \nconcerned about the very public that gives them these benefits. So I \nintroduce this legislation and look forward to support from my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. President, like the rest of my colleagues I have just returned \nfrom a week in my home State of Minnesota. I met with many \nconstituents, but none with more compelling stories than senior \ncitizens struggling to make ends meet because of the high cost of \nprescription drugs--life-saving drugs that are not covered under the \nMedicare program. Ten or 20 years ago these same senior citizens were \ngoing to work everyday--in the stores, and factories, and mines in \nMinnesota--earning an honest paycheck, and paying their taxes without \nprotest. Now they wonder, how can this Government--their Government--\nstand by, when the medicines they need are out of reach.\n  The unfairness which Minnesotans feel is exacerbated of course by the \nhigh cost of prescription drugs here in the United States--the same \ndrugs that can be purchased for frequently half the price in Canada or \nMexico or Europe. These are the exact same drugs, manufactured in the \nexact same facilities with the exact same safety precautions. A year \nago, most Americans did not know that the exact same drugs are for sale \nat half the price in Canada. Today, you can bet the pharmaceutical \nindustry wishes no one knew it. But the cat is out of the bag--and it \nis time for Congress to right the inequities that are rife in the way \nthe United States government interacts with the pharmaceutical \nindustry.\n  Today, I want to focus on one of those inequities--the subsidies that \nthe United States Government offers to pharmaceutical manufacturers to \ndevelop drugs which these same companies proceed to sell to the \nAmerican people at up to twice the price they charge in other \ncountries. To combat that problem I am introducing today the \nPrescription Price Equity Act of 2000, a bill to deny research tax \ncredits to pharmaceutical companies that sell their products at \nsignificantly higher prices in the U.S. as compared to other \nindustrialized countries.\n  The need for this bill is clear. The U.S. Government provides \nlucrative tax credits to the pharmaceutical industry in this country in \norder to promote research and development of new lifesaving \npharmaceutical products. Yet, in return for these government subsidies, \nthe drug companies charge uninsured Americans the highest prices for \ndrugs paid by anyone in the world.\n  The Congressional Research Service recently completed an analysis of \nthe tax treatment of the pharmaceutical industry. That analysis \nconcluded that tax credits were a major contribution to lowering the \naverage effective tax rate for drug companies by nearly 40 percent \nrelative to other major industries from 1990 to 1996. Specifically, the \nreport found that while similar industries pay a tax rate of 27.3 \npercent, the pharmaceutical industry is paying a rate of only 16.2 \npercent. At the same time, after-tax profits for the drug industry \naveraged 17 percent--three times higher than the 5 percent profit \nmargin of other industries.\n  It is time for the pharmaceutical industry to earn these tax \nbenefits--by offering their life saving drugs to America's seniors at \nthe same prices they charge in other countries.\n  Numerous studies have shown that uninsured seniors pay exorbitant \nprices for pharmaceuticals. Surveys done by the Minnesota Senior \nFederation on the prices of the most commonly used drugs by Medicare \nbeneficiaries found that in Minnesota, seniors pay on average about \ntwice the price that Canadian seniors just across the border pay for \nthe exact same medication. I know that the House Government Reform \nCommittee compared prices of prescription drugs in the numerous \ndistricts around the country with the prices of prescription drugs in \nCanada. Those comparisons found price differentials in the exact same \nballpark that we found in Minnesota. It is no wonder that Minnesota \nseniors are willing to spend their time and money to go across the \nborder to buy their prescription medications. And the same is happening \nall over New England, in the Dakotas, in Montana, in Washington state, \nand elsewhere.\n\n  Yet, at the same time that seniors are being asked to pay these \noutrageous prices, the drug companies are reaping the benefit of \ngenerous governmental subsidies. There's something wrong with a system \nthat gives drug companies huge tax breaks while allowing them to price-\ngouge seniors. The Prescription Price Equity Act of 2000 attempts to \ncorrect this glaring inequity in a very even-handed approach. The \nmessage to pharmaceutical companies is this: So long as your company \ngives U.S. consumers a fair deal on drug prices as measured against the \nsame products sold in other OECD countries, you will continue to \nqualify for all available research tax credits. But if your company is \nfound to be fleecing American taxpayers with prices higher than those \ncharged for the same product sold in other industrialized countries, \nlike Japan, Germany, Switzerland, or Canada, then you become ineligible \nfor those tax credits.\n  I know that the pharmaceutical industry, through its trade \nassociation, PhRMA, will oppose the Prescription Price Equity Act and \nwill claim that the bill means the end of pharmaceutical research and \ndevelopment. That is complete nonsense. As shown by Congressional \nResearch Service, drug industry profits are already three times higher \nthan all other major industries. This legislation doesn't change the \ncurrent system of research tax credits at all unless drug companies \nrefuse to fairly price their U.S. products. This bills intent is by no \nmeans to reduce the U.S. Government's role in promoting research and \ndevelopment. It is simply to make clear that in return for such \nsignificant government contributions to their industry, drug companies \nmust treat American consumers fairly. Is there any reason why U.S. tax \ndollars should be used to allow drug prices to be reduced in other \nhighly developed countries, but not here at home as well? Of course \nthere is no good reason for that.\n  That is why this bill simply tells PhRMA that U.S. taxpayers will no \nlonger subsidize low prices in the OECD countries with our tax code. \nResearch and development is important and that is why we give these \nhuge tax breaks, but that research and development does little good for \nU.S. consumers who can't afford to buy the products of that research.\n  This bill does not solve the biggest underlying problem that \nAmerica's senior citizens face. Only a comprehensive, prescription drug \nbenefit, available to and affordable by all Medicare beneficiaries will \ndo that. I have introduced and cosponsored legislation that can make \nthat happen. But this bill, the Prescription Price Equity Act, \nnonetheless, sends an important message. It makes clear that the \npriority of the Federal Government in subsidizing research and \ndevelopment is to make sure that the miracles of modern medicine that \nresult are at least equally available to American citizens as\n\n[[Page S2944]]\n\nthey are to those in the rest of the industrialized world.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON:\n  S. 2466. A bill to require the United States Trade Representative to \nenter into negotiations to eliminate price controls imposed by certain \nforeign countries on prescription drugs; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              prescription drug price control legislation\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will \ndirect the U.S. Trade Representative for the next year to negotiate \nfairer and more equal prices from foreign governmental purchasers, and, \nin the absence of success of doing so, make specific statutory \nrecommendations to this Congress.\n  This is a proposal the drug companies themselves suggested to me. I \nregard it as a constructive proposal, but not as a solution to the \nproblem standing alone. But it is a tangible result of the course I \nhave already charted, and one that came as a result of my communication \nwith drug companies of my concerns and the earlier draft of the bill I \nam introducing today.\n  The problem is a very simple one. American citizens are paying too \nmuch for prescription drugs because our companies are allowing foreign \npurchasers to pay too little for exactly the same drugs. At the very \nleast, American citizens who have spent so much of their tax money in \nfinancing the research and development of these drugs should not be \npaying more than purchasers in other countries.\n  That is the goal of each of the two bills I am introducing today, but \nwhat I really want and what the American people really want is a \nsolution and answer to this problem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 2467.

A bill to suspend for 3 years the duty on methoxyfenozide; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                         Duty Suspension Bills\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce five bills that will suspend import tariffs for three years \non five chemicals used in the manufacturing of crop protection agents, \nTriazamate, Dichloro- toluene, Aminomethylpentyne, Fenbuconazole, and \nMethoxyfenozide.\n  These chemicals are imported by Rohm and Haas Company, a \nmultinational manufacturer of specialty chemicals headquartered in \nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania. Tariffs on these products are not needed to \nprotect American industry since these chemicals are not manufactured in \nthe United States. Moreover, these chemicals have no other commercial \nend uses other than in the manufacture of pesticides used in \nagricultural applications. The revenue which would be forgone as a \nresult of the proposed suspension of duty on these chemicals is minimal \nand has been estimated at less than $227,000 per chemical over the \nentire period of the suspension.\n  These end products, used on farms around the globe, are considered \nimportant tools in the advancement of agriculture. They protect crops \nsuch as fruits, nuts, vegetables, grain and cotton, against fungal \ninfections, weeds, agricultural mites, and insects. By providing \nadequate protection for these crops, farmers are able to market healthy \nproduce and grains, while commanding the best prices for their goods.\n  Established over 90 years ago, Rohm and Haas Company has grown to \nbecome one of the world's largest manufacturers of specialty chemicals. \nWith 21,000 employees worldwide, the Company continues to maintain a \nsignificant presence throughout Pennsylvania, with research facilities \nin Newtown, Reading, and Spring House. Additionally, Rohm and Haas \nCompany provides grants which support many community organizations \nactive in the delivery of health and human services, education, and \ncivic and community improvement.\n  In consideration of the positive impact Rohm and Haas Company has on \nthe global and local communities, I urge my colleagues to support these \nbills which will suspend the duties on the import of these \nchemicals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 2473. A bill to strengthen and enhance the role of community \nantidrug coalitions by providing for the establishment of a National \nCommunity Antidrug Coalition Institute; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n  legislation establishing the national community coalition institute\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation that \nwould give support to community antidrug coalitions nation-wide. The \nNational Community Coalition Institute would strengthen and enhance the \nrole of community coalitions, to reduce and prevent drug use in \ncommunities.\n  More specifically, one of the problems we have found in implementing \nthe Drug Free Communities Program has been the inexperience of a lot of \nthe communities, particularly smaller and rural ones in knowing how to \nevaluate their efforts; get information on best practices from other, \nsuccessful coalitions, and on how to fill out grant applications. The \nNational Community Coalition Institute would improve the effectiveness \nof community coalitions by providing state-of-the-art and widely \navailable education, training, and technical assistance for coalition \nleaders and community teams. The National Community Coalition Institute \nwould ensure that communities nation-wide are adequately prepared to \nundertake the important work of building drug free communities.\n  Ultimately, the fight against drugs cannot be successful if it does \nnot start in our own backyards. I invite all of my colleagues to join \nme in supporting this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 2474. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to improve the \nachievement of cost-effectiveness results from the decisionmaking on \nselections between public workforces and private workforces for the \nperformance of a Department of Defense function; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n\n\n         The DoD COST MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT of 2000\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nAlabama, Senator Sessions, to introduce legislation that will improve \nDepartment of Defense business practices as well as assist the DoD in \nits ability to estimate cost savings, a process that has significant \nimpact in the DoD's budget process. This legislation will also result \nin improved readiness by adding a more realistic approach to the DoD's \ncost estimating process by eliminating the unknowns that the DoD faces \nin projecting its budget.\n  Today the Department of Defense is using arbitrary cost saving \nobjectives of up to $11.2 billion in its budget for Fiscal Years 2001 \nto 2005. These cost savings are projected efficiencies expected to be \nrealized through processes such as outsourcing and the OMB Circular A-\n76 process. Unfortunately, both the Government Accounting Office and \nthe Naval Audit Service have published reports stating that these \nsavings are inflated and overly optimistic.\n  The greatest cause of concern however, is the self-inflicting damage \ncaused by these overestimated savings. Once the individual services \nwithin the Department of Defense establish these arbitrary savings \ngoals, they reduce the future operating budget estimates to take into \naccount the estimated savings. But, when these predicted savings are \nnot achieved, it is the readiness accounts and modernization programs \nthat end up paying the price.\n  None of us would run our personal home finances in such a manner, and \nno business could proceed using such an accounting method. So that is \nwhat Senator Sessions, my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, \nand I want to address in this legislation. We want to establish better \nbusiness practices, so that DoD is not setting itself up for failure. \nDoD needs to take a more realistic approach in the way it estimates \nprojected savings and how it establishes performance standards to \nmeasure the impact of workforce\n\n[[Page S2945]]\n\nchanges. The DoD and the American taxpayer need to understand the \npotential impact to the readiness of our armed forces.\n  This legislation has four basic provisions that will provide improved \nbusiness practices.\n  First, this legislation requires the Department of Defense to \nestablish a system to track the costs and savings incurred through \nmanaged competitions, efficient reorganizations, and the streamlining \nof other functions currently being performed by the government through \nthe A-76 process or other re-engineering of a federal activity.\n  The data collected through the establishment of this system will \nserve two purposes. It will be compiled into a report the Department of \nDefense is required to submit to Congress each year, so that Congress \nwill have the information necessary to provide oversight of the A-76 \nprocess and other cost saving reorganizing process. The data will also \nbe used to establish a metric of current performance and current costs \nprior to outsourcing, to serve as a standard for future performance and \nfuture cost comparisons--so that the leaders within the Department of \nDefense will be able to validate the actual savings achieved and \nevaluate the maintenance of performance standards.\n  Second, this legislation requires that the cost and savings incurred \nthrough out-sourcing, strategic sourcing, or re-organizing each \nposition currently staffed by federal personnel, be projected over the \nFuture Years Defense Program. This requirement will improve savings \nestimates by including both the short and long term costs associated \nwith outsourcing, or contracting out a function.\n  The third provision of this legislation requires the Secretary of \nDefense to certify that the function analysis and decision to \noutsource, strategically source, or to maintain the current federal \nforce was not based on unfair personnel constraints that may prevent \nthe current federal organization from operating efficiently. This will \nensure that our federal workers are provided a fair chance in any \nprocess and will provide the Department of Defense the most efficient \nwork force for the actual task at hand.\n  As part of the A-76 process, the Department of Defense is required to \nconduct an evaluation of the impact on local economies and communities \nif the decision is made to convert functions currently being performed \nby government workers to the private sector. The fourth provision of \nthis legislation requires the Department of Defense to submit a \nstatement of the potential economic impact on each affected local \ncommunity. This notification will provide Congress and our constituents \nthe opportunity to better understand these impacts.\n  Mr. President, in the short term, this legislation will require \nsignificant changes in the way the Department of Defense conducts its \nprocesses. But in the long term this legislation will yield significant \nbenefit. These four provisions are based on the recommendations of \nexperts in the U.S. General Accounting Office and the Naval Audit \nService. By enforcing better business practices--which is what this \nlegislation effectively does--the long term effects will benefit the \nDepartment of Defense by improving the accuracy of cost and savings \nestimates, stabilizing the budget, and protecting modernization \nprograms.\n  Additionally, the benefits will extend to the current federal \nworkforce, who will be guaranteed the opportunity to compete on an \nequal basis, and the local communities surrounding these agencies will \nbe able to better understand the impact of any decisions that are made.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe that this legislation supports the \nbest interests of the Department of Defense and the federal work force. \nI urge my colleagues to review this legislation--and I am confident \nthat they will see it's merits and join me and support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/26/senate-section/article/S2945-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2945-S2947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 514\n\n  At the request of Mr. Cochran, the name of the Senator from Oregon \n(Mr. Wyden) was added as a cosponsor of S. 514, a bill to improve the \nNational Writing Project.\n\n\n                                 S. 866\n\n  At the request of Mr. Conrad, the name of the Senator from Nebraska \n(Mr. Kerrey) was added as a cosponsor of S. 866, a bill to direct the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to revise existing regulations \nconcerning the conditions of participation for hospitals and ambulatory \nsurgical centers under the medicare program relating to certified \nregistered nurse anesthetists' services to make the regulations \nconsistent with State supervision requirements.\n\n\n                                 S. 890\n\n  At the request of Mr. Wellstone, the name of the Senator from Hawaii \n(Mr. Akaka) was added as a cosponsor of S. 890, a bill to facilitate \nthe naturalization of aliens who served with special guerrilla units or \nirregular forces in Laos.\n\n\n                                 S. 934\n\n  At the request of Mr. Leahy, the names of the Senator from New York \n(Mr. Schumer) and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin) were added as \ncosponsors of S. 934, a bill to enhance rights and protections for \nvictims of crime.\n\n\n                                S. 1277\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland (Mr. L.
