Indeed, who are we \nwithout You at the center of our lives? What value is all that we know, \nvast accumulation though it be, but a chipped fragment if we do not \nknow You, Author of wisdom? What is the sum of all our stirring and \nworking, even in this mighty Chamber, but a half-finished work if we do \nnot know You, Creator of galaxies, and Star-spark of life within us?\n  We know, Lord of all nations, that You have always taken more than a \npassing interest in the ways and works of all those women and men to \nwhom You have granted stewardship of government and leadership in the \nnations of the world.\n  So it is, that at the beginning of this day, we pray for all who \nserve here; from the President pro tempore and Senators, to the pages \nand staff, from the reporters and Capitol police to the people who \nraise the flags over us.\n  We call upon You, Gracious God, that these persons whom You love may \non this day be encountered by the glad surprise of Your Grace, and come \nto know You in the midst of their work on bahalf of the Nation.\n  Today, in the press of the calendar and stress of the schedule; grant \nthem moments of Your peace.\n  Today, under the burden of issues which rearrange human destiny: \ngrant them a clear vision of Your zeal for truth and justice.\n  Today, amidst the seductiveness of their power; grant them courage to \nlive and work on the side of Your power.\n  Today, as they labor here, guard their families, heal their wounds, \nrestore their relationships to health.\n  And as the day wanes, revive their sagging spirits and forgive their \nshortcomings. Turn them away from the temptation of bitterness and \nblame, so that in the darkest hour of the night they might trust Your \never-present redeeming grace and come to know that You love them. O \nLord of all nations, hear our prayer.

Mr. President, we look forward to today's activities. We \nhope we can move forward with an up-or-down vote on these two \nnominations. We also are looking forward to the legislative skills of \nthe chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Gramm, to get us to the \npoint where we can again work on the Export Administration Act, which \nwas considered yesterday for a brief period of time. This legislation \nis extremely important to the country. It is important not only to the \nhigh-tech industry but our economy generally. There is not a piece of \nlegislation that is more important to move along than this one as it \nwill allow us to compete with foreign nations in the exportation of \ncomputers and other high-tech equipment. This is something that needs \nto be done, and we hope that in the week we get back from our break, we \ncan move into a very productive session, taking care of the Export \nAdministration Act, doing something about prescription drugs, and other \nwaiting legislative matters, also recognizing that the minority is \nwilling to work in conjunction with the majority in any way to move all \nlegislation. I think we showed our good faith last week when we were \nable to move such a large amount of legislation including amendments on \nthe education tax initiative that was put forth by the majority.\n  So we look forward to completing today's work and, after next week, \ndoing the many things that burden us legislatively.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1335-7", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1335-S1336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo).

The Senate will now return to executive \nsession and resume postcloture debate on the two Ninth Circuit judicial \nnominations which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nominations of Marsha L. Berzon, of \nCalifornia, and Richard A. Paez, of California, to be United States \nCircuit Judges for the Ninth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Smith, shall be in control of up to 3 hours of total \ndebate on both nominations and the Democratic leader or his designee \nshall be in control of up to 1.5 hours of total debate on both \nnominations.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, as we have gone through \nthis debate, although my name was not attached to anything in terms of \na filibuster, it is no secret that I have been the person who has \nfilibustered these two nominees, Judge Berzon and Judge Paez. The issue \nis, why are we here? What is the role of the Senate in judicial \nnominations?\n  The Constitution gave the Senate the advise-and-consent role. We are \nsupposed to advise the President and consent if we think the judge \nshould be put on the court. We do not get very much opportunity to \nadvise because the President just sends these nominations up here--he \ndoes not seek our advice--and then we are asked to consent.\n  Based on some of the comments that have been made to me privately and \nsome of the things I have read publicly, it seems as if the Senate \nshould be a rubber stamp, that we should just approve every judge who \ncomes down the line and not do anything with the advise-and-consent \nrole. That is not the way I read the Constitution.\n  I believe that is wrong. We have an obligation under the Constitution \nto review these judges very carefully. I have certainly voted for more \nthan my share of judicial nominations this President has put forth. But \nI point out that the two nominees before us, in terms of their legal \nopinions--and that is all we are talking about; we are not talking \nabout any personal matters other than their legal opinions--I believe \nare activist judges; they are out of the mainstream of American \nthought, and I do not think either one should be put on the court. The \nbottom line is they are controversial judges.\n  I was criticized by some for filibustering, that ``we are on a \ndangerous precedent'' of filibustering judges. The filibuster is over. \nWe are now on the judges. The filibuster is a nonissue.\n  Filibuster in the Senate has a purpose. It is not simply to delay for \nthe sake of delay. It is to get information. It is to take the time to \ndebate and to find out about what a judge's thoughts are and how he or \nshe might act once they are placed on the court.\n  I was told by some of my colleagues yesterday that we are going down \n``a dangerous path'' to debate these judges and slow them down, whether \nit be through a filibuster or debate in this Chamber. My colleagues \nwill find there will be very few people who will speak in the roughly 3 \nhours on our side under my control. That is sad. I believe we should \nair the concerns we have.\n  As far as the issue of going down a dangerous path and a dangerous \nprecedent, that we somehow have never gone before, as I pointed out \nyesterday and I reiterate this morning, since 1968, 13 judges have been \nfilibustered by both political parties appointed by Presidents of both \npolitical parties, starting in 1968 with Abe Fortas and coming all the \nway forth to these two judges today.\n  It is not a new path to argue and to discuss information about these \njudges. In fact, Mr. President, Chief Justice William Rehnquist sat in \nyour chair about a year ago finishing up the impeachment trial of \nPresident William Jefferson Clinton. When William Rehnquist was \nnominated to the Court, he was filibustered twice. Then after he was on \nthe Court, he was filibustered again when asked to become the Chief \nJustice. In that filibuster, it is interesting to note, things that \nhappened prior to him sitting on the Court were regurgitated and \ndiscussed. So I do not want to hear that I am going down some trail the \nSenate has never gone down before by talking about these judges and \ndelaying. It is simply not true. I resent any argument to the contrary \nbecause it is simply not true.\n\n  I will talk a bit about the Ninth Circuit on which these two judges \nare about to go. Make no mistake about it, this is going to be a tough \nvote to win. I know that. But it does not mean the fight should not be \nmade. We are all judged as Senators based on what we do, what we say, \nand how we act. History will judge us, as it has judged the great \nSenators such as Clay, Calhoun, and Webster who debated the great \nissues before and during the Civil War. We are judged on what positions \nwe take. Maybe history will prove a Senator is right; maybe history \nwill prove a Senator is wrong. When it comes time to make that vote, \none does not have anyplace to hide. One has to make it and take the \nconsequences one way or the other. I do what I do with the best \ninformation I have.\n  I can assure my colleagues that I have researched both of these \njudges very carefully. I have looked at the Ninth Circuit very \ncarefully, and I have grave concerns about two very controversial \njudges being placed on a very controversial circuit court, the ninth. \nThis is a renegade circuit court that is out of the mainstream of \nAmerican jurisprudence. It has been reversed by the Supreme Court 90 \npercent of the time. It is important to let that sink in. Ninety \npercent of the decisions this Ninth Circuit has made have been \noverturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I want to repeat some of those statistics. From 1999 to now, 7 of 7, \n100 percent of their cases, have been reversed. In 1998 to 1999, 13 of \n18 were reversed, 72 percent.\n  From 1997 to 1998, 14 of 17, or 82 percent, were overturned. We can \ngo on and on. From 1996 to 1997, 27 of 28 cases this court gave a \ndecision on were overturned, 96 percent. From 1995 to 1996, 10 of 12 \nwere overturned, 83 percent--and on and on and on. The average is: 90 \npercent of the cases were overturned in the past 6 years. There have \nbeen 84 reversals in the last 98 cases. That is an abysmal record, to \nput it mildly.\n  The Ninth Circuit is routinely issuing activist opinions. While the \nSupreme Court has been able to correct some of these abuses, the record \nis replete with antidemocratic, antibusiness, and procriminal decisions \nwhich distort the legitimate concerns and democratic participation of \nthe residents of the Ninth Circuit. Some of the more outrageous \nopinions include striking down NEA decency standards, creating a \n``right-to-die,'' blocking an abortion parental consent law, and a slew \nof obstructionist death penalty decisions.\n  I hope the American people and my colleagues understand that when you \nhear these terrible stories about prisoners getting out after 5 years, \nor people committing terrible crimes and never going to jail or getting \npardoned or getting lenient sentences, this is not an accident. This \nhappens because of the people we put on the court.\n  We are here as Senators to advise and consent, or not to consent, on \nthe basis of these nominees. How many times do you read in the paper \nsome judge let some criminal out, and the guy committed a crime again \nand again, and he got out again and did it again? It goes on and on--\nstalking, rape, murder, robbery, armed robbery, assault, over and over \nand over again. Time after time after time we hear about that \nhappening. We sit around our living rooms at night, we watch \ntelevision, we talk to each other, our families, and ask: Why did this \nhappen? What in the world is the matter with the judges?\n\n[[Page S1337]]\n\n  I say, with all due respect, when you have judges who are this far \nleft out of the mainstream, surely out of the hundreds and hundreds of \njudges all over America, on the various district courts in this \ncountry, we can find somebody to serve on the circuit court who is not \nthis controversial.\n  That is the bottom line. That is what this debate is about. That is \nwhy I am here on the floor. That is why, even though I know I am going \nto lose, I want this case made. That is why I have asked for the time \nto do it.\n  Again, the Senate, and particularly Republican Senators from Ninth \nCircuit States, are on record in favor of splitting this court; it is \nso controversial, making it into two circuits.\n  There was a commission called the White commission that recommended a \nsubstantial overhaul of the circuit's procedures, and that has not been \nimplemented. It found that the circuit has so many judges that they are \nunable to monitor each other's decisions and they rarely have a chance \nto work together. That is what is going on. There are so many judges \nthey cannot even monitor the decisions.\n  The Ninth Circuit covers 38 percent of the country, more than twice \nas much as any other circuit. It covers 50 million people, more than 20 \nmillion more than any other circuit. Not surprisingly, it has the most \nfilings in the country.\n  President Clinton has already appointed 10 judges to the circuit. \nDemocratic appointees compromise 15 of the 22 slots currently occupied. \nThere is no need to put more controversial nominees on the court from a \nlame duck President.\n\n  Paez and Berzon have attracted significant opposition both within and \noutside the Senate. Both were reported out of the Judiciary Committee \nby a 10-8 vote. That is a pretty narrow vote. Neither would move the \ncircuit to the mainstream. In fact, they are activist judges.\n  In Paez' case, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is officially opposed to \nthe Paez nomination, principally due to his decision in the Unocal case \nin 1997 allowing U.S. companies to be sued for the human rights abuses \nof foreign governments. Think about that. How would you like to be a \nU.S. company and be sued for the human rights violations and abuses of \na foreign government? That is the way Paez ruled.\n  The letter notes the chamber's serious concern about a judge pursuing \na foreign policy agenda in this fashion and argues that it ``has the \npotential to cause significant disruption in the U.S. and world \nmarkets.''\n  The Judicial Selection Monitoring Project at Free Congress Foundation \ncirculated a letter signed by 300 grassroots organizations opposing \nthis nomination. The letter highlights Paez's 1995 Boalt Hall \ninappropriate remarks regarding pending ballot initiatives, on the \nbelief that he ``is an activist judge,'' and his lack of ``judicial \ntemperament.''\n  The ACLU of Southern California applauded his nomination as ``a \nwelcome change after all the pro-law enforcement people we've seen \nappointed to the state and federal courts.'' Think about that statement \nby the ACLU. No matter what you think about the ACLU, let me repeat \nthat statement. They stated, this nomination is ``a welcome change \nafter all the pro-law enforcement people we've seen appointed to the \nstate and federal courts.'' What does that tell you about this guy? I \nam telling you, my colleagues, I really wish we would stop and think \nabout what we are doing.\n  Even the Washington Post, not exactly a bastion of conservatism, \nstated, in an October 29, 1999, editorial: ``Republican opposition to \n[Paez] is not entirely frivolous.'' It argued that his Boalt Hall \nspeech was ``inappropriate'' and that a ``principled conservative could \nsuspect, based on Judge Paez' comments, that he might be sympathetic to \nsuch [liberal activist] thinking and would be more generally a liberal \nactivist on the bench.''\n  That is the Washington Post's nice way of saying: This guy may not be \nthat good after all.\n  There is a lot of evidence out here. You have to understand the \nframework: A liberal activist court that has been overturned 90 percent \nof the time--the Ninth Circuit--and now we put a judge on there who is \nbeing lauded as ``a welcome change'' after all the prolaw enforcement \npeople we have seen on the court.\n  I say to the American people and my colleagues, when you hear stories \nabout people getting out of jail or not going to jail or committing \ncrimes over and over and over again--and you ask yourself: Oh, those \nliberal judges, what are we going to do about them?--ask your Senators \nwhat they did about liberal judges when they came before the Senate, \nbefore we put them on the court. That is a legitimate question: Do you \nsupport people who are lauded because they are antilaw enforcement? \nMaybe you ought to ask them that question because that is exactly what \nis happening.\n  In Berzon's case, the Berzon nomination was described by the National \nRight to Work Committee as the ``worst judicial nomination President \nClinton has ever made.'' She has been associate general counsel of the \nAFL-CIO since 1987 and has represented unions in the automobile, steel, \nelectrical, garment, airline, Government, teachers, and other sectors \nboth in a day-to-day capacity and in appellate practice.\n\n  Among the positions she has espoused which courts have rejected: One, \nState bars should be able to use compulsory dues of objecting members \nfor lobbying. That is the way she ruled. You are forced, as a member of \na union, to give dues. You are forced to allow those dues to be used \nfor lobbying for something with which you disagree. The bottom line is: \nI want my job. I pay my union dues. And on top of that, they rub my \nnose in it further by saying: Now, in addition to that, we are going to \nspend money lobbying for something you disapprove of. She ruled yes; \nshe would do that.\n  Secondly, unions should be able to prohibit members from resigning \nduring a strike. So somebody goes on strike, they decide they want to \nperhaps do something else, resign, for whatever reason--how about if it \nis for their health?--she is prohibiting them from resigning during a \nstrike. What does that mean? If somebody has a heart attack, they \ncannot quit?\n  What have we come to in this country? You should not be surprised \nwhen you hear about these outrageous decisions coming down through the \ncourts because we are putting the people on the courts who give us \nthese outrageous decisions. We do not deal with it in a forthright \nmanner.\n  There are better judges than this. Bill Clinton can bring better \njudges than this before the Senate. Frankly, he has, and they have been \napproved. They may not believe everything to my way of thinking, but he \nis the President. But we do not want judges who are so far over to the \nleft that they swing the pendulum way over there against what American \npeople want.\n  Another opinion she has espoused which courts have rejected is: \nUnions should be able to use nonmembers to subsidize union litigation \nin organizing. That is the way she ruled.\n  She describes herself as a believer in the labor movement, which is \nfine, but when you come on the court with an agenda, the Constitution \nshould be your agenda, not labor, not a conservative or liberal or \nmoderate cause. No, the Constitution should be your cause. If it is not \nconstitutional, then you should not be for it.\n\n  The bottom line: The Senate should not confirm more judges to the \nNinth Circuit unless and until its structure is reformed, and unless \nthe nominee will help bring the circuit's jurisprudence back into the \nmainstream. This is clearly not the case with Judge Paez or Marsha \nBerzon. Neither nominee should be confirmed. It is that simple.\n  Now, let's look at some of the politics of the Ninth Circuit. In the \nWashington Times yesterday, Wednesday, March 8, was an article by \nThomas Jipping:\n\n       Politics of the Ninth Circuit. Senators should reject \n     judicial nominees.\n\n  I want to read one paragraph out of that op-ed piece:\n\n       The Senate this week will vote on two of the most \n     controversial judicial nominations in recent memory. The \n     result may well demonstrate whether Republicans deserve their \n     majority status.\n       President Clinton has nominated U.S. District Judge Richard \n     Paez and labor lawyer Marsha Berzon to the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Nearly twice as large as other \n     circuits, it may also be the most influential, which is \n     unfortunate because even the liberal New York Times calls it \n     ``the country's most liberal appeals court.'' Two-\n\n[[Page S1338]]\n\n     thirds of its judges are Democratic appointees. The Supreme \n     Court has reversed its decision 90 percent of the time over \n     the past 6 years--far more than any other circuit. And in \n     1996, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote, ``Some panels of the \n     Ninth Circuit have a hard time saying no to any litigant with \n     a hard luck story.'' In its 1997-98 term, the Supreme Court \n     reversed 27 of the 28 Ninth Circuit decisions it reviewed, 17 \n     unanimously and 7 without either briefing or oral argument. \n     Because this aggressive activism so grossly distorts the law, \n     many Senators have long urged special scrutiny of Ninth \n     Circuit nominees.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this entire article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, March 8, 2000]\n\n                     Politics of the Ninth Circuit\n\n\n                Senators should reject judicial nominees\n\n                         (By Thomas L. Jipping)\n\n       The Senate this week will vote on two of the most \n     controversial judicial nominations in recent memory. The \n     result may well demonstrate whether Republicans deserve their \n     majority status.\n       President Clinton has nominated U.S. District Judge Richard \n     Paez and labor lawyer Marsha Berzon to the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

In 1996, \n     Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote that ``some panels of the Ninth \n     Circuit have a hard time saying no to any litigant with a \n     hard-luck story.'' In its 1997-98 term, the Supreme Court \n     reversed 27 of the 28 Ninth Circuit decisions it reviewed, 17 \n     unanimously and seven without either briefing or oral \n     argument. Because this aggressive activism so grossly \n     distorts the law, many senators have long urged special \n     scrutiny of Ninth Circuit nominees.\n       Even ordinary scrutiny shows that these nominees will push \n     that court further in the wrong direction. The L.A. Daily \n     Journal quotes Judge Paez, who calls himself a liberal, \n     describing his own aggressively activist judicial philosophy. \n     Courts, he says, must tackle political questions that \n     ``perhaps ideally and preferably should be resolved through \n     the legislative process.'' America's Founders, however, did \n     not suggest that legislatures exercise legislative power \n     merely as an ideal or a preference; the first article of the \n     Constitution they established, and that Judge Paez is sworn \n     to uphold, states that ``all legislative powers'' are granted \n     only to the legislature.\n       The L.A. Times says Judge Paez was a liberal state court \n     judge. When nominated to the federal district bench, no less \n     an arbiter of liberalism than the American Civil Liberties \n     Union considered him ``a welcome change after all the pro \n     law-enforcement people we've seen appointed.''\n       Judge Paez struck down a Los Angeles anti-panhandling \n     ordinance enacted after a panhandler killed a young man over \n     a quarter. He ruled that companies doing business overseas \n     can be held liable for human rights abuses committed by \n     foreign governments. The Institute for International \n     Economics says this novel ruling would ``vastly expand the \n     jurisdiction of the U.S. court system.'' The U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce, which normally steers clear of nomination fights, \n     cites this decision in opposing Judge Paez. His decision \n     against any jail time for U.S. Rep. Jay Kim, guilty of the \n     largest admitted receipt of illegal campaign contributions in \n     congressional history, prompted the newspaper Roll Call to \n     suggest that Judge Paez may be ``too soft on criminals to be \n     an appellate judge.''\n       The nominee also appears to place politics ahead of both \n     judicial impartiality and independence. In a 1995 speech, for \n     example, he attacked two California ballot initiatives while \n     they were still in litigation even though the judicial code \n     of conduct prohibited him from comments that ``cast \n     reasonable doubt on [his] capacity to decide impartially any \n     issue that may come before [him].''\n       Marsha Berzon's record may be as a lawyer and not a judge, \n     but the clues lead to the same conclusion. Her training in \n     the political use of the law had early impetus as a law clerk \n     to activist Supreme Court Justice William Brennan and \n     continued with membership or leadership of activist legal \n     organizations such as the Brennan Center for Justice and \n     Women's Legal Defense Fund. Hers is not benign disinterest; \n     the political agenda these groups pursue in the courts, she \n     says, hold ``a lot of importance and meaning for me.''\n       Miss Berzon repeatedly pressed extreme arguments that \n     ignored the plain meaning of statutes and Supreme Court \n     precedent, the very hallmarks of judicial activism. These \n     include arguing that state bar associations can use \n     compulsory dues of objecting members for political \n     lobbying and that the right to refuse to join a labor \n     union is somehow less protected by the First Amendment \n     than other speech. These and other aspects of her \n     controversial record made her one of only two Clinton \n     nominees ever to receive eight negative votes in the \n     Judiciary Committee.\n       Senators concerned about a politicized judiciary should \n     find these nominations easy to oppose. Three things stand in \n     the way. First, since a politicized judiciary is impossible \n     to defend, its advocates stoop to playing the race and sex \n     cards. Mr. Clinton first chooses women and minorities as some \n     of his most radical nominees. Senators who would oppose white \n     males with the same record face those dreaded labels \n     ``racist'' and ``sexist'' if they don't create a double-\n     standard and vote for these. Hopefully, senators will reject \n     this perverse tactic and focus on the record which has led \n     more than 300 grassroots organizations to oppose Judge Paez.\n       Second, those who cannot defend a politicized judiciary \n     continue playing the numbers game. Batting 338-1 so far, \n     however, Mr. Clinton has appointed more than 44 percent of \n     all federal judges in active service. Democratic appointees \n     now outnumber Republicans throughout the judiciary.\n       Third, the lure of patronage tempts individual senators to \n     put their personal interests ahead of the country's \n     interests. Rejecting these radical nominees means showing \n     Americans that the Republican Party stands for at least basic \n     principles of the rule of law and a judiciary independent \n     from politics.\n       In 1993, then-Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole appeared on a \n     live public affairs television show and a caller criticizes \n     him for failing to block Mr. Clinton's judicial nominees. He \n     responded: ``Give us a majority and if we don't produce, you \n     ought to throw us out.'' Americans gave Republicans the \n     majority and rejecting the Berzon and Paez nominations is \n     their chance to produce.\n\n  Think about that. When you think about the makeup of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, there are some liberal justices there and some conservative \njustices there, but some of these decisions have been overturned \nunanimously; that is, with Scalia, Thomas, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg on \nthe same vote. So they have to be outrageous to get that kind of \nsupport to overturn it. That is the whole point. So why are we adding \nmore fuel to the fire?\n  I want to break into some categories here and a few of the Court's \ndecisions on the Ninth Circuit. Let's look at criminal justice for a \nmoment. It is very notorious for its anti-law enforcement record, as I \nsaid. And, again, Judge Paez is being praised for his anti-law \nenforcement status. So we are going to put another judge on the court \nthat is anti-law enforcement, and he is being praised because he is \nbeing put on there.\n  In Morales v. California, 1996, the circuit struck down the \nCalifornia State law governing when defendants could present claims \nduring habeas corpus appeals which had not been made during appeals in \nState courts. According to the California-based Criminal Justice Legal \nFoundation, this holding opened ``the doors to a flood of claims that \nwould be barred anywhere else in the country.''\n  In U.S. v. Watts, in 1996, the Supreme Court issued summary reversals \nin two cases without even hearing arguments after the Ninth Circuit \nallowed past acquittals to be considered during sentencing. They are so \noutrageous they just rule.\n  In Calderon v. Thompson, in 1998, the Supreme Court reversed the \nNinth Circuit's decision to block the scheduled execution of a \nconvicted rapist and murderer with a bizarre and rarely used procedural \nmaneuver, calling it a ``grave abuse of discretion.''\n  In Stewart v. LeGrand, 1999, the circuit blocked an execution on the \ngrounds that the gas chamber was cruel and unusual punishment. The \nSupreme Court reversed that without even hearing the arguments.\n  So over and over and over again, we are hearing these arguments about \nhow bad this court is.\n  I know there are other speakers on the floor on both sides here. So I \nam going to suspend in a moment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader be \nrecognized at 12:30 for up to 20 minutes relative to the pending \nnominations, and the 20 minutes be considered as time used under the \ncontrol of Senator Smith.\n  I further ask consent that the votes scheduled to occur at 2 p.m. \ntoday be postponed to now occur at 2:15 p.m. under the same terms as \noutlined in the previous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the sincerity of the Senator from New \nHampshire. But I also recognize that sincerity sometimes does not \ncreate the facts that are necessary to substantiate the sincerity.\n\n[[Page S1339]]\n\n  With the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, what we have to understand \nis that, yes, they have been reversed a lot of times. For example, \nduring the 1995-1996 term, five other circuits had higher reversal \nrates than the Ninth Circuit.\n  I also say to my friend that if you take, for example, this past \nyear, we have had seven reversals so far. Four of them have come from \njudges who wrote the opinions and were appointed by Presidents Reagan \nand Bush.\n\n  The Supreme Court reverses most cases they take from the circuits. \nThat is what they do. With the Ninth Circuit, they have thousands of \ncases. There are 51 million people who live within it. Mr. President, I \nthink there is some substance to the fact that we need to take a look \nat the Ninth Circuit. Maybe it is too big. Maybe we need to revamp how \nit operates. But don't pick on Berzon and Paez because of that.\n  Also, Judge Paez is a very nice man. He graduated from one of the \nmost conservative universities in the entire country, Brigham Young \nUniversity. He went to one of the finest law schools in America, Boalt \nHall, University of California Berkeley. It is always rated in the top \n10. It is a fine, fine law school. His record is one of significant \ndistinction. Here is a man who is unquestionably qualified for the \nNinth Circuit or any other court. He has been a judge for 18 years. \nThey have pored over all of the decisions he has made and they found \nrelatively nothing.\n  I can't help what the ACLU says, but I can relate to you that there \nare many organizations that support his nomination and that are law \nenforcement-oriented organizations. We can talk about the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations; the Los Angeles Police Protective \nAssociation; the Los Angeles County Sheriff, Sherman Block, who \nrecognizes his skills; Los Angeles District Attorney Garcetti; James \nRogan, a Republican House Member and member of the impeachment team \nhere just a year ago, supports Judge Paez. The Los Angeles County \nPolice Chiefs Association, the Association for Los Angeles Deputy \nSheriffs, Incorporated, and its president, Pete Brodie, support him.\n  Also, there has been some talk about how antibusiness Judge Paez is. \nI don't really want to get into this, but the simple fact is that in a \nvery important decision in California--an issue in a very important \ndiscovery matter--he ruled for Philip Morris, the largest tobacco \ncompany in America. Does that mean he is protobacco? He also ruled in \nfavor of the Isuzu Motor Company in a suit against the Consumers Union. \nDoes that mean he is pro-foreign car manufacturers? Does that mean he \nis pro-big business? The answer is no. The Unocal case shows that he is \na judge who follows the law and plays no favorites, as indicated in the \nPhilip Morris case and the Isuzu Motor Company case.\n  His preliminary ruling in the Unocal case to dismiss may have \ndispleased the company. His decision on that issue no more proves he is \nantibusiness than he is protobacco or pro-big automobile manufacturer.\n  There has been some talk that this man is antireligion. He is not \nantireligion. In fact, the case they continually refer to is a case \nwhere they are saying he said you can't use a Bible in the courtroom. \nHere is an exact transcript as to what he told the defendant. This is \nin court. Everybody was there. He says:\n\n       I don't have a problem with the Bible. I don't care if you \n     have it there on the table. My concern is I don't want any \n     attempt to sway the jury. I don't want any demonstrative \n     gesture that is not proper.\n\n  That is the end of the quote.\n  The report also says he told the defendants he would consider \npermitting the defendants to quote the Bible during closing arguments \nor to carry the book to the witness stand when they testified. I am not \nsure I would allow that if I were a judge. But he decided he would do \nit.\n  I have tried a lot of cases. When somebody comes up to that jury \nstand, it would be my personal opinion that it is improper to carry the \nBible up there. I just do not think it is appropriate. Judge Paez \nbelieved it would be.\n  There has been some talk that he has bad judicial temperament. The \nAlmanac of the Federal Judiciary isn't written about Democrats, \nRepublicans, conservatives, or liberals. It includes reviews from \nattorneys who have appeared before all the Federal judges. They not \nonly have the ability to look at his Federal judicial record but also \nhis 13 years as a State judge in California where he served in the \ncourts of unlimited jurisdiction. The Almanac for 1999 that reviews \nboth his State court experience and his Federal court experience says:\n\n       Lawyers reported that Paez had an excellent judicial \n     temperament.\n\n  Some of the quotes from these lawyers include:\n\n       I think he has great temperament.\n       He has a very good demeanor.\n       He is professional.\n       He doesn't have any quirks.\n       He is very good in the courtroom.\n       He is courteous to everyone.\n\n  I think we should have an up-or-down vote on Judge Paez and Ms. \nBerzon.\n  I heard the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the \nsenior Senator from the State of Utah, talk about Ms. Berzon. He talked \nabout what a great legal mind she has. You may not like her clients. \nShe has done a lot of work for organized labor. But no one questions \nher qualities. She has a very fine, incisive political mind and will be \na great addition to the Ninth Circuit.\n  As I have said, the Ninth Circuit is something of which I am very \nproud. I am proud of the Ninth Circuit. I fought when there was an \nattempt to split Nevada off from California. I practiced law in Nevada \nand in the courts in Nevada. Whether we like it or not, I fought the \nlandmark decision made in the State of California. I fought to make \nsure Nevada would remain part of the California circuit.\n  I also am very proud of the Ninth Circuit because the senior judge, \nthe man who is the administrative head of the Ninth Circuit Court and \nthe chief judge of the Ninth Circuit, is a Nevadan, Judge Proctor Hug, \nJr. He is a man who has a great legal mind. He excelled academically at \nStanford Law School, and he has excelled on the Ninth Circuit.\n  I don't know, but I would bet that Judge Hug has written some \nopinions that have been reversed. That doesn't make him a bad man or a \nbad lawyer.\n  I hope we will look closely at what we are doing here. Judge Paez has \na great record in the courtroom, in the classroom, and in the world and \nsociety in which he lives. He is a fine man, as is Marsha Berzon.\n  I hope we can move forward with these nominations. I hope there is an \noverwhelming vote. I think it would send a great message out of this \nSenate that we need to start doing things on a bipartisan basis. We \nhear the call for that all the time. There is no clearer example to \nshow that than by voting overwhelmingly for these fine people--Judge \nPaez and Marsha Berzon. Both have established in their lives records of \nsuperior quality.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you very much. I just arrived on the \nfloor. I listened to some of the extensive remarks made by my friend \nfrom New Hampshire, Senator Smith. I really came over to refute some of \nthose remarks and some of those comments.\n  I have been through this fight over the judicial nominations once \nbefore. When Margaret Morrow was nominated and kept on the hook, people \ncame to the floor of the Senate and said she was an activist, a \nliberal--the same buzzwords we are hearing. These buzzwords are: ``Out \nof control,'' ``liberal''--all of these words.\n  That was a great speech. But, unfortunately, it doesn't have anything \nto do with Margaret Morrow, who is as mainstream and as apple pie as \nyou can get.\n  I say to my friend from New Hampshire, because I know people have \nvaried opinions of this President, President Clinton, that I happen to \nthink he has brought us out of the deepest, darkest economic nightmare \nwe ever faced and I think will go down in history for that. But that is \nup to the historians. There is one thing about this President that I \ndon't think anyone would refute. He is a pragmatist. He knows what he \ncan get through this Senate. He certainly knows that if he puts someone \nbefore the Senate who is not in the mainstream, they are not going to \nget confirmed. He is not going to go through the exercise. It is very\n\n[[Page S1340]]\n\npainful for people to be nominated if they have no chance of being \napproved by the Senate. This President doesn't do that. In all my \nrecommendations to him, and in all of Senator Feinstein's \nrecommendations to him, we have been very careful to make sure we \nrefute things.\n  I hope the Senator from New Hampshire will appreciate this.\n  If I believe a judicial nominee is not going to pass the mainstream \ntest, I don't even bother with it. If I don't believe a judicial \nnominee has Republican support, I will not even bother with it.\n  I have had several conversations with Chairman Hatch. He has been \nvery clear. He says: Barbara, you are not going to get people through \nwho are not in the mainstream. You are not going to get people through \nwho do not have bipartisan support. You will not get people through who \ndo not have law enforcement support.\n  Yesterday, as Senator Sessions was speaking--believe me, I respect \nboth of my colleagues' right to vote against these two nominations, if \nthey so choose--I pointed out this wonderful record of support these \ntwo candidates have from Republicans and Democrats alike in law \nenforcement. My goodness, Sheldon Sloan, the head of Governor Pete \nWilson's Judicial Advisory Committee, is the one who is backing Judge \nPaez.\n  Listen to this. I will repeat it. The head of Governor Pete Wilson's \nJudicial Advisory Committee is backing Richard Paez.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record several \neditorials supporting Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Feb. 6, 2000]\n\n                    Judge Deserves Rousing Approval\n\n       Perhaps this week the full Senate will finally take up the \n     nomination of Judge Richard Paez to a seat on the U.S. Court \n     of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. With a decisive vote to \n     confirm Paez, the Senate can redeem itself after its \n     disgraceful treatment of this worthy jurist.\n       Paez, since 1964 a federal district judge in Los Angeles, \n     was first nominated for the appellate bench by President \n     Clinton more than four years ago. No nominee in memory has \n     waited longer for a confirmation vote, a reflection on the \n     Senate.\n       The first time the Senate Judiciary Committee considered \n     his nomination, it refused to act, and the second time it \n     voted approval, only to have the nomination die when Senate \n     leaders refused to call an up-or-down vote. Last July, the \n     panel once again forwarded Paez's name to the Senate, with \n     committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and one other \n     Republican supporting the judge. But not until November did \n     Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) agree to set a Senate \n     vote for March. Now March is upon us and Lott says he will \n     deliver on his promise of a floor vote.\n       On the bench and before that as an attorney, Paez, a 52-\n     year-old Latino, has earned a reputation for being \n     thoughtful, fair and committed to civil rights. He would be \n     an asset to the circuit court.\n       Republican leaders, whose treatment of Paez and other \n     nominees stems from their deep animus toward President \n     Clinton, are now anxious to cast themselves as an inclusive \n     lot after divisive debates over religion and race in the \n     presidential primary campaigns. A resounding vote to confirm \n     Judge Paez is a good place to start.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Jan. 20, 2000]\n\n                    Infamous Anniversary for Courts\n\n       Next Tuesday, four long years will have passed since \n     President Clinton first nominated U.S. District Judge Richard \n     A. Paez to a seat on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. It's a \n     sorry moment.\n       The Senate has long toyed with Clinton's judicial nominees, \n     grilling them mercilessly at Judiciary Committee hearings, \n     then deep-freezing the nominations by refusing to call an up-\n     or-down floor vote. No one has waited as long as Paez. First \n     nominated to the 9th Circuit on Jan. 25, 1996, Paez, now 52, \n     has been before the Judiciary Committee three times. Once, \n     the committee refused to act; once, it approved him only to \n     have the Senate let his nomination die by failing to vote. \n     Last July, the committee approved Paez again, but the Senate \n     still has not voted.\n       Why the delays? What so troubles Senate leaders about Paez? \n     An extensive review of Paez's record, on the federal trial \n     bench and, before that, on the Los Angeles Municipal Court \n     and as a public-interest attorney, was published earlier this \n     week in the Los Angeles Daily Journal, which covers legal \n     affairs. The record reveals a jurist who is thoughtful, smart \n     and unbiased. Regardless, some conservatives remain \n     convinced, largely without evidence, that Paez has \n     ``activist'' tendencies.\n       Late last year, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) \n     said he would call a floor vote by March 15 on Paez and a San \n     Francisco lawyer, Marsha Berzon, whose nomination to the 9th \n     Circuit also has languished.\n       There are now six vacant seats on the 9th Circuit Court and \n     76 on federal courts nationwide. The Senate's humiliating \n     treatment of nominees like Paez and Berzon only serves to \n     dissuade worthy men and women from serving on the federal \n     bench.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, March 3, 2000]\n\n                       The Paez and Berzon Votes\n\n       Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has indicated that the \n     Senate will finally hold up-or-down votes on judicial \n     nominees Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon by March 15. Judge \n     Paez has waited four years for the Senate to consider his \n     nomination, and Ms. Berzon has waited two. Both nominees to \n     the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals are well qualified. It is \n     time both were confirmed.\n       The ostensible reason for the opposition to these \n     appointments is that the nominees allegedly harbor tendencies \n     toward ``judicial activism.'' In neither case, however, is \n     the allegation justified. Judge Paez made a single ill-\n     advised remark about a proposed anti-affirmative action \n     ballot initiative in California; his opponents also criticize \n     him because, as a district court judge, he refused to dismiss \n     a human rights lawsuit against a company doing business in \n     Burma. Ms. Berzon stands accused of favoring abortion rights \n     and supporting the labor movement. Such positions may trouble \n     principled conservatives, but they are not the sort of \n     ideological differences that should keep well-qualified \n     nominees off the bench.\n       Some conservatives dislike the comparative liberalism of \n     the 9th Circuit itself and so are reluctant to confirm judges \n     who do not obviously break with that court's current \n     tendency. But diversity among circuits is healthy, and the \n     9th Circuit is by no means a rogue operation out of the \n     bounds of respectable legal thinking. Judge Paez and Ms. \n     Berzon would be good additions to the court--and they have \n     waited too long for the Senate to say so.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, February 26, 2000]\n\n                   Senate GOP Drags Feet on Justices\n\n       More than a few defendants have been in and out of U.S. \n     District Judge Richard Paez's California courtroom--and \n     prison as well--in the time the distinguished jurist has been \n     waiting for a vote on his confirmation to the 9th Circuit \n     U.S. Court of Appeals.\n       If only the ``speedy trial'' rules that Paez must follow \n     applied to the U.S. Senate.\n       It's just our luck here in the 9th Circuit, which \n     encompasses eight Western states including Washington and \n     California, that Paez has become the poster child for the \n     Republican-led Senate's refusal to schedule timely votes on \n     nominations submitted by President Clinton.\n       This circuit, the biggest and arguably the busiest in the \n     country, has six vacancies, yet Senate Majority Leader Trent \n     Lott, R-Miss., had the gall to tell reporters Thursday that \n     he does not believe additional judges are needed at this \n     time. (Lott and fellow Republicans are really rankled by what \n     they perceive as the court's left-leaning nature, but that's \n     another tale.)\n       Lott disclosed that as he announced he would vote against \n     Paez, who still stands a chance of becoming the first \n     Hispanic on this appellate court. Well, that's some progress. \n     At least Paez will have his day in ``court,'' although it \n     will come more than four years after Clinton first sent his \n     name to the Senate.\n       Paez's fitness is not the issue; the American Bar \n     Association has given him its highest ranking. Timeliness is. \n     Seven years ago it took an average of 83 days for the Senate \n     to vote a federal judicial nominee up or down; now it takes \n     more than three times that long.\n       Justice delayed is justice denied, whether it's for judges \n     or defendants.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, March 9, 2000]\n\n                       Ending a Judicial Blockade\n\n       The Senate is scheduled to hold confirmation votes today \n     that would finally end the egregious stalling by Republicans \n     that has blocked consideration of two worthy nominees for the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, on the \n     West Coast. Richard Paez, a respected federal district judge \n     in Los Angeles, has been waiting four years for the full \n     Senate to act on his nomination. Marsha Berzon, a prominent \n     appellate litigator in San Francisco, has been waiting two \n     years.\n       Both these candidates were approved by the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee with the support of its chairman, Orrin Hatch. But \n     a floor vote was stalled by a few Republicans who reflexively \n     branded the nominees as too liberal and too ``activist.'' \n     Only after Democratic complaints about the Republicans' \n     slowness in approving minority and female nominees did the \n     majority leader, Trent Lott, agree to allow the full Senate \n     to vote on their nominations.\n       The Senate should approve the Paez and Berzon nominations, \n     then promptly vote on the 35 other pending judicial \n     nominations. At the current sluggish pace, the Senate stands \n     to approve even fewer judges this year than the 34 it \n     confirmed last year, an indefensible record at a time when \n     federal courts are facing rising caseloads and huge backlogs.\n       The fact that this is a presidential election year is no \n     excuse for inaction. In 1992, President Bush's last year in \n     office, the Senate,\n\n[[Page S1341]]\n\n     then Democratic, confirmed 66 judges. In the last year of the \n     Reagan administration, 42 judges were approved. The quality \n     of justice suffers when the Senate misconstrues its \n     constitutional role to advise and consent as a license to \n     wage ideological warfare and procrastinate in hopes that a \n     new president might submit other nominees.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I guess we have a conflict between the Washington Times \nand the New York Times. The New York Times writes today: ``Ending a \nJudicial Blockade.''\n\n       The Senate is scheduled to hold confirmation votes today \n     that would finally end the egregious stalling by Republicans \n     that has blocked consideration of two worthy nominees for the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, on the \n     West Coast. Richard Paez, a respected federal district judge \n     in Los Angeles, has been waiting four years for the full \n     Senate to act on his nomination. Marsha Berzon, a prominent \n     appellate litigator in San Francisco, has been waiting two \n     years.\n\n  They recite the history, then state the Senate should approve the \nPaez and Berzon nominations.\n  The Los Angeles Times, editorial board, which is now dominated by \nRepublicans, says: ``Judge Deserves Rousing Approval.'' It says:\n\n       On the bench and before that as an attorney, Paez, a 52-\n     year-old Latino, has earned a reputation for being \n     thoughtful, fair and committed to civil rights. He would be \n     an asset to the circuit court.\n\n  The Washington Post says:\n\n       Judge Paez has waited four years for the Senate to consider \n     his nomination, and Ms. Berzon has waited two. Both nominees \n     to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals are well qualified. It is \n     time both were confirmed.\n\n  We hear the word ``activist'' mentioned. If I were to name an \nactivist on the Republican side of the aisle, it would be my friend Bob \nSmith. He is the best activist that the antichoice people have. He is \nan activist. He is the best activist the Humane Society has. When it \ncomes to Judge Paez, when it comes to Marsha Berzon, I dispute the \n``activist'' tag. Some have made the term ``activist'' a bad name. I \ndon't think it is.\n  These two nominees have temperaments that fit the court. They are \nwell reasoned. When Judge Paez was reviewed by 15 experts in the law \nprofession, they said his opinions will stand the test of time; that he \nis well reasoned. The lawyers have refuted everything that has been \nsaid on this floor by people who don't know Judge Paez.\n  I will read statements from lawyers, the people who appear before him \nday after day, and anonymous quotes they gave to the Judicial Almanac \nwhen talking about Judge Paez and his temperament.\n  We are turning the word ``activist'' into something different. \nMargaret Morrow had to struggle to be confirmed. I think some of my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle think you are an activist if you \nhave a heartbeat or a pulse, if you are alive. Nominees have to have \nsome opinions; that is what a judge does.\n  Accusing Judge Paez of being soft on crime is an incredible \nstatement, because, as I understand it, a criminal sentence by Judge \nPaez has never, ever been overturned.\n  To hear people talk about letting rapists and other criminals free, \nsome might have done it but not Judge Paez. He has never been \noverturned on a criminal sentence in his entire career, and he has been \non the bench for 18 years.\n  Sometimes people come to the floor making an argument about the Ninth \nCircuit. How about putting two people on the Ninth Circuit who will \nmake it better? That is the opportunity we have today.\n\n  I will read some comments made by the lawyers who appear before Judge \nPaez all the time. These are people who take all sides of the issue: He \nis a wonderful judge. He is outstanding. He is highly competent. He is \nsmart. He is thoughtful. He is reflective.\n  ``I don't know anyone,'' one lawyer said, ``who hasn't been \nexceedingly impressed by him. He does a great job.''\n  ``He is very well prepared,'' says another.\n  ``He knows more about a case than the lawyers.''\n  Here is another: ``I think he has a great temperament. He never says \nor does anything that is off. He has a good demeanor. He is \nprofessional. He doesn't have any quirks.''\n  I listened to my friend, Senator Smith, who is eloquent, but he is \nnot talking about the man these lawyers know. He certainly is not \ntalking about the man whom all the law enforcement people who have \nendorsed him know.\n  We hear Judge Paez is soft on crime. Why, then, does the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations endorse him? Also endorsing him is \nthe Los Angeles Police Protective League, the Los Angeles County Police \nChief Association, the Association of Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, the \nDepartment of California Highway Control Commissioner. Why would he \nhave bipartisan support from California State judges and justices, such \nas California Court of Appeals Justice Walter Croskey, bar leaders, \nbusiness leaders, community leaders, the whole Hispanic community?\n  There is a lot of discussion about what party deserves to get the \nvotes of the Hispanics. I hope we can rise above this, but I do hope we \ncan listen to the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce which strongly support \nJudge Paez.\n  I will read from their letter:\n\n       To the Senate majority leader from the United States \n     Hispanic Chamber of Commerce:\n       I urge you to consider the views of the U.S. Hispanic \n     Chamber and of the Hispanic small business community as we \n     await a decision from the Senate on the nomination of Judge \n     Paez. Judge Paez would be a great asset to the Ninth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals.\n\n  They conclude:\n\n       I therefore urge you to listen to the voice of the Hispanic \n     community and confirm Judge Paez to the Ninth Circuit Court \n     of Appeals.\n\n  Here is a joint statement from the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce--the \nbusinesspeople--and the Hispanic National Bar:\n\n       The Hispanic community is justifiably proud of Judge Paez's \n     achievement. He is a jurist of integrity and decency, a role \n     model for Hispanics everywhere. Yet he has been kept waiting \n     for more than 49 months for a Senate vote. We applaud Senator \n     Lott's decision to give Judge Paez a vote and urge the Senate \n     to give him full and fair consideration.\n\n  They conclude:\n\n       If Judge Paez's record is reviewed fairly, he will be \n     confirmed on a bipartisan basis.\n\n  I know there is some thought as we get ready for an up-or-down vote \non these two nominees that there might be a motion made to indefinitely \npostpone this vote. I have had discussions with the Parliamentarian who \nbelieves that motion would be in order. I say it would be precedent \nsetting. We have these candidates. They have gone through a very \ndifficult confirmation process, being nominated a few times, getting \nthrough the committee a few times, being asked extensive questions, \nsurviving an important cloture vote, which, frankly, they won \noverwhelmingly. Eighty-some Senators said they have a right to have a \nvote. I admire those Senators who voted for that, even though they \nwon't vote finally for either Marsha or Richard.\n  I make an appeal: If we vote to indefinitely postpone a vote on these \ntwo nominees or one of these two nominees, that is denying them an up-\nor-down vote.\n  That would be such a twisting of what cloture really means in these \ncases. It has never been done before for a judge, as far as we know--\never. Again, it would undermine what Senator Lott said when he said \nthese people deserve an up-or-down vote.\n  So I make a plea to my friend, Senator Smith. He and I go at it on \nmany issues, but we are good friends and we like each other. Consider \nwhat you would do if you were to make such a motion, or another Senator \nwould do so. You would be saying these two people do not deserve an up-\nor-down vote. I think that would be an undermining of the spirit of \nwhat we did yesterday.\n  I hope we will not go that route. What goes around comes around. \nThen, when you have a President who sends down a nominee, you are \nsetting your party's President up for this kind of twisting in the wind \nthat I do not think any nominee ought to go through.\n  I thank my friends for their indulgence. I believe very deeply we \nhave two mainstream, strong candidates, supported by Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, both inside the Senate and outside the Senate. We \nhave two people who have proven their mettle. I thank them for hanging \nin there. I know there were times when they wondered whether it was \nworth it; that they had\n\n[[Page S1342]]\n\nto look at their families one more time and say, ``We don't know yet. \nWe don't know yet. We don't know when we are getting a vote.'' That is \nwhy I brought their pictures to the floor the last couple of days, to \nput a face on these nominees. They have children. They have spouses. \nThey have community friends. They work hard. Their lives have \nessentially been in limbo--for Marsha for a couple of years.\n  It is tough when you are in a law firm and you have been nominated. \nThe partners don't know what to do. Do they give you more cases? Do \nthey not? If you start a case, will you be pulled? It is a very \ndifficult thing for an attorney in that situation.\n  For Judge Paez, it has been tough for him to hear some of the things \nthat have been said when he is a man who has such broad-based support \nin the community.\n  Colleagues on both sides of the aisle, this is a big and important \nday. If there should be a motion made to indefinitely postpone this \nnomination, please do not support it. That would undermine what we \npromised these nominees way back several months ago when we told them \nthey would have a vote. If we have that vote, please turn against it. \nAnd then, please vote for these nominees. They deserve your vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I might say to my \ncolleague, she knows we respect each other and like each other \npersonally.\n  The points she makes about the families, when a nominee comes before \nthe Senate and there is a long delay, we understand that. That is not \neasy for anybody. But I might also say, as far as I know--and I speak \nfor myself, and I am pretty sure I speak for everyone else--I remember \nClarence Thomas and people going in to find out what videos he \npurchased. He had a family. And Robert Bork had a family. And Doug \nGinsburg had a family. I remember some very nasty things being said \nabout those nominees.\n  We are looking at court cases of these nominees, and that is all we \nare looking at. I have not said, nor has anyone said on the Senate \nfloor, one word about their personal lives. I have no desire to go \nthere. This is about their court cases. In terms of Judge Paez in \nparticular, his judicial philosophy, his activist philosophy, I will \nuse his own words:\n\n       I appreciate the need for courts to act when they must. \n     When the issue has been generated as a result of a failure of \n     the political process to resolve a certain political \n     question, there is no choice but for the courts to resolve \n     the question that perhaps ideally and preferably should be \n     resolved through the legislative process.\n\n  The legislative process is to write the laws. That is what we do \nhere. It is not up to the courts to write the laws. It is up to the \nlegislature to write the laws. You should not put your activist views, \nconservative or liberal, on the court. I want judges who will interpret \nthe Constitution.\n  These are his own words. I also want to point out--and I am just now \nanalyzing the case--I know it is not a criticism because I did not know \nit either until this morning, but apparently there was a criminal case \nof Judge Paez that was overturned yesterday. I am trying to analyze \nthat now, or maybe Senator Sessions may get into it later. So there was \nat least one, in terms of a criminal overturn.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will note, just before I start, a couple \nof points.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Hampshire spoke about video rental \nrecords of Judge Bork or Judge Thomas. He may recall when that \nhappened, a law was passed, the Leahy-Simpson law, which I proposed, \ninitiated, and drove through in short order, to make it illegal for \nanybody to go and check somebody's video records. Ideally, I would like \nto see us have as strong a law for our medical records, something that \nhas been held up while we spend a lot of time on a lot of other things. \nThat is something being held up by this Congress on medical privacy. I \nwish we could do the same with that situation. But on Judge Bork or \nJudge Thomas or any other judges, the Leahy-Simpson law says we cannot \nlook at their records.\n  I also note it was the Democrats who said very strongly about both \nJudge Bork and Judge Thomas, there should be no filibuster. As I \nrecall, we expedited them relatively quickly for votes. It was also \nthis Senator, joined by some others on this side, who, on the Ginsburg \nmatter, when items were being leaked to the press--as it turned out, \nsome from the same White House from which his nomination came--it was \nthis Senator who took to the floor, and spoke elsewhere, and said let \nus give Judge Ginsburg a hearing; he should not be subjected to \nanonymous leaks, wherever they are coming from. As I said, some, it \nturned out, came from the White House. It was the White House that then \nannounced, news to him, he was going to be withdrawing his name, which \nof course he did.\n  It was approximately 12 weeks from the time Judge Bork was nominated \nuntil we had a vote. It was something like 15 weeks from the time Judge \nThomas was nominated before we had a vote. Of course, on Judge Paez it \nhas been 4 years; on Marsha Berzon, 2 years.\n  I think we should talk about facts. Up to this date, there have been \na lot of red herrings set out on these two nominees. They have been \nheld without votes. Now at the 11th hour, some have sought to raise the \nrandom assignment of the case against John Huang in the District Court \nof the Central District of California as another reason to extend what \nhas already been a 4-year delay in our consideration of the nomination \nof Judge Richard Paez.\n  I have yet to hear anybody suggest that there was anything untoward \nin the assignment of Judge Paez on this case. The suggestion is out \nhere, somehow this was some nefarious thing, to put Judge Paez on this \ncase. So I checked around about what the court rules are in assigning \ncases, because most courts have rules on how cases are assigned. They \nare not secret. They are public, and they are publicly available. I \nknow they are in my own State of Vermont. They are elsewhere. But I \nthought maybe there was something that those who were objecting to his \nassignment to this case knew that we didn't. So I checked with the \nCentral District of California, and of course they do have court rules \ngoverning the assignment of cases.\n  In fact, I understand the assignment of cases in the central district \nis pursuant to general order No. 224 of that court. I mention this \nbecause I wonder if any of those who have impugned Judge Paez sitting \non this case even bothered to check that rule as I did, as anybody can, \nsimply by picking up the phone and calling.\n  Section 7 of that order deals with the assignment of criminal cases. \nParagraph 7.1 says:\n\n       The assignment of criminal cases shall be completely at \n     random through the Automated Case Assignment System. . . .\n\n  That is how the cases are assigned. The order allows exceptions under \nsupervision of the chief judge. In the Huang case, there is no \nindication any exception was involved. Quite the contrary. I am told \nthe assignment was done pursuant to a random assignment. That is what I \nwas told when I called. That is what anybody would have been told if \nthey had bothered to call instead of slandering this judge.\n  Then to make sure, because I am amazed anybody even questioned that \nbecause it is such a longstanding rule, I went to the extraordinary \nlength of getting a statement under oath subject to the penalty of \nperjury by the district court executive and clerk of court explaining \nhow these cases are assigned; Sherri Carter, district court executive \nand clerk of court.\n  I must apologize on the record to Ms. Carter for any indication that \nthe Senate does not take her word for this or that people insist she \nsubmit this statement under penalty of perjury. I say to her, this is a \nstrange time. Any lawyer who practices anywhere in this country knows \nthat practically any court has these same kind of random assignments. \nState courts do it. Federal courts do it. Certainly any lawyer in \nCalifornia knows it is a random assignment. I suspect the bailiffs can \ntell you that. The janitors can tell you in that court, but the Senate \nis so far removed from it that we need an affidavit telling us \nsomething that everybody else outside of the sacred 100 in this Chamber \nknow.\n\n[[Page S1343]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the sworn affidavit of Sherri Carter, \ndistrict court executive and clerk of court, saying that district judge \nRichard Paez was randomly assigned to the Huang case under the district \ncourt-approved random assignment methodology using an automated \ninformation processing system be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              U.S. District Court,\n\n\n                               Central District of California,\n\n                                                  Los Angeles, CA.\n       I, Sherri R. Carter, District Court Executive and Clerk of \n     Court, for the United States District Court, Central District \n     of California, declare that case number CR-99-524-RAP, U.S.A. \n     v. John Huang, was randomly assigned to District Judge \n     Richard A. Paez, on June 14, 1999 through the District Court \n     approved random assignment methodology utilizing an automated \n     information processing system.\n       Pursuant to 28 UCS 1746, I, Sherri R. Carter, District \n     Court Executive and Clerk of Court, declare under penalty of \n     perjury that the foregoing is true and correct executed on \n     March 8, 2000.\n\n                                             Sherri R. Carter,\n\n                                          District Court Executive\n                                               and Clerk of Court.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am sure Judge Paez had no interest in \nbeing assigned that case or the case against a former Member of \nCongress, Republican Representative Jay Kim, or any other high-profile \ncase. I suspect any judge who has a pending confirmation would be \ndelighted to avoid such high-profile cases, but they follow the rules. \nIf the machine comes up and says ``you are assigned,'' then that judge \nhears that case. Judge Paez ought not continue to be penalized for \ndoing his job in ruling in those assigned cases.\n  There is no allegation--no credible allegation, no believable \nallegation, no factual allegation, no whisper of an allegation--outside \nthis Chamber that he did anything to obtain jurisdiction over those \nmatters. None whatsoever. That ought to settle this matter once and for \nall.\n  It is the same as buying a lottery ticket and having the machine pick \nthe numbers for you. It is done automatically. He did not win the \nlottery on this because he did not want a high-profile case, but he did \nhis job, the job he was sworn to do. We ought to do the job we are \nsworn to do and vote up or down on these two people and not, as some \nhave suggested, have a vote to suspend indefinitely. That is the Senate \nsaying: Notwithstanding we are being paid to vote yes or no, we decide \nto just vote maybe.\n  Let's vote up or down. In this particular case that has been talked \nabout, Judge Paez sentenced John Huang to 1 year probation, 500 hours \ncommunity service, and a $10,000 fine after he pled guilty to a felony \nconspiracy charge on August 12, 1999. He agreed to plead guilty after \nhe reached an agreement, not with the judge but with the prosecution \nfor the Department of Justice. Based on that agreement, the prosecutors \nrecommended no jail time in exchange for the defendant's cooperation. \nJudge Paez's approval of the prosecutor's recommendation was not \nunusual.\n  During my years as a prosecutor, I can think of a number of times \nwhen I said to the judge: Would you give this type of a sentence \nbecause we are getting cooperation from this person? I am after bigger \nfish; I have bigger fish to fry. I need their cooperation. Will you \nplease sentence him to what might appear to be a lighter sentence?\n  Judge Paez did put the sentencing off for 10 days, from August 2 to \nAugust 12. Why? To consider a request by a Republican Congressman, Dan \nBurton, who asked Judge Paez to delay sentencing until Huang testified \nin front of his committee investigating campaign finance abuses. The \nCongress asked him to delay. The Federal prosecutors objected to \nRepresentative Burton's request for the indefinite suspension of \nsentencing, and having delayed to consider the matter, Judge Paez \nproceeded with the sentencing on August 12. I believe he was correct in \ndoing so. Huang's lawyer told the prosecutor he would cooperate with \nRepresentative Burton's committee, notwithstanding sentencing. My \nrecollection is that is exactly what he did.\n  When it became clear, in virtually unprecedented fashion, Judge Paez \nand Marsha Berzon would have to leap over a 60-vote margin in cloture, \nand when it became clear the Senate would not add to the disgrace and \nhumiliation of holding them up this long, that we would invoke cloture \nthey want to suspend it indefinitely. After four years we should be \nmore than prepared to vote for him for the Ninth Circuit.\n  Suspending a vote on this nomination would be a tragedy. Here is a \nremarkable man: a Hispanic American who has reached the Federal bench, \nhas the highest rating that bar associations can give for a nominee, \none of the most qualified people I have seen before the committee, \nRepublican or Democrat, in my 25 years here. He has been waiting, \ndangling, for 4 years, humiliated by the actions of the Senate.\n  Now they ask to delay him again. It does not match up to what should \nbe the standards of a body that calls itself the conscience of the \nNation. Let us be clear, the Huang plea agreement, the transcript of \nthe sentencing and related documents are not new. They have been in the \npossession of the Judiciary Committee since at least September of 1999. \nSix months they have been here.\n\n  The sentencing, his postponement, and the position of sentence did \nnot happen in secret. It was in the glare of nationwide publicity. \nThousands of sentencings go on every year in this country in all kinds \nof courts rarely covered by the press. This one was. These events \nextend back to last August and before. It is not a justification for \nasking for new information. It has been here.\n  I think the opponents misdirect their complaints about the plea \nagreement between the Government and Mr. Huang at Judge Paez. Complain \nabout the Government's recommendation. That is one thing. Do not blame \nthe judge who followed them.\n  Moreover, in spite of the impression sought to be created here, the \nplea agreement, dated May 21, 1999, expressly provides that Mr. Huang \nis not immune from Federal prosecution under ``laws relating to \nnational security or espionage'' but covers only that conduct he had \ndisclosed to prosecutors. In fact, his own attorney acknowledged at the \ntime of sentencing that this plea agreement, OK'd by the prosecutors \nand the judge, leaves Mr. Huang open to further prosecution.\n  As far as the sentencing, let's be clear what happened. The Senate \nshould know, pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Huang pled guilty to one \ncount of conspiracy, a charge that carries the maximum penalty of up to \n5 years. As for the calculation of the sentencing guidelines, both the \nGovernment and the probation office agreed on that calculation. They \nfurther agreed that in light of his substantial cooperation, he should \nreceive a sentence of 1 year's probation and 500 hours of community \nservice.\n  In fact, the only disagreement between the prosecutors and the \nprobation office was on the amount of the fine. In this case, Judge \nPaez disregarded what the probation office recommended and went with \nthe prosecutors' recommendation, the higher fine, and he imposed that \nfine.\n  If you read the sentencing transcript, you see the judge acted in a \nconscientious manner. He insisted on a probation officer's report and \nrecommendation before proceeding. He did not proceed until he was \nadvised of the extent and nature of Huang's cooperation that was \nexpected. The Government informed the court that Huang provided \nsubstantial, credible information helpful in task force investigations. \nThe judge emphasized that Mr. Huang was expected to continue to \ncooperate after his sentencing.\n  I mentioned being a former prosecutor. I can tell you, when I was \nprosecuting cases nothing was more infuriating than when people did not \nknow the facts of a case or the extent of cooperation or the value of \nthe plea agreement, and they would try to pick apart an agreement after \nthe fact.\n  I can think of cases where people would say: Oh, my gosh, how can \nthis person get a light sentence? Why? Because they helped us catch \nfive other people we would not have caught without them.\n  It is easy enough to criticize and second-guess. It is always easy to \nsay someone else settled too cheap, that they made a bad deal. That \nundermines the role and morale of good prosecutors. We all know how \nclogged the already overloaded courts would be if prosecutors could not \nuse their best\n\n[[Page S1344]]\n\njudgment and enter into plea agreements.\n  We have 75 vacancies in the Federal court. Prosecutors are under \npressure all the time to move cases through because we have not \nconfirmed the judges; we have not added the extra judges they need. The \ncourts are backlogged. You cannot get civil cases heard because of all \nthe criminal cases. Prosecutors have to make their best judgment.\n  Whether one agrees or disagrees with the agreement, no one can say, \nwith a straight face, that we suddenly found out about it, or that now \nwe have to have a last-minute postponement. We do not need such a \nthing.\n  This has been pending for 4 years. The facts have been here for 4 \nyears. The nomination has been here for 4 years. Local law enforcement \nhas strongly backed Judge Paez for 4 years. His home State Senators \nhave strongly backed him for 4 years.\n  He is supported by the Los Angeles district attorney, the Los Angeles \nPolice Protective League, the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, the Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, the Los \nAngeles County Police Chiefs' Association. This guy sounds like the \nkind of judge I would have liked to have had my cases assigned to when \nI was a prosecutor.\n  We have made this highly qualified man jump through hoops for 4 \nyears. He was required to review his criminal sentences for his whole \ncareer on the Federal bench. This is what we asked him to do after he \nwas pending for 4 years. He had two confirmation hearings, and had been \nvoted out twice by the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee.\n  A lesser person would have said: Enough is enough. This is such petty \nharassment. He did not complain. He complied. What do the facts show? \nHe is a tough sentencer. Those are the facts, not the comment of some \nreporter thrown into a political story here in Washington.\n\n  The people of California, the people who know him best, named him the \nFederal Criminal Law Judge of the Year in 1999. He has had sentences \nwithin the sentencing guidelines more often than the national average \nfor district judges. We ought to be praising him for that. People say \ndistrict judges don't follow the guidelines. We ought to praise him for \nbeing above average in that.\n  We talk about his criminal judgments appealed. There were 32 criminal \njudgments appealed. He was affirmed 28 times. Two of the appeals were \ndismissed for lack of jurisdiction; one was remanded. Only 1 of the 32 \nwas reversed, in part.\n  We talk about how we want people who are going to be upheld on \nappeal. There isn't a district court judge--Republican, Democrat, or \nanything else--who would not be delighted to have a record on appeal \nlike Judge Paez.\n  He is a tough judge, a really tough judge. He is also a good judge, a \nwell-trained judge, a highly intelligent judge, and a judge who wins on \nappeals.\n  Obviously, every Senator has a right to vote how he or she wants, but \nat least vote. I do not think it is right to hold somebody up. It would \ncertainly be an outrageous mark of shame on the Senate if we took the \nunprecedented step, for a Federal judicial nominee, after cloture, to \nmove to indefinitely postpone. It would be the first time that sequence \nwould be followed in the Senate. That would be a mark of shame on us.\n  But what bothers me is the way people look for any reason--real or \nimagined--to vote against Judge Paez.\n  There seems to be no interest in looking at his whole record of \npublic service. I have heard no mention of Judge Paez's decision in the \nGreat Western Shows, Inc. case. That was a controversial case. I am \nsure he did not ask to be assigned to it. But he applied the law fairly \nand objectively. Let's mention this case.\n  We heard he may be a liberal judicial activist, whatever that is. It \nmust mean, like the majority in the Supreme Court in the last year or \nso, taking away more rights from the States and people in patent cases, \nand so on. But let's talk about this.\n  In the Great Western Shows case, he heard and granted a motion for a \npreliminary injunction against a Los Angeles county ordinance that \nwould have effectively banned gun shows, the sale of firearms and \nammunition on county property. He went against those who wanted to ban \nthe gun show because he found substantial questions that the ordinance \nwas preempted by State law. So he granted an injunction so the gun show \ncould proceed.\n  To me, that does not sound like a judicial activist. It reminds me of \nthe courage that a Vermont district court judge showed back in 1994 \nwhen his nomination to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals was likewise \npending before the Senate. At that time, Judge Fred Parker handed down \nhis decision in the Frank case in which Judge Parker held the 10th \namendment prohibited Congress from usurping the power of Vermont's \nLegislature and declared certain provisions of the Brady law \nunconstitutional.\n  I remember that very well because it was about the same time I was \ndown asking the President of the United States to appoint Judge Parker, \na conservative Republican, who served as the deputy attorney general of \nour State. I was asking the President to appoint Judge Parker to the \nSecond Circuit. I also knew Judge Parker was an extraordinarily \nbrilliant person. He was a classmate of mine in law school. He is \nhighly honest. Usually he had supported my opponents.\n  I had to tell the President, who was strongly supporting the Brady \nlaw: This judge I want you to appoint to the Second Circuit Court of \nAppeals has just found a hunk of that law unconstitutional. The \nPresident said: Anything else you want me to do for you today?\n  But to Bill Clinton's credit, he did appoint Judge Parker to the \nSecond Circuit. Oh, just as a little footnote, to Judge Parker's \ncredit, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld him. They said he was right, that \nthe way it was drafted, that part of the Brady law--which we have since \nchanged--was unconstitutional.\n  The point is, both these judges, Judges Parker and Paez, acted with \ncourage to do their duty. They applied the law to the facts, and they \ndid their judicial duty. They did so at some personal risk while their \nnominations to higher courts were still pending before the Senate. I \nthink the strength they show is commendable. They are the kinds of \njudges we need in our Federal courts to act with independence and in \naccordance with the law. All the Senators who were in the Senate at \nthat time voted for Judge Parker.\n\n  I hoped they would give the same with respect to Judge Paez. He \ndoesn't tailor rulings or sentences to please political supporters. He \nis not soft on crime. This is a man who gets upheld on virtually all \nhis criminal cases. He is a person with great resolve and temperament \nand intellect. Those who seek to diminish this man or his record should \nreconsider and support his prompt confirmation.\n  I understand why people support him so strongly. I ask that a \nsampling of letters from the Hispanic National Bar Association, \nnational Hispanic Leadership Agenda and its more than 30 constituent \norganizations, the League of United Latin American Citizens, and the \nU.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in support of Judge Paez be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Hispanic National Bar Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 20, 2000.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Courthouse Plaza,\n     Burlington, VT.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: It is the understanding of the Hispanic \n     National Bar Association that Majority Leader Trent Lott has \n     agreed to call a floor vote on the nomination of Judge Paez \n     by March 15. Therefore, as the Regional President of the \n     Hispanic National Bar Association with jurisdiction over the \n     State of Vermont, I am writing to inquire into your position \n     on the nomination of Judge Richard A. Paez to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n       The Hispanic National Bar Association is a non-partisan \n     organization with over 22,000 members that has as one of its \n     goals to promote the appointment of qualified Hispanic \n     candidates to the Bench. We have reviewed the qualifications \n     of Judge Paez and strongly support his confirmation. In fact, \n     his confirmation is one of our top priorities for this year.\n       I will contact your office within the next few days to see \n     if you, or your staff, are available to meet with us to \n     discuss this important nomination. If you have any questions, \n     please feel free to contact me at (617) 565-3210.\n       For your information, I have attached a copy of a Los \n     Angeles Daily Journal article on Judge Paez which, upon your \n     perusal,\n\n[[Page S1345]]\n\n     should clear up any misconceptions and incorrect labels that \n     are currently the foundations of objections to his \n     nomination.\n       I appreciate your attention to this request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              R. Liliana Palacios,\n     Regional President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 National Hispanic\n\n\n                                            Leadership Agenda,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: As members of the Board of Directors of the \n     National Hispanic Leadership Agenda (NHLA), we are writing to \n     reiterate our strong support for Judge Richard Paez to the \n     Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and our request that you vote \n     to confirm him.\n       About two weeks ago, you should have received a letter from \n     the NHLA signed by our Chair, Manuel Mirabal. Because we wish \n     to convey to you fully the importance of this matter to the \n     Latino community, we have decided to send you this additional \n     letter with our individual signatures.\n       The NHLA represents a highly diverse and important cross-\n     section of the national Latino community. Our organizations \n     have offices and constituents throughout the country, and we \n     come together when we find issues of mutual concern. We \n     submit this letter on behalf of the organizations we \n     represent, and we sign this letter as individuals prominent \n     in various fields, including business, legal, labor, health, \n     scientific, among others as well.\n       We come together to support a highly qualified candidate to \n     the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals--Judge Richard Paez. In \n     1994, Judge Paez became the first Mexican American appointed \n     to the Central District Court of California in Los Angeles. \n     This was a milestone for the Latino community. Now that Judge \n     Paez has been nominated to the Ninth Circuit, we believe he \n     will serve well not only the 14 million Latinos living in the \n     Ninth Circuit, but all Americans who seek a fair review of \n     the matters they bring to court.\n       Thank you again for considering our strong backing for \n     Judge Paez, and we urge you to support his confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n         Elena Rios, MD, National Hispanic Medical Association; \n           Kofi Boateng, Executive Director, National Puerto Rican \n           Forum; Elisa Sanchez, CEO, MANA, A National Latina \n           Organization; Delia Pompa, Executive Director, National \n           Association for Bilingual Education; Manuel Oliverez, \n           President & CEO, National Association of Hispanic \n           Federal Executives; Guarione M.

Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the League of United Latin \n     American Citizens, the oldest and largest Hispanic \n     organization in the United States, I urge you to vote to \n     confirm Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. Judge Paez was first nominated to serve on the Ninth \n     Circuit on January 25, 1996--more than four years ago. This \n     is an unusually long time to wait, especially considering \n     Judge Paez's qualifications for the position.\n       Judge Paez currently serves with distinction as a Federal \n     District Judge in the Central District of California, where \n     he has been for over five years. Before that he served as a \n     municipal judge in Los Angeles for thirteen years. When first \n     considered by the Senate, Judge Paez was confirmed \n     unanimously. Many of the Senators who agreed to his \n     nomination in 1994 are still in office. Since he was \n     nominated to the Ninth Circuit, Judge Paez has been through \n     two hearings to review his qualifications and both times he \n     was voted favorably out to be considered by the full Senate. \n     He has been rated well-qualified by the American Bar \n     Association and is supported by a wide array of individuals \n     and organizations, including representatives from the \n     business and law enforcement communities.\n       By March 15, 2000, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott will \n     move for a vote on Judge Paez. I strongly urge you to support \n     his confirmation. His confirmation is important to LULAC not \n     only because we have the opportunity to place an excellent \n     judge in this important position, but as a Latino, he \n     represents one of a very few opportunities for our community \n     to be present at this level. It is also important to our \n     judicial system, both how it operates and how it is perceived \n     to operate, that individuals who have worked hard, played by \n     the rules, and are qualified receive a fair chance just like \n     others who may be different from them. Judge Paez has done \n     everything it takes to be qualified for the position on the \n     Ninth Circuit; he deserves your vote.\n       I hope we can count on you to support Judge Paez. LULAC \n     will be recommending that this vote be include in the \n     National Hispanic Leadership Agenda scorecord which will be \n     published at the conclusion of this session.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Rick Dovalina,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            United States Hispanic\n\n\n                                          Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 1999.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senate Majority Leader: On behalf of the Board of \n     Directors of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce \n     (USHCC). I urge you to encourage a vote on the nomination of \n     Federal District Court Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals. I urge you to consider the views of \n     the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and of the \n     Hispanic, small-business community as we await a decision \n     from the Senate on the nomination of Judge Paez.\n       As you may know, the USHCC's primary goal is to represent \n     the interests of over 1.5 million Hispanic-owned businesses \n     in the United States and Puerto Rico. with a network of over \n     200 Hispanic chambers of commerce across the country, the \n     USHCC stands as the preeminent business organization that \n     effectively promoters the economic growth and development of \n     Hispanic entrepreneurs. In addition, the USHCC provides and \n     advocacy on many issues of importance to the Hispanic \n     community. Hispanic entrepreneurs are interested in promoting \n     the growth and development of Hispanics in the United States. \n     For this reason, the USHCC supports the confirmation of Judge \n     Paez to the Ninth Circuit.\n       Judge Paez was nominated to the Ninth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals in 1996. He has been awaiting confirmation by the \n     United States Senate for three and a half years, one of the \n     longest pending nominations in history. Judge Paez has \n     demonstrated the leadership and accomplishments that are well \n     suited to a candidate for a Ninth Circuit Court Judge. He \n     served as a judge in the Los Angeles Municipal Court for 13 \n     years. While serving on that court, he was selected to serve \n     in various leadership positions, including Presiding Judge. \n     He was also elected to serve as Chair of the Los Angeles \n     County Municipal Court Judges Association. In 1994, he was \n     confirmed to the Central District Court of California where \n     he currently serves.\n       Judge Paez would be a great asset to the Ninth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals. He has the support of many civil rights, \n     law enforcement and community groups, including that of the \n     National Hispanic Leadership Agenda (NHLA) of which the USHCC \n     is a member organization. The NHLA is a coalition of over 30 \n     national and leading. Hispanic organizations in the United \n     States. The USHCC has been supportive of NHLA's efforts \n     regarding the confirmation of Judge Paez. I therefore urge \n     you to listen to the voice of the Hispanic community and \n     confirm Judge Paez to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                               George Herrera,\n\n                                                     President and\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hope today we will close the chapter of \nwhat has not been the greatest light and the greatest time of the \nSenate--close this chapter of 4 years of delay and harassment of this \nwonderful man and confirm him today.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains for the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). There are 33 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder \nof my time. I thank my distinguished friend from New Hampshire for \nyielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, in a moment I will yield \nto my colleague from Alabama. I want to respond to a couple of points \nthat were made during the debate, in terms of\n\n[[Page S1346]]\n\nprocess, by the distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, and \nSenator Leahy of Vermont.\n  The criticism on the filibuster is a bit unwarranted. I could have \ncome down here and thrown the Senate into quorum calls and delayed and \ndelayed just for the sake of delay. None of us on our side, including \nme, did any such thing. We worked out an agreement with the majority \nleader for a limited amount of time, which on our side was 3 hours--it \ncould have been 30, No. 1--after cloture. Secondly, I agreed to move \nthe cloture time up, and the leader agreed with me.\n  The real purpose of that was to get facts out about these two \njudicial nominees, Berzon and Paez. I know in the case of Senator \nSessions, who will speak for himself on this, he has new information \nabout Judge Paez. I believe that when new information is there, in \nspite of the fact that this judge has been before the Senate for 4 \nyears, it should be shared with the Senate. I think Senator Sessions \nhas every right to share it. Frankly, I think Senators will want to \nhear it. So I hope they will listen when Senator Sessions speaks in \ndetail about the new information he has because I think it is very \nimportant in the case of the nomination of Judge Paez.\n  I want to speak for just a moment on the issue of the random rule \nthat my colleague from Vermont talked about. He indicated, to his \ncredit, that he called and asked about the random rule, and he got a \nstatement from the clerk that that was in fact random. Well, that is \none statement, and it may well be true. I think we have a right to \ncheck that out to make sure it was random. If it were random, I ask my \ncolleague, should this judge who is before the Senate to be confirmed \nfor the circuit court, nominated by President Bill Clinton--is it the \nright thing to do, perception-wise, to sit on a case involving Maria \nHsia, who has just been convicted for part of the fundraising scandal, \nalong with John Huang who was also involved in that scandal? It seems \nto me, even if it did come out randomly, it would be good, common sense \nto say I will recuse myself from these cases because I don't think it \nlooks good.\n  The random aspect has a problem, which Senator Sessions will address. \nThe random aspect presents a problem for me because there are 34 judges \nthere, and the fact that those 2 cases would be randomly assigned to \nthis judge is pretty suspicious. But if you give them the benefit of \nthe doubt, a bad judgment was made by Judge Paez in taking them.\n  Finally, much has been made here this morning as to comments about \nHispanic judges. I think the implication is, somehow there is bias \nhere. I remind my colleagues and the American people that we had a vote \nof whatever it was--95-0--on Judge Fuentes the other day. I voted for \nthat judge, as did all of my colleagues. I certainly didn't assign any \nracial bias when Judge Thomas was opposed by many on the other side of \nthe aisle, who happened to be a conservative black, which was the first \nsin--and probably the only sin, as far as I know--he committed. For \nthat, he went through a living hell for a long time. Had he been a \nliberal black judge, I don't think there would have been a problem at \nall.\n\n  So I don't think we need to get into name calling and give the \ninsinuation that somehow because Paez happens to be Hispanic--that is \nuncalled for, and I hope we can get away from that kind of debate. I \nlook at each person on the basis of their qualifications and their \ndecisions. For all I know--OK, Paez, is that a Hispanic name? I don't \neven know. I could care less. So I hope we can get beyond that.\n  At this time, I yield to my colleague from Alabama, Senator Sessions, \nwhatever time he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator and I appreciate his \nleadership on this issue and his courage in standing up for it.\n  It is really offensive to me that it would be suggested I or other \nMembers would oppose someone simply because they were Hispanic, African \nAmerican, or any other nationality, religion, or racial background. I \nhardly knew he was Hispanic until we were into this matter. He has been \nheld up for a number of years for reasons that have been discussed in \nsome detail. He has stated, as a State judge, a philosophy of judging \nthat is the absolute epitome of judicial activism. He said that when a \nlegislative body doesn't act, it is the responsibility of the judge, or \nthe judiciary, to act and fill the void. Well, when a legislative body, \nduly elected by the people of the United States, fails to act, that \nbody has made a decision--a decision not to act. But they are elected. \nIf they do the wrong thing, they can be removed from office. But now we \nwant to have a Federal judge who is unelected, with a lifetime \nappointment, to blithely walk in and say: Well, I don't like this \nimpasse. You guys have a problem and you didn't solve it, so I am going \nto reinterpret the meaning of the Constitution. That word doesn't mean \nthat, or ``is'' means something else. So I am going to make this \nlegislation say what I want it to say. I am going to solve this \nproblem. You guys in the legislative branch would not solve it; you \nfailed to solve it, and you are thinking about special interests. But I \nam above that, and I will do the right thing.\n  Mr. President, that is judicial activism. That is an antidemocratic \nact at its most fundamental point because that judge has a lifetime \nappointment. He has no accountability to the public whatsoever.\n\n  It is a thunderous power that the Founding Fathers gave Federal \njudges. And for the most part they have handled themselves well. But \nthis doctrine of judicial activism that they have a right to act when \nthe needs of the country are at stake is malicious, bad, and wrong. It \nundermines the rule of law. It undermines the democracy at its very \ncore.\n  Hear me, America. When you have a Federal judge who is an unelected \nperson unaccountable to the people, we have gone from a democracy to \nsomething else. I believe that is not healthy. His statement in that \nregard is a fundamental statement that indicates to me he is \nparticularly not a good choice for the Ninth Circuit.\n  As the Senator so ably pointed out, it is the most activist circuit \nof all. I know the Senator mentioned the recent case in which he was \nreversed.\n  The city of Los Angeles passed a statute against panhandling after an \nindividual on the street of Los Angeles was murdered when he wouldn't \ngive somebody 25 cents. They passed legislation. The Los Angeles City \nCouncil is not a city council that has set about to deny civil \nliberties. They are one of the most open cities in the world.\n  What did Judge Paez do, according to the Federal Supplement opinion \nof his district court order in 1997? He found that the ordinance was \ninvalid on its face under the California Constitution's Liberty of \nSpeech clause for discriminating on the basis of content between \ncategories of speech.\n  The case was appealed to the Federal court. They certified that \nquestion, as they sometimes do, to the California Supreme Court. This \nis a California statute, and the Federal judge was invalidated by the \nCalifornia Supreme Court.\n  Out of deference and respect to the California Supreme Court, what is \nyour opinion of that? They reviewed the matter. They came back and \nconcluded that the judge was wrong after having delayed the \nimplementation of a duly passed statute by the duly elected leadership \nof the city of Los Angeles. This one sitting, lifetime-appointed judge \nunaccountable to the American people wiped it out. The California \nSupreme Court said this:\n\n       As noted above, the regulation of solicitation long has \n     been recognized as being within the government's police \n     power. And, yet, plaintiff's suggested approach to content \n     neutrality in many instances would frustrate or preclude that \n     means--\n\n  Let me stop--\n\n       [T]he kind of narrow tailoring that is generally demanded \n     with regard to the exercise of such police power regulation \n     in the area of protected expression. If, as plaintiff \n     suggests, lawmakers cannot distinguish properly between \n     solicitation for immediate exchange of money and all other \n     kinds of speech, then it may be impossible to tailor \n     legislation in this area in a manner that avoids rendering \n     the legislation impermissibly over-inclusive.\n\n  It is free speech to say ``stick'em up, turn over your money or your \nlife''? No, it is not.\n  This is a pretty cutting and direct rebuttal, and a blunt \ncondemnation of Judge Paez from the Supreme Court of California--not a \nright-wing court, I submit:\n\n\n[[Page S1347]]\n\n\n       In our view, a court should avoid a constitutional \n     interpretation that so severely would constrain the \n     legitimate exercise of government authority in an area where \n     such regulation has long been acknowledged to be \n     appropriate.\n\n  Indeed, one of the main reasons our murder rate fell in this country \na few years ago was because Rudy Giuliani, as mayor of New York, \nexamined what was happening to crime in New York, and he decided that \nwhat was happening was we were allowing panhandlers and drug dealers to \nbe wandering the streets and they focused on small crime. They had a \nplummeting of the murder rate in New York. It dropped by about two-\nthirds in almost 1 year's time. In fact, there was almost a one-half \ndecline in the murder rate in 1 year.\n  This judge would say those kinds of regulations that allow a city to \ntake control of its streets is not valid, and it was reversed by the \nSupreme Court of California in pretty blunt language. To say he is not \nan activist and not willing to use his power as an unelected public \nofficial to set public policy in America is wrong.\n  That is only one of the cases that is involved here.\n  I am concerned about the sentencing of John Huang. It is a very \nimportant case. It is a case of real national importance. His \nactivities were followed. The Democratic National Committee had to give \nback $1.6 million in contributions that had come from illegal sources, \nmainly foreign sources--the Lippo Group, and Riady, and so forth. That \nwas a major news story, and it was for years.\n  We, as members of the Judiciary Committee, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, leaders in the House and Senate, urged Attorney \nGeneral Janet Reno to set up an independent prosecutor to investigate \nthis campaign finance problem. She steadfastly refused to do so, \nalthough she did in a lot of other cases.\n  The employees of the Department of Justice are answerable to the \nAttorney General, who holds her office at the pleasure of the President \nof the United States. She can be removed at any moment by the President \nof the United States. She decided she would hold onto that case. She \nwould not give it up, and she assured us that they would effectively \nprosecute it; they would get to the bottom of it and crack down on \nthese illegal contributions from foreign governments, mainly believed \nto be the People's Republic of China, a Communist nation, and a \nsignificant competitor of the United States, while they were stealing \nour secrets at the same time from our laboratories.\n  This is a serious matter. She would not give it up. She said she \nwould do a good job with it, and they took the case and investigated \nit. Her underlings met with John Huang's lawyers in Los Angeles, and \nthey discussed the case and the disposition of it.\n  I was a Federal prosecutor for 15 years. I have some experience. I \nhave been here for 3 years, but most of my career was as a Federal \nprosecutor.\n  So they have this meeting and they reach a plea agreement. I have a \ncopy of the plea agreement. They had a plea agreement and presented it \nto the judge.\n  I tell you, a judge is not required to accept a plea agreement under \nthe law, and I can document that entirely. A judge is not required to \naccept a plea agreement presented to him by a prosecutor. It is common \nknowledge and everyday practice. You present a plea to the judge. By \naccepting it, he accepts the guilty plea of that defendant. If he \nrejects it, he doesn't take the plea.\n  What did the plea agreement say about that particular issue? They \nsaid: Oh, you know, the judge is just a victim of the prosecutor. He is \njust bound by them.\n  I am telling you that a judge is a force. A Federal judge to a \nFederal prosecutor is a force. What he says or she says goes. They can \ndemand all kinds of things before they take a plea, and they should \ndemand all kinds of things before they take a plea.\n  For those who think the judge had no authority, I will read the exact \nlanguage between John Huang and the Clinton Department of Justice \nprosecutors.\n\n       Paragraph 15: This agreement is not binding on the court. \n     The United States and you understand that the court retains \n     complete discretion to accept or reject the agreed-upon \n     disposition as provided for in paragraph 15(f) of its \n     agreement. If the court does not accept the recommended \n     sentence, this agreement will be void, you will be free to \n     withdraw your plea of guilty. If you do withdraw the plea, \n     all that you have said and done in the course of leading to \n     this plea cannot be used against you.\n       In addition, should the court reject this agreement, and \n     should you, therefore, withdraw your guilty plea, the United \n     States agrees it will dismiss the information, the charge, \n     that is brought against you, without prejudice to the United \n     States right to indict you on charges contained in the \n     information and any other appropriate charges.\n\n  This is basic. They go to the court and plead guilty. The judge does \na pre-sentence report, as the Senator from Vermont said. A judge ought \nto be impeached if they don't do a pre-sentence report on a case such \nas this. That is routine. A pre-sentence report is made, which has not \nbeen made part of the record. There was a plea on what is called an \ninformation, not an indictment.\n  That means the case was not presented to a grand jury of 24 citizens \nto have them vote on what charges should be brought against John Huang.\n  Remember, the investigation began out of the charges of $1.6 million \nto the 1996 Democratic National Committee to benefit the Clinton-Gore \ncampaign.\n  Some say: Jeff, you are just playing politics. You want to talk about \ncampaign finance reform.\n  I am talking about the judge who took the plea on the man who was a \ncentral figure in the gathering of this money from a Communist nation. \nThis is serious business. We ought not to treat this lightly.\n  Any judge who had already been nominated by this President for a \nhigher Federal court position, I believe, should have realized the \nsignificance of the position he was in and conducted himself with a \nparticularly high level of scrutiny. It was produced after this plea \nagreement was signed between the prosecutor and John Huang and his \nattorneys. They produced an agreed-upon charge--not an indictment \nbecause it wasn't a grand jury; it is called an information. It is \nwritten by the prosecutor, saying: The United States charges.\n  They did this, and presumably filed the case on the docket. In some \nfashion, the case went to Judge Paez. Out of 34 judges, this case goes \nto the Judge who is already being nominated by the President for \nanother high court position. I know we have a clerk who has written a \nletter, but clerks get their fannies in trouble if they don't say those \nkinds of things. I don't know how this case got to him. I would like to \nhave that clerk under oath for about an hour, and I will know after \nthat whether or not it was handled in a legitimate way. That is what I \nbelieve. This little one- or two-line statement doesn't say a lot that \nsatisfies me. I have seen many of those statements. The President \nsubmitted a many affidavits saying, ``I didn't do anything wrong'' in \nhis civil cases. We learned later that he did do some things wrong.\n  It is curious to me that Judge Paez had drawn the other significant \ncampaign finance reform case for the Democratic National Committee in \nthe Clinton-Gore campaign. That was a Maria Hsia case. Maria Hsia is \nthe one laundered the money through the Buddhist nuns for the campaign. \nHe got both of those cases. That is a pretty high number. I would like \nto see a mathematical calculation of the chances of the two most \nprominent campaign finance reform cases both falling to 1 judge out of \n34 judges in Los Angeles, California. I don't know how it happened. \nMaybe there is a good explanation. If there is, I am pleased to accept \nit.\n  I have been in courts and my experience is, and this is the reason I \nam concerned, usually in Federal courts, if there are 50 indictments \nreturned by grand jury, they go on some sort of ``wheel'' and are \nrandomly assigned. Cases that proceed on information by a prosecutor do \nnot move through a grand jury. They move through the system in a \ndifferent direction and do not always go on random selection.\n  Years ago, I remember when we would take the case to whatever judge \nwas available. If a defendant wanted to plead guilty and we were \nsatisfied, we called the judge and said: Judge, can you take the plea \nthis afternoon at 4 o'clock? He would say, OK, or we would find another \njudge.\n\n[[Page S1348]]\n\n  It is much more possible there is ``judge shopping'' on a plea to an \ninformation than on an indictment returned by a grand jury.\n  I think we ought to know this before we vote on a lifetime appointee. \nI wish it had been discovered sooner.\n  This is not an individual member of a law firm who had his practice \ndisrupted. He is now a sitting Federal judge with a lifetime \nappointment. If he is not confirmed by this Senate, he will still be a \nFederal judge. He was previously confirmed by this Senate to be a \nFederal judge for the district court. I submit it is not too much to \nask for a few weeks, 2 or 3 weeks, to have the matter cleared up. It \nhas been 4 years; what is 3 more weeks to get the matter settled? That \nis what we ought to do if we want to do our duty.\n  I believe the evidence shows with some clarity why I believe the \njudge's actions at a minimum did not meet standards required of him.\n  There has been a lot of talk from those who defend Judge Paez. They \nsay he is a victim of the prosecutor. Prosecutors have to take the \npleas. It is routine to take the pleas.\n  This was not routine, No. 1.\n  Then they say the prosecutors were not doing their job. The \nprosecutors didn't tell him everything. He could not know everything.\n  We have examined the portions of the sentencing record we have been \nable to obtain, and we know at least some of those facts of which he \nwas aware. I will analyze, based on the record, what he knew and what \nthe sentencing guidelines require in terms of a sentence. I think I \nwill demonstrate to the satisfaction of any fair observer that the \njudge did not follow the sentencing guidelines effectively. He found a \nlower level of wrongdoing than he should have. That level of wrongdoing \nallowed him to issue a light sentence instead of a sentence in jail.\n  I take very seriously the sentencing guidelines that were passed by \nthis Congress a number of years ago. In the early 1980s, I was a U.S. \nattorney, a Federal prosecutor. The whole world held its breath when \nthe U.S. Congress eliminated parole. It said to Federal judges: We are \ntired of one Federal judge giving 25 years for bank robbery and another \ngiving probation for the same bank robbery offense. We don't want one \njudge who doesn't like drug cases giving everyone probation and another \njudge hanging an individual for minor amounts.\n  We are going to have guidelines. They passed detailed guidelines, and \nsay the range would be 26 to 30 years. If the judge desired, he would \ngive the lowest sentence allowed, 26; if he desired, he could give an \nindividual 30.\n  The guidelines mandated and controlled sentencing. It was designed \nout of concern that there had been racial disparity. It was designed \nout of concern about an individual judge's predilictions to be soft or \ntough, and tried to create a uniform sentencing policy.\n  We held our breath. We didn't know if judges got their back up. They \ndidn't like that. They had complete discretion before. They fussed. We \nwondered if they would follow. They did follow it. The courts of \nappeals and the Supreme Court directed them to follow. If they didn't \nfollow guidelines, they reversed the sentences and sent the case back, \nsaying: Follow these sentencing guidelines.\n  Even if we don't like them, they were passed by the elected \nRepresentatives of America in Congress. We, as judges, have to abide by \nthose guidelines.\n  That is the basic point on that.\n  The plea agreement was stunning, in my view. And the information that \nwas filed for the case was very troubling to me. We have a national \nmatter involving the very integrity of the Presidential election by the \ninfusion of large sums of illegal cash. It made national news, TV, \nradio, magazines, newspapers. What do the Department of Justice \nprosecutors do? Where do we charge John Huang with this fundamental \nviolation of the 1996 election? Is that what he pled guilty to, in this \ninformation and plea agreement? I have it right here. He did not plead \nto one dime of illegal contributions to the Clinton-Gore Democratic \nNational Committee campaign in 1996. His plea was to a $5,000 and a \n$2,500 campaign contribution to the Michael Woo for Mayor Campaign \nCommittee in Los Angeles. That is what he pled guilty to. That is all \nhe pled guilty to.\n\n  What did the prosecutor recommend? He recommended a nonincarcerated \nsentence of 1 year probation, no jail time, don't go to the Bastille, \ndon't get locked up, don't serve time in jail for one of the biggest \nintrusions of illegal cash in the history of American political life. \nPlead guilty to a violation in a mayor's race. Don't discuss the matter \nof the Presidential election; it might embarrass the boss of the \nprosecutor who is handling the case.\n  This is raw stuff. It goes to the absolute core of justice in \nAmerica. As U.S. attorney in Mobile, I prosecuted friends of mine, \nclassmates of mine, business people I knew in the community, and drug \ndealers galore because I swore an oath we would have ``equal justice \nunder law.'' It is on the Supreme Court, right across this street. Go \nlook at it: ``Equal Justice Under Law.''\n  I assure you that, this very day in Los Angeles, CA, 25-year-old \ncrack cocaine dealers are getting sentenced to 20 to 25 years in jail; \nsome, life without parole. I was involved in a cocaine smuggling case. \nFive guys from Cleveland or somewhere brought in 1,500 pounds of \ncocaine, and the five of them got life without parole the same day \nbecause the Federal sentencing guidelines are tough on drug dealers. \nAnd they have tough provisions for corruption cases. But what did he \nget? He got 1 year probation and a $10,000 fine.\n  Do you think Mr. Riady would be glad to pay that fine? Do you think \nthe Lippo Group could afford to pay a $10,000 fine for their buddy \nJohnny Huang? He testified. They said, you need to get at the bigger \nfish, and they did this because John Huang agreed to testify. Against \nwhom did he testify? Did he provide important information? That is what \nprosecutors have to ask themselves. They had apparently debriefed him \nat the time of his plea and gotten him to tell what he knew and what he \nwas going to cooperate about.\n  Who was the big fish? Who was the big fish that this great team of \nprosecutors agreed to prosecute? It was Maria Hsia. That is the only \nperson, to my knowledge, John Huang has ever testified against. From \nwhat I hear, it was a pretty weak bit of testimony in a recent case in \nWashington. So they plea-bargained with John Huang, the big fish, and \nended up getting testimony against some little fish.\n  What happens to Maria Hsia, the lady who raised all that laundered \nmoney at the Buddhist temple for Vice President Gore, the President of \nthis Senate, when he chooses to be, there raising the money? She got \nconvicted on five counts, allowing her to be sentenced for up to 25 \nyears in jail.\n  It has always been curious to me why they did not try that case in \nLos Angeles, which would have been a much more favorable forum, \naccording to most experts, than here in Washington. They brought it up \nhere. Many say the Department of Justice was shocked they got a \nconviction, but they got a conviction. So now we have John Huang who \nraised $1.6 million, who pled guilty to a piddling mayor's race case \nand got 1 year probation, testifying against Maria Hsia, who, in my \nview, would be less culpable than he. She is subjected to up to 25 \nyears in jail.\n\n  I am not talking just about politics. I love the Department of \nJustice. I spent over 15 years of my career in the Department of \nJustice. I love the ideals of the Department of Justice. When they \nsentence young people to jail for long periods of time, any prosecutor, \nany judge who does not have a moral commitment of the most basic kind \nto ensure that when people in suits and ties who have a lot of money \ncommit crimes, they serve their time, is not much of a judge or \nprosecutor, in my view. They are not worthy to carry the badge.\n  What else did they do in this great prosecution that Janet Reno held \nonto? I was stunned. He was given transactional immunity. Listen to \npage 3 of the prosecutor's agreement that the judge approved. Not only \ndid they not indict him for the $1.6 million or any of those funds, \nthey gave him absolute immunity. Look at the language. This is the \nagreement, the contract between the prosecutor and Huang:\n\n       The United States will not prosecute you for any other \n     violations of Federal law other than those laws relating to \n     national security or espionage, occurring before the date \n     this agreement is signed by you.\n\n\n[[Page S1349]]\n\n\n  That is a very dangerous plea agreement. I always warned my assistant \nU.S. attorneys not to sign those kinds of agreements. Under this \nagreement, had John Huang committed overt bribery, had it been proven \nhe walked into the Oval Office, as I think he did on a number of \noccasions, and met the President of the United States and gave him $1 \nmillion cash for some bribe, he could never be prosecuted for that. He \nhad complete immunity once this plea agreement was accepted. If he had \ncommitted a murder, he had complete immunity under Federal law based on \nthis agreement. If he brought in drugs from the East, he would have \nbeen given complete immunity and could not be prosecuted for it.\n  He was given a sweetheart deal, a year probation and a $10,000 fine. \nThat is not worthy of justice in America, I submit. It is a pitiful \nexample of prosecuting, a debasement of justice. It is wrong, not \nright, not according to ideals and standards. I am stunned reading this \ndocument.\n  How did they do it? These Federal Sentencing Guidelines contain some \npretty tough stuff. How did they wiggle this thing down to get a \nprobation deal? Let's see. I have the document here. We looked at it. \nWe looked at the factors in this kind of case, including the evidence \nthe judge had, according to the transcript of sentencing. There is \nprobably more evidence than this he could have considered, but we know \nthat the judge was given these facts.\n  The judge started out with a base level of 6. That is the basic \nsentencing level for this type of fraud or deceit activity. I do not \ndisagree with that. The prosecutors recommended a number of things, and \nthe judge agreed. They recommended only a four-level departure downward \nfor his cooperation. Apparently, the prosecutors felt the level of \ncooperation rendered by John Huang was not that significant. They asked \nfor a four-level downward departure.\n  In addition, he had to then deal with the factors that would require \nan upward raising from level 6.\n  The judge found more than minimal planning. He upped it two. \nCertainly there was more than minimal planning in this deal to raise \nthe money, even for the race in Los Angeles. It was 100-something \nthousand dollars--$156,000, I believe, for the total--even though he \npled guilty specifically to $7,500. They gave him that sentencing and \nsome other increases and decreases and adjustments.\n  I will go over several on which I believe the judge was clearly \nwrong.\n  In the facts before Judge Paez, I believe the evidence was clear that \na substantial part of this fraudulent scheme was committed outside the \nUnited States. Indeed, the money came from outside the United States. \nThat is what was illegal about it.\n  In the facts, the prosecutor said in the very information itself:\n\n       In 1992--\n\n  This is about the mayor's race--\n\n       . . . defendant Huang and other Lippo Group executives, \n     entered into an arrangement by which (1) Huang and others \n     would identify individuals and entities associated with Lippo \n     Group that were eligible to contribute to various political \n     committees.\n\n  They would find some people who were not identified as foreign and \nidentify them. That is the first step.\n  The second step, according to the Justice Department prosecutors, \nwas:\n\n       Huang would solicit the Contributors to make contributions \n     to various political campaign committees.\n\n  Huang would find buddies at Lippo, and say: You are eligible to give; \nyou give this money. And he would solicit them to give the money.\n  No. 3, the illegal part:\n\n       Lippo Group--\n\n  A foreign corporation out of Jakarta, Indonesia, with direct \nconnections to Communist China.\n\n       Lippo Group would reimburse the Contributors for their \n     contributions.\n\n  Do my colleagues see what that is? It is the classic launder. Lippo \nGroup cannot give a contribution, so they take one of their employees, \nHuang, and get him to identify some people who can, and then reimburse \nhim for the contributions. That is specifically provided for in the \nFederal election campaign law, and it is illegal. Wrong. No-no. You \ncannot do that.\n  Did some of this involve out-of-the-United States activities? Yes. \nUnder the Federal guidelines, a judge is required to add two levels to \nthe sentencing for that. Did Judge Paez do that? No, he ignored that \nprovision of the sentencing guideline. He had that information because \nit was in the charge brought against Huang to which Huang admitted \nand pled guilty.\n\n  By the way, apparently the pattern of the contributions to the \nmayor's race was exactly the same as they used in the Presidential \nrace: At least 24 illegal contributions spread out over a course of 2 \nyears involving multiple U.S. and overseas corporate entities of which \nJohn Huang was responsible for soliciting and reimbursing the illegal \ncontributions.\n  Those are the facts that were before the court. Judge Paez had that \ninformation.\n  Under the normal reading of the sentencing guidelines, that would \nhave added between two and four levels because he would have been \nacting as an organizer or manager in this criminal activity. He clearly \nwas. He was the hub of it. He was the organizer, the manager, and \nmanipulator of it all. He was the one doing the dirty work to put it \ntogether. What did Judge Paez do? He ignored that and did not increase \nit one level for being an organizer and manager. I believe he clearly \nwas required to do so if he were following the law that was mandated \nfrom this Congress.\n  These were the facts before the court.\n  No. 3: John Huang was an officer and director of various corporate \nentities involved in this case and also was director and vice chairman \nof a Lippo bank.\n  According to the guidelines, if a person commits a crime, and at the \ntime of committing that crime, abuses ``a position of public or private \ntrust,'' such as a director of a bank--we have that all the time. \nBankers are being sentenced, directors are being sentenced, and they \nhave their sentence enhanced because if they are an officer of a bank, \nthe court holds them to a higher standard and they get more time than a \nteller would get for a similar crime.\n  For abusing ``a position of public or private trust . . . in a manner \nthat significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the \noffense,'' as section 3B1.3, add two levels. Did the judge do that? No; \nno increase in levels.\n  When it all settled, Judge Paez was able to do what the prosecutors \nwanted. He helped them out. He bent the rules. He ignored the rules. He \nviolated the rules. And what level of offense did he find? He found \nlevel 8.\n  Why is that important? Level 8 calls for a sentence of from zero to 6 \nmonths. A judge can give zero or as high as 6 months. That is the only \nrange if he finds this level. If it had been level 9, zero would not be \nin the chart. It would not fit. If it was level 9, he would have had to \nserve time in jail. If it would have added up to, as I think it should \nhave, at least to eight more levels, he would have faced from 12 to 30 \nmonths in the slammer, where he ought to be. That would be a good deal \nfor him because that does not include the $1.6 million he raised in the \nPresidential campaign.\n  I do not know how in America we have become so blase. We have been so \nbeaten down and so overwhelmed with manipulation of lawsuits and courts \nthat I do not think we realize what is happening in this country. I am \namazed there was not an absolute outrage by the people who were \nfollowing this case over this plea. Maybe they thought he really was \ngoing to blow the whistle on somebody. Maybe they thought he was going \nto blow the whistle on the chairman of the Democratic Party or the Vice \nPresident or the President or the chairman of the campaign committee or \nsome big fish. Maybe they thought this was not such a bad idea because \ncertainly the prosecutors would not give away the case to get some \npiddling testimony against Maria Hsia. They probably did not need his \ntestimony against her anyway.\n\n  I do not know about this. We need a hearing with Judge Paez. Having \nsentenced young people to jail with no background, no money, bad homes, \ndealing in drugs, how can he send them off to jail regularly and not \nsend this guy in a suit and tie connected to one of the most wealthy \nenterprises in the world, the Lippo Group out of Indonesia, connected \nto Communist China, to jail? Why didn't he see fit to do anything about \nthat? Did it have anything\n\n[[Page S1350]]\n\nto do with the fact the President of the United States had nominated \nhim already for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals?\n  That is a troubling thought. He is entitled to have a day's hearing \non it, be asked about it, and defend what he did. My analysis is this \nis not good.\n  Further, in my practice before Federal judges, they were not at all \nworried about prosecutors. If I had walked into the Southern District \nof Alabama, before any of the Federal judges in that district--\nbasically, good, solid judges, not political, not out to befriend any \npolitical entity--and said, ``In our plea agreement, judge, he is going \nto plead guilty to contributing to the race of the mayor of Mobile; we \nare going to give him immunity for all these other charges'', I do not \nbelieve I would have the guts to walk in that courtroom.\n  That judge would say: Counsel, I am reading in the New York Times \nthis man gave $1.6 million to the President's race. You have him plead \nguilty to contributing to the mayor's race, and you give him immunity \nfor that plea? You want me to accept that plea? You are going to have \nto convince me. Show me.\n  None of that happened. He did not question this plea a bit. He \nfacilitated this coverup because he accepted all their accounting \nmeasures which manipulated the guidelines so he could get the \nsweetheart deal of probation. That is wrong. That is not good. I am \ntroubled by it.\n  I wish I realized this had happened and that we would have slowed \ndown the hearings when they came up so we could have gotten into it. I \nwish I had. I do not supervise the staff of the Judiciary Committee who \ndoes most of the background work. They do a great job. Somehow it just \ndid not get into our brains that this was a problem.\n  The more I investigate, looking in recent weeks at the actual \ndocuments from the court, and the more I read about this agreement and \nthe sentencing guideline violations, the more this matter is stunning \nto me. I do not like it. I believe it is potentially an abuse of \njustice in America. If that is so, and it was done to protect a \npolitical party, or a Presidential candidate, or a Vice President, then \nwhy should we reward this judge with an elevation to a higher court by \nthis very President who was protected? Why should we do that? I do not \nthink it is a good idea.\n  In our committee, it was a 10-8 vote that reported out this \nnomination. Eight members of the committee, based on the judge's own \njudicial activist views, opposed this nomination. That was before we \nfocused on this at all. I am concerned about that.\n  I wrestled with how to debate this procedurally. I have not agreed \nwith some of my distinguished colleagues that we ought to conduct a \nfilibuster. I just do not like that. I know Senator Leahy talked about \ndistinguished jurists and all. He did not have any hesitation to oppose \nJudge Bork, an extremely brilliant person, for the Supreme Court, but \nhe did not filibuster that nomination. We took the vote. He fought it \nas hard as he could, but he did not filibuster it.\n  I am not one who thinks we need to get into filibustering these \nnominations. He would be 1 of 28 judges. It would be unfortunate to \nmove us farther to the left in the Ninth Circuit and make it even \nharder to get back to the mainstream.\n  We ought to recognize he is a sitting Federal judge; he gets a \npaycheck every week. The difference in pay for a district judge and a \ncircuit judge is not much, frankly; he would hardly miss the money. I \nthink we ought to take a few weeks here and get into this. Let's have a \nhearing on it.\n\n\n                    Motion To Indefinitely Postpone\n\n  Mr. President, I move, in a postcloture environment, to postpone \nindefinitely the nomination of Richard Paez in order for this body to \nget the answers I believe every Senator deserves with regard to the \nconcerns I have raised about Judge Paez over the last several days. It \nis not in order for me to move to postpone to a time certain, according \nto our parliamentary and Senate rules, or I would do so.\n  Personally, I think 3 weeks, unless there is some complication, would \nbe more than enough time to have a good hearing. I am willing to vote; \nif he is confirmed, fine. If he has good answers for all this, fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is debatable.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nmotion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second at the moment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from \nVermont, the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, \nwho has always played a big role in these issues and is an outstanding \nadvocate. If I ever got into trouble, I would like him to represent me.\n  I think that is what we should do. That is the purpose of my motion. \nIn a prompt evaluation of this matter, the public and this country are \nentitled to know about it, because, remember, once that confirmation is \nconcluded, there is absolutely no other action this or any other body \nin the United States can take against any judge--in this case, Judge \nPaez--short of impeaching him for a criminal act.\n  We ought to consider that and take our time here in a few more weeks \nto settle this matter. We will feel better about ourselves. Perhaps the \njudge will have an answer. He certainly has a number of friends. He has \na good family.\n  I believe his deficiencies for the position revolve around an \nhonestly held political philosophy that I do not agree with--judicial \nactivism. That is the main basis for opposing his nomination. But I am \nvery troubled by the case I cited because I do not understand how it \ncould have been disposed of in the way it was. I believe the judge \nshould have blown the whistle on this with a proper plea bargain. It \nwas not done. I would like to have him have an opportunity to explain \nwhy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, a parliamentary inquiry: \nAs I understand it, the debate continues, and at the completion of the \ndebate, there will be a vote on Senator Sessions' motion, and a debate \non Paez and then Berzon--or is it Berzon and then Paez?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). If the motion fails, then \nthere would be a vote on the Paez nomination.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. That is the order? It is Berzon, Paez, or \nthe other way around?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Berzon and Paez, Berzon first.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. So there will be a vote, then, on Berzon \nand, after that, there will be the Sessions motion. And then, if that \ndoes not prevail, a vote on Paez?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Chair.\n  As we continue this debate, I refer back to the Ninth Circuit chart \nbehind me. This is a situation where we see, again, nearly 90 percent \nof the Ninth Circuit cases have been reversed by the Supreme Court. I \nhave had this chart up all morning because I think that is a very \nsignificant number, to say the least.\n  Earlier in the debate, my colleague, Senator Reid, made the argument \nthat oftentimes we have higher numbers, as much as 100-percent \nreversal, with some of the circuit courts. He is correct. But what he \ndid not say is that sometimes the reversals are one or two cases. For \nexample, he said there were several times when the First and the Second \nCircuits were reversed 100 percent of the time. He is right. In the two \ncases he cited, one was when there was only one case, another was when \nthere were six. Several of them were in the D.C. Circuit, the Federal \nCircuit, and others, a 100-percent overturn rate. The\n\n[[Page S1351]]\n\n100-percent overturn rate was based on one case.\n  What we are talking about here in the Ninth Circuit is, in 1996 and \n1997, 27 of 28 cases overturned, a 96-percent overturn ratio. I think \nit is very important to understand what we are talking about. This is \nnot 100 percent based on one case or two cases; this is based on 27 of \n28 cases in 1996 and 1997. In the 1997-98 term of the Ninth Circuit, 13 \nof 17 were reversed, for a 76-percent rate. Then again, the Senator \nfrom Nevada referred to some other circuits that year. Of course, the \nEleventh had two overturned out of two, for 100 percent. So it is \npretty misleading to suggest that 90 percent is very common in \noverturning these circuit cases because there are higher percentages in \nother cases when, again, it is based on 1 or 2 cases, not on 27 or 28, \nas it was in 1996-97. It is based on 13 out of 17 in 1997-98. As of \nJune 1999, it was 14 out of 18, for a total of 78 percent.\n\n  Yes, wherever you see a 100-percent overturn ratio, it is usually \nalmost exclusively one or two cases at the most. Those are very \ndramatic and significant statistics.\n  I think what we have here is a situation where we have a rogue \ncircuit that is basically way out of the mainstream of American \npolitical thought. Now we are putting two more judges on that court \nwho--I think it is pretty obvious based on the information we have \nheard--are going to add to that out-of-the-mainstream majority.\n  Let us look at specifically each of these judges. Richard Paez is one \nof the nominees we are considering. It is no secret I am opposed to \nthat nomination. In general, I oppose nominees who are judicial \nactivists. I don't think judicial activism is what the Constitution or \nthe Founding Fathers meant. I don't think they meant judicial activism \non the right, and I don't think they meant judicial activism on the \nleft.\n  I think what they meant is, interpret the Constitution, don't \nlegislate from the bench, and uphold the Constitution as it was \nwritten. That is what they meant. That is not what we have gotten from \nmany, certainly not from these two judges, and it is certainly not what \nwe have gotten from several other judges who were put on the bench over \nthe years.\n  In 1981, Richard Paez became Los Angeles Municipal Court judge, where \nhe served until 1994. Since then, he has served as a U.S. district \njudge for the Central District of California. We can go back through a \nlot of cases; we have done a lot of research. If we go back to Prop. \n187 and Prop. 209 in California, Proposition 187 was the California \ninitiative to limit public assistance to illegal immigrants, and \nProposition 209 was the California initiative to end State-run racial \npreference programs.\n  In 1995, Judge Paez spoke to the University of California at Berkeley \nLaw School. This is what he said:\n\n       The Latino community has for some time now faced heightened \n     discrimination and hostility which came to a head with prop \n     187. The proposed anti-civil rights initiative will inflame \n     the issues all over again without contributing to any serious \n     discussion of our differences and similarities or ways to \n     ensure equal opportunity for all.\n\n  Here we have a sitting Federal judge. He has his right to his \nopinion. We all do. But he is a sitting Federal judge talking about a \nCalifornia ballot initiative that was likely the subject of litigation. \nWhy is he taking that position publicly on that particular proposition? \nThe answer is simple: Because he has an agenda. Those comments were \ninappropriate for a Federal judge because his agenda is that he didn't \nlike Prop. 187. So, therefore, he said so.\n  I think we all know--I have heard judge after judge after judge after \njudge after judge come before the Judiciary Committee and, much to my \nconsternation and frustration in trying to find out their philosophy, \nnot answer questions about any case that might be pending or be before \nthem. As frustrating as it is not to get an answer, that is correct. I \ndon't think a sitting judge should be doing this. I think that issue \nalone on that one statement is enough to reject this nominee, just on \nthat.\n  Again, Proposition 187 later became California Proposition 209, and \nit passed. And Proposition 209 ended affirmative action in California \nState programs. Paez should know that the Judicial Code of Conduct \nprohibits him from comments that cast any doubt on his capacity to \ndecide this case or any case on an impartial basis. So he went over the \nline on an issue that he knew was going to come before him or certainly \nwas reasonable to assume was going to come before him.\n\n  Is there any doubt about how Judge Paez would now rule on any \nCalifornia proposition that affects affirmative action? Regardless of \nhow one feels about affirmative action, that is not the issue here. We \nnow know how he feels. He has already told us. So I don't know how he \ngives us a fair decision when he has already said what his decision is.\n  He did say he was an activist judge in his own words, even though \nsome on the floor have said he is not. I will repeat this again. He \nsaid:\n\n       I appreciate the need for courts to act when they must when \n     the issue has been generated as a result of the failure of \n     the political process to resolve a certain political \n     question. There is no choice but for the courts to resolve a \n     question that perhaps ideally and preferably should be \n     resolved through the legislative process.\n\n  In the Constitution, it doesn't say ``ideally'' and ``preferably'' in \nterms of the legislative process. If you can find that in the \nConstitution somewhere, that it says ideally and preferably the \nlegislature should pass the laws, ideally and preferably the executive \nbranch should enforce the laws, or ideally and preferably the judicial \nbranch should interpret the laws--it doesn't say any of that. There is \na very clear distinction in the Constitution: Three separate but equal \nbranches of the United States Government.\n  It is very clear who is supposed to legislate, who is supposed to \nwrite the laws. It is not the Supreme Court. It is not the circuit \ncourt. It is not the district court. It is not any Federal court. We \nhave a Federal judge talking about a California ballot initiative that \nwas likely the subject of litigation. I think that is inappropriate.\n  Now, again, let's go back to another example. This was a decision \nrendered by Judge Paez in the case of John Doe I v. Unocal in March of \n1997. I will read an excerpt from a letter that the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce sent to me Monday, March 6, about Judge Paez. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2000.\n     Hon. Robert Smith,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: I am writing to inform you of the U.S. \n     Chamber's opposition to the nomination of Richard A. Paez to \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Our \n     opposition to this nomination rests principally on a decision \n     rendered by Judge Paez in John Doe I v. Unocal (hereafter, \n     Unocal) in March of 1997.\n       Judge Paez' decision in the Unocal case suggests that U.S. \n     companies conducting business in a foreign country may be \n     held liable for the actions of that foreign government or the \n     actions of any business enterprise owned by the foreign \n     government. Aside from the constitutional question of whether \n     it is appropriate for the courts to pursue their own foreign \n     policy agendas; the Paez decision has the potential to cause \n     significant disruption in U.S. and world markets.\n       Although the decision in the Unocal case dealt with a \n     pretrial motion to dismiss and is currently on appeal, we \n     view it as a serious threat to international commerce. \n     Moreover, the Unocal decision represents a dangerous and \n     unconstitutional intrusion by the courts into the formulation \n     and implementation of U.S. foreign policy--a prerogative that \n     rests solely with the Congress and the Executive Office.\n       As you know, improving the ability of American business to \n     compete in the global marketplace is a top priority of the \n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce. As part of our efforts to advance \n     free trade, the Chamber's legal arm--the National Chamber \n     Litigation Center--has challenged similar attempts by state \n     and local governments to impose unilateral economic trade \n     sanctions. Recently, the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the First Circuit upheld a challenge supported by the \n     National Chamber Litigation Center to the so-called \n     Massachusetts Burma Law, which imposed sanctions on companies \n     doing business with Burma (Myanmar).\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am quoting a couple of \nparagraphs from the letter from Mr. Bruce Josten of the U.S. Chamber:\n\n       Dear Senator Smith:\n       I am writing to inform you of the Chamber's opposition to \n     the nomination of Richard A. Paez to the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Our opposition to this \n     nomination rests principally on a decision rendered by Judge \n     Paez in John Doe I v. Unocal in March of 1997.\n       Judge Paez's decision in the Unocal case suggests that U.S. \n     companies conducting\n\n[[Page S1352]]\n\n     business in a foreign country may be held liable for the \n     actions of that foreign government, or the actions of any \n     business enterprise owned by the foreign government. Aside \n     from the constitutional question of whether it is appropriate \n     for the courts to pursue their own foreign policy agendas, \n     the Paez decision has the potential to cause significant \n     disruption in U.S. and world markets.\n\n  The next paragraph:\n\n       Although the decision in the Unocal case dealt with a \n     pretrial motion to dismiss and is currently on appeal, we \n     view it as a serious threat to international commerce. \n     Moreover, the Unocal decision represents a dangerous and \n     unconstitutional intrusion by the courts into the formulation \n     and implementation of U.S. foreign policy--a prerogative that \n     rests solely with the Congress and the Executive Office.\n\n  You can't say it any more clearly than that. You don't get involved \nin U.S. foreign policy on the court. This is a prerogative that rests \nonly with the Congress and executive branch.\n  This man is intelligent, and no one is challenging that. He knows \nexactly what he is doing. He knows what the Constitution says. We will \ncertainly give him that. He also knows how to implement his agenda as \nopposed to sticking with the Constitution. That is what we are talking \nabout.\n  Now, this case is currently before the Supreme Court and we are \nhopeful, as Bruce Josten says, that the First Circuit Court decision \ninvalidating the Massachusetts law will be upheld.\n  That is in another case involving the national chamber and another \ncase that is referred to in the letter which will be part of the \nRecord. So this is serious business.\n  I also think this hostility to religion is pretty serious. I want to \nget into this because this is very disturbing. Again, this is about a \njudge's views on issues; it is not about the judge personally. I think \nwe see an open hostility to religion.\n  Mr. President, I want to preface what I am going to say just by \nsaying this: Just to the left of the Chair's left hand is a Bible. In \nevery court, they say we swear to uphold, to tell the truth, the whole \ntruth, nothing but the truth. That Bible is on display for everyone to \nsee here in the Senate Chamber. We swear oaths all the time on Bibles \nas witnesses. The President of the United States swears on a Bible and \ntakes an oath to uphold the Constitution.\n  Now, in that framework, I want you to think about what I have just \nsaid and then listen to what Paez said. This was in the L.A. Times in \n1989 when this case came up. It was a trial of five anti-abortion \ndemonstrators accused of trespassing and conspiracy, and it flared into \na dispute over whether the defendants can display their Bibles before \nprospective jurors. They had Bibles in the courtroom. It says:\n\n       In a rare flash of anger, Los Angeles Municipal \n     Judge Richard A. Paez warned the defendants and their \n     attorneys that he would instruct the court bailiff to \n     confiscate the Bibles if they continued to openly consult \n     or wave them during jury selection.\n\n  I want you to think about that. He is going to instruct the bailiff \nto haul people out--the defendants--if they are sitting there looking \nat their Bibles during jury selection.\n  Here is what he said:\n\n       ``I don't want them [the bibles] in view of the jurors,'' \n     Paez said sternly, raising his voice and motioning with his \n     hand. ``Don't give me a hard time.''\n\n  Now, we could go a little bit further:\n\n       Paez, who has said he is determined to prevent the trial \n     from being used as a platform to debate the moral and \n     political issues surrounding abortion, ordered . . . the \n     defendants to refrain from displaying their bibles \n     prominently to the jury box. He had given similar \n     instructions the day before.\n\n  But what happened was the defendants refused, challenging the judge \nto go ahead and hold them in contempt.\n  Further:\n\n       Co-defendant Michael McMonegle leaped to his feet, asking \n     that the prosecutor be removed from the case.\n       ``She is obviously an anti-Christian bigot,'' he said \n     loudly. Tensions escalated until Paez recessed for lunch.\n       The showdown between the judge and defense attorney was \n     averted, however, when [one of the lawyers] did not return \n     for the afternoon session, saying he had to attend another \n     trial in Federal Court.\n       A calmer Paez told the defendants that, while they may keep \n     the Bible on the counsel table, they must not attempt to \n     ``affirmatively communicate'' their religious beliefs to \n     potential jurors who are being questioned.''\n       ``I don't have a problem with the Bible. I don't care if \n     you have it there (on the table),'' Paez said. ``My concern \n     is I do not want any attempt to sway the jury. I don't want \n     demonstrative gestures . . . . That is not proper.''\n       Paez said, on the other hand, that he would consider \n     permitting the defendants, some of whom are representing \n     themselves, to quote from the Bible during closing arguments \n     or to carry the book to the witness stand when they testify.\n\n  I wonder whether Judge Paez put his hand on the Bible somewhere when \nhe became a judge. What is the big deal? Are we going to destroy \nourselves as a society because a group of defendants want to hold a \nBible in their hands when they come into a courtroom? What kind of a \njudge is this? This is the kind of judge that Bill Clinton is putting \non the courts. So when you hear about all this moral decadence and you \nhear about these problems and you hear about some being outraged by \nthese decisions, why should you be surprised? Your Senators are putting \nthem on the court. That is what is happening. Your Senators are \napproving these judges.\n  There is no mystery about this. It is a constitutional process. The \nPresident nominates and we approve or disapprove. So don't be \nsurprised, and don't blame it on the President. We can stop him if we \ndon't like them. He has a right to nominate anybody he wants to. We \nhave a right under the Constitution--sometimes we forget that we do--to \nadvise and consent. We are talking about extreme activism here. This is \nnot the mainstream.\n  How many people in America listening to me now can honestly say they \nfeel there is a threat to our whole constitutional process or to our \ncourt system because somebody carries a Bible into the room? Maybe we \nought to take it out of here. That will probably be next. Somebody will \nstand up in here--who knows--and say I don't want to look at that Bible \nin here. That is what is happening in this country. You wonder why. \nRead about the Roman Empire and find out what happened to them. Find \nout where they went. Moral decadence. That is what happened to them. \nThey went down the tubes. Is that what is in the future for America? I \ncertainly hope not. If we keep doing this kind of stuff, it will \nhappen. There are no surprises here. I don't understand why all these \njudges are doing this. There is nothing to understand. They are put on \nthe bench. Hello, we put them there. The President nominates them and \nwe approve them and on the bench they go. They make decisions not for \n10 days, not for 10 years, but for life. You can't throw them off the \nbench for the decisions they make.\n\n  That is just one.\n  Finally, in the case of the Los Angeles Alliance for Survival of the \nCity of L.A., Paez blocked a city ordinance designed to outlaw \naggressive panhandling--Senator Sessions spoke about it--claiming that \nit was facially invalid under California's Constitution. The Supreme \nCourt of California rejected Paez's decision and held that:\n\n       . . . a court should avoid a constitutional interpretation \n     that so severely would constrain the legitimate exercise of \n     government authority in an area where such regulation has \n     long been acknowledged as appropriate.\n\n  He is an extreme, liberal activist who is not afraid to say ahead of \nthe time in a matter that comes before his court how he is going to \nvote. He has done it on occasion after occasion.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question on \nthe Paez case which he cited?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes; the last one.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The so-called ``panhandling'' case. Will the Senator \nagree, however, that at the time Judge Paez made his decision, there \nwas a Ninth Circuit decision on all fours, which he as a Federal \ndistrict judge within that circuit was bound to follow, and he and all \njudges going for confirmation always say they will follow stare \ndecisis, that they will follow the decision?\n  Is it not a fact that in that particular case he had a decision on \nall fours from his circuit which he had to follow? And is it not also a \nfact that the Ninth Circuit then, under a new ruling, submitted it to \nthe California Supreme Court for their own ruling to the California \nSupreme Court? Because, obviously, you cannot appeal to the California \nSupreme Court, Judge Paez being a Federal court. But the Ninth Circuit \nthen submitted it under a certification procedure--a new procedure--in \nCalifornia to the California\n\n[[Page S1353]]\n\nSupreme Court. And then a year or so later, they came down and said the \nNinth Circuit's earlier ruling did not interpret California law \ncorrectly. They then changed theirs and thus changed the rule Judge \nPaez had to follow.\n  Is that not the fact?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Why was it overturned, reversed on \nappeal?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The point is, he has to follow what is in his circuit.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. But it was reversed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. No. The circuit did. Judge Paez's decision, as I \nunderstand it, did not go to the Supreme Court because it couldn't go \nto the California Supreme Court. The circuit itself then changed their \nearlier decision, came back to the beginning, and had to follow the new \ndecision, which he very much explained in his confirmation hearing. He \nsaid, among other things, that he lives in these neighborhoods; he has \nconcerns himself.\n\n  But the point is, just as some Federal judge in my State would have \nto follow the Second Circuit's decisions, and a Federal judge in the \nState of New Hampshire would have to follow the First Circuit's \ndecisions, he is caught kind of between a rock and a hard place.\n  What I am basically saying is, he should have followed his own stare \ndecisis. Yet, if he didn't, then he is an activist judge. This man is \ndamned if he does and damned if he doesn't.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I think the Senator is making my case \nthat the Ninth Circuit is a rogue circuit which does not really follow \nthe mainstream.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I notice that the Senator mentioned all the reversals. I \nthink half of those reversals in the last year were decisions written \nby Reagan appointees and Bush appointees. I don't recall the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire or anyone on his side voting against those judges.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, let me briefly discuss the \nother nominee, Marsha Berzon.\n  I think we have made a pretty overwhelming and compelling case about \nthe Ninth Circuit itself being out of touch in having almost 90 percent \nof its cases overturned, as the chart in the back shows. And we are \nadding two more judges to that court, if they are approved, who are \nbasically going to also, obviously, have cases overturned if they \nfollow along the lines we are talking about.\n  When I think of all the judges who are qualified, whatever their \npolitical philosophy, if they are qualified to be a circuit court \njudge, why do we pick a judge who opposes having somebody carry a Bible \ninto the courtroom? Because he is afraid somehow that is going to ruin \nthe whole judicial process and somehow threaten the Constitution or the \nliberties of the United States of America? It doesn't make sense. It \nreally, in my view, says a lot about the nominee.\n  We have approved many Clinton nominees who have come through this \nSenate. I voted for a lot of them myself. Some of them went through \neven without a challenge. But I think when you start talking about \npeople who are this extreme, this is a mistake. I believe it is a \nmistake we will regret.\n  I commend my colleague, Senator Sessions, for what he has done with \nthe most recent information he brought forth regarding the Maria Hsia \ncase and the John Huang case.\n  I am going to bring something up that may set a few people off. But I \nam being told, as I stand here now, that there is a possibility the \nVice President of the United States may be called, or has been called, \nto come to the chair during the vote on the Sessions motion or perhaps \non the vote on Paez.\n  I want you to think for a second about the implications of that. He \ncould be the tie breaker. He could be, in theory, the tie breaker.\n  Here you have the Vice President of the United States who was a close \npersonal friend of Maria Hsia who shook down Buddhist nuns for money, \nwas prosecuted for it, and convicted. And the judge whom Bill Clinton \nis trying to put on the court was involved in at least one case--not \nthat one, but one case involving Maria Hsia, which gave her a break, if \nyou will, a lenient sentence, and then in the other case, John Huang, \n$1.5 million from the Chinese Communist Government into the coffers of \nthis administration, of which Vice President Gore is a part, and he \ngoes in before Judge Paez, supposedly randomly selected, and gives the \nguy a plea bargain for a $7,500 contribution in the mayoral race in \nL.A., as Senator Sessions has pointed out.\n  Now the Vice President of the United States is going to sit in the \nChair and break a tie for that judge? How far will this administration \ngo to cover up and to be blatant and in your face on what they have \ndone?\n  If he sits in this Chair today and votes on this nomination, if it \nshould come to a tie, that is an outrage. It is outrageous, and it is \nan in-your-face outrage that I think the American people are not going \nto tolerate.\n  As Senator Sessions has so ably pointed out, I don't know whether it \nwas random or not--there were 34 judges who could have gotten those 2 \ncases, and he got both of them. That is point No. 1.\n  Point No. 2: If it were random, then perhaps he should have said: You \nknow, Bill Clinton nominated me, and I am before the Senate for a \ncircuit court nomination. Both of these cases involve scandals in the \nPresident's administration. I will take a walk on these. Assign them to \nsomebody else. But he didn't do it. He gave lenient punishment after he \ntook them. And we are going to tolerate that by allowing Judge Paez to \ncome in? It is just outrageous. It is just outrageous. Yet it is \nprobably going to happen here on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to the \nnominations of Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon for the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  The Ninth Circuit is clearly out of the mainstream of law in this \ncountry today. It is clearly the most activist circuit in the Nation. \nThe circuit has been reversed by the Supreme Court in almost 90 percent \nof the cases that have been considered in the past 6 years. In fact, in \nthe current session of the Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit's record is \nzero of seven. These nominees will not correct this problem.\n  Judge Paez is a self-described liberal. He has made inappropriate \ncomments regarding ballot initiatives that were pending in California \nat the time he discussed them. I also have questions regarding his \nsentencing of John Huang. Further, he has made various questionable \nrulings that call into question whether he understands the limited role \nof a judge in our system of government. For example, he ruled that a \nLos Angeles ordinance that prohibited aggressive panhandling was \nunconstitutional. He prevented the enforcement of a reasonable \nordinance enacted by the legislative branch because he said it violated \nfree speech rights. The California Supreme Court later ruled contrary \nto Judge Paez after the question was submitted to them. This shows a \nlack of deference to the legislative branch. Also, he made a \nquestionable ruling holding an American corporation liable for human \nrights violations committed by a foreign government, which prompted the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce to oppose his nomination.\n  I also cannot support the nomination of Marsha Berzon. She has spent \nmuch of her career as an attorney for the labor movement, and she has \nbeen involved in liberal legal organizations. She served for years on \nthe board of directors of the Northern California, ACLU, during which \nit filed questionable briefs in various cases.\n  If these nominees are confirmed, I hope they turn out to be sound, \nmainstream judges and not judicial activists from the left. I hope they \nwill improve the dismal reversal rate of the ninth circuit.\n  However, we must evaluate judges based on the record before us. I am \nnot convinced that these nominees are a sound addition to the ninth \ncircuit, especially when it is already leaning far to the left. \nTherefore, I must opposed these nominees.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the nominations of Richard \nPaez and Marsha Berzon to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. I intend \nto vote against Judge Paez and for Marsha Berzon. Because these \nnominations have received a great deal of attention, I would like to \nbriefly explain the reasons for my votes.\n  I want to begin by briefly discussing the ninth circuit. As a Senator \nfrom\n\n[[Page S1354]]\n\nArizona (the state which generates more appeals than any other ninth \ncircuit state except California), as a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and as someone who practiced law in the ninth circuit for \nnearly 20 years, I have a keen interest in matters affecting the ninth \ncircuit.\n  Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon are, of course, nominees to the ninth \ncircuit. I agree with many of my colleagues that nominees to the ninth \ncircuit should be given special scrutiny because of the problems with \nthe circuit.\n  The ninth circuit has received a great deal of criticism--so much, in \nfact, that Congress passed bipartisan legislation to require a blue-\nribbon commission to study the circuit. See Public Law No. 105-119, \nsection 305(a)(1)(B) and (a)(6). Before both the House and Senate \nJudiciary Committees, I have testified in detail as to my concerns with \nthe circuit, so I will not go into detail here. I would like to just \nmention one statistic that speaks volumes: In the past 6 years, the \nSupreme Court has reversed (often unanimously) the ninth circuit in 86 \npercent (85 of 99) of the cases it has reviewed. The average reversal \nrate for courts other than the ninth circuit is about 57 percent. As \nJustice Scalia commented in a September 9, 1998, letter to Justice \nWhite, the chair of the Commission on Structural Alternatives, the \nNinth Circuit's ``reversal rate has appreciably--sometimes \ndrastically--exceeded the national average.''\n  This is but one small piece in a mountain of evidence that indicates \nthat the ninth circuit is out of the mainstream of American \njurisprudence. See, for example, letters to the Commission on \nStructural Alternatives by Justice Scalia (August 21, 1998), Justice \nKennedy (August 17, 1998), and Justice O'Connor (June 23, 1998); \nCommission on Structural Alternatives, Final Report, December 18, 1998; \nReview of the Report by the Commission on Structural Alternatives \nregarding the Ninth Circuit and S. 253, the Ninth Circuit \nReorganization Act, hearing before the House Committee on the \nJudiciary, 106th Congress, 1st Session (July 16, 1999) (statements of \nninth circuit Judges Pamela Ann Rymer (member of commission) and \nDiarmund F. O'Scannlain). It seems clear that the ninth circuit has \nproblems. Even those who oppose dividing or splitting the circuit \nconcede this point. Thus, in my opinion, nominees to this circuit--\nwhich is effectively the court of last resort for more than 52 million \npeople--should be given special scrutiny.\n  The Constitution imposes an important role upon the Senate. In \nexercising its advice and consent power, the Senate must be vigilant in \nensuring that, at a minimum, nominees are of top legal caliber, possess \ngood judgment, have the proper judicial temperament, are of \nunquestioned integrity and impartiality, and would not abuse the great \npower of their office--an office they will hold for life.\n  In this regard, I would like to reiterate the comments that I made \nbefore this body 3 years ago, on March 12, 1997.\n\n       Some have attributed the Ninth Circuit reversal rate to the \n     unwieldy size of the bench. Others point to a history of \n     judicial activism, sometimes in pursuit of political results. \n     I suspect there is more than one reason for the problem. \n     Whatever the case, the Senate will need to be especially \n     sensitive to this problem when it provides its advice and \n     consent on nominations to fill court vacancies. The nominees \n     will need to demonstrate exceptional ability and objectivity. \n     The Senate will obviously have an easier time evaluating \n     candidates who have a record on a lower court bench. Such \n     records are often good indications of whether a judge is--or \n     is likely to be--a judicial activist, and whether he or she \n     is frequently reversed. Nominees who do not have a judicial \n     background or who have a more political background may be \n     more difficult to evaluate. . . . [T]he Senate has as much \n     responsibility as the President for those who end up being \n     confirmed. We need to take that responsibility seriously--\n     among other things, to begin the process of reducing the \n     reversal rate of our largest circuit.\n\n  I remain quite concerned about the ninth circuit. In the October 1999 \nterm, the U.S. Supreme Court has so far reviewed seven ninth circuit \ncases and in all seven cases the ninth circuit has been reversed--four \ntimes unanimously, twice by a 7-2 margin, and once by a 5-4 vote. If \nthe ninth circuit continues to remain out of step, it will be very hard \nto continue to give ninth circuit nominees the benefit of the doubt. \nThe risk is too great. The ninth circuit covers nine states and two \nterritories. To have so many subject to a circuit that so often errs \nshould concern us all.\n  Within this context, the general rule that a President should be \ngiven deference in making nominations to the federal judiciary is less \nrelevant to today's nominations.\n  While Judge Paez is academically qualified, I have reservations about \nhim for a variety of reasons. First, he made what many consider to be \ninappropriate comments while he was a federal district court judge. In \nan April 6, 1995 speech at Boalt Hall School of Law in Berkeley, \nCalifornia, Judge Paez said the following:\n\n       The Latino community has, for some time now, faced \n     heightened discrimination and hostility, which came to a head \n     with the passage of proposition 187. The proposed anti-civil \n     rights initiative [Proposition 209] will inflame the issues \n     all over again, without contributing to any serious \n     discussion of our differences and similarities or ways to \n     ensure equal opportunity for all.\n\n  Judge Paez was, as I noted above, a sitting federal district court \njudge when he made this remark, and litigation was pending in Judge \nPaez' own court, the Central District of California, regarding the \nconstitutionality of Proposition 187. The court had granted a temporary \nrestraining order and had before it a request for a preliminary \ninjunction, which the district court did not rule on until November \n1995, 7 months after Judge Paez' speech. As Senator Spence Abraham \npointed out in a detailed statement before the Senate, Judge Paez' \nremark seems inconsistent with Canon 4(A)(1) of the Model Code of \nJudicial Conduct which governs judges' extra-judicial activities. Under \nthat canon, ``a judge shall conduct all of the judge's extra-judicial \nactivities so that they do not cast reasonable doubt on the judge's \ncapacity to act impartially as a judge.'' In discussing Judge Paez' \ncomments in an October 29, 1999, editorial, the Washington Post stated \nthat ``[f]or a sitting judge to disparage ballot initiatives that were \nlikely subjects to litigation was inappropriate.'' And, indeed, the \njudge appears to have, at least privately, acknowledged this error.\n  Judge Paez made another troubling comment. On March 26, 1982, in the \nLos Angeles Daily Journal, he is quoted as making the following \nstatement.\n\n       I appreciate * * * the need of the courts to act when they \n     must, when the issue has been generated as a result of the \n     failure of the political process to resolve a certain \n     political question * * * There's no choice but for the courts \n     to resolve the question that perhaps ideally and preferably \n     should be resolved through the legislative process.\n\nAt the time of this statement, Paez was a municipal court judge. In the \nsame article, he commented that ``you could characterize my background \nas liberal.''\n  Judge Paez' supporters have made comments that raise concerns. For \nexample, in an August 13, 1993 Los Angeles Times article, Romana \nRipstein, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union \nof Southern California, made the following statement in discussing \nPaez's nomination to the federal district court: ``It's been a while \nsince we've had these kinds of appointments to the federal court. I \nthink it's a welcome change after all the pro-law enforcement people \nwe've seen appointed to the state and federal courts.'' If this is an \naccurate portrayal of his predilections, Ms. Ripstein's \ncharacterization is troubling. Similarly, in a November 17, 1995, Los \nAngeles Daily Journal article, trial attorney Steven Yagman commented \nthat ``Judge Paez embodies the ideal of the '60's. The Judge is an \nintelligent, moral person who got power and uses it to do good.'' \nJudges are not supposed to use power to do good (especially since that \nis a subjective term). Judges are supposed to apply the law. That's why \nwe say we are a nation of laws.\n  Judge Paez also has been criticized for giving--without explaining \nhow he arrived at the sentence--what many consider to be a light \nsentence to former Representative Jay Kim following Kim's guilty plea \nfor having accepted more than $250,000 in illegal campaign \ncontributions, the largest acknowledge receipt of illegal contributions \nin congressional history. In the March 10, 1998, Los Angeles Times, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Mansfield said, ``The sentence . . . \nmust not\n\n[[Page S1355]]\n\nbe a `slap on the wrist.' It must not approximate a penalty for \n`jaywalking'.'' The Los Angeles Times also reported that ``[o]utside \nthe federal courthouse, prosecutors made it clear that they were \ndisappointed but not stunned by Paez' sentence.'' On March 12, 1998, \nRoll Call wrote, ``All the evidence--and the fact that Kim received a \nlighter sentence than his former campaign treasurer--makes Judge Paez' \nsentence a mere slap on the wrist and makes us think that the Senate \nJudiciary Committee ought to question whether Paez isn't too soft on \ncriminals to be an appellate judge.''\n  None of these factors would by itself necessarily disqualify a \nnominee, but taken as a whole they are troubling and lead me to \nconclude that, on balance, Judge Paez is apt to be an activist rather \nthan a neutral arbiter. As a result, I reluctantly conclude that I \ncannot support his nomination.\n  I have concerns about Marsha Berzon. Almost her entire legal \nexperience has been in one narrow field--labor law. According to her \nSenate Judiciary questionnaire, ``more than 95 percent'' of her work \nhas been civil. Additionally, she stated that ``I have not personally \nexamined or cross-examined a witness in any trial'' and that ``I have \nnot tried any cases myself, jury or non-jury.''\n  Concerns have been expressed by the National Right to Work Committee \nand the Chamber of Commerce because of her narrow labor-oriented \nbackground. While I share these concerns, I am unaware of credible \nevidence suggesting that she fails to possess the requisite capability \nor temperament to serve on the bench. As a result, although I have \nserious concerns about her nomination, I will support it.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, there are few duties of the Senate more \nimportant than the confirmation of nominees to positions on the federal \nbench.\n  It is my strong belief that the qualifications of the nominees must \nbe weighed carefully and deliberately, no matter what level of the \ncourt system the nominee is supposed to join.\n  My decision on a judicial nominee's fitness is based on my evaluation \nof three criteria: character, competence and judicial philosophy--that \nis, how the nominee views the duty of the court and its scope of \nauthority. This is the original role of the judiciary: neither rubber-\nstamping legislative decisions, nor overreaching to act as substitute \nlegislators. I have heard from citizens complaining about the harm done \nby social activists of the bench--harm that may only be reversed by an \nextraordinary action on the part of the legislative branch, if at all.\n  It is exactly this aspect of the nomination before us that concerns \nme. I have reviewed the background materials on Judge Paez, and I \ncannot ignore the nominee's penchant for imposing his own political \nvision on the case before him.\n  Judge Paez has shown, on more than one occasion, his activist \njudicial philosophy. He was quoted in the Los Angeles Daily Journal as \nsaying: ``I appreciate the need of the courts to act when they must, \nwhen the issue has been generated as a result of the failure of the \npolitical process to resolve a certain political question. . . . There \nis no choice but for the courts to resolve the question that perhaps \nideally and preferably should be resolved through the legislative \nprocess.''\n  That is as clear a statement of judicial activism as I have ever \nheard.\n  On another occasion, Judge Paez demonstrated that his politics were \nmore important than the appearance of judicial impartially and \nindependence. In a 1995 speech he attacked California Proposition 187 \n(to end assistance to illegal immigrants) as anti-Latino \n``discrimination and hostility'' and Proposition 209 (to end racial and \ngender preferences in California) as anti-civil rights. What strikes me \nis that, at the time, both propositions were subject of pending \nlitigation. Clearly the Judicial Code of Conduct prohibits a judge from \nsuch comments.\n  Even if these were the only incidents of this kind, they would weigh \nheavily with me. But Judge Paez' record contains a number of other \ntroubling episodes. In the Los Angeles Alliance for Survival case, \nJudge Paez ruled that a Los Angeles city ordinance--prohibiting \naggressive panhandling at specified public places and passed in \nresponse to the death of a young man who refused to give a panhandler \n25 cents--was unconstitutional under California's constitution. He \naffirmed that this law constituted ``content-based discrimination'' \nbecause it applied only to people soliciting money and consequently \ngranted an injunction to prevent it from being enforced. However, apart \nfrom Los Angeles where the ordinance has yet to be enforced, the same \nlaw has been ``peacefully'' upheld in other parts of California by \nother federal judges.\n  The position expressed by Judge Paez was well out of the mainstream. \nThis became even clearer last week, when the Supreme Court of \nCalifornia, asked by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to rule on the \nmerits of Paez' holding, held that the Los Angeles ordinance was \nconstitutional and valid.\n  I have also been troubled about the implications and consequences of \nthe Unocal decision issued by Judge Paez in 1997, in which he ruled \nthat American companies can be held liable for human rights abuses \ncommitted by the foreign governments or overseas companies owned by the \nforeign governments with which they do business. This decision leaves \nopen a wide range of issues and has the potential to cause significant \nconsequences in the U.S. and world markets, not to mention U.S. foreign \npolicy.\n  It is not surprising that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has expressed \nits opposition to the nomination of Judge Paez to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit, in view of the decision's potential \nimpact on international commerce. At a minimum, Judge Paez pushed the \nlimits of prior law in this ruling--but this decision takes on a great \ndeal more significance in light of his prior statements and other \njudgments. This is a judge who is ready, willing, and able to act on an \nopportunity to open new frontiers in the law.\n  I share the concerns that many of my colleagues have raised about the \nstructure of the ninth circuit itself. It covers 38 percent of the area \nof the Nation and serves more than 50 million people, 20 million more \nthan any other circuit. It has 28 authorized judgeships, 11 more than \nany other circuit. I am one of the majority of Senators representing \nthat circuit who believe it should be split.\n  The ninth circuit remains, as the New York Times labeled it, ``the \ncountry's most liberal appeals court'' and a circuit out of the \nmainstream of American jurisprudence.\n  Over the past six years, the Supreme Court has reversed nearly 90 \npercent of the ninth circuit cases it has reviewed: in 1997-98, the \nreversal rate was 96 percent (27 out of 28 decisions) and 35 percent of \nthe decisions reviewed by the Supreme Court were from the ninth \ncircuit.\n  It has been suggested that the ninth circuit has difficulty \ndeveloping and maintaining coherent and consistent law because, as the \nsize of the unit increases, the opportunities the court's judges have \nto sit together and to develop a close, continual, collaborative \ndecision making decrease. Of course, this would increase the risk of \nintracircuit conflicts since judges are unable to monitor each other's \ndecisions and very seldom have the chance to work together.\n  In any event, my constituents and other citizens in the ninth circuit \nwould hardly be well served by adding yet another liberal judicial \nactivist to the current mix. Whether or not Congress ultimately \naddresses the circuit's problems by agreeing to the split I am \nadvocating, this Senate should not exacerbate the problems with this \nill-advised nomination.\n  I know the administration must take the best case possible for its \nnominees, but they cannot expect this Senator to ignore ``the other \npart of the story.'' Judge Paez' record reflects an eagerness to use \nhis authority to accomplish social change and a disrespect for \nprinciples of judicial decision making. In sum, I strongly believe it \nwould be a mistake to advance Judge Paez to the ninth circuit, and I \nwill vote against his confirmation.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the nomination of U.S. District Court \nJudge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit Court is, to put it mildly, \ncontroversial. His nomination has now been before the Senate for almost \n4 years, a period of time close to a dubious record. He deserves a \nvote, and at least serious consideration of an affirmative vote, for \nthat reason alone.\n\n[[Page S1356]]\n\n  The President nominates, and by and with the advice and consent of \nthe Senate, appoints judges to the Federal courts. That constitutional \nsystem allows Senators as much latitude to approve or disapprove \njudicial nominations on the basis of the nominee's judicial and \npolitical philosophies as it does to the President in making those \nnominations. In my view, however, that senatorial prerogative does not \nextend to rejecting Presidential nominees solely on the ground that a \nSenator would have chosen someone else. If a nominee clearly falls \nwithin a fairly broad philosophical mainstream and is otherwise \ncompetent, he or she should probably be confirmed.\n  In my view, Judge Paez falls within that broad mainstream. I have \nconsidered carefully the objections of colleagues whose views I greatly \nrespect. But I have also considered the views of Republicans and \nconservatives from California and who know Judge Paez best--including \nCongressman Rogan. Their views persuade me to vote to confirm Judge \nPaez to the Ninth Circuit.\n  The nomination of Marsha Berzon to the Ninth Circuit, however, seems \nto me to create too great a risk that we are confirming someone for a \nlifetime appointment to the most influential circuit court in the \ncountry, who falls on the far side of the philosophical divide I \ndescribed in my remarks on Judge Paez. Ms. Berzon has a relatively \nnarrow scope of private practice in a highly ideological field, and has \nbeen active and ideological in the expression of her political views. \nMs. Berzon also has no judicial experience, and so has no record by \nwhich to determine whether her ideological activism will be curtailed \nonce she is on the bench. It certainly is possible that it would be. It \nis also possible that it will not. Given the concerns of many, \nincluding my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee who voted against \nher confirmation, that the Ninth Circuit already is ideologically \nunbalanced, I simply am not willing to take this risk. I see no clear \nreason to consent, in constitutional terms, to her nomination.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Richard Paez' \nnomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. \nAnd I must say, this vote is long, long overdue. I have heard a lot of \ntalk here on the floor along the lines of hey--this is politics as \nusual. ``Oh when Senator Biden was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nwe held nominees up all the time.''\n  Let me say this: forget my tenure as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. As far as I know, no judicial nominee in the history of this \nnation has waited as long as Judge Paez has for a vote. Four years is \nnot even within the ballpark of a reasonable delay.\n  Judge Paez is a well-respected, experienced jurist. We already \nconfirmed his nomination to the federal district court bench. He has \nserved with distinction for 6 years on the federal district court and \nfor 13 years before that as a municipal court judge in Los Angeles. The \nAmerican Bar Association has given Judge Paez its highest rating, \npronouncing him ``well qualified.'' Judge Paez enjoys broad bipartisan \nsupport in his own community, including from law enforcement officials.\n  Judge Paez is an honorable man, a man of integrity, and a man who has \ndevoted his entire career to service--first, to service to the poor as \na committed poverty lawyer, and then to service to the public at large \nas a state and then federal judge. His record does the President and \nhis supporters proud.\n  From what I can tell, listening to the debate on the floor, the \nopposition to Judge Paez boils down to a few main points. First, to \nsome off-hand remarks that he made about the California initiatives \nthat maybe were ill-advised, but I believe may have been misconstrued--\nbut we have already heard this discussed at length on the floor. I \nthink it is a real shame to judge a man's distinguished 19-year record \non the bench on the basis of any single remark.\n  More importantly, though, opponents cite concerns about the allegedly \nout-of-whack ninth circuit, which detractors like to call a ``rogue'' \ncourt. Aside from the fact that several circuits are reversed as or \nmore often than the ninth circuit, I say this: If you have a problem \nwith the ninth circuit, let's consider whether we should change the \nninth circuit. I'm not saying whether we should or that we shouldn't, \nbut there are several proposals out there to restructure the court. \nLet's debate them.\n  Why should we punish the millions of people who live in the ninth \ncircuit by depriving them of the judges they need to mete out timely \nand fair justice? There are six vacancies on the ninth circuit--that is \nmore than 20 percent of the 28 positions authorized for the court. And \neven more judges are needed to handle that court's heavy case load. All \nof these vacancies, by the way, are characterized by the Judicial \nConference as judicial emergencies.\n  Let's not take out our differences on the ninth circuit on the people \nwho live there and more importantly for today, let's not take out our \ndifferences on this nominee or--for that matter, on Marsha Berzon, \nanother outstanding nominee who we are also voting on today.\n  The Los Angeles Daily Journal did an in-depth study of the criticisms \nleveled against Judge Paez and found that they were unfounded. What \nthey concluded was this:\n\n       The portrait that emerged is of a thoughtful, unbiased and \n     even-tempered judge, propelled into the political spotlight, \n     only to be trapped in a seemingly never-ending and bitterly \n     polarized nominations process.\n\n  Let us end that nominations process for Judge Paez here and now, and \nlet it end with a vote of support.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Hatch and Senator Leahy for \nall of the hard work they've put into, and continue to put into, the \njudicial nomination process.\n  I also recognize Senator Lott for making a commitment to bring the \nPaez and Berzon nominations to the Floor for a vote by March 15, over \nthe protests of certain members of his caucus.\n  First, a process comment. One of the most important duties of the \nUnited States Senate, as envisioned by our founding fathers, is the \nconfirmation of Presidential appointments. Article II, Section 2, of \nthe Constitution states that the President shall nominate and ``appoint \nAmbassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme \nCourt, and all other Officers of the United States'' with the ``Advice \nand Consent of the Senate.'' This is one of our enumerated duties in \nthe Constitution, and to my mind, we have egregiously failed to uphold \nthis duty in the case of Judge Richard Paez.\n  More often than not, nominations move through the Senate the way \nthey're supposed to. However, in this case, the system has broken down. \nAs a result, considerable public attention is being paid to this \nnomination, especially among members of the Latino community, because \nthe Senate is not doing its job. This is troubling. In regards to \nnominations, the public rightly expects us to move judiciously and \nexpeditiously and without regard to politics.\n  No nominee for judicial office should have to wait four years to have \nhis appointment confirmed. Allowing Judge Richard Paez and his family \nto wait four years for this body to perform its constitutional duty is \ninexcusable.\n  Judge Paez has opened up his life and resume for our examination, so \nthat we can make a very important decision about his qualifications for \na very important job, lifetime tenure on the United States Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. This is appropriate. Judge Paez should be \nsubject to serious scrutiny by this body.\n  But no citizen of this country should have to wait three Congresses \nfor this body to act. Just as he has presented his qualifications to us \nto the best of his ability, we need to make a decision about these \nqualifications to the best of our ability in a timely fashion.\n  In the private sector, how many of us would subject ourselves to the \nprocess that Judge Paez has subjected himself in order to be on the \nBoard of Directors or the CEO of one of America's top companies. Most \nof us would choose not to go through that process at all.\n  And that is exactly my point, we should not make this process so \npainful that America's best and brightest attorneys are unwilling to \nsubject themselves or their families to what has become an increasingly \nunpleasant and distressing process. We should be doing everything that \nwe can to encourage people like Judge Paez to aspire to be members of \nour judicial branch. This,\n\n[[Page S1357]]\n\ndespite lower pay and greater responsibility than most lawyers have in \nprivate practice.\n  As the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals wrote in a \nMarch 2, 2000 letter to Senators Hatch and Leahy, the Ninth Circuit \nCourt has had a 300% increase in workload with no increase in active \njudges.\n  Unfortunately, the Paez and Berson nominations are indicative of a \ngreater systemic breakdown that should be disturbing to both \nRepublicans and Democrats. Even Justice Rehnquist has felt it necessary \nto comment on the problems being caused by greater federal court \nworkloads, and too few judges.\n  Second, it's clear that the President has nominated lawyers of \nextraordinary ability when it comes to Judge Richard Paez and Ms. \nMarsha Berzon. Both have received the American Bar Associations's \nhighest rating (``well-qualified'') and we are fortunate that these \nindividuals have been willing to go through such a grueling federal \njudicial nomination process thus far.\n  I ask my colleagues today take their constitutional duty seriously \nand vote for these nominees on the basis of their objective \nqualifications, and not on the basis of petty politics. This process is \nmuch too important to the citizens of this great democracy to do \notherwise.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I see the Senator from California. I \nsee the majority leader noticeably present on the floor. I am curious \nto know about the procedure. Are we going to continue?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes. There is a unanimous consent for the \nmajority leader to speak now and, after he finishes, we go back to the \ndebate.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder, after the majority leader speaks and the \nSenator from California speaks, if I could be recognized, in that \norder.\n  Might I ask the senior Senator from California how long she will \nspeak?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Alaska. I will yield myself \n10 minutes from our manager's time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. And the leader, of course, will go on for whatever \ntime is necessary. I ask unanimous consent for that time allotment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, what we do today with a vote on these \nnominations is important. It does matter. I am sure both of these two \nindividuals, Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, are fine people and are \nwell intentioned in the positions they take, but we are going to vote \non them being confirmed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for life. \nThat is serious.\n  Yes, the President has a right to make nominations to the Federal \nbench of his choice. However, we have a role in that process. We \nshould, and we do, take it very seriously. We should not give a man or \na woman life tenure if there is some problem with his or her \nbackground, whether academically or ethically, or if there is a problem \nwith a series of decisions or positions they have taken.\n  I certainly don't take this lightly. I would have preferred if these \nindividuals had never been nominated, never been reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee, and that the situation would not have arisen in \nwhich there is this vote on the floor. But after a lot of consultation \nback and forth with my colleagues, a reasonable case could be made they \nshould at least have a vote on their confirmation one way or the other.\n  As majority leader, I must make decisions as to the time and manner \nin which matters are considered. Sometimes my colleagues think it is \nthe right way and the right time; sometimes that is not the case. Once \nI make a commitment for a vote, I am going to keep that commitment the \nbest I can, keep my word, and go forward.\n  I have colleagues on my side of the aisle who don't like going \nforward with this vote. At this time, I think it is appropriate that we \nhave a vote. I urge my colleagues to vote against these two nominees. \nHowever, it is time we have the vote, and we will do so today.\n  Let me discuss why I feel so strongly that these two nominees should \nnot be confirmed. First, it is about the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, which is clearly a circuit court of appeals that is out of \nsync with the mainstream and has been repeatedly reversed by the \nSupreme Court.\n  In recent days, I have seen references to the Ninth Circuit as \ncontaining ``California, Arizona, and a handful of other states.'' My \nstate is in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, but I would take \numbrage if my circuit was referred to as ``the circuit that has Texas \nand other States.'' But there are only three States in our circuit, the \nFifth Circuit.\n  The Ninth Circuit clearly has a problem. It is too large, it is too \nunwieldy, and it is not functioning effectively. It is not serving the \npeople of the circuit well, and we must remember that it is not just \nthe ``circuit of California, Arizona, and other States.'' How would \nsomeone like to be in the circuit that is referred to that way if one \nlives in Utah, Nevada, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, \nGuam, and Hawaii?\n  We need to do something about this. We have known we needed to do \nsomething about it for years, but we haven't done it. Millions of \npeople who live in the States of the Ninth Circuit must submit their \ndisputes to a court that has consistently flouted the statutes and the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  It covers 50 million people. Nearly 40 percent of the area of this \ncountry is in this one circuit. In the past 6 years, the Ninth Circuit \nhas been reversed by the Supreme Court in 85 out of 99 cases \nconsidered, roughly a 90-percent reversal rate. In most classes, that \nwould be rated as an abysmal failure. There is something not right \nhere.\n  It was bad before the President Clinton appointees were added, and it \nhas gotten worse. In the 1996-1997 term, the Ninth Circuit was reversed \n27 out of 28 times, including 17 unanimous reversals. There is \nsomething wrong with this circuit.\n  Let me give some specific examples of the kind of decisions they are \nentering:\n  In Washington v. Glucksberg, the Ninth Circuit found a constitutional \nright to die, a decision reversed unanimously by the Supreme Court;\n  In Calderon v. Thompson, 1997, the Ninth Circuit blocked an execution \nbased on a procedural device the Supreme Court called a ``grave abuse \nof discretion'';\n  In Mazurek v. Armstrong, 1996, the Ninth Circuit enjoined a Montana \nlaw allowing only doctors to perform abortions, only to be reversed \nonce again by the Supreme Court.\n  I have a long list of decisions from the Ninth Circuit, and I ask \nunanimous consent I be able to have these lists and other material \nprinted at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LOTT. There is a problem with this circuit. It is a circuit that \nhas serious problems with its rulings. It is an extremely liberal \ncircuit, and it will get worse with these two nominees. That is one of \nthe reasons I have been hesitant to bring up the nominees.\n  Now, let me go to the next point. I hope it won't happen, but I \nsuspect there is going to be somebody in this Chamber, or certainly in \nthe media, who will suggest that the consideration of these nominees \nhas something to do with their race or gender.\n  These charges are totally false. We don't have a place where we check \nrace or gender when we consider these nominees. It is irrelevant. We \nhad a nominee last year who was defeated in the Senate that turned out \nto be African American. I am confident at least half the Senators \ndidn't even know that. We didn't talk about that.\n  In this case, the fact that Judge Paez is Hispanic is not a \nconsideration at all. We need more minorities and women on the courts. \nLet me make this point so everybody will be aware of it now: Last year, \n18 of the 34 judicial nominees confirmed by the Senate, or 53 percent, \nwere women or minorities. By contrast, only 51 percent of President \nClinton's nominees were women or minorities. However, I am not going to \ncharge him with some sort of discrimination based on race or gender.\n  I will have printed for the Record a list of some of the statistics \nshowing this Senate is more than willing and desirous of confirming \nwomen and minorities of all backgrounds to the courts. Over the past \nseveral years, we have confirmed a high percentage from minority groups \nor women, including a unanimous or near-unanimous confirmation of an \nHispanic nominee to\n\n[[Page S1358]]\n\nthe Third Circuit Court of Appeals earlier his week.\n  While some have expressed concern at the delay in bringing up the \nnominations we are considering today, it is important to keep in mind \nthat each of these nominees was opposed by almost half of the Members \nof the Judiciary Committee. This is the committee charged with \nreviewing the background and qualifications of nominees. Any time so \nmany Members of the Judiciary Committee express this level of concern, \nthis body should proceed with caution.\n  The charges that race has somehow played a part in the Senate's \nconsideration of these or other nominees is more than false. It demeans \nthe Senate and those making the charges. If the charges are made in a \ncynical attempt to gain some political advantage, that is even worse. \nNo real or perceived political advantage is worth debasing your own \nintegrity by falsely impugning that of others.\n  Let me go to the specifics of Judge Paez. Some say: How long must he \nwait? What will happen? He is on the Federal district court now, so it \nis not as if he is waiting for employment.\n  He has a long record and philosophy that is very liberal. That is not \ndisqualifying anymore than we should disqualify somebody because they \nare conservative. He has a record also of highly questionable rulings \nand political statements while sitting on the bench. When he was being \nconsidered as a judge, for instance, he was quoted as saying:\n\n       The courts must tackle political questions that ``perhaps \n     ideally and preferably should be resolved through the \n     legislative process''.\n\n  That is the point. He believes the courts should be willing to do \nwhat is our job, not theirs. That is a fundamental problem.\n  When he was being nominated to the Federal district bench, no less an \narbiter of liberalism than the American Civil Liberties Union \nconsidered him a ``welcome change after all the pro law enforcement \npeople we have seen appointed.''\n  I think the American people want pro law enforcement people appointed \nto the bench regardless of their background or any other consideration.\n  There have been some astounding cases: Judge Paez struck down a Los \nAngeles antipanhandling ordinance enacted after a panhandler killed a \nyoung man over a quarter; he ruled companies doing business overseas \ncan be held liable for human rights abuses committed by foreign \ngovernments.\n  Excuse me? How in the world could he extrapolate anything in the laws \nof this country or the Constitution that would allow him to make such a \ndecision?\n  Now we have the situation with John Huang. I do not know what \nhappened there, but it seems to me there is a conflict of interest. The \nAmerican people need to understand. He somehow or other was selected to \nbe the judge in the John Huang case, and he agreed to a very light \nplea-bargained sentence at a time, I believe, when his confirmation was \nstill pending, involving a matter where the President of the United \nStates was clearly implicated. There is something not right about that. \nIt does not pass the smell test.\n  Am I willing now to charge some illegality, or some totally unethical \nact? No. But we should have done more on this, on that point, before we \ncame to this vote.\n  Last, but not least, when you are on the bench--I have kidded my \nfriends who are Federal judges about how they ascend to someplace in \nthe sky, never to be heard from again: Retirement to the Federal bench. \nThey laugh. I laugh. But in a way, that is the way it is and that is as \nit should be. Because when you go on the bench, your political \ninvolvement, your personal preferences, should remain private. You \nshould assume the bench and keep your mouth shut until you rule \nappropriately.\n  When you have a judge speak out, as Judge Paez did in 1995, for \nexample, and attack two California ballot initiatives while they were \nstill in litigation or potentially the subject of litigation, that is a \nbig problem. The Judicial Code of Conduct prohibits judges, as it \nshould, from comments that ``cast reasonable doubt on his capacity to \ndecide impartially, any issue that may come before him,'' that is a \nfundamental point.\n  You cannot, as a Federal judge, make political statements on \ninitiatives on the ballot that bring into question your impartiality in \nthese cases in any way. It is highly inappropriate.\n  With regard to the nomination of Ms. Berzon, she does not have a \nrecord of judicial decisions, having served as a prominent labor lawyer \nfor many years. Clearly, however, her positions are very questionable \nin terms of how she would rule when she got on the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals. I think it would be a mistake.\n  I am particulary troubled by some of the extreme pro-labor positions \nshe has advocated--positions that have been summarily rejected by the \nSupreme Court.\n  Some of the questionable positions she has advocated include arguing \nthat new employees, or more junior employees that worked during a \nstrike, must be layed off in favor of more senior employees when the \nstrike is over. She also argued unsuccessfully that unions should be \nable to prevent members from resigning during a strike.\n  Finally, her statements on the use of union funds for political \nactivities--or other activities not directly related to union \nnegotiations and bargaining--raise serious questions about her \nwillingness to live within the letter and spirit of the Beck decision.\n  It is no wonder that the proponents of these nominations ignore the \nrecord of the Ninth Circuit and the judicial approach of these \nnominees. We are told instead of their strong qualifications and \npersonal attributes. I have no doubt that Judge Paez and Ms. Berzon are \nfine lawyers and are technically competent. My concern is with their \njudicial philosophies and their likely activism on the court.\n  Let me go back to my beginning point. This is very serious. We are \ngoing to be voting on putting these two individuals on the Ninth \nCircuit for life. I think the record is clear that they would be \nactivists on the bench.\n  Judicial activism is a fundamental challenge to our system of \ngovernment, and it represents a danger that requires constant \nvigilance. In our tradition and under our laws, we give power not to a \nspecific group of trained experts, but rest our faith in the ability of \nall Americans, whatever their backgrounds, to participate in their \ngovernment. Judicial activism robs the people of their role, and \nundermines the basis of our democracy.\n  Nowhere is this problem of judicial activism greater than in the \nNinth Circuit. And nowhere is it more incumbent upon us as Senators to \ntake seriously our responsibility to restore a proper respect for our \nsystem of representative government.\n  I believe these nominees should not be confirmed. Number 1, because \nthere is a problem with this circuit; No. 2, because, in the case of \nJudge Paez, of the rulings he has been involved in, many of them of a \nhighly questionable nature; No. 3, in his case, for remarks he has made \nin the political arena while sitting as a judge on issues that could \ncome before him.\n  While her public record is not as extensive, the same questions exist \nfor Ms. Berzon, particulary when you look at her positions with regard \nto the type of issues that may well be coming before the Ninth Circuit, \nand eventually, before the Supreme Court. There is great doubt about \nthe basis for her confirmation.\n  While I have kept my word and we will vote on these judges today, I \nwill vote against them both.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n              ninth circuit reversals by the supreme court\n\n       For the period from 1994 through 2000, 85 of the 99 Ninth \n     Circuit cases considered by the Supreme Court were \n     overturned:\n       1999-2000 7 of 7--100%.\n       U.S. v.

Since \n     all of these judges received Senate confirmation, the \n     Senate's record must, by definition, mirror the President's. \n     In fact, in 1999, 53% of the nominees confirmed were women \n     and/or minorities, compared to only 51% of Clinton's \n     nominees.\n       This Congress, over half (21) of the total number (42) of \n     nominees reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee were \n     either a minority, a female, or both. Similarly, over half \n     (18) of the total number (34) of nominees confirmed were \n     either a minority, a female, or both.\\1\\ Half of the 34 \n     nominations pending in committee are white males. (Statistics \n     as of 2/29/00)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ These figures include non-controversial nominees such as \n     Charles Wilson (Eleventh Circuit), Ann Claire Williams \n     (Seventh Circuit), Adalberto Jose Jordan (S.D. Fla.), Carlos \n     Murguia (D. Kan), William Haynes, Jr. (M.D. Tenn.), Victor \n     Marrero (S.D.N.Y.), and George Daniels (S.D.N.Y.), all of \n     whom were confirmed within 7 months of their nomination.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       According to the Judiciary Committee, during the first \n     session of the 106th Congress, on average minorities were \n     reported out of committee faster (108 days) than white male \n     candidates (123 days). Similarly, on average minorities were \n     confirmed faster (122 days) than white males (143 days).\n       Senator Hatch in an Op-Ed to the Washington Post cited a \n     Task Force on Federal Judicial Selection study reporting that \n     the pace of actual confirmations was the same for minorities \n     and non-minorities in 1997-98.\n       In the Democratic-controlled 102nd Congress, the Senate \n     took 18% longer to confirm minority and female district court \n     nominees than white males. In comparison, the Republican-\n     controlled Senates in 97th, 98th, and 99th Congresses moved \n     female nominees faster than males.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, first, I do thank the distinguished \nmajority leader for keeping the commitment he made to me, to Senator \nDaschle, to the two Senators from California, and others last year to \nbring these nominations to a vote. I appreciate that. I wish, of \ncourse, he would vote for the two nominees, but that is his right.\n  We keep talking about these reversal rates, the Ninth Circuit being \nreversed the most. Of course, that is not the case. I will put in the \nRecord later on a letter from Chief Judge Hug, who shows a number of \ncircuits that have been reversed far more than the Ninth Circuit.\n  I will also point out, as I did earlier, about half of the most \nrecent reversals have been on decisions written by appointees of \nPresident Reagan and appointees of President Bush. So I would not be \nblaming President Clinton for this.\n  We have heard a great deal about the so-called panhandling decision. \nThe judge had no choice in that matter. He had a case on all fours from \nhis own circuit. As a district judge, he had to follow that decision. \nWhether he liked it or not, that is what he had to follow. \nSubsequently, when his own circuit reversed its position on it, then he \nwould have to follow the new position.\n  Last, I am disturbed to have it suggested that the judge could not \ntell litigants in a courtroom that they could not wave anything in the \nface of jurors, whether it is a Bible or a newspaper. I yield to nobody \nin this body in my defense of the first amendment. I have certainly \nreceived more first amendment awards than anybody serving here. I would \nsay also if they were to wave a newspaper and a headline in the face of \njurors, a judge could say: No, you can't do that.\n  That is not freedom of the press. That is not freedom of religion. No \njudge anywhere is going to allow litigants to wave anything in the face \nof jurors to influence them, nor to act outside of the regular rules of \ncourt, or when you can refer to an item in evidence or not, when you \ncan refer to it in argument.\n  I just point that out. We continuously attack this man for doing the \nthings he is supposed to do.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from California who seeks 10 \nminutes, I understand. I yield 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes as a 7-\nyear member of the Judiciary Committee, to set the record straight on \nsome of the comments that have been made with respect to the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. I have heard that circuit called a rogue \ncircuit, out of control, out of sync with the rest of the Nation. All \nof this is based on statistics for 1 year, 1996-1997, when the Supreme \nCourt reversed that circuit 27 out of 28 times.\n  The question is, Even in that year, did that place it as the most \nreversed circuit? The answer is no because even in that year they fell \nin the middle of the pack. When the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was \n95 percent, it was still less than five other circuits: The Fifth, the \nSecond, the Seventh, D.C., and Federal Circuits all had a 100-percent \nreversal rate.\n  You can seek out the Ninth Circuit because it has 9,000 cases on \nappeal as opposed to a circuit with 1,000 or 1,500 cases. But the \nrecord is the record, even in that year, that much maligned year that \nis the basis of all of these comments.\n  Let's look at some of the other years. In the 1998-1999 Supreme Court \nsession, the Supreme Court reviewed 18 cases of the Ninth Circuit; 4 \nwere affirmed, 11 were reversed, and 3 had mixed rulings. So only 11 \nout of 18 cases were outrightly reversed. That is a 61-percent reversal \nrate.\n  Is that the worst? No. This is less than the reversal rates for the \nThird Circuit, 67 percent; the Fifth Circuit, which was reversed 80 \npercent of the time; and the Seventh Circuit, 80 percent of the time; \nthe Eleventh Circuit, 88 percent; and the Federal Circuit, 75 percent.\n  In terms of reversals, the Ninth Circuit is not at the bottom of the \npack, it is in the middle of the pack.\n  I think I know why there were newspaper articles. The Ninth Circuit \nhas been made a target by many conservatives who either want to see it \nsplit or, in some way, destroyed. That has become very clear to me as a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee as I have watched proposal after \nproposal surface.\n  Am I always pleased with the Ninth Circuit? Absolutely not. Do I like \nall the decisions? Of course not. But the point is, the Ninth Circuit \nis well within the parameters, and in virtually every year that one can \nlook at reversals, one will see the Ninth Circuit is approximately in \nthe middle of the pack.\n  The argument is also made that Clinton appointees are making \ndecisions that are being reversed. I have looked at the Ninth Circuit \njudges who were reversed over the last 3 years by the Supreme Court. \nOnce again I correct the record. On only eight occasions in the last \nthree full Supreme Court terms have Clinton appointees on the Ninth \nCircuit joined in decisions later reversed by the Supreme Court. At the \nend of the 1998-1999 term, Clinton appointees were 20 percent of the \njudges on the Ninth Circuit.\n  If one wants to compare, compare Clinton appointees with Reagan \nappointees. Reagan appointees on the Ninth Circuit have been overturned \nin 30 instances from the 1996-1997 Supreme Court term through the 1998-\n1999 term. Currently, there are the same number of Reagan appointees on \nthe Ninth Circuit as Clinton appointees.\n  I have wondered, as I have watched this debate emerge for the last 7 \nyears, why there is this persistent effort to demean, to break up, in \nsome way to destroy this court. I have a hard time fathoming why.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a \nletter from the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              United States Courts\n\n\n                                        for the Ninth Circuit,\n\n                                          Reno, NV, March 1, 2000.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senator, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senator, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Hatch and Leahy: I write on behalf of the \n     Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to emphasize the importance of \n     filling the judicial vacancies on this court.\n       During the four years that I have been Chief Judge of the \n     Ninth Circuit, we have had up to ten vacancies on the court \n     of appeals. We now have six vacancies, two have been vacant \n     since 1996, two since 1997, one since 1998, and one since \n     1999. It has been very difficult to operate a court of \n     appeals with up to one-third of our active judges missing. As \n     you know, I have worked with the White House and the Senate \n     in an attempt to fill these vacancies in a timely manner, and \n     I am continuing to do so.\n\n[[Page S1360]]\n\n       As Chief Judge, I have implored our active judges and our \n     senior judges, on an emergency basis, to carry a larger \n     caseload during this interim while the vacancies are being \n     filled, in order to do our best to avoid building up a \n     backlog of cases with the consequent delay for the litigants.\n       Our judges have been most responsive in hearing \n     considerably more cases than would ordinarily be assigned. I \n     am very grateful, but I cannot expect the judges to do this, \n     on an emergency basis, for the indefinite future.\n       In addition, we have called upon the district judges within \n     our circuit to serve on panels, as well as visiting judges \n     from other circuits. However, this is not the ideal way to \n     perform the services of a court of appeals. The appeals from \n     the Ninth Circuit should be heard by the judges of the Ninth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Despite all these efforts, we do have a backlog of cases, \n     which principally affect civil cases, some of which have had \n     to wait a year or more to be heard. My major concern is that \n     we have had a significant increase in filings this past year, \n     which considerably exceed the number of cases we are able to \n     terminate even with this enhanced effort. In the year ending \n     December 31, 1999, the number of appeals filed was 9,444, and \n     the number of appeals terminated was 8,407. This is a \n     difference of over 1,000 cases.\n       If our six vacancies were filled and those judges were on \n     our court, it would mean we could decide an additional 800 \n     cases on the merits. If they are not filled, I can anticipate \n     considerable delay for the litigants of this circuit.\n       Our court is very pleased that the leadership of the Senate \n     has committed to hold a floor vote this month on nominees \n     Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon. We have every hope that \n     they will be confirmed. We would ask, however, that the other \n     nominees, Barry P. Goode, James F. Duffy, Jr., Richard C. \n     Tallman, and Johnnie B. Rawlinson receive hearings before the \n     Judiciary Committee in the near future. It is vital to our \n     Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       By the way of emphasizing the need brought about by our \n     increasing caseload and the importance of filling these \n     vacancies, I might note a little historical perspective. In \n     1980, shortly after I came on the court of appeals, we had 23 \n     active judges with a caseload of 3,000 appeals. Today, with 6 \n     of our 28 judgeships vacant, we have 22 active judges to hear \n     over 9,000 appeals. You can see the importance of proceeding \n     promptly with the confirmation process.\n       I might make one other observation--I have noted that the \n     reversal rate of the Supreme Court in one unusual year, 1996-\n     97, has assumed some importance in the hearings. Even in that \n     year, when the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was 95%, it was \n     less than five other circuits--the Fifth, Second, Seventh, \n     D.C., and Federal Circuits--all with a 100% reversal rate. In \n     the 1997-98 term, the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was 76%, \n     equivalent to that of the First Circuit's 75%, and less than \n     the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits' 100% reversal rate. In the \n     1998-99 term, the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was 78%, \n     equivalent to that of the Second and Federal Circuits' 75%, \n     and less than the Fifth Circuit's 80%, the Seventh Circuit's \n     80%, and the Eleventh Circuit's 88% reversal rates.\n       However, the important point to emphasize, in my opinion, \n     is that the reversal rate has little to do with the \n     effectiveness of any circuit court of appeals. For example, \n     the 13, 14, or 20 cases reversed in a term were out of 4,500 \n     cases decided on the merits in the Ninth Circuit. The \n     reversal rate in any circuit should also have little to do \n     with the nomination or confirmation of judges to fill \n     vacancies on a court.\n       Our judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals will \n     certainly appreciate any efforts on your parts to afford the \n     judicial nominees a hearing in the near future and a prompt \n     vote on the floor of the Senate.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                 Procter Hug, Jr.,\n                                                      Chief Judge.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will quickly read the paragraph to \nwhich the ranking member alluded. I believe it is worthwhile for \neverybody to hear this. Judge Hug said:\n\n       I might make one other observation--I have noted that the \n     reversal rate of the Supreme Court in one unusual year, 1996-\n     97, has assumed some importance in the hearings.\n\n  These are the hearings on confirmation.\n\n       Even in that year, when the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate \n     was 95 percent, it was less than five other circuits--the \n     Fifth, Second, Seventh and Federal Circuits--all with a 100 \n     percent reversal rate. In the 1997-98 term, the Ninth \n     Circuit's reversal rate was 76 percent, equivalent to that of \n     the First Circuit's 75 percent and less than the Sixth and \n     Eleventh Circuits' 100 percent reversal rate. In the 1998-99 \n     term, the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was 78 percent, \n     equivalent to the Second and Federal Circuits' 75 percent and \n     less than the Fifth Circuit's 80 percent, the Seventh \n     Circuit's 80 percent, and the Eleventh Circuit's 88 percent \n     reversal rates.\n\n  Once again, the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit attests that the \nNinth Circuit's reversal rate is substantially in the middle of the \npack of all the circuits. I hope the record stands corrected.\n  I want to speak about the two judges before us and indicate my strong \nsupport for the appointment of both Judge Paez and Mrs. Berzon.\n  Judge Paez has been before this body for 4 years. He has had two \nhearings and has been reported out of committee twice. Marsha Berzon \nhas been before this body for 2 years, and she has had two hearings and \nbeen reported out of committee once.\n  I have sat as ranking member on one of her hearings. It was equal in \nthe quality and numbers of questions to any Supreme Court hearing on \nwhich I have sat, and I have sat on two of them. She was asked detailed \nquestions on the law, questions about her performance, questions about \nher background, and, I say to this body, she measured up every step of \nthe way. She is a brilliant appellate lawyer, and she has represented \nboth business clients as well as trade union clients.\n  Judge Paez has 19 years of experience as a judge and 6 years as a \nFederal court judge. I will speak about his record on criminal appeals.\n  According to the Westlaw database, 32 of his criminal judgments have \nbeen appealed; 28 of these were affirmed. The Circuit Court dismissed \ntwo appeals for lack of jurisdiction, remanded one for further \nproceedings, and one judgment was affirmed in part or reversed in part. \nThat is an 87-percent affirmance rate. That is pretty good.\n  Judge Paez has not been reversed on a criminal sentence. Of his 28 \ncriminal affirmances, they include 6 cases where a sentence he imposed \nwas upheld by the appellate court; 4 involved his decision to enhance \nthe defendant's defense level within the guidelines, actually giving \nthe offender a tougher sentence, and 2 involved Judge Paez's refusal to \ngrant a downward departure.\n  Judge Paez was also named Federal criminal judge of the year by the \nCentury City Bar Association.\n  As I have looked at this case and listened to members in the \nJudiciary Committee, a lot of the objection seems to come down to one \nspeech he made at the University of California Boalt Hall where he \ncriticized a proposition on the ballot which was a very incendiary \nballot measure in California. It was Proposition 209, and that may have \nbeen somewhat intemperate.\n  My point is, one comment does not outweigh 19 years of good judicial \nservice, 6 of them on the Federal court. I believe strongly that both \nthese nominees deserve confirmation today.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I want to talk a bit about the matter \nbefore us, the judicial nominations of Paez and Berzon.\n  I have listened to the debate today, and it is fair to say, to a \nlarge degree, the Ninth Circuit Court has made itself the target. The \nsuggestion was made the Ninth Circuit is in the middle of the pack with \nregard to reversals. Thirty-three percent of the reversals over the \nlast 3 years have come out of the Ninth Circuit Court. I have talked to \njudges in that court. They are so frustrated by the caseload and their \ninability to follow the cases in the court that they privately and \npublicly suggest something be done.\n  We have been at this for a long time. We have been discussing it, we \nhave been arguing, we have been debating how we split it up. Naturally, \nCalifornia is a little reluctant to see it split up, for lots of \nreasons which I do not think are necessary to go into.\n  The reality is this body has an obligation of timely justice, and \ntimely justice is not being done in the Ninth Circuit for a couple of \nreasons. It serves the largest population of all the circuits. The \njudges can't handle all the cases. Legal reasoning has been abandoned \nin favor of extremist views. The Ninth Circuit has invited this upon \nitself.\n  The point I make is, we have an obligation on our watch to do \nsomething about this problem. We have to do it. It is inevitable.\n  This week I introduced legislation to split the Ninth Circuit. These \ntwo nominees are perfect examples of why my bill should be passed \nimmediately by this body. Senator Hatch and other are co-sponsoring \nthis bill.\n  The Ninth Circuit is already plagued with a very activist group on \nthe judiciary who bring their causes to the bench with them.\n\n[[Page S1361]]\n\n  But let's look at the number of cases that have been reversed by the \nSupreme Court. This chart shows the number of cases reversed by the \nU.S. Supreme Court between 1997 and 1999. The statement has been made \nthat the Ninth Circuit court is somewhere in the middle. It is more \nthan the middle. The Ninth Circuit has almost a quarter of all the \ncourt reversals in all of our circuit courts. Next is followed by the \nEighth Circuit and then the Fifth Circuit. It is not a factual \nstatement to suggest that the reversals in the Ninth Circuit are \nsomewhere in the middle.\n  We have another chart I will describe to you as the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, a court that is out of control. From 1994 to the year \n2000, the number of decisions reversed, 86 percent; decisions upheld, \n14 percent.\n  If this followed a pattern in the other circuit courts, I would not \nbe up here arguing; but it is far too high. It suggests it is out of \ncontrol. The reality is that 86 percent of the decisions were reversed \nin that period, from 1994 to the year 2000; and 14 percent of the \ndecisions were upheld by the Supreme Court. These are people who were \ndenied justice--at great cost.\n  Let's look at the reason why it is so obvious that we have to do \nsomething about it. It is the caseload. Look at the growth of the \ncaseload. From 1991 through the year 2000, it has gone from 7,500 to \n9,500. It continues to increase. What they will tell you is it is \nincreasing beyond a manageable level. We all know something about \nmanagers and management. Some of us are better managers than others; \nsome are worse than others. But you have some real problems when the \njudges cannot follow the decisions that are coming out of the court. \nThey will be the first ones to acknowledge that.\n  Let me show you a chart referencing the population in relation to the \nother circuit courts because that is very important. The circuit courts \nare depicted on this chart--the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, \nSixth, Seventh, Eighth, currently the Ninth, the Tenth, and Eleventh. I \nwant to move this chart up a little bit. I am not sure the Presiding \nOfficer can see it. This is the story. It is cold, hard facts.\n  Here is the Ninth Circuit shown on the chart. It is almost off the \nchart. The Ninth Circuit will increase 26 percent by the year 2010. It \nis at 50 million now. That is the problem. We have to split it. The \nquestion is, who is going to accept the responsibility? Are we going to \nput it off? The longer we put it off, the less timely justice prevails.\n  We owe this to the residents of the States affected. They ought to \nhave something to say about it. We are saying we want it changed. We do \nnot hear that from California. But the other States say they want a \nchange; they want an equitable change.\n  What have we done? We have reached out and tried to get opinions of \npeople who know something about the problem. Everybody is an expert; \nand everybody can get an expert. But the Supreme Court agrees that \nreform is needed. How much higher do you have to go?\n  Here is what they say:\n\n       The disproportionate segment of this Court's discretionary \n     docket that is consistently devoted to reviewing Ninth \n     Circuit judgments, and reversing them by lop-sided \n     margins, suggests that this error-reduction function is \n     not being performed effectively.\n\n  That means justice is not being done. That is Justice Scalia.\n\n       With respect to the Ninth Circuit in particular, in my view \n     the circuit is simply too large.\n\n  Isn't that what it shows? That is Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor.\n\n       In my opinion the arguments in favor of dividing the \n     Circuit into either two or three smaller circuits \n     overwhelmingly outweigh the single serious objection to such \n     a change.\n\n  These are the Supreme Court Justices who have to make these \nreversals.\n  I have another chart. You can read, at your leisure, what retired \nSupreme Court Chief Justice William Burger said.\n\n       I strongly believe that the 9th Circuit is far too \n     cumbersome and it should be divided.\n\n  Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy:\n\n       I have increasing doubts and increasing reservations about \n     the wisdom of retaining the Ninth Circuit in its historic \n     size, and with its historic jurisdiction. We have very \n     dedicated judges on that circuit, very scholarly judges . . . \n     But I think institutionally, and from the collegial \n     standpoint, that it is too large to have the discipline and \n     control that's necessary for an effective circuit.\n\n  We have a hard enough time controlling discipline here, and there are \nonly 100 of us--plus 100 egos. But I will not go into that.\n\n       We (the Ninth Circuit) cannot grow without limit . . . As \n     the number of opinions increases. . . .\n\n  That is the Honorable Diarmuid O'Scannlain, a Ninth Circuit judge, I \nmight add.\n  Our former colleague, Senator Mark O. Hatfield:\n\n       The increased likelihood of intracircuit conflicts is an \n     important justification for splitting the Court.\n\n  There you have it, one of our own.\n  In my opinion, this matter before us is further evidence of the \nnecessity of splitting the court. The circuit is already plagued with \nactivists on the judiciary who bring their causes to the bench with \nthem. I do not think that is appropriate. One simply has to look at the \nrate of reversals to find the proof. I have gone into that. Now is the \ntime for Congress to stop this unwieldy circuit. I hope we will because \nour inaction is only going to weaken an already detached and out of \ncontrol circuit.\n  Most shocking is that the nominees do little to deflect accusations \nthat they share an activist judicial philosophy. Justice Paez, in his \nown words, stated that he ``appreciate[s] . . . the need of the courts \nto act when they must, when the issue has been generated as a result of \nthe failure of the political process to resolve a certain political \nquestion. . . .''\n  He then continues:\n\n       There's no choice but for the courts to resolve the \n     question that perhaps ideally and preferably should be \n     resolved through the legislative process.\n\n  I think that statement deserves a great deal of thought and \nconsideration because he is implying that if we don't take care of it \nthrough the political process, this judge is going to simply take \naction into his own hands. I am not ready for that. That, to me, is a \nflag.\n  One does not have to be a legal scholar to see that this is a blatant \ninfringement upon the Constitution, the Constitution we rely upon to \nprotect ourselves from improper Government actions. Article I, as I \nknow the Chair is familiar, clearly states that ``[a]ll legislative \npowers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United \nStates.'' Should this body abdicate its role and confirm nominees who \nopenly defy the Constitution? I hope we will all answer with a \nresounding ``no.''\n  Unfortunately, Judge Paez's background goes far beyond activist \njudicial decisions. I think we should all pause and reflect upon a \nnomination for which the director of the ACLU in Southern California \nstates:\n\n       It's been a while since we had these kinds of appointments \n     to the federal court. I think it's a welcome change after all \n     the pro-law enforcement people we have seen appointed to the \n     state and federal courts.\n\n  That sends another message to me. I am not sure this judge is going \nto have the balance necessary to protect our law enforcement people. \nThey need a lot of protection. They are hit by the press. They are hit \nby mistakes. They are hit by the exposure they have out there, \nprotecting our property and protecting us. We owe more to the men and \nwomen who risk their lives each and every day to maintain law and \norder. We owe more to Americans who see crime around every corner. \nThere is a lot of it, and a lot of them see it.\n  Time and time again, Judge Paez has demonstrated a lack of proper \njudicial temperament. We should be able to agree that judges should be \nimpartial and not speak out on matters that may appear before their \ncourt. I think we do agree on that. Yet Paez, during the California \nProposition 209 ballot initiative debate which would have ended racial \nquotas and discrimination by the State government, labeled the proposal \n``anti-civil rights'' and said it would ``inflame the issue all over \nagain without contributing to any serious discussion.''\n  I am realist enough to recognize that people in California and their \nelected representation have a better understanding of this than I do. \nIt sounds a little strange and uncomfortable to me.\n  A judge is expected to remain impartial. Certainly, they should not \ncomment upon efforts by the citizens of California, in their wisdom, to \npass a\n\n[[Page S1362]]\n\nlegal and constitutional ballot initiative. Judicial Cannon 4(A)(1) \nalone requires that a judge do nothing ``to cast reasonable doubt on \nthe judge's capacity to act impartially as a judge.'' This is not a \nperson who should be deciding cases that affect 50 million people in \nour circuit court.\n  Here, again, is the chart that shows the proof of why this court is \nout of control.\n  I also find it ironic that supporters of Marsha Berzon are the very \npeople who claim to be advocates of campaign finance ``reform.'' It is \ninteresting because there are some political overtones there. There \nprobably are going to be some more. While quick to target political \nspeech by national parties, they seem to have turned a blind eye to \ntrue injustice in our campaign finance system. I am referring to the \nforced speech that large and radical unions placed upon their willing \nmembers. Many of the union members acknowledge that privately; they are \na little hesitant to do it publicly.\n  The majority has worked hard to open the workforce to all Americans \nand to remove automatic payroll contributions to unions for political \nads of which members disapprove. Shouldn't those members have a right? \nI think so.\n\n  Now the Clinton administration has sent us a judicial nominee who has \nbeen labeled by the National Right to Work Committee as the ``worst'' \nClinton appointee in terms of labor issues. I wonder how objective that \nperson is.\n  While representing the Nation's most powerful unions, Ms. Berzon \nstated that mandatory union dues ``implicates first amendment values \nonly to a very limited degree.'' I wonder how limited that is. \nThankfully, the Supreme Court struck down this logic in Communication \nWorkers of America v. Beck.\n  Look at the Ninth Circuit's already startling reversal rate by the \nSupreme Court. In 1997, it was 95 percent. One can imagine an even more \ndetached judiciary with the addition of Ms. Berzon. This period this \nchart shows is for the years 1994 through 2000: 86 percent of the \ndecisions reversed, only 14 upheld. That is a reflection on the court, \nand it is a reflection on us for not doing something about it.\n  Mr. Paez is no stranger to the reform debate. During a time when we \nexpect firm and fair enforcement of our Nation's financing laws, Judge \nPaez gave one individual an unusually light sentence after he admitted \nto accepting more than $250,000 in illegal campaign contributions. This \nis the largest acknowledged receipt of illegal contributions in \ncongressional history, except for POGO maybe. We have 300-some-odd \nthousand in reward money out there that we have to investigate. There \nare going to be some heads rolling once that is made public and the \npublic and this body understands how that system of whistleblowers \nworks. What was the sentence? The sentence was 1 year on probation and \n200 hours of community service. This is for $250,000 illegal campaign \ncontributions. This is the real problem in campaign financing.\n  I could go on for a long time. I see the Senator from Maryland \nwaiting to be recognized. I could continue listing the seemingly \ncountless reasons why these two nominees should be rejected by this \nSenate. But, I find that unnecessary. There really is only one reason. \nBecause the people of the Ninth Circuit deserve better. They deserve \nbetter.\n  They deserve a justice system that reflects the temperament of the \nsociety. They deserve a judiciary that creates dependable case law by \nfollowing judicial precedent. They deserve a judiciary that provides \nswift yet fair justice.\n  Most importantly, they deserve a judiciary that follows the \nConstitution and the rule of law and objectivity. For these reasons, I \nurge my colleagues to reject the two nominations before us prior to the \nvote this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes as in morning business, ensuring that it doesn't take time from \neither side on this debate. This has been cleared with the leadership \non the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Mikulski pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2229 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank my colleague from Alaska for his \ncomments in support of the opposition to these two nominees.\n  I yield myself 5 minutes to summarize.\n  We have a circuit court, the Ninth Circuit, widely considered by most \nobjective observers a renegade circuit that is out of the mainstream of \nAmerican jurisprudence, a circuit court that has had decisions \noverturned by the Supreme Court nearly 90 percent of the time in the \npast 6 years. That is a very high percentage of the number of cases \nthey have. It is the largest circuit in the country. It includes the 7-\n7 overturn rate in 1999-2000 and 27-28 reversal rate in 1996-1997. In \nfact, 17 of the decisions in 1996-1997 out of the 27 were overturned \nunanimously, which means both the liberal and the conservative Justices \non the Supreme Court agree that these decisions were so outrageous, \nthey had to be overturned.\n  It is a court that routinely issues activist opinions, opinions that \nconflict with the basic American constitutional and legal principles. \nWe have had a great debate on some of the outrageous decisions that \nhave come down.\n  As I have said, these two new nominees will, if approved, add to that \ncourt in a way that is going to continue to have cases overturned. \nThese two judges, Ms. Berzon as well as Mr. Paez, have both indicated \nby their own track records they will be making similar decisions. I \nthink this is most disturbing.\n  In the case of Marsha Berzon, we are talking about a potential \njudicial activist on labor issues. As I said before, it doesn't matter \nwhat the issues are, what one believes in personally. The job as a \njudge is to interpret the Constitution in a way that does not put \npersonal views on the court but, rather, enforces the Constitution.\n\n  Ms. Berzon has described her practice: From the outset of my law \npractice, an important client has been the AFL-CIO. Since 1975, I have \ndevoted a substantial part of my practice to aiding labor organizations \naffiliated with the AFL-CIO at the Supreme Court and other appellate \nlitigation.\n  There is nothing wrong with that on the surface. She certainly has a \nright to represent anyone she chooses to represent if she is asked to \ndo it in a court of law.\n  The question is, Why talk about that when she knows that cases \ninvolving labor could come before her? Imagine what would happen on \nthis floor. We have heard a lot of people outraged by what we have \ndone, getting a good, thorough debate on the two nominees.\n  Imagine if we had a nominee before the Senate, the outcry from the \nother side of the aisle if we had a guy or gal come before the Senate, \na nominee of any President--say of President Bush in the future--and \nthis person said, ``I have since 1975 devoted a substantial part of my \npractice to fighting gun control and have been affiliated with the \nNational Rifle Association and gun owners of America in many cases \nbefore the courts of America.''\n  Imagine what we would hear on the other side. They have a right to \nair that if they wish. I think it would be justified if a person were \nto say he was going to promote the interests of any particular group or \nindustry.\n  It is not new to raise the debate on issues about a particular \nnominee. I get tired of hearing talk that we are wrong to raise these \nissues because these judges happen to be liberals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is not a question of liberal or \nconservative. As I recall, when the Democrats were in control of the \nSenate during 6 years overlapping the Reagan and Bush Presidencies, we \nvoted to confirm about 99 percent of the nominations of President \nReagan and President Bush.\n  Justice Scalia is considered one of the most conservative Members of \nthe Supreme Court. As I recall, he got a unanimous vote from the \nRepublicans and Democrats in the Senate Judiciary Committee. I believe \nhe had a unanimous vote on the floor of the Senate.\n  Let's not use this shibboleth. We have also had a number of judicial \nnominees who said they were members of the National Rifle Association \nand a number who have said they have defended conservative \norganizations. I\n\n[[Page S1363]]\n\nnever remember a single one having difficulty being confirmed. Let's \nnot use that.\n  If we want to assume for the sake of argument that the Ninth Circuit \nis dominated by liberal activist judges, these critics urge the Senate \nto reject the confirmation of new judges. They are not letting two \nbasically moderate judges come, thereby adding to the mix. It does not \nmake a great deal of sense to me that they want to keep the court \nexactly the way it is.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nJudge Procter Hug that points out there are a number of circuits that \nhave far higher reversal rates than the Ninth Circuit.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              United States Courts\n\n\n                                        for the Ninth Circuit,\n\n                                          Reno, NV, March 2, 2000.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Russell Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Hatch and Leahy: I write on behalf of the \n     Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to emphasize the importance of \n     filling the judicial vacancies on this court.\n       During the four years that I have been Chief Judge of the \n     Ninth Circuit, we have had up to ten vacancies on the court \n     of appeals. We now have six vacancies, two have been vacant \n     since 1996, two since 1997, one since 1998, and one since \n     1999. It has been very difficult to operate a court of \n     appeals with up to one-third of our active judges missing. As \n     you know, I have worked with the White House and the Senate \n     in an attempt to fill these vacancies in a timely manner, and \n     I am continuing to do so.\n       As Chief Judge, I have implored our active judges and our \n     senior judges, on an emergency basis, to carry a larger \n     caseload during this interim while the vacancies are being \n     filled, in order to do our best to avoid building up a \n     backlog of cases with the consequent delay for the litigants.\n       Our judges have been most responsive in hearing \n     considerably more cases than would ordinarily be assigned. I \n     am very grateful, but I cannot expect the judges to do this, \n     on an emergency basis, for the indefinite future.\n       In addition, we have called upon the district judges within \n     our circuit to serve on panels, as well as visiting judges \n     from other circuits. However, this is not the ideal way to \n     perform the services of a court of appeals. The appeals from \n     the Ninth Circuit should be heard by the judges of the Ninth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Despite all of these efforts, we do have a backlog of \n     cases, which principally affect civil cases, some of which \n     have had to wait a year or more to be heard. My major concern \n     is that we have had a significant increase in filings this \n     past year, which considerably exceed the number of cases we \n     are able to terminate even with this enhanced effort. In the \n     year ending December 31, 1999, the number of appeals filed \n     was 9,444, and the number of appeals terminated was 8,047. \n     This is a difference of over 1,000 cases.\n       If our six vacancies were filled and those judges were on \n     our court, it would mean we could decide an additional 800 \n     cases on the merits. If they are not filled, I can anticipate \n     considerable delay for the litigants of this circuit.\n       Our court is very pleased that the leadership of the Senate \n     has committed to hold a floor vote this month on nominees \n     Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon. We have every hope that \n     they will be confirmed. We would ask, however, that the other \n     nominees, Barry P. Goode, James F. Duffy, Jr., Richard C. \n     Tallman, and Johnnie B. Rawlinson receive hearings before the \n     Judiciary Committee in the near future. It is vital to our \n     Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       By the way of emphasizing the need brought about by our \n     increasing caseload and the importance of filling these \n     vacancies, I might note a little historical perspective. In \n     1980, shortly after I came on the court of appeals, we had 23 \n     active judges with a caseload of 3,000 appeals. Today, with 6 \n     of our 28 judgeships vacant, we have 22 active judges to hear \n     over 9,000 appeals. You can see the importance of \n     proceeding promptly with the confirmation process.\n       I might make one other observation--I have noted that the \n     reversal rate of the Supreme Court in one unusual year, 1996-\n     97, has assumed some importance in the hearings. Even in that \n     year, when the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was 95%, it was \n     less than five other circuits--the Fifth, Second, Seventh, \n     D.C., and Federal Circuits--all with a 100% reversal rate. In \n     the 1997-98 term, the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was 76%, \n     equivalent to that of the First Circuit's 75%, and less than \n     the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits' 100% reversal rate. In the \n     1998-99 term, the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was 78%, \n     equivalent to that of the Second and Federal Circuits' 75%, \n     and less than the Fifth Circuit's 80%, the Seventh Circuit's \n     80%, and the Eleventh Circuit's 88% reversal rates.\n       However, the important point to emphasize, in my opinion, \n     is that the reversal rate has little to do with the \n     effectiveness of any circuit court of appeals. For example, \n     the 13, 14, or 20 cases reversed in a term were out of 4,500 \n     cases decided on the merits in the Ninth Circuit. The \n     reversal rate in any circuit should also have little to do \n     with the nomination or confirmation of judges to fill \n     vacancies on a court.\n       Our judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals will \n     certainly appreciate any efforts on your parts to afford the \n     judicial nominees a hearing in the near future and a prompt \n     vote on the floor of the Senate.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                 Procter Hug, Jr.,\n                                                      Chief Judge.\n\n                       REVERSAL RATE 1996-97 TERM\n                             Revised 7/07/97\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Percent\n                                           Total      Number    reversed\n                                           cases     reversed     for\n                                                                circuits\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal..................................         80         57         76\n                                        ================================\nOrg....................................          1          0          0\n1st....................................          1          1        100\n2d.....................................          6          6        100\n3d.....................................          3          2         67\n4th....................................          2          1         50\n5th....................................          5          4         80\n6th....................................          3          2         67\n7th....................................          3          3        100\n8th....................................          8          5         63\n9th....................................         21         20         95\n10th...................................          2          1         50\n11th...................................          6          1         17\nD.C.

Mr. President, four out of seven recent reversals were \ndecisions written by either a Reagan or Bush appointee from the Ninth \nCircuit. Somehow it wasn't brought out on the other side.\n  As far as showing fairness, even for Clarence Thomas, who had a tie \nvote, with Republicans and Democrats voting against him in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, the Democrats, being in charge of the Senate, \nstill allowed him to come forward for a vote even though normally that \nwould have killed it.\n  The circuits should not all be the same. Different circuits have \ndifferent attitudes. They come from different parts of the country. If \nthey were to be all the same, we might as well just have one big \ncircuit for the whole country. The Second Circuit is different from the \nThird Circuit. The Third is different from the Fifth, and so on.\n  I remind my friends on the other side, if we are going to have a \nlitmus test for a circuit, let us understand what this means when \napplied to the Fourth Circuit. That is the most conservative and \nactivist in the country. Ironically enough, we forget the fact the very \nconservative circuit can be a very activist circuit. Nobody would deny \nit is one of the most activist circuits in the country, rewriting \nlegislation willy-nilly.\n\n[[Page S1364]]\n\n  If the argument is accepted from the other side, then no nominee \nother than one with a more liberal judicial philosophy should be \nconfirmed in the foreseeable future to the Fourth Circuit. I am not \ntrying to make that argument. But if you follow their argument, that is \nthe case.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Majority Leader for bringing this matter \nto a vote. After two years, it is time to vote on the nomination of \nMarsha Berzon. She is one of the most qualified nominees I have seen in \n25 years, and Senator Hatch has agreed with that assessment publically. \nHe voted for her in the Judiciary Committee.\n  Marsha Berzon is an outstanding nominee. Her legal skills are \noutstanding, her practice and productivity have been extraordinary. \nLawyers against whom she has litigated regard her as highly qualified \nfor the bench. She was first nominated in January 1998, some 26 months \nago. By all accounts, she is an exceptional lawyer with extensive \nappellate experience, including a number of cases heard by the Supreme \nCourt. She has the strong support of both California Senators and a \nwell-qualified rating from the American Bar Association.\n  She was initially nominated in January 1998. She participated in an \nextensive two-part confirmation hearing before the Committee back on \nJuly 30, 1998. Thereafter she received a number of sets of written \nquestions from a number of Senators and responded in August, two years \nago. A second round of written questions was sent and she responded by \nthe middle of September, two years ago. Despite the efforts of Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Kennedy, Senator Specter and myself to have her \nconsidered by the Committee, she was not included on an agenda and not \nvoted on during all of 1998. Her nomination was returned to the \nPresident without action by the Committee or the Senate in October \n1998.\n  The President renominated Ms. Berzon in January 1999. She \nparticipated in her second confirmation hearing in June, was sent \nadditional sets of written questions, responded and got and answered \nanother round. I do not know why those questions were not asked in \n1998.\n  Finally, on July 1, 1999, almost eight months ago, the Committee \nconsidered the nomination and agreed to report it to the Senate \nfavorably. After more than two years the Senate will, at long last, \nvote on the nomination. Senators who find some reason to oppose this \nexceptionally qualified woman lawyer can vote against her if they \nchoose, but she will finally be accorded an up or down vote. That is \nwhat I have been asking for and that is what fairness demands.\n  Senator Hatch was right two years ago when he called for an end to \nthe political game that has infected the confirmation process. These \nare real people whose lives are affected. Marsha Berzon has been held \nhostage for 26 months, not knowing what to make of her private practice \nor when the Senate will deem it appropriate finally to vote on her \nnomination.\n\n  Last fall I received a Resolution from the National Association of \nWomen Judges. The NAWJ urged expeditious action on nominations to \nfederal judicial vacancies. The President of the Women Judges, Judge \nMary Schroeder, is right when she cautions that ``few first-rate \npotential nominees will be willing to endure such a tortured process'' \nand the country will pay a high price for driving away outstanding \ncandidates to fill these important positions. The Resolution notes the \nscores of continuing vacancies with highly qualified women and men \nnominees and the nonpartisan study of delays in the confirmation \nprocess, and even more extensive delays for women nominees, found by \nthe Task Force on Judicial Selection formed by Citizens for Independent \nCourts. The Resolution notes that such delay ``is costly and unfair to \nlitigants and the individual nominees and their families whose lives \nand career are on hold for the duration of the protracted process.'' In \nconclusion, the National Association of Women Judges ``urges the Senate \nof the United States to bring the pending nominations for the federal \njudiciary to an expeditious vote so that those who have been nominated \ncan get on with their lives and these vacancies can be filled.'' We \nreceived that Resolution in October 1999 and I included it in the \nRecord at that time--October 1999.\n  There are judicial emergencies vacancies all over the country. The \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals has had to declare that entire Circuit \nin an emergency. Its workload has gone up 65 percent in the last 9 \nyears; but they are being forced to operate with almost one-quarter of \ntheir bench vacant despite highly qualified nominees having been sent \nto the Senate by the President.\n  Continuing dilatory practices demeans the Senate, itself. I have \ngreat respect for this institution and its traditions. Still, I must \nsay that the use of secret holds for extended periods that doom a \nnomination from ever being considered by the United States Senate is \nwrong and unfair and beneath us. After four years with respect to Judge \nPaez and two years with respect to Marsha Berzon, it is time for the \nSenate to vote up-or-down on these nominations. I, again, ask the \nSenate to be fair to these judicial nominees and all nominees. For the \nlast few years the Senate has allowed one or two or three secret holds \nto stop judicial nominations from even getting a vote. That is wrong.\n  The Washington Post noted last year:\n\n       [T]he Constitution does not make the Senate's role in the \n     confirmation process optional, and the Senate ends up \n     abdicating responsibility when the majority leader denies \n     nominees a timely vote. All the nominees awaiting floor votes \n     * * * should receive them immediately.\n\n  The Florida Sun-Sentinel has written:\n\n       The ``Big Stall'' in the U.S. Senate continues, as senators \n     work slower and slower each year in confirming badly needed \n     federal judges. * * * This worsening process is inexcusable, \n     bordering on malfeasance in office, especially given the \n     urgent need to fill vacancies on a badly undermanned federal \n     bench. * * * The stalling, in many cases, is nothing more \n     than a partisan political dirty trick.\n\n  Nominees deserve to be treated with dignity and dispatch--not delayed \nfor two or three or four years.\n\n  Acting to fill judicial vacancies is a constitutional duty that the \nSenate--and all of its members--are obligated to fulfill. In its \nunprecedented slowdown in the handling of nominees since the 104th \nCongress, the Senate is shirking its duty. That is wrong and should \nend.\n  Today the New York Times included an editorial entitled ``Ending a \nJudicial Blockade'' in which it notes: ``The quality of justice suffers \nwhen the Senate misconstrues its constitutional role to advise and \nconsent as a license to wage ideological warfare and procrastinate in \nhopes that a new president might submit other nominees.''\n  In 1992, a Democratic majority in the Senate acted to confirm 66 \njudicial nominations for a Republican President in his last year in \noffice. With the confirmations of Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon to the \nNinth Circuit today, this Senate will have confirmed only seven \njudicial nominations so far this year. I look forward, at long last, to \nthe confirmation of Marsha Berzon and ask other Senators to join with \nme to work to confirm many, many more qualified nominees to the federal \nvacancies around the country in the weeks ahead this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, several comments have been \nmade today, I think correctly so. I do not think the information was \nout. But it is interesting we now have a capital sentencing case, \nArreguin v. Prunty, in which Judge Paez was reversed, as of yesterday. \nSeveral people had said no criminal case of his had been reversed. \nThose statements were correct. That has changed now since March 9. So \nhere we have this judge being reversed, this judge we are now talking \nabout putting on the circuit court.\n  In this case, the defendant was an accomplice to robbery and murder \nand he actively encouraged the murder of an innocent civilian.\n  Under California law, an accomplice can only be sentenced to life \nwithout parole or death if he was a ``major participant'' in the \ncapital crime.\n  In Arreguin, an impartial jury unanimously convicted the defendant as \nan accomplice to robbery and murder.\n  The State trial judge instructed the jury on what a ``major \nparticipant'' was. The jury sentenced the defendant to life without \nparole.\n\n[[Page S1365]]\n\n  The California appellate courts recognized that the State trial judge \nmade a technical error in giving the ``major participant'' instruction, \nbut held that the record clearly showed that the defendant was in fact \na ``major participant'' in the robbery-murder and affirmed the sentence \nunder the harmless error rule.\n  On habeas review, however, Judge Paez held that the Constitution \nsomehow created a liberty interest in receiving a perfect jury \ninstruction--even if he was clearly a major participant in the robbery-\nmurder.\n  This is a classic example of the continued liberal activist \ninterpretation of the Constitution by Judge Paez.\n  Yestreday, March 8, 2000, a unanimous panel of the Ninth Circuit \nreversed Judge Paez and reinstated the sentence of the defendant to \nlife without parole.\n  The Ninth Circuit agreed with and quoted the California appellate \ncourt, stating:\n\n       . . . under any reasonable interpretation of the evidence, \n     [Arreguin] was a major participant and the error was harmless \n     beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n  The [California] court further stated:\n\n       Standing within arms's reach of an armed accomplice \n     exhorting, ``Shoot 'im, shoot 'im'' about the victim, \n     immediately after another accomplice forcibly broke the truck \n     window, warrants no other reasonable conclusion than that \n     appellant was a major participant. Appellant's testimony that \n     he did not participate at all was necessarily rejected by the \n     jury in its verdict. This harmless error analysis is \n     sufficient. . . . Therefore, we reverse the grant of the \n     writ.\n\n  Once again, this shows a continuing liberal, activist interpretation \nof the Constitution that even the Ninth Circuit could not agree with. \nJudge Paez will not move the Ninth Circuit into the mainstream, he will \nmake the problem. Accordingly, I will vote against this nominee.\n  Judge Paez will not move the Ninth Circuit into the mainstream; he is \ngoing to make it the problem.\n  That is one of the major reasons why I am not going to vote for Judge \nPaez, and in my view, respectfully, I do not think others should \neither.\n  I also want to mention the Senate has received over 10,000 signatures \non petitions opposing the Berzon nomination because of her extreme \nposition on labor matters. Here are the 10,000 signatures. That is a \nlot of signatures. That is a lot of time people take to oppose a judge, \nand not even a Supreme Court Justice but an appellate court judge or \ncircuit court judge.\n  There is a lot of opposition out there. Also, I might add, there is a \nlot of knowledge about these nominees.\n  They should be rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent time be charged \nequally to both sides, in the quorum.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not, I think it \nis probably a moot point right now. I see the distinguished Democratic \nleader on the floor going to seek recognition.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I just wanted to protect the time I had. \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time so as not to \ntake time of either side.\n  I want to add my voice especially to those of the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Vermont and the Senator from California, who have \nspoken so eloquently on this matter for what seems to be several days. \nI want to make three points.\n  I think the most disconcerting aspect of this debate, for those who \nmay be watching, is the concern that I would have, having heard many of \nour colleagues express their virtual desire to influence the Ninth \nCircuit and the decisions made there. Our Founding Fathers did an \nextraordinary job of creating the checks and balances in our \nconstitutional system. As I travel around the world and talk to leaders \nfrom other parts of the world, who have not enjoyed that delicate \nbalance between the judiciary, the executive, and legislative branches, \nthe lament I hear all around the world is: We don't have an independent \njudiciary. We have a politicized judiciary. Because it is politicized, \nwe don't have the rule of law. Because we don't have the rule of law, \nwe don't have the predictability in law that creates the extraordinary \nstability that you have in your country.\n  These leaders tell me: We want the rule of law, and we recognize that \nif we are ever going to acquire it, what we have to do is to \ndepoliticize our judiciary, and we have to ensure that we do what you \nhave done--respect its independence.\n  There is a huge difference between voting against somebody's \nphilosophy or experience or qualifications based upon past judgments in \na particular trial--and Senators have every right to do so on the basis \nof whatever qualifications they may choose. All of those criteria, it \nseems to me, are fair game. But if we are saying we ought to vote \nagainst someone, or for someone, because we want to influence the \ndirection of a certain circuit, I think we get precariously close to \ncreating the kind of politicization of the judiciary that, to me, is \nfrightening. We need to be very, very careful. For 200 years, we have \nbeen able to maintain that independence and discipline it takes to \nensure the rule of law will always prevail.\n  I hope as we cast our votes, people will cast them based upon whether \nthey think Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon are capable--whether they have \nthe right qualifications. And, frankly, if they want to throw in \nphilosophy, so be it. But let us not say this ought to be some judgment \non the Ninth Circuit. Let us not say that somehow we want to send a \nmessage to the Ninth Circuit or any circuit, for that matter. That is \nnot our role. That is not our responsibility. In the Constitution, the \nFounding Fathers had no design, no possible thought that we as Senators \nought to be influencing in any way decisions made by the court, an \nindependent and coequal branch of government.\n  That is my first point.\n  My second point is that I believe there is a time and a place for us \nto consider any nominee and, once having done so, we need to get on \nwith it. I cannot imagine that anybody could justify, anybody could \nrationalize, anybody could explain why, in the name of public service, \nwe would put anyone through the misery and the extraordinary anguish \nthat these two nominees have had to face for years. Why would anyone \never offer themselves for public service if they knew what they had to \ngo through was what these two people have had to experience and endure?\n  I do not know who is going to be President next. I do not know who is \ngoing to be in the majority in the next Congress. But let's just assume \nthat the roles are reversed and we, the Democrats, are in the majority \nand we have a Republican President--which I do not think is going to \nhappen. If that happens, do we really want to wait 4 years to take up a \nRepublican nominee? Do we want to pay back our colleagues for having \nmade these people wait as long as they have? I know that I have heard \nfrom people over the last several months: that we should do to them \nwhat they have done to us.\n  But, I do not want to hear about that in this body. There is going to \nbe no payback. We are not going to do to Republican nominees, whenever \nthat happens, what they have done to Democratic nominees. Why? Because \nit is not right.\n  Will we differ? Absolutely. Will we have votes and vote against \nnominees on the basis of whatever we choose? Absolutely. But are we \ngoing to make them wait for years and years to get their fair \nopportunity to be voted on and considered? Absolutely not. That is not \nright. I do not care who is in charge. I do not care which President is \nmaking the nomination. That is not right.\n  I hope somehow the nominations that are still pending will not be \nsubjected to the same extraordinary, unfair process to which these \nnominees were subjected. We have 34 nominees pending. There is no \nreason why every single one of them cannot be confirmed or at least \nconsidered in the next few months.\n\n[[Page S1366]]\n\n  The last point I will make is one I have made a couple of times \nbefore, but it bears repeating. This has been a very difficult process \nfor a lot of people, and there are a lot of people who deserve some \ncredit. I have already cited the extraordinary contribution of the \nsenior Senator from Vermont, our ranking Judiciary Committee member. I \nhave already noted the efforts made by the California delegation, \nespecially Senator Boxer. Senator Hatch is here. I note his cooperation \nand the effort he has made in getting us to this point.\n\n  I thank the majority leader. He and I have talked about this on \nseveral occasions, and it is never easy when you have dissent within \nyour own caucus to make decisions. He made a commitment last year, and \nhe held to that commitment this year. He said we would have these \nvotes, up or down, on the confirmation of these two judicial nominees \nbefore the 15th of March, and we are going to do that. I publicly thank \nhim and commend him for holding to that commitment. It is not easy. He \nhas done a difficult thing, but he has done it.\n  I hope today we can celebrate not only the confirmation of two \njudges, but renewed comity between our parties when it comes to all \nnominees--regardless of party, regardless of administration, and \nregardless of who controls the Senate. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, since we need a \nlittle more time and I need to make some remarks on this, that the \nremaining time be 3 minutes for the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Smith; 3 minutes for the distinguished Senator from \nVermont, Mr. Leahy; and 8 minutes for myself.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, as \nI understand, normally I would have had 14 minutes. This will \naccommodate the distinguished Senator from Utah and the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire. Do I understand that following that time, \nwe then will have the vote? Is that part of the Senator's request?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is part of my unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, perhaps I can start first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I was listening in the past hour to the \neloquent statement of Senator Murkowski explaining why the Ninth \nCircuit ought to be split. His statement comes 2 days after Senator \nMurkowski and I introduced legislation that would split that circuit \ninto two more manageable circuits.\n  It strikes me that this subject is precisely the one that this body \nought to be debating today as the real solution to the stated concerns \nabout the Ninth Circuit.\n  As I explained recently on the Senate floor, the massive size of the \ncircuit's boundaries has confronted the circuit's judges with a real \ndifficulty in maintaining the coherence of its circuit law.\n  I will not let my concerns regarding the Ninth Circuit--many of which \nappear to me to be structural in dimension--affect my judgment on the \nconfirmation of Judge Paez, who is an innocent party with regard to \nthat circuit's dubious record. Doing so would force him into the role \nof Atlas in carrying problems not of his own making.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of federal \ndistrict Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I have to say, I have served a number of years in the Senate, and I \nhave never seen a ``motion to postpone indefinitely'' that was brought \nto delay the consideration of a judicial nomination post-cloture.\n  Indeed, I must confess to being somewhat baffled that, after a \nfilibuster is cut off by cloture, the Senate could still delay a final \nvote on a nomination. A parliamentary ruling to this effect means that, \nafter today, our cloture rule is further weakened.\n  But on occasion, like Justice Holmes' statement about the law, the \nlife of the Senate is not logic but experience. And I have no interest \nin quibbling further with this ruling.\n  As I turn to the merits of the situation before us, I want to begin \nby commending the efforts of my colleague from Alabama for his legal \nacumen and tenacity in presenting his case why a further postponement \nin considering Judge Paez's nomination would be warranted. I am proud \nto have worked with Senator Sessions on legislation involving civil \nasset forfeiture, and involving youth violence, and a whole raft of \nother issues, as well. Senator Sessions' prosecutorial talents have not \nleft him, and my respect for him as a principled advocate has never \nbeen greater than today.\n  The same goes for Senator Smith.\n  Still, I must take exception to the point that he has so forcefully \nadvocated. I must explain why the time has finally come for an up-or-\ndown vote to be cast on Judge Paez's nomination.\n  Senator Sessions' request for a postponement is grounded in Judge \nPaez's handling of the Government's case against John Huang.\n  Let us begin with the determinative fact: Though Mr. Huang may have \nbeen involved in illegalities in connection with the Clinton-Gore \nreelection campaign of 1996, he was not charged with a single such \ncount.\n  The Assistant United States Attorney who was asked why no such \ncharges were brought responded by saying that: ``we investigated all \nthe allegations and felt that the charges in this case fully addressed \nhis culpability.''\n  Ultimately, Mr. Huang pleaded guilty to a single felony charge of \nconspiring to violate Federal election law. In that plea, he admitted \nto laundering a $2,500 contribution to an unsuccessful contestant in \nLos Angeles' 1993 mayoral campaign, and $5,000 to an entity called the \nCalifornia Victory Fund '94, the funds of which were shared by a \nDemocrat candidate, the Democratic Party, and two Democrat committees.\n  Prosecutors--in exchange for Mr. Huang's guilty plea to this single \ncharge--recommended that Mr. Huang receive no jail time, but instead be \nordered to pay a $10,000 fine and provide 500 hours of community \nservice.\n  Judge Paez accepted the prosecutor's recommendation, which was \nconsistent, by the way, with the report of the probation office.\n  So with this factual premise, I would like to address Senator \nSessions' argument that Mr. Huang's sentence--which he concedes was the \none recommended by the prosecution--was insufficiently harsh.\n  From that premise, there are only a few possibilities:\n  First, that Judge Paez should have ignored the Federal prosecutors \nand handed down a stiffer penalty than the one they recommended. But \nlet's consider this. From a man like Senator Sessions who believes--as \nI do--in judicial restraint, it is anomalous to suggest that judges \nshould depart from the adversarial system and impose their own view of \nan appropriate punishment.\n  A second alternative is that the prosecution should have recommended \na stronger punishment, and that Judge Paez ought to have accepted it. \nThat may indeed be correct. I am on record as expressing similar \nconcern about the level of punishment sought. I am very upset about \nwhat the prosecutors did in this matter.\n  But the problem with this hypothesis is that it is just that --a \nhypothesis. The prosecution did not recommend a stronger sentence. And \nwe should not castigate Judge Paez for the acts of another--in this \ncase, the prosecution--by holding him accountable for the prosecution's \nfailure to make a stronger case against John Huang.\n  In any event, neither of these scenarios is one in which Judge Paez \ncan fairly be faulted for not acting more aggressively.\n\n  Of course, there is nothing to suggest any sort of impropriety \npursuant to which Judge Paez acted in sync with prosecutors to ensure a \nlenient handling of a case so sensitive to the Clinton administration. \nNor is there any evidence at all to suggest that a departure was made \nin this case from the automated, random case-assignment system utilized \nin the Federal court for the Central District of California.\n  Yes, I believe some inside and outside this administration have \nengaged in fraud upon fraud against the laws, ethical norms, and the \npeople of this country.\n  But I cannot accept, in the absence of any supporting evidence, that \ntwo\n\n[[Page S1367]]\n\nbranches of Government engaged in a conspiracy to alleviate a defendant \nof responsibility for violations of Federal law.\n  This speculative theory should not become the basis for any further \ndelay by the United States Senate. There is no reasonable basis--let \nalone any hint of evidence--to suggest that further delay would amount \nto anything other than further delay.\n  Of course, I can understand and appreciate fully why it is that some \nof my colleagues remain so dubious about the results of the Huang \nprosecution. It is because that prosecution was born out of an \negregious conflict of interest with the President's own prosecutors--\nsubject always to his own oversight and control--being asked to \ninvestigate a matter that, if ultimately prosecuted in an appropriately \nzealous fashion, could have led to enormous embarrassment to the \nPresident.\n  The result is that the prosecution's decision not to prosecute any of \nthe wrongdoing alleged in connection with the President's reelection \ncampaign can be objectively viewed as a cover-up, and as favoritism to \nthe President. No less a person than Senator Sessions, among many \nothers in this body, retain such doubts. And if they have doubts, it is \nto be expected that the American people have doubts, thereby \nundermining the public's faith in the rule of law in this country.\n  This is precisely why I called so insistently upon our Attorney \nGeneral to appoint an independent prosecutor to investigate all alleged \nillegalities involving our Federal campaign laws in connection with the \n1996 Clinton-Gore campaign.\n  The Judiciary Committee, under my direction, was the first to \nformally request the appointment of an independent counsel to \ninvestigate alleged illegalities in connection with the President's \n1996 reelection campaign. And the Judiciary Committee has formed a \nformal task force, led by Senator Specter, to inquire into the \nDepartment of Justice's handling of this and other campaign finance \ninvestigations.\n  But for purposes of our vote today, the determinative point is that \nour concerns about the manner in which our Federal campaign finance \nlaws have been flouted do not at all implicate Judge Paez.\n  So we must now proceed to put this matter to a vote, and end the \nlengthy delay in this matter by choosing--on the basis of the abundant \nevidence known to us at this time--whether it shall be yea or nay on \nJudge Paez' nomination. No further information or delay is needed to \ncast an intelligent and knowing vote on this nomination.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for allowing me to make this \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know we are about to finish this debate. \nI do want to compliment the two Senators from California for bringing \nbefore us two fine judicial nominees: Judge Paez and, I hope soon to \nbe, Judge Marsha Berzon.\n  I compliment the distinguished Democratic leader for what he said on \nthe floor--a true leadership statement. I compliment my friend from \nUtah, Senator Hatch, who says we should go forward and defeat this \nmotion to, in effect, kill, by parliamentary maneuver, one of these \nnominations.\n  I agree with what the Senator from South Dakota, our distinguished \nDemocratic leader, said, that we should not get ourselves in a position \nwhere there is payback. Whoever the next President might be, if it is a \nRepublican President do we start doing the same things to him the \nRepublicans have done to President Clinton? That should not be done in \njudicial nominations. We should protect the integrity and the \nindependence of our Federal courts.\n  I have served here for 25 years. I love and revere this body. The day \nI leave the Senate, I will know that I have left the finest time of my \nlife, the best and most productive time of my life, the time that I \npass on to my children and my grandchildren, by being 1 of 100 men and \nwomen whom I respect and have looked forward to working with every day. \nBut that is because I think of this body as being the conscience of the \nNation.\n  If we now use a parliamentary procedure, something totally \nunprecedented on a Federal judgeship following a cloture motion, then \nwe shame the Senate. We should not.\n  Judged by any traditional standards of qualifications, competence, \ntemperament, or experience, both Marsha Berzon and Judge Paez should be \nconfirmed. They will be good judges. They will probably be even great \njudges. Their commitment to law and justice will serve the people of \ntheir circuit and our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Who yields time?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to \nthe distinguished Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to sum up briefly and say \nthere is new evidence that Judge Paez, a sitting district judge, while \nbeing nominated to the Ninth Circuit, under nomination by the President \nof the United States, found on his docket--rightly or wrongly, out of \n34 judges--the John Huang case, and he accepts a plea bargain that did \nnot require Huang to plead at all to the $1.6 million in illegal \ncampaign money he raised for the Democratic National Committee, for the \nClinton-Gore campaign.\n  He pled guilty only to a small contribution in the city of Los \nAngeles. He was given immunity for that amount.\n  When the guidelines were calculated based on the evidence the judge \nhad at that time, he should have added two additional levels for having \na substantial part of the scheme being outside the United States, two \nto four additional levels for being an organizer or a manager, and two \nadditional levels for violating a position of trust as the vice \npresident of a bank. Those are levels that should have been added by \nthe judge. He failed to do so. In so doing, he was able to find a level \nof eight, the highest possible level in which he could give this \nindividual zero time in jail, straight probation, and immunity on the \nmost serious charge. I believe it is wrong, and we need to have a \nhearing on it to find out how it happened.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I don't apologize for \nexercising my rights under the Senate rules and the Constitution to \nadvise and consent and speak against any judge, as did the other side \non William Rehnquist, twice, and four or five other judges in the last \n25 or 30 years, to name a few.\n  In response to what Senator Sessions said, his motion is very \nimportant in regards to Judge Paez. I ask my colleagues to consider one \nquestion: What if it was not random that Paez got the John Huang case? \nWhat if? Well, if you want to put the guy on the court and find out \nlater, that is up to you.\n  Finally, this is an activist court. This is a court that has been \noverturned 209 percent of the time. We are putting two judges on it, \none who says that a member of a union can't resign in a strike no \nmatter what the reason, and, finally, Paez, who is opposed by the U.S. \nChamber and who believes that a defendant cannot carry a Bible into a \ncourtroom, much as that Bible sits here on the desk of the Presiding \nOfficer right now. Those are the kinds of people we are putting on the \nbench.\n  I strongly urge that both of these nominees be rejected and that \nSenator Sessions' motion be supported.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Marsha L. Berzon, of California, to be United States Circuit Judge \nfor the Ninth Circuit?\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, a point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state the point of order.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I understand the Vice President is in the Chamber. \nUnder the Senate rules, a person who has a personal conflict of \ninterest in a vote is not allowed to vote. I make a parliamentary \ninquiry----\n  Mr. LEAHY. Regular order.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. As to whether or not the Vice President should be \nrequired to recuse himself under these circumstances on the vote.\n\n[[Page S1368]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The right of the Vice President is in the \nConstitution. The question is on confirmation of the nominations.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, may the Vice President exercise his \ndiscretion and recuse himself?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Debate is not in order. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

I thank those who worked hard to bring this on to the \nfloor for a vote.\n  Also, just a footnote, the Senate did the right thing in its second \nvote in rejecting the cockamamy idea of having a motion to suspend \nindefinitely a judicial nominee following a cloture vote. That may \nsound like inside baseball, but that would have been a terrible \nprecedent. I applaud the distinguished Democratic leader for speaking \nout so strongly against that motion, and I compliment the chairman of \nour Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, for sticking with these \nnominees, both of whom passed our committee.\n  We have done the right thing. We have righted a wrong of 4 years. I \nthink now the Senate should go on, set aside partisanship, and let us \nlook at those nominees who are still pending.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1368-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, is it any wonder why the approval ratings of \nthe Congress go up every time we go into\n\n[[Page S1369]]\n\nrecess? The American people are watching us, and they are wondering if \nwe are really paying attention to the issues important to them. I fear \nthat we are not paying enough attention, certainly.\n  Next month, the nation will observe the 1-year anniversary of the \ntragic shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado, in which fifteen \npeople, including the two student gunmen, were killed. But this tragedy \nis not unique.\n  In May 1992, a 20-year-old killed four people and wounded ten others \nin an armed siege at his former high school in California.\n  In January 1993, a 17-year-old walked into his teacher's seventh-\nperiod English class in Kentucky, and shot her in the head. He then \nshot the janitor in the abdomen.\n  In February 1996, a 14-year-old student took an assault rifle to his \nschool in Washington state and opened fire on his algebra class, \nkilling two classmates and a teacher.\n  One year later, in February 1997, a 16-year-old student opened fire \nwith a shotgun at a school in Alaska, killing a classmate and the \nschool principal and wounding two other students.\n  In October 1997, a 16-year-old student, after shooting his mother, \nwent to school with a gun and shot nine students, killing two of them.\n  In December 1997, a student opened fire on a student prayer circle at \na Kentucky school, killing three students and wounding five others.\n  In March 1998, a pair of boys took rifles to school and turned them \non classmates and teachers when they exited the building in response to \na false fire alarm at their Arkansas school. Four girls and a teacher \nwere killed, and 11 people were wounded.\n  In April 1998, at a Pennsylvania school, a 14-year-old-boy fatally \nshot a teacher and wounded two students at an eighth-grade dance.\n  The following month, in May 1998, a high school senior shot and \nkilled another student in the school parking lot in Tennessee, and then \nturned the gun on himself.\n  Two days later, a freshman student in Oregon opened fire with a semi-\nautomatic rifle in a high school cafeteria, killing two students and \nwounding 22 others. The teen's parents were later found shot to death \nin their home. This freshman student did not heed the admonition of the \nScriptures which says: Honor thy father and thy mother. He prceeded to \nkill his father and his mother.\n  Then, a month after last year's massacre at Columbine High School, in \nMay 1999, a 15-year-old gunman--I suppose you could call a 15-year-old \na gunman--opened fire on fellow students in Georgia, injuring six \nstudents, including one critically.\n  Most recently, last week in Flint, Michigan, a six-year-old boy took \na gun to school and killed a six-year-old girl in front of their \nshocked classmates. Six-year-olds killing six-year-olds--what have we \ncome to? And yet, the Congress fails to act. Are we blind? Are we numb \nto these killings? Even in the city in which we work, the tragedies are \nmounting. In the District of Columbia, since the school year began in \nSeptember, 18 juveniles have been killed. Of those, police say that \nhalf of them started as arguments at school and ended in death in \nnearby neighborhood streets.\n  Isn't this enough? Can't this Congress hear the cry of the American \nstudents, and their parents, to step up to the plate and at least \ndebate ways to help break this cycle of violence? I know that Congress \ncannot solve this problem on its own, just as an individual school \nboard or PTA cannot resolve this crisis acting as a single institution. \nBut we, the elected leaders of this nation who are very quick to point \nto problems in other nations, are not even talking about ways to end \nthis horrific record of children killing children.\n  Day after day, we criticize one nation for human rights violations or \nanother nation for failing to meet the needs of its people. But who are \nwe to look across the waters and criticize others if we remain silent, \nif we remain numb, if we remain mute, dumb about our own problems?\n  I am told that the current gridlock on this issue is because of \npartisanship. I hear that the reason the conference committee on the \njuvenile justice bill has only met once--last August--is that Members \nare at opposite ends of the spectrum on the gun-related provisions in \nthe legislation.\n  This legislation does not take any dramatic steps toward weapons. It \nsimply would put in place some commonsense provisions to balance public \nsafety and private gun owners' rights. Requiring trigger locks would \nnot jeopardize anyone's second amendment rights, but it might prevent \nchildren from using the guns at school--where the parents are at fault \nfor letting those weapons lie around where they are within the reach, \nwithin the sight, of children. And improving background checks is not a \nmonumental change either. These checks would only serve to prevent \nthose people who should not have access to weapons from getting them. I \nhope responsible parents and gun owners will be able to support these \ncommonsense provisions.\n  So I do not understand why this has to be a partisan issue in the \nU.S. Capitol Building or in the adjacent Senate and House Office \nBuildings when it is not a partisan issue in the rest of the country.\n  I note that earlier the Republican Governor of Colorado signed into \nlaw a new background check initiative that is even more rigorous than \nthe one overseen by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Governor Owens \nsaid this effort is a balance between ``the public's need to try to \nkeep firearms out of the hands of criminals with the private right to \npurchase a firearm.'' Let me read what the Governor said again: ``* * * \nthe public's need to try to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals \nwith the private right to purchase a firearm.'' It is a balance between \nthe two. He was talking about a balance between the two.\n  If there can be bipartisan legislation in Colorado, why can't there \nbe bipartisan legislation here in Congress? Even in this Chamber, \nSenators were able to put partisanship aside when we passed the \njuvenile justice bill last May. The legislation was approved \noverwhelmingly, by a vote of 73-25. Yet the conference committee still \ncannot reach an agreement.\n  Is that the problem? The conference committee between the two Houses \ncannot reach an agreement. The time for delay is over. Our Nation is \nyearning for leadership. I express my hope, as one Senator, to the \nconferees to move ahead on the juvenile justice bill. Craft a \ncommonsense bill that would help to break this cycle of youth violence. \nShow the Nation that the Congress can see what is happening outside the \nCapitol Building and that we are capable of working in partnership with \nall Americans to bring some modicum of calm to our classrooms.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to once again address an \nissue I have been talking about since last September, that of global \noil supply and prices. Back in September, I was talking about the \npossibility of an impending oil crisis due to OPEC's manipulation of \nglobal supply. As we moved into the fall, I joined with the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, and we started talking \nabout the likelihood of a crisis. Well, now it is a certainty.\n  As we all know, that crisis struck early this winter as home heating \noil prices in the Northeast pierced the $2-a-gallon level --something \nunheard of in the past. What began as a heating oil supply and price \nshock in the Northeast this winter is now rolling as thunder across our \nentire Nation. It is affecting the farmers throughout America in the \ncost of diesel fuel for their planting season. It is affecting truckers \nwho are having a very difficult time making a living because they are \nso dependent on the cost of diesel fuel. It has affected airlines with \nthe $20 surcharge. It has affected blue chip stocks. Yesterday, an \nanalysis read that one of the predominant reasons Procter & Gamble \nstock had sunk so was the high price of oil.\n  Yet, unfortunately, things could--and are likely to--get worse if \nnothing is done. It is likely to get worse with the price of gasoline. \nGasoline, in my judgment--and I have been saying this for several \nmonths--could hit $2 per gallon this summer and maybe more if nothing \nis done. Perhaps worst of all, this oil shock could very well throw \nsand in the gears of our high-flying economy as the Federal Reserve, \nworried about inflation, raises interest rates and the wonderful growth \nwe have experienced now for a record number of months could be thrown \ninto doubt or even jeopardy.\n  The numbers present a very dim outlook for us. Oil inventories are at \na 20-year low. Global supply is 2 million barrels below daily demand. \nComing off home heating oil prices that set records and defied gravity, \nwe are heading straight into a gasoline supply and price debacle this \nsummer.\n  We have now reached the point where rising oil prices are no longer a \nnuisance but, rather, a crisis for our economy. Two days ago, Procter & \nGamble, as mentioned, lost $34 billion in market value--nearly one-\nthird of the entire worth of a company that spent decades and decades \nbuilding up its value; boom, down one-third. It was because of profit \nworries due in large part to oil prices.\n  In fact, analysts are attributing the 15-percent drop in the Dow \nsince the beginning of the year directly to oil prices and the \ninflationary effects. I understand the Nasdaq index continues to go up, \nbut you can't have the industrial and traditional part of the economy \nwithout it affecting the tech parts of the economy, soon enough, \nunfortunately. If all of this doesn't wake us up to an economic crisis, \nI don't know what will.\n  Gas prices are now about $1.50 a gallon. They have set another \nrecord. That is the national average. Of course, in certain parts of \nthe country, particularly on the West Coast, they are considerably \nhigher, but $1.50 is about the average in my State--a little higher in \ndownstate areas, and a little lower in some of the upstate areas, \nalthough some, such as Binghamton and Utica, have pierced $1.50 as \nwell. But this summer by Memorial Day, as the summer driving season is \nupon us, if no further oil is released, we will likely hit $2 per \ngallon, self-service regular, average in the country.\n  This will do dramatic damage not only to people's pocketbooks and \nwallets but to our economy. New York--both upstate and downstate--\ndepends on tourism. In the summer season people are more likely to \ndrive. They are less likely to curtail their vacation.\n  Of course, the continued problems in agriculture, in transportation, \nand in manufacturing will get worse if oil prices continue to rise. \nThey rose about 44 cents today on the market, and not as high as the \n$34 a barrel they were 4 days ago, but that is scant relief. Given the \nlaws of supply and demand, it is quite likely they will exceed the $34 \nrather shortly.\n  We are going to hear about this from our constituents. The upcoming \nimpending gasoline crisis will be a major issue in the campaigns this \nsummer and fall, if nothing is done.\n  I don't blame our constituents for asking us to do something because \nwe have not acted resolutely with OPEC. We have not used the one ace in \nthe hole that we hold in our hand to compel OPEC to increase \nproduction--our well-stocked, 570-million-barrel Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. OPEC, by the way, cut back on supply, my friends, 5 percent \nlast year, and their revenues have increased 59 percent. That is how \ntight the oil market is.\n  For the last several weeks, Secretary Richardson, doing his best, has \nmet with various OPEC and OPEC-aligned ministers to try to get them to \nincrease production by their March 27 meeting. It seems very plausible \nand likely that Secretary Richardson's efforts have helped move some \nmembers of OPEC, and it is likely production will increase somewhat. \nBut there is also too good a chance, unfortunately, that ``somewhat'' \nwill not be enough. There is too good a chance that while OPEC will \nincrease production, the amount they decide to increase production \nwon't avoid the impending crisis in gasoline prices and oil prices this \nsummer.\n\n  The chart to my left shows the various OPEC scenarios. If we don't \nsee at least a 2-million-barrel increase in production right away, and \nsee that 2-million-barrel increase continue into the third quarter, the \nprices we have now--much too high already--will look like the good old \ndays.\n  This chart is conservative. Here is what it shows. If there is no \nchange in OPEC output, if they keep oil production as they have it--\nthey have talked a good game, but they haven't done anything--the price \nwill go way above $40 a barrel to $41.\n  Let's say they do what most people think is likely, that they will \ntry some palliative measure with a 1-million-barrel increase in the \nsecond quarter. Then the price still goes up from what it is now to \nabout $35 or $36 a barrel.\n  Let's say they pledge to increase oil by 1 million barrels a day in \nquarters 2 and 3. It still goes up from what it is today. And even if \nthey pledge the 1-million-barrel increase permanently, the price goes \nup but not on as great a slope. The worst thing about this chart is \nthat with 1 million barrels a day, even permanently, the price of oil \ncontinues to go up, which means the prices today will be lower than in \nthe future.\n  Today, the New York Times reported the stock market rebounded \nyesterday due in large part to a dip in oil prices stemming from rumors \nthat the Saudi Arabian and Iranian Governments agreed in principle to \nincrease supply at the March 27 meeting.\n  Look how dependent we have become on oil speculation from OPEC \nministers. When these ministers mumble about supply increases, our \neconomy signals relief. When they mention maintaining the quotas, or \nnot increasing supply enough, economic indicators begin heading south.\n  What this means to me is simple. It means OPEC has won. Its 18-month \ncutback in supply has succeeded in giving it significant leverage over \nthe U.S. and world economies. Even if OPEC chooses to increase supply \non March 27, which they in likelihood will do, the hard truth is that \nglobal inventories are so low that even a moderate increase will still \nallow the cartel to manipulate supply and increase prices at a moment's \nnotice. They have us, quite simply, by the neck.\n  We cannot allow our economy to become beholding to the decisions of \nOPEC ministers--plain and simple. My suggestion to the administration \nis this: We need to use the SPR as leverage. And we should make a \npromise to OPEC. We can make it privately or we can make it publicly. \nBut we should tell them in no uncertain terms that unless they decide \nto increase production by 2 million barrels a day by March 27, we will \nuse our reserve to make up the difference. Whether we make that promise \npublicly or privately, as I mentioned, is immaterial so long as they \nunderstand the consequences of squeezing supplies to the point of \nhurting our economy. And a comprehensive SPR-swaps policy, which means \nselling now and promising\n\n[[Page S1371]]\n\nto buy back later, makes good sense because the price will be lower \nlater and we can replenish the reserve. That needs to be put in place \nnow.\n  Some have argued that we shouldn't use the reserve except for \nnational emergencies. When oil is at $34 a barrel, when gas prices are \nheaded towards $2 per gallon, when major companies in America lose \ndramatic parts of their value because of the price of oil, and when the \neconomic expansion that has made this country smile from one coast to \nthe other for so many years is in jeopardy, to me that is an emergency. \nIf for some reason some in the administration have doubt about whether \nthey have the legal ability to sell the reserve--I believe they do--we \ncan easily in this body pass legislation that Senator Collins and I \nhave sponsored which makes it clear that they do.\n\n  No one is looking to go back to $10-per-barrel oil. But oil trading \nover $30 per barrel is clearly going to affect our economic growth and \nseverely impact the global economy.\n  We have a perfect tool to reduce the inordinate power of OPEC and \nprotect our economy. That tool is the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It \nis high time we used it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, in 1975, Congress passed the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which was designed \nto ensure that all students with disabilities would receive the \neducational services they needed in order to attend ``mainstream'' \nschools. This legislation has been effective in increasing access to \nquality education for disabled students all across the nation.\n  In my state of Ohio, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \nhas meant so much to thousands and thousands of young men and women \nover the last 25 years. It has opened up whole new worlds and shown \nthem that their disabilities cannot bind the limitless possibilities \nthat are provided by the gift of education.\n  IDEA has helped students like John Hook, from Elgin High School in \nMarion, Ohio. IDEA has given John's school the resources to hire a \nspecial education teacher who is able to help John with his reading and \nwriting.\n  Before IDEA, students with learning disabilities like John might have \ndropped out, but now, many are thriving. And because of the help he's \nreceived and his hard work, John is on his school's honor roll and is \n``on track'' for college.\n  IDEA has also been a tremendous help to Todd Carson, an 18 year old \nstudent from Highland High School in Highland Local School District \noutside Medina, Ohio. Todd has Cerebral Palsy and is confined to a \nwheelchair. Todd is unable to write and he cannot use a keyboard to \ncommunicate.\n  Through IDEA, Highland District was able to purchase a speech \nrecognition program called ``Dragon Dictate'' which can be used to \ncontrol a word processor. This has been like a ray of sunshine for \nTodd. Now, Todd has the ability to take class notes and write papers. \nDragon Dictate also lets him use the Internet and send e-mail. This \nprogram has been a big difference for Todd, allowing him to read, write \nand participate in class.\n  I am pleased with what we've been able to do with IDEA in Ohio. \nBefore its passage, there were close to 25,000 children who were \ninstitutionalized in Ohio because of conditions like Cerebral Palsy and \nautism. Now, according to the Ohio Coalition for the Education of \nChildren with Disabilities, there are no kids institutionalized in \nOhio. IDEA is a big factor in this success because instead of being \nhidden-away and forgotten about, these kids are in school--learning and \nthriving--preparing to add their contributions to society.\n  However, even with all the success of IDEA, the thousands and \nthousands it has benefitted, there is a startling reality to this \nprogram that no longer can be ignored: IDEA is crushing our schools \nfinancially.\n  Many of our state and local governments have found that the costs of \nserving handicapped students are typically 20% to 50% higher than the \naverage amount spent per pupil. This, in itself, is not the problem; \nstate and local governments understand that students with disabilities \nrequire different, and many times, expensive needs.\n  Congress, too, understood the expense involved when it passed IDEA, \npromising that the federal government would pay up to 40% of the costs \nassociated with the program.\n  Congress said, we think IDEA is so needed as a national priority, \nthat we will pay up to 40% of the costs.\n  The problem rests in the fact that the federal government has not \nprovided nearly as much funding as they told state and local leaders \nthey would provide, and which our children need. Indeed, in fiscal year \n2000, the federal government only provides enough funds to cover 12.6% \nof the educational costs for each handicapped child, not the 40% it \npromised.\n  As in past years, our State and local governments will be forced to \npay the leftover costs. That is what is going to happen. They are going \nto have to pay that leftover cost.\n  Because the Federal Government has not lived up to its expectations, \nIDEA amounts to a huge unfunded mandate. When I was Governor of Ohio, I \nfought hard for passage of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act so that \ncircumstances such as this could be avoided.\n  I was one of only a handful of State and local leaders who lobbied \nCongress to pass legislation that would provide relief to our State and \nlocal governments. I felt so strongly about this that in 1995 I asked \nSenator Dole to make unfunded mandate relief legislation S. 1. I was \nprivileged to be in the Rose Garden 5 years ago this month when the \nPresident signed S. 1 into\n\n[[Page S1372]]\n\nlaw. I will never forget the President saying how opposed he was to \nunfunded mandates since he had been a Governor for a number of years \nand had seen the effects of such unfunded mandates.\n  Unfortunately, the President has done nothing--nothing--to address \none of the most costly unfunded mandates; that is, the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act.\n  The President's fiscal year 2000 budget contains $40.1 billion in \ndiscretionary education funding. That is more than a 37-percent \nincrease over the fiscal year 2000 discretionary education total, \nincluding advanced funding, and nearly double the $21.1 billion in \ndiscretionary education spending allocated by the Federal Government in \n1991--just 10 years ago.\n  Think about that for a moment. The President is looking to increase \nfederal education discretionary spending so that it will have grown by \nalmost 100% in ten years. And that's at a time when inflation will have \ngrown only 20.7% during the same ten years. That's incredible!\n  What's even more incredible is what we're doing to our states and \nlocalities. Of the discretionary total for fiscal year 2000, we \nallocated $4.9 billion for IDEA. If we had funded IDEA at the 40% level \nthat Congress had promised in 1975, we would have allocated $15.7 \nbillion in fiscal year 2000. In essence, we have passed along a $10.8 \nbillion mandate on our state and local governments.\n  Think about it--a $10.8 billion mandate.\n  For anyone who thinks about it, they are asking, What does that mean? \nThat is more than we spent on the entire budget for the Department of \nthe Interior. Think of it.\n  When our Nation's Governors were in Washington recently for the \nannual Governors' Association winter meeting, one of their more \nprominent issues--I would say the most prominent issue they brought up \nwith Congress and the President--was the need to fully fund IDEA.\n  The Governors made it patently clear that if the Federal Government \npaid their 40-percent share of IDEA, it would free up $10.8 billion \nacross America and would allow them to better respond to the education \nneeds in their respective States.\n  They also pointed out that many of them were building schools, hiring \nteachers, and doing most of the things Washington wants to do with that \n$10.8 billion that should have gone to the States to fund IDEA.\n  With the help of the Ohio School Boards Association and the Buckeye \nAssociation of School Administrators, I am contacting superintendents \nof education, leaders from urban, suburban, and rural districts in \nevery part of Ohio--I have a letter going out to all of them--asking \nthem about their experience with the fiscal impact of IDEA and their \nadvice on what would be the best way the Federal Government could be a \nbetter partner.\n  The main question I have asked Ohio's educators is: What will help \nyou more--fully funding the Federal commitment to IDEA, or funding at \nthe Federal level programs that, by their very nature, are the \nresponsibility of our State and local governments, such as hiring new \nteachers, building new schools, and a host of other programs that may \nor may not be needed in school districts across America?\n  I am going to be reporting back later this spring with the results of \nthat survey. In the meantime, I believe it is incumbent on the Senate, \nas it considers the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, to find money to fully fund IDEA. This body for sure \nshould not support expensive new Federal education programs until IDEA \nis fully funded.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my letter to Ohio's education \nleaders be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                February 28, 2000.\n       Dear Ohio Education Leader: I am writing to ask for your \n     input concerning the Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Act (IDEA). As you know, IDEA was passed in 1975 to ensure \n     that handicapped students receive the educational services \n     that they need to attend mainstream schools. This legislation \n     has been successful in increasing access to quality education \n     for Ohio's disabled students and for young people throughout \n     the nation. However, many educators have contacted me about \n     the funding of IDEA and the ability of school officials to \n     discipline students under the Act.\n       Act the Senate prepares to debate the reauthorization of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, many educational \n     issues, including IDEA, will be examined. As such, I am \n     interested in your experience. Is the funding your school \n     district receives from the federal government inadequate to \n     help you meet your obligations under the Act? As you may \n     know, the federal government has not lived up to its promise \n     to provide up to 40 percent of the costs of special education \n     under the Act nationally. Are the costs to your district of \n     complying with disability legislation affecting your ability \n     to pay for your other programs and responsibilities? \n     Secondly, I have heard from educators about the difficulty \n     they have maintaining discipline in classrooms while \n     complying with the requirements of IDEA. Has this been a \n     challenge for your schools?\n       As we work to improve our laws, any insights you have into \n     the impact of federal regulations concerning the education of \n     disabled students on school in Ohio or input into improving \n     IDEA would be appreciated.\n       Finally, in light of the President Clinton's continued \n     emphasis on federal involvement in education, traditionally a \n     state and local responsibility, I am interested in your \n     thoughts on whether your district would benefit more from the \n     President's new education proposals or if you would be better \n     off if Congress met its obligations under IDEA--freeing money \n     for you to fund your own priorities.\n       Thank you for your valuable input. I strongly believe that \n     working together we can make a difference for Ohio's young \n     people.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              George V. Voinovich,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts).

Mr. President, during the course of the last 2 weeks, the \nhealth committee has been dealing with the vitally important subject of \neducation and has been engaged over a period of many hours in the \nwriting of a bill extending the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof the United States. That writing process, in my view, has been highly \nconstructive. It has also been ignored by the press of the United \nStates and, therefore, by most of the people of the United States. It \ndoes not deserve that fate.\n  Education is a vitally important subject, and the Federal role in \neducation, a role that has increased markedly over the course of the \nlast several decades, is at a crossroads in the course of that debate--\na debate which I hope next month will proceed to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  This is truly a defining moment in our history in Congress. We have \nan opportunity to greatly improve and change the direction of Federal \nGovernment funding for schools all across the United States of America. \nWe get this opportunity only once every 4 to 6 years, when the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act comes \nbefore us.\n  I am convinced we will do that job best by listening to our \nconstituents who have an immediate concern with education--an immediate \nconcern because they are the parents of our public school students, an \nimmediate concern because they are teachers in our schools, and an \nimmediate concern because they are principals or elected school board \nmembers in those schools; in other words, people whose lives revolve \naround the education of the next generation of American young people.\n  I am going to try to do my part during the course of the recess over \nthe next 10 days by once again spending a considerable amount of my \ntime visiting schools in the State of Washington in Bellingham, Mount \nVernon, Spokane, and Colfax, carrying on a tradition I have used \nincreasingly over the course of the last 3 or 4 or 5 years.\n  What I found during those visits is that each school is different \nfrom every other school. They are united only in the concern of the \npeople who work in those schools for the future of our children. Some \nof those schools need more teachers. Some need teachers who are better \npaid to compete with outside opportunities. Some need more classroom \nspace. Some need better teaching for the teachers. Others need more \ncomputers. But different as those needs are, present Federal policy \nsays here is what you must do with the money we provide you in \nliterally dozens and perhaps hundreds of different narrow categorical \nfunctions, each of which requires a bureaucracy in Washington,\n\n[[Page S1373]]\n\nDC, to look over applications and to run audits, and each of which \nrequires a corresponding bureaucracy in our States and in our local \nschool districts to ask for the money and to account for how it is \nspent.\n  I have proposed, and a majority of the members of the health \ncommittee are now proposing, to add to this Federal formula a bill that \nI call Straight A's to inject what I consider to be some common sense \nin the way in which we help our schools in Washington, DC.\n  Straight A's will give to States all across the United States an \nopportunity to change from a process of accountability to a performance \naccountability. Instead of spending their time filling out forms to \nshow that they have spent their money exactly as Congress has dictated, \na State which elects to come under Straight A's will be able to take \none to two dozen of these narrow categorical aid programs, combine them \ninto one, and get rid of all the forms and most of this process \naccountability on the basis of one's promise. That promise is: Let us \ndo what we think best for our kids, and we will do a better job. Our \nkids will do better. We will have standardized tests in our States and \nwe will prove they are doing better, because we are allowed to make \nmore of our own decisions or you can cancel the whole thing and take it \nback. It is as simple as that.\n\n  It is the provision of trust in people who are putting their lives \nand their years into the education of our kids, the people who know our \nkids' names, rather than a group in the Department of Education in \nWashington, DC, or in this body which so often seems to feel it can and \nshould act as one nationwide school board.\n  I have heard a lot from the defenders of the status quo over the \ncourse of the last 3 years. One of the first who criticized my earlier \nproposal said: My gosh, if we let them do that, they will spend all the \nmoney on swimming pools. Another said it might be football helmets.\n  All of them had one common thought: We don't dare let our educators \nand our school board members make up their minds; They would make \nmistakes; We know more than they do; We know more than the people in \nyour hometown, Mr. President, in Kansas, or my people in the State of \nWashington, or the constituents of the Senator from the State of \nVirginia. Somehow we know the cure for 17,000 school districts across \nthe United States.\n  The biggest of the present Federal programs is title I, originally \npassed 35 years ago to narrow the gap between underprivileged children \nand privileged children. The gap has not narrowed in that 35 years. Is \nit not time we give some of our States and some of our school districts \nthe opportunity to say they think they can do it better? We think those \nright on the ground in our schools can do it better than taking \ndirection from the Senate, the House, the White House, and the \nDepartment of Education in Washington, DC.\n  That is the opportunity we 100 Members of the Senate are going to be \ngiven very soon, I am convinced, by the action of a committee under the \nleadership of the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, and \nother dedicated members of that committee. I am disappointed the work \nthey have been doing for the past couple of weeks has not gotten wider \npublicity and attention than it has received. I am now convinced that \ncommittee is going to present the most profound reform, the most \nhopeful new direction in the field of Federal education policy than we \nhave received in a generation.\n  All 100 Members are going to have an opportunity to make those \nchanges ourselves. I look forward to that opportunity. I congratulate \nthe committee for the work it has already done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have an amendment appended at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Presiding Officer is familiar with the \nmatter I bring to the attention of the Senate, and I thank him for his \nadvice and willingness to participate in the undertaking to prepare the \namendment which I will now address.\n  I rise today to advise the Senate of a proposed amendment on Kosovo, \na form of which I and other cosponsors intend to offer when the Senate \nconsiders the fiscal year 2000 Supplemental Appropriations Act. An \nexperienced group of colleagues have worked together, and we will \ncontinue to work together on this legislation. I thank Senators \nStevens, Inouye, Roberts, and Snowe for joining me as cosponsors in \nthis effort.\n  I inform the Senate about this amendment now so that other \ncolleagues, officials in the administration, and, indeed, our allies \nand other nations and organizations will have sufficient time to study \nand provide constructive comment on this legislation prior to the \nSenate's consideration of the supplemental later this month.\n  This is a vital issue, as our Presiding Officer knows full well. It \nis critical to the men and women of our Armed Forces that the U.S. \nCongress face up to this issue. It is equally critical to the brave \ntroops of other nations serving in Kosovo. It is critical to the future \nof NATO, and it is critical to future peacekeeping missions.\n  There are an ever-increasing number of problems in the world today. \nIt is a far more complex and dangerous place than it was a decade ago \nor a decade before that. Indeed, as I look back on the cold-war era, \nthere was a certain amount of certainty within which we were able to \nstructure our forces, lay down a strategy, and perform our missions. \nToday, it is greatly different. The challenges posed to our national \nleaders, and particularly the men and women of the Armed Forces, have \nlittle precedent. Likewise, the diversity of the threats have now \nproliferated throughout the world. They are less and less nation \nsponsored, state sponsored; oftentimes, they are just small groups. \nThere are conflicts in ever-increasing numbers, prompted by cultural, \nethnic, and religious differences.\n\n  As I publicly stated regarding this amendment, my intention in \noffering this legislation is to ensure that our European allies have \nstepped up to meet their share in providing the necessary resources and \npersonnel for the civil implementation in Kosovo, the efforts to which \nwe have all pledged as a group of nations to fulfill. Once the military \nmission was completed, then we committed among ourselves to take the \nnext step to ensure the peace that was given as a consequence of the \nsacrifices and the professionalism of the men and women who promulgated \nthat combat action for 78 days.\n  During that period of combat, the United States bore the major share \nof the military burden for the air war, flying almost 70 percent of the \ntotal strike and support forces at a cost of over $4 billion to the \nAmerican taxpayer. Many, many aviators and others took high personal \nrisks. We were joined in that combat operation by another seven or \neight nations that indeed did fly, willingly and courageously. However, \nit was the United States only--how well our colleagues know--that had \nthe high-performance aircraft, the guided missiles, that support the \ntransport aircraft. NATO did not have it. Those elements of our \nmilitary, whether they were in or out of NATO, were brought together to \npromulgate this successful military operation.\n  In return, the Europeans then promised to pay the major share of the \nburdens to secure the peace. So far, they have committed and pledged \nbillions of dollars for this goal. I acknowledge that. They have come \nin diverse amounts at diverse periods of time, but the problem is not \nenough money has been put up thus far in a timely fashion to make their \nway to the Kosovo problems, and then begin to solve those problems.\n  Why the delay? The troops and the public are entitled to know. As a \nresult, our troops and other troops are having to make up for the \nshortfalls of failing to provide the police force--something we all \nagreed upon long before the first shot was fired. The troops today, \ntherefore, are having to make up for those shortfalls by performing \nbasic police functions, such as running\n\n[[Page S1374]]\n\ntowns and villages, acting mayors, settling all types of disputes, and \nguarding individual houses and historic sites. The distinguished \nPresiding Officer visited this region just a month or so ago, as did I, \nand witnessed this.\n  The troops are functioning in areas for which they were not \nspecifically trained. However, there is an extraordinary learning curve \nfor men and women in the Armed Forces of the United States of America \nand, indeed, other nations. The Presiding Officer and I know; we were \nprivileged to wear uniforms ourselves at one time. We know how well \nthese young men and women can adapt to challenges.\n  They were not specifically trained, but they are doing the job, and \nthey were doing it very well, but at a great personal risk, I say to \nthe Presiding Officer, at a great personal risk. We have seen in the \npast few weeks, in Mitrovica and other areas, outbursts, we have seen \nwoundings, we have seen deaths.\n\n  That was not a situation we anticipated would take place if there had \nbeen a timely sequencing of the military actions and the placing of a \ncivilian police force, infrastructure adjustments, and all the other \nthings needed to bring together Kosovo as an operating society.\n  Our troops engaged in a high-risk mission, along with others. Their \ncourage, their professional work, as I said, was witnessed by the \nPresiding Officer and myself, on my trip, and by many others in the \nSenate. I credit the large number of Senators for taking the time to go \nover and visit with our troops to see for themselves the complexity of \nthe situation and the risks that are being taken.\n  As I said, our troops accept that risk. Indeed, the American people \nthus far have accepted that risk. But it is now incumbent upon the \nCongress of the United States to begin to exercise its authority and to \nshow some leadership, hopefully in partnership with the administration. \nWe need to show leadership to make certain, regarding the commitment \nmade by our allies and other organizations--whether it be the United \nNations, the E.U., the OSCE, or many others who are working in \ngovernmental organizations--that we are pulling on the oars together. I \nam proud to say our country, as best I can determine, has met in a \ntimely fashion its obligations. But the purpose of this amendment is to \ndraw the attention of our allies to the fact the record does not show \nthat they are likewise fulfilling their commitments in a timely way.\n  We braved those 78 days of combat. Along with other nations that \nparticipated we laid the foundation for peace in Kosovo. What we cannot \nand must not allow to happen is for the risk to our troops to endlessly \ndrift on because of the failure of our allies to live up to their share \nof the commitments. This is the bottom line of this amendment.\n  The amendment is simple and straightforward. Half of the funding \nincluded in the supplemental for the U.S. military operations in \nKosovo--over $1 billion; that is one-half; it is a total of $2 \nbillion--would be provided up front, ready for prompt disbursal to stop \nthe drawdown of the readiness accounts. This would pay for the expenses \naccrued by our military in Kosovo since the start of the current fiscal \nyear, way back on October 1, 1999.\n  The remainder of the money, roughly another $1 billion, would be \navailable only--and I underline ``only''--after the President of the \nUnited States certifies to the Congress that the European Commission, \nthe member nations of the European Union, and the European member \nnations of NATO have provided a substantial percentage of the \nassistance and personnel which they themselves have committed to the \nvarious civil implementation efforts in Kosovo.\n  This is an important point that needs to be emphasized. In this \nlegislation we are not seeking an arbitrary or unachievable standard. \nWe are holding the Europeans accountable for the pledges and \ncommitments which they have made. Recognizing that nations have \ndifferent fiscal years and different procedures, we are not asking for \nfull compliance within the context of this legislation. We expect \neventually full compliance.\n  In the critical areas of humanitarian assistance, support for the \nKosovo Consolidated Budget--the money needed by Dr. Kouchner, to whom I \nwill refer later; he is the head of the U.N. mission--to run Kosovo and \nthe police for the U.N. international police force, the Europeans must \nprovide 75 percent of the money or personnel which they committed to \nprovide before additional U.S. taxpayer dollars for military operations \nin Kosovo would be disbursed.\n  That is a formula I devised along with the others who worked with me \non this, and the intention is to lay down the figures of who has done \nwhat, when they did it, and what is left to be done. Unless our \nPresident, through his leadership, and other world leaders, can bring \nthis rough formula into play, then we have the triggering mechanism by \nwhich the President, if he desires not to certify, or cannot because \nthe facts do not justify a certification. Then I will spell out what \nhappens to the balance of that money.\n  As I mentioned, on the reconstruction side--I wish to repeat that; it \nis important--it is a more long-term endeavor. We are requiring the \nEuropeans to provide a third of the money they pledged for the 1999 and \n2000 period.\n  I will readily admit I do not know if a third of the reconstruction \nmoney is a good benchmark because that is the category of aid for which \nI am having the most problem getting accurate data. I cannot tell you \nthe hours and hours involved in consultation, trips and travel to the \nU.N. and elsewhere, to the Departments of our Federal Government, \nindeed, consultations with the White House. I found everyone trying to \nbe constructive.\n  We had a meeting at the White House with the Secretaries of State, \nDefense, the chairman of the Budget Office, the National Security \nAdviser. Trying to assemble the data is an awesome task. This amendment \nforces that task to be undertaken by that individual best qualified to \ndo it, and that is the President of the United States, working in \nconcert with these organizations and the other allies.\n  It is so difficult to get the data, but we have plowed ahead as best \nwe could. We know, for example, that billions have been pledged at two \ninternational donor conferences for Kosovo reconstruction, but I have \nnot been able to find within the administration, at the U.N. or at the \nE.U., anyone or any document or fact that could advise me and inform \nthe Senate on how much of that money has actually been disbursed.\n  To put it in the vernacular, where are the canceled checks for what \nhas come in already? It is as simple as that. The American people \nunderstand there has to be a record. That is part of the body of fact \nthis Congress needs--and that is required by this legislation--as we \ndecide whether or not to support a continuation of our military \ndeployment, the U.S. troops which are part of the KFOR military \nstructure.\n  Again, I compliment that KFOR structure. It is working. It is meeting \nunanticipated problems. It is doing the best it can. There have been \nsome problems recently. Our committee has had General Clark in, just a \nweek or so ago. We went over this, carefully provided oversight about \nevery 3 months or less on this situation.\n  What happens, I ask, if our allies do not fulfill their commitments \nand the President is not able to make the certification required by \nthis amendment? If the President cannot make the required certification \nby June 1, then the remaining $1 billion contained in the supplemental \nfor military operations in Kosovo may be used only for the purpose of \nconducting a safe and orderly and phased withdrawal of U.S. military \npersonnel from Kosovo.\n\n  There it is. That is the bottom line. It has to be said. Someone has \nto say it. And I said it. I am very pleased with the support I have \ngotten from a number of individuals to step up and take on this \nresponsibility.\n  Further, no other funding previously appropriated for the Department \nof Defense may be used to continue the deployment of U.S. military \npersonnel in Kosovo. We have to seal that up. It had to be said. I \nthought long and hard on the time and the moment I would come to this \nfloor and state it. But I did it.\n  We are not setting a deadline for the withdrawal of our troops. It is \nup to the President and his military advisers to decide how best a \nsafe, orderly, and phased withdrawal should be done. Under this \nlegislation, the President would have to submit his plan for the \nwithdrawal to the Congress by June 30. In my opinion, that withdrawal \nshould not take more than 18 months.\n\n[[Page S1375]]\n\n  The bottom line is it is not fair to our troops, to their families at \nhome, to the other troops, to remain indefinitely in Kosovo with the \npolitical structure, be it our President, the Congress of the United \nStates, the legislatures of the other nations and their leaders, not to \ntake some strong, positive action now to ensure this peace.\n  We cannot ask those people in uniform and, indeed, many civilians who \nare associated in this effort--there are a lot of volunteer \norganizations there--we cannot ask them to take the ever-increasing \nshare of this burden and the risks, personal risks, simply because the \nnations are not willing, in a timely way, to provide the funding or \npersonnel they promised for civil implementation in Kosovo.\n  Some will criticize this legislation. That is all right. I am \nprepared to receive it. But what is a better solution than what we have \ndevised? If there is a better one, please come forward and give it to \nus. I invite constructive criticism. I invite suggestions. Those who \nworked with me on this join me.\n  Some may claim it holds the U.S. military deployment in Kosovo \nhostage to the actions of our allies; that we are in effect letting \nothers decide whether or not our troop presence in Kosovo will continue \nby their inaction. I address that allegation now and say, quite \nrespectfully, that our President has already made that connection. The \nexit strategy for our troops in Kosovo--as it is for our troops in \nBosnia--is directly linked to the actions of the U.N., the E.U., the \nOSCE and others in achieving their goals on the civil implementation \nside.\n  Our President said on October 15 in a letter to the Congress:\n\n       The duration of the requirement for U.S. military presence \n     (in Kosovo) will depend upon the course of events. . . . The \n     military force will be progressively reduced based on an \n     assessment of progress in civil implementation and the \n     security situation.\n\n  This legislation uses the same link, the same tie to the actions of \nothers already adopted in concept by this administration.\n\n  In Kosovo, the U.N., E.U., and OSCE are the groups charged with the \ncivil implementation responsibilities. Up to this point, I must say \nquite plainly, these organizations are not doing the job they committed \nto do in a timely manner in Kosovo. The successful NATO-led military \noperation in Kosovo was undertaken--at personal risk to our troops and \nthose of other nations, and with billions of dollars in costs to the \nAmerican taxpayers and the taxpayers of other nations--with the \nunderstanding in America and, indeed, throughout Europe that the U.N. \nand other organizations would promptly move in behind and consolidate \nthe military achievements. Now, as a result of little progress in that \nconsolidation, U.S. troops and troops from over 30 nations, are \nrequired to perform almost all the tasks and are facing an indefinite \ndeployment and indefinite risk in Kosovo.\n  Personal bravery, international bonds of commitment, and prudent NATO \nleadership won the war in Kosovo, but will the slow pace of follow-on \nactions result in the loss of the peace? That is what we are facing.\n  Recent events in Mitrovica show how fragile the peace is in Kosovo \nand how time and unfulfilled commitments play into the hands of those \nwho oppose the peace, and there are several factions that oppose this \npeace.\n  During a hearing in the Senate Armed Services Committee on February 2 \nwith NATO commander General Clark as the witness, I and other Members \nsignaled our intention to take legislative action in connection with \nthe upcoming Kosovo supplemental to be proposed by President Clinton. \nIt has not as yet arrived in the Senate. It is to revitalize the near \nstagnant situation in Kosovo. That is the purpose of this amendment.\n  Congress has a coequal responsibility with the executive branch, and \nwe now must exercise leadership, again I say, hopefully in partnership \nwith the administration. This is not a political document. Many went in \nwith the best of intentions, but it is time we recognize that no matter \nhow sincere those intentions may have been, we are not collectively, as \na group of nations, fulfilling our responsibilities.\n  We, a growing number of Senators, state:\n\n       Other nations and organizations must follow through on \n     their commitments if U.S. troops are to remain a part of the \n     Kosovo military force.\n\n  The United States has far too many commitments around the world. Our \nmilitary is stretched too thin as it is. We cannot have an open-ended, \npossibly decades-long military deployment in the Balkans.\n  We, together with other nations, went into Kosovo with the best of \nintentions--to stop the slaughter of tens of thousands of innocent \npeople, to restore peace and stability to that region, and to help the \npeople of Kosovo rebuild lives shattered by war and ethnic cleansing. \nBut what has the situation achieved? What has this coalition really \nachieved? Clearly, the military has fulfilled its mission. To the \nextent possible, given the continued ethnic animosities--and how \nextraordinarily they persist--the military has stopped the large-scale \nfighting and created a relatively safe and secure environment, from a \nmilitary perspective. However, unacceptable dangerous levels of \ncriminal activity continue and put our troops and many others at risk. \nTherefore, we have little time left in which to address this problem. \nWe have to figure out, given the precious little progress that has \ntaken place to date, what we can do in the future. This is one idea by \na very conscientious and thoughtful group of Senators.\n\n  We must recognize the U.N. bears its share of the responsibility. We \nonly say that because the U.N. cannot share all the blame or accept all \nthe blame for the slow pace of progress in Kosovo. But we are mindful \nof the fact that international organizations are dependent on timely \ncontributions of money and personnel from member nations. In other \nwords, the U.N. acts as a funneling of these funds as they are \ncontributed pursuant to commitments by the various nations. These \ncontributions have been severely lacking, severely delayed in the case \nof Kosovo.\n  When I was in Pristina in January, I had the opportunity to meet with \nDr. Kouchner--an extraordinary man--the head of the UNMIK, the U.N. \nmission in Kosovo. He is a very dedicated and committed individual. He \nhas given up much of his private life to go into that area to do the \nvery best he can.\n  We conducted that meeting with General Reinhardt at the KFOR \nheadquarters, the headquarters, I might add, which on that particular \nnight did not even have running water and the electricity was \nflickering. It is just an example of the inability to deliver the very \nbasic necessities.\n  I remember Dr. Kouchner said that night--he was bitterly cold--that \nthere were people literally huddled in their homes without adequate \nfood, heat, shelter, and the like, and it could have been alleviated, \nto some degree, had these nations stepped up and met their commitments.\n  As I said, I was impressed with the professionalism and dedication of \nthe general and Dr. Kouchner.\n  Dr. Kouchner sounded a consistent and urgent theme. He desperately \nneeded money if the U.N. was to achieve its goals in Kosovo. Dr. \nKouchner has been going from capital to capital across Europe and, \nindeed, in this hemisphere--he visited here just a few days ago--urging \nnations to live up to the commitments they made, to send the money for \nhis mission. General Reinhardt has been supporting Dr. Kouchner in his \nefforts, since the general understands the KFOR troops continue to bear \nthe full burden if the U.N. mission does not succeed and the missions \nof all the organizations. According to General Reinhardt:\n\n       The problem for Bernard Kouchner is that he doesn't get the \n     money to pay for what he knows he needs and wants for Kosovo. \n     . . . The international community--the same governments that \n     decided to get us here--doesn't give him what . . . he needs, \n     and it has a direct impact on my soldiers.\n\n  On Monday, March 6, Dr. Kouchner and General Reinhardt, as I said, \nwere at the U.N. to report to the Security Council on the situation in \nKosovo. Dr. Kouchner told the Security Council:\n\n       If we hope to build democracy in Kosovo, we must do more \n     than ensure the safety of its residents. We must allocate the \n     necessary resources to accomplish the job.\n\n  I agree. Foreign donors must deliver immediately, as the United \nStates has done, on their commitments and promises.\n  My greatest concern is with the international police. The U.N. has \nsaid it needs an international police force of\n\n[[Page S1376]]\n\n4,718. To date, only 2,359 police have arrived in Kosovo. It is \ninteresting, just about half of what was projected. The United States \nhas done its share. We have already deployed 481 police, and the \nremaining police pledged by the U.S.--for a total of 550--will arrive \nin Kosovo shortly. Others, particularly Europeans, have to do their \nshare by providing the necessary police forces. Overall, nations have \npledged over 4,400 police. They must now deliver on these pledges. \nPledges do not help with the current violence. We need to put it in \nwords that Americans understand: ``Cops on the beat.''\n  I commend my distinguished ranking member, Senator Levin, who has \nconstantly hit that theme in open sessions over and over again. To a \nlarge measure, he joins me in the purport of this amendment. Hopefully, \nin the weeks to come, with his advice, and with others advice, we can, \nto the extent necessary--maybe not necessary--reconfigure some of the \nlanguage of this amendment.\n  We had a meeting today with officials of our administration in the \nArmed Services hearing, again, to show the amendment and to urge them \nto come forward and give us such suggestions as they wish to make.\n  I spoke, by phone, with Secretary Cohen and National Security Adviser \nBerger. It is not as if we are out here operating on our own. We are \ntrying to do our best. But remember, Congress has coequal \nresponsibility and must exercise its best leadership.\n  NATO's soldiers must get out of the business of policing. That will \nnot happen until enough police arrive. Our troops are not policemen. \nThey were not specifically trained, as I said, to perform these tasks. \nIt should not be a part of their continuing indefinite mission.\n  Since the air war began almost a year ago, the United States has \nspent over $5 billion for our military operations in Kosovo--$5 \nbillion. It was for a good cause. But $5 billion is desperately needed \nby our military today for its modernization. The distinguished chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee, at lunch--and the Presiding Officer \nwas there--recounted program after program in terms of the airlift, the \naging C-5, the aging C-41, the need to up the buy of the C-17. That is \nwhere these needed dollars are required.\n  The annual price tag for the military commitment is over $2 billion \nin Kosovo. This is a heavy burden on the defense budget, but we are \ngoing to, hopefully, get it in the supplemental so that we do not take \nit, as we say, out of their operating accounts. That is the importance \nof this supplemental. Plus, it is a heavy burden on the American \ntaxpayer.\n\n  In addition to these significant sums of money, I am concerned, \nagain, about the safety and welfare of the men and women in uniform. I \nwill come back to that on every single pace. Each day that I am \nprivileged to be a member of the Armed Services Committee--and now as \nits chairman--I think and begin every day asking myself: What is my \nobligation to work with this committee to better the lot of the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces and their families?\n  They are patrolling these towns and villages--as you and I are in \nthis Chamber, and others--subjecting themselves to substantial personal \nrisk while performing their duties. They are taking the risks. The \nAmerican people take the risks.\n  I believe we have reached a point in time where it is the \nresponsibility of the Congress to take action to ensure that others \nstep up and fulfill their commitments--other nations and \norganizations--and that the U.S. military commitment to Kosovo not \nremain an endless commitment.\n  I place this draft in the Senate Record of today, rather than \nformally filing the amendment, to show our determination to put forth a \nconstructive approach, not a ``cut and run''--there is never any \nintention to do that--but accountability for all trying to secure a \nlasting peace in Kosovo. That is the bottom line. I did not file it, so \nthat, if necessary--if we get a good set of suggestions--we can change \nthis document and improve it.\n  I believe the American people will continue to support the U.S. \ninvolvement in Kosovo. I know they will if they know that our President \nand their Congress are acting in partnership, in concert, to get this \njob done that is fair to all. They want to see our allies also step up \nand be accountable and to do their part.\n  I think--and I say this humbly--this proposal will help do just this. \nWe invite the comments and suggestions of all.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and others, for joining me in this \neffort.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n\n                            amendment no.--\n\n(Purpose: To limit the use of funds for support of military operations \n                               in Kosovo)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n       Sec. __.

Mr. President, I want to discuss a subject that is \nnot terribly different than the remarks made by the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia just now. He talks about our responsibilities, \nwhat we have to do to protect our citizens. He talked about it in a \nslightly different way than I am going to discuss it now.\n  But we are at a point in time, Mr. President, when there are 43 days \non the calendar left until the 1-year anniversary of the shootings at \nColumbine High School in Colorado. On April 20, 2000, it will be 1 year \nsince the country listened, in shock, to the news that two high school \nstudents, Eric Harris and\n\n[[Page S1377]]\n\nDylan Klebold, had stormed into Columbine and systematically shot and \nkilled 12 classmates and a teacher.\n  When we talk about 43 days to go, those are calendar days. If we \ntalked about the number of days left for us to enact legislation, there \nare somewhere around 23 days left.\n  In addition to those 12 classmates and a teacher killed, 23 other \nstudents and teachers were wounded in the assault.\n  It pains me--and I am sure it is true for all Americans--when I think \nback to the picture of that carnage: Young people running in a high \nschool, fearful that their lives may be taken away, many weeping with \nterror as they fled. Who could ever forget the picture of that young \nman hanging out of a window to try to protect himself?\n  But even in some ways more shocking is to see how quickly this \nCongress can dismiss those images. The American people must be \nwondering: What we have been doing since that tragic day almost a year \nago? What have we done to reassure parents across the country that we \nare working to prevent it from happening again? We have shown no \nevidence of that. As a matter of fact, the evidence is quite to the \ncontrary. The evidence says: Congress had a chance to do it, but we \nchose not to. We have not done anything, and it is a disgrace. I heard \nyesterday that there was a shooting. I have recounted several incidents \nin the past year when I have heard news of a shooting here and news of \na shooting there. My first question is, Is it a school? Is it a \nschoolyard that has become another killing field? Yesterday's shooting \nwas not in a schoolyard. But when that 6-year-old child was killed by \nanother 6-year-old child, it was in a schoolyard. It was an adult's \nfault more than that child's fault--the 6-year-old didn't know any \nbetter--the man whose gun was lying casually around when this boy \npicked it up and took it to kill his classmate. We have not dealt with \nthat. We have not dealt with the problem of adult responsibility, \nkeeping guns out of the hands of children. There is no doubt in my mind \nthat the responsibility should fall directly on the adult and have them \npay, and pay dearly, for their role in the crime.\n\n  On Tuesday, the President tried to help. He met with leaders of the \nconference committee, where gun safety measures are stalled, to try to \nmove this issue to the front burner. I salute his efforts. He \nunderstands the need for action. He recalls routinely the vote we took \nin this Chamber to pass my gun show loophole amendment. It did pass, \n51-50, with the help of Vice President Gore, who voted to break the \ntie.\n  But nothing happened. The legislation passed the Senate. But the \nHouse passed a juvenile justice bill without gun safety measures. While \nthe President tried to make positive progress, the NRA, the National \nRifle Association--I name them clearly--and the gun lobby continued to \nobstruct every single effort to pass commonsense gun safety measures. \nThey do it by spreading false information about what these measures are \ndesigned to do. They distort the record to achieve their goal: no gun \nsafety laws. That is what they want.\n  They said my amendment was intended to shut down gun shows. It was a \nlie. It was an untruth. They also misquoted my remarks at a press \nconference. But when the video of my speech is reviewed, you see what I \nsaid. I said, ``Close the gun show loophole.'' These folks don't \nrespect the truth.\n  My amendment would simply shut out criminals who use gun shows as \nconvenience stores to buy the firearms they will use to rob and commit \nviolent crimes, to kill people. That includes our police officers, law \nenforcement people.\n  The American people support criminal background checks on all gun \nsales at gun shows. It has to be hard for people across the country to \nunderstand that you have to get a permit, you have to get a bill of \nsale, to buy a car, in many cases, to buy an appliance. Why in the \nworld would we not insist that people who are buying a gun identify \nthemselves in some way?\n  The support for identification is overwhelming. We saw it in an ABC \nnews poll. Ninety percent of the people said they want to close the gun \nshow loophole, the loophole that says unlicensed dealers, private \ndealers, can go ahead and sell guns to anybody who has the money. No \nneed to ask the question: What are you going to do with it? They ask if \nyou are 18. If you say you are 18, that takes care of it; then they \njust sell them.\n  If you are a member of the Ten Most Wanted list, the most wanted \ncriminals in the country, you can step up there and buy a gun. No one \nwill ask you a question.\n  What about the gun owners the NRA claims to represent? In a poll that \nwas conducted by the Center for Gun Policy and Research at Johns \nHopkins University, two-thirds--66 percent--of gun owners said they \nfavor background checks at gun show sales. Last year, the FBI issued a \nreport which noted that between November 30, 1998, and June 15, 1999--\nless than a year, 6 months--the FBI failed to block about 1,700 gun \nsales to prohibited purchasers--in other words, people unfit, unable to \nmeet basic standards--because it didn't have enough time to complete \nthe background check. The FBI had to allow the gun sales to go through.\n  Those transactions were completed because the FBI didn't have enough \ntime to complete the background check. So consequently, they had to \nissue gun retrieval notices and law enforcement had to try to track \ndown the criminals who got the guns.\n\n  So we must not permit weakening of our criminal background check \nsystem. We should strengthen it, a system that has stopped more than \n470,000 guns from being purchased in 6 years. Half a million people, \nalmost, who wanted to buy guns, who were unfit to buy those guns--\ncriminals, fugitives, other prohibited purchasers--tried to buy a gun \nand were stopped by Federal law from doing so. I think that is a good \nthing for people in our country to hear. It includes 33,000 spousal \nabusers who were denied a gun because of a domestic violence gun ban I \nwrote only 4 years ago.\n  The NRA makes another outrageous claim, that my gun show loophole \nclosing bill won't make any difference; in other words, if there are \nguns out there bought by unknown people, that it doesn't matter. They \nsay my legislation won't make it tougher for people to buy a gun to \ncommit a crime. That is also nonsense.\n  But don't take my word for it. Look at what Robyn Anderson told the \nColorado State Legislature recently. She is the woman who went with \nEric Harris and Dylan Klebold to the Tanner gun show in Adams County, \nCO. She said:\n\n       Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had gone to the Tanner gun \n     show on Saturday and they took me back with them on Sunday. . \n     . . While we were walking around, Eric and Dylan kept asking \n     sellers if they were private or licensed. They wanted to buy \n     their guns from someone who was private--and not licensed--\n     because there would be no paperwork or background check.\n\n  They needed Anderson's help because she was 18 and they were too \nyoung to buy guns. So Robyn Anderson bought 3 guns for them at the gun \nshow, 2 shotguns and a rifle--3 guns that Harris and Klebold would use \nto murder 13 young people at Columbine High School.\n  Here is what she said. You read it and you will understand it, I \nhope. She said:\n\n       It was too easy. I wish it had been more difficult. I \n     wouldn't have helped them buy the guns if I had faced a \n     background check.\n\n  How much clearer could it be? Closing the gun show loophole will make \na difference. I plead with all of my colleagues in this Chamber--I \ndon't understand how we can ignore the cries of our people--I plead \nwith them: Follow your conscience. Let's do the right thing. Whom are \nwe hurting if we say you have to identify yourself when you buy a \nweapon? We are not hurting anybody.\n  By not demanding it, we permit this kind of thing to take place, \nunidentified gun buyers. That ought to shock everybody in America. \nLet's do what the people of this country expect us to do. Ten months \nago, the Senate passed my amendment to close the gun show loophole. Now \nthat bill is being held hostage in a conference committee.\n  For those who are not aware of what it is, a conference committee is \na committee of the House and a committee of the Senate. They join \ntogether--it is called a conference committee--to iron out differences \nin legislation they want to see passed in both Houses.\n  Nothing has happened. The committee has met only one time, last year. \nThey have not debated the issues.\n\n[[Page S1378]]\n\nWe are asking: Please, let that legislation go free. Don't let the gun \nlobby prevail over the families across this country who want to stop \nthe gun violence.\n  Don't let the gun lobby rule what takes place in this Senate or in \nthe House of Representatives. We have to do it now, before April 20, \nbefore the anniversary of that terrible day at Columbine High School. \nNo one will forget it. No one who is alive and old enough to understand \nwhat took place will forget it. One year is time enough to act. April \n20.\n  People across this country are asking: What has Congress done? What \nwill they do? If one thinks they will be satisfied to hear that we have \ndone nothing at all, I urge them to think again. And I urge people \nwithin the range of my voice to listen to what some are saying--that \nCongress will do nothing about it, even though children die across this \ncountry and adults die across this country. Over 33,000 a year die from \ngunshot wounds. We wound 134,000. In Vietnam, we lost 58,000 over the \nwhole 10-year period that war was fought. But we lose 33,000 Americans \na year--young, old, black, white, Christian, Jewish, it doesn't matter.\n  So I plead with my colleagues, give our people a safer country. They \nare entitled to that. If we have an enemy outside our borders, we are \nprepared to fight that enemy. We have service personnel and airplanes \nwith the latest equipment. We try to provide our law enforcement \npeople--the police departments, FBI, drug enforcement agents, and \nborder patrol people--with the weapons to fight crime. But each year, \n33,000 people die from gunshots in this country. We ought not to permit \nthat. I plead with my colleagues to help our people. Let's try to move \nforward with gun safety legislation as quickly as we can when we return \nthe week after next.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business up to \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1378-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1378-S1379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FEDERAL DAIRY POLICY\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Recently, I came to the floor to address Federal dairy \npolicy, specifically focusing on an erroneous but often repeated claim \nthat dairy compacts are necessary today to guarantee a supply of fresh, \nlocally produced milk to consumers. During that time, I dealt with how \nthis is a myth similar to urban legends that are assumed to be true \nbecause they are repeated so often. Another dairy myth that you may \nhear a great deal is that dairy compacts preserve small dairy farms. \nMr. President, this is simply not true, and this afternoon I want to \npoint out the reasons why it is untrue.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact sets a floor price that processors must \npay for fluid milk in the region. Ostensibly, this is supposed to \nprovide small farmers with the additional income necessary to help them \nsurvive during hard times. In its practical effect, it doesn't work \nthat way at all. In fact, It has provided financial incentives for big \ndairy farms to get even bigger.\n  Consider the cases of Vermont and Pennsylvania. Vermont is in the \nNortheast Dairy Compact and Pennsylvania is not. Before the formation \nof the compact in 1997, Vermont had 2,100 dairy farms with an average \nherd size of 74 cows per farm. By 1998, the number of farms had fallen \nnearly 10 percent to 1900 dairy farms, but the average herd size had \nincreased to 85 cows per farm. That is a 15-percent increase.\n  Meanwhile, during the same period of time in Pennsylvania--again, \nwithout the compact--the number of dairy farms fell 3 percent, from \n11,300 to 10,900, but the average herd size increased only from 56 cows \nto 57 cows. Thus, in a compact State such as Vermont, the number of \ndairy farms fell significantly while the average herd size per farm \nincreased significantly. And then compare that to the noncompact State \nof Pennsylvania during the same period. Their number of dairy farms \ndropped by a smaller number, and farm herd sizes increased by an even \nsmaller percentage. So this does not appear in any way to be a compact \nto protect small dairy farms.\n\n  The extra income that the compact provides to large farms accelerates \ntheir domination of the industry by helping them get larger and \nstronger. Since the amount of compact premium a producer receives is \nbased entirely on the volume of production, the small amount of \nadditional income a small farmer receives is often inconsequential and \ndoes nothing to keep small farms from exiting the industry. In fact, \nduring the first year of the compact, dairy farms in New England \ndeclined at a 25 percent faster rate than the average rate of decline \nduring the previous 2-year period.\n  The assertion that dairy compacts do not protect small farmers is not \njust something that this Minnesota Senator claims but compact \nsupporters themselves have acknowledged as much. In the latter part of \n1998, the Massachusetts commissioner of agriculture declared that the \ncompact, after 16 months, had not protected small dairy farms. The \ncommissioner consequently proposed a new method for distributing the \ncompact premium to class I milk, capping the amount of premium any one \ndairy farm could receive and redistributing the surplus. Farms of \naverage size or smaller would have seen their incomes increase by as \nmuch as 80 percent. However, large farm dairy interests were \npredictably able to kill this proposal because the assistance to small \ndairy farmers would have come, of course, out of their pockets. So \nwhile compact supporters perpetuate a sentimental picture of compacts \nenabling small family farmers to continue to work the land, the bottom \nline is that compacts hasten the demise of the small farmer while \nenriching the bigger producers.\n  This claim that compacts save small dairy operations is often made in \nconjunction with the claim that compacts are being unfairly opposed by \nlarge-scale Midwest dairy farms that want to dominate the market. Well, \nthis, too, is untrue because the average herd size for a Vermont dairy \nfarm is 85 cows per herd, while the average herd size for a Minnesota \ndairy farm is only 57 head. Thus, Vermont dairy farms average in size \nalmost 50 percent larger than Minnesota dairy farms.\n  Similarly, the South, which has also sought to have its own compact, \nalso has larger farms than the Midwest. The average herd size of a \nFlorida dairy farm is 246 head. That is almost four times larger than \nthe upper-Midwest average. Incidentally, Minnesota producers would love \nto be getting the mailbox price that farmers in Florida and the \nNortheast are getting.\n  In November of last year, the mailbox price--which is the actual \nprice farmers receive for their milk--in the upper-Midwest was $12.09 \nper hundredweight. In the Northeast, it was $15.02. And in Florida, due \nto the milk marketing order system, it was $18.72 per hundredweight. So \nin the Midwest it was $12; in the Northeast it was $15--that is $3 per \nhundredweight more--and again, in Florida, it was $18.72, or nearly $7 \na hundredweight more, or 50 percent more for milk produced in Florida \nthan in Minnesota. How are you going to compete against this type of \nunfairness in the compact system and in the milk marketing orders?\n  So the Northeast price is 24 percent higher than Minnesota's, and \nFlorida's price is almost 55 percent higher. Again, Minnesota farmers \nwould love to get those kinds of mailbox prices, but our Government \nprogram--and again, the larger farmers in these areas unfairly benefit \nfrom this program--ensures that they don't and that these other regions \ndo.\n  While dairy compacts are again not saving small dairy farms in \ncompact States, they are impacting the bottom line of small-scale \nproducers in non-compact States; in other words, those dairy farmers \noutside the compact. Compacts are a zero-sum game that shifts producer \nmarkets and income from one region of the country to competing regions. \nThey don't have small family farms, and they certainly don't deserve \nthe continuing sanction and the support of the Congress.\n  Again, there are other dairy myths that must be exposed, and the \ntruth must be told. I will be back on the floor soon to take another \nlook at a misleading claim, try to dissect it a little bit, and put \nsome fairness into what we often hear in the dairy debates.\n  If we look at this system and why it is unfair, again to look at the \nprices farmers receive for the milk they produce, why is it fair that \nif you are in the Midwest, you get $12.60 or $12.70\n\n[[Page S1379]]\n\nper hundredweight, but if you are in New England in the compact States, \nyou get $15.20, and if you are a farmer in Florida, that somehow you \ncan receive $18.72 per hundredweight? I don't know. We don't sell \ncomputers that way. We don't sell oranges that way. We don't sell \nautomobiles that way. Why is it milk is different? Why is the \nGovernment picking winners and losers among those who are in the dairy \nindustry?\n  If you are in the Midwest, the Government says, well, you are going \nto be a loser, and if you are in Florida or in the compact States, our \nGovernment programs say you are going to get more so you can be a \nwinner. I don't think we should have this type of competition and \nunfair playing field with the Government picking dairy winners and \nlosers.\n  I hope we bring some sanity into our dairy program. I will be back on \nthe floor to take on another misleading claim we often hear in these \ndairy debates.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think I understand more than many the \nanger many Americans feel when they see gasoline pump prices at $1.80 a \ngallon or higher. But I also think it is unfortunate that the Clinton-\nGore administration has, for 8 years, kind of lulled Americans into \nbelieving that an unlimited supply of relatively cheap gasoline will be \navailable from our so-called friends in OPEC.\n  As a consequence of that false sense of security, America's soccer \nmoms, with the idea of running the kids here and there, have gone out \nand spent tens of millions of dollars on sport utility vehicles that \nbarely get 15 miles a gallon. With today's gas prices, they find when \nthey fill up one of those SUVs that it can put a big hole in a $100 \nbill. It will cost $70 or $80. It is almost certain that gasoline will \nhit $2 a gallon this summer because our refineries are not refining \ngasoline because they are still refining heating oil. Since they have \nnot shut down for the conversion, we won't have on hand the reserves \nnecessary to meet the requirements for the families in this country who \nare used to driving long distances in the summertime. It is going to \nhappen. We are going to get $2-a-gallon gasoline.\n  Americans I don't think should blame OPEC when the fault lies clearly \nwith the Clinton-Gore administration and their energy policy, which is \nreally no policy. They have no policy on coal, they have no policy on \noil, and they have no policy on hydro other than it is nonrenewable, \nand they have no policy on natural gas. They say that is the savior. \nBut they won't open up public land for oil and gas exploration, \nparticularly in the upper belt of the Rocky Mountains, my State of \nAlaska, and the OCS areas.\n  What they propose is to put the Secretary of Energy on an airplane \nand send him over to Saudi Arabia with his hand out begging the Saudis \nto produce more oil. They made that trip; they made that request. And \nthe Saudis said: We have a meeting of OPEC March 27. He said: No, you \ndon't understand. There is an emergency in the United States. We need \nyou to produce more oil. They said: You don't understand, Mr. \nSecretary. Our meeting is March 27.\n  That is hardly an adequate response to a nation that went over there \nand fought a war so that Saddam Hussein could not take over Kuwait. \nThat war was about oil.\n  We sought relief from the non-OPEC nations of Mexico and Venezuela. \nThe Mexicans said: Well, isn't it rather ironic, when oil was $11, 12, \nand $13 a barrel and the Mexican economy was in the tank and in \nshambles, where were the Americans? Was the administration trying to \nhelp us out? We weren't there. So we got stiffed. We got poked in the \neye.\n  Now we see oil fluctuating from $34 a barrel a couple of days ago. It \ndropped $3. It went up again today.\n  The point is, we are dependent on imports and we are increasing that \ndependence.\n  Since the very first day this administration took office in 1993, \nthey declared war on domestic energy producers.\n  The first proposal they sent to the Congress--this is very important, \nbecause some of you do not have a memory of 1993. But the Clinton \nadministration proposed to the Congress a new $70 billion tax on fossil \nfuel produced in this country. That was a tax they planned with \ninflation indexing so that it would go up every single year. On top of \nthat, they tried to add $8 billion in new motor fuel taxes and $1 \nbillion in taxes on barge fuel.\n  Do you remember that, Mr. President? This Senator from Alaska does. A \nlot of folks in the administration would like us to forget that. I hope \nwe will not forget that.\n  The Democratically-controlled Congress delivered to President Clinton \n$42 billion in new motor vehicle taxes in the form of a 30-percent gas \ntax increase. The Democratically-controlled Congress delivered to \nPresident Clinton $42 billion in new motor fuel taxes in the form of a \n30-percent gas tax increase, and not a single Republican voted for that \ngas tax hike. We were joined by six Democrats, which resulted in what? \nA 50-50 tie vote. But the $42 billion gas tax hike became reality for \nevery single American because the Vice President, Al Gore, cast the \ntie-breaking vote in favor of this tax hike.\n  That is a fact, and the Record will so note.\n  It will be interesting to hear his explanation. We heard an \nexplanation not so long ago that, if elected, he would cancel the OCS \nleases. Where does he propose to get energy from, the tooth fairy?\n  I believe today, when gasoline is selling for more than $2 a gallon \nin some parts of the country, we should suspend the 30-percent Clinton/\nGore tax increase. That is the least we can do to help the American \nmotorist. We can make sure the highway trust fund is reimbursed for any \nlost revenue so we can ensure that all highway construction that is \nauthorized will be constructed and that we don't jeopardize that.\n  I believe it is appropriate for this payback to the trust fund \nbecause the Clinton/Gore gas tax was not used for highway construction. \nIt was used for government spending until Republicans took over \nCongress and authorized the tax to be restored for highway \nconstruction.\n  That is a short-term fix, but I think a realistic and achievable one.\n  Mr. President, barely a month ago, when heating oil prices were at \ntheir peak, what did the President propose? another $2.5 billion tax \nincrease on the oil industry. Let me assure everyone in this chamber \nthat those proposals are dead on arrival, as they should be.\n  It is not just higher energy taxes that the President demands. What \nhas he done on the supply side? In a word, nothing. This administration \nhas done nothing to open federal lands for exploration and development \nof oil and gas.\n  We should develop the overthrust belt of the Rocky Mountains and some \nof the OCS areas. The administration refuses to budge on the most \npromising oil field in America, ANWR. It is simply off limits. And they \ndemand moratoriums on offshore, and on and on.\n  There is the story. Petroleum demands go up, and crude production \ngoes down. That is where we are. It is as simple at that.\n  Mr. President, some people say that the administration does not have \nan energy policy. I would disagree with that statement. The Clinton-\nGore administration does have an energy policy. It's goal is simply to \nstop energy production in the United States and make this country \ncompletely dependent on foreign oil. When Bill Clinton took office, we \nimported 43 percent of our oil. Today, foreign oil accounts for 56 \npercent of domestic consumption.\n  This isn't going to come as a surprise to the Department of Energy. \nThe Department of Energy says the U.S. will be 65 percent in the year \n2020--somewhere between 2010, 2015, and 2020.\n  That seems to be the goal of this administration rather than trying \nto do something about it.\n\n[[Page S1380]]\n\n  And the predictable result of this irrational policy: We send the \nSecretary of Energy with hat in hand begging OPEC to raise production. \nThe Sheiks in the Middle East must be laughing all the way to the bank \nas they contemplate how this administration has turned America into a \ndependent of OPEC.\n  They must view with mild amusement the irrational pie-in-the sky \npolicies that this administration has tried to sell to the American \npeople. Would this administration support building more nuclear \nfacilities to reduce our dependence on OPEC? NO!\n  Would they support building new non-polluting hydro-electric \nfacilities to reduce our dependence on OPEC? No. In fact, in what must \nbe one of the most naive proposals from this Administration, they have \nbeen proposing tearing down dams that have been providing power for \ndecades. Tearing down dams at a time when we are 56 percent dependent \non imported oil is simply unconscionable. How would we replace this \nlost source of power? Does the administration support building more \ncoal fired power plants? No. So how do President Clinton and Vice \nPresident Gore propose that we generate energy to run our industry and \nfuel our transportation system? Year in and year out what we hear from \nthis administration is one word: Renewables--solar, wind, and \ngeothermal.\n  I know the Administration is always emphasizing renewable energy as \nthe best option. They are all important, but they constitute less than \n4 percent of U.S. energy production and for the foreseeable future are \nnot going to make a dent in our energy production.\n  I hope someday renewables will play a bigger role. We have to face \nreality. In 25 years, if there are technological breakthroughs, they \nmay play a more important role, but today they have almost no role.\n  Face it: Today there are no solar airplanes; there are no \neconomically feasible solar automobiles; there are no wind-powered, \nsolar-powered trains. it gets dark in Alaska in the winter. None of \nthese concepts is on the drawing board. The fact that the \nadministration does not want to face up to this is evident up to now \nand in the foreseeable future.\n  This administration hopes they can get out of town before the crisis \nhits, the calamity of the American public asking: What have you done? \nYou sold our energy security to the Saudis and some of the other Third \nWorld nations.\n  For 8 years, this administration has been blind to the facts and \nlived in a renewable dream world. Today, the American consumer is \npaying the price for the failed energy policies of the Clinton-Gore \nadministration.\n  Today's gas prices may wake us up and call the country to the \nrecognition that we have to begin to address, with long-term solutions, \nour energy security issues. If we don't do that, we may look back on \nMarch 2000 as the good old days when gasoline was only $1.70 a gallon. \nAs we propose taking off this 4.3 percent, I look forward to the \nadministration's response as to how the Vice President broke that tie. \nHe and the administration are responsible for the tax costing the \nAmerican consumer $43 billion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1380-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1380-S1381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PARDON ATTORNEY REFORM AND INTEGRITY ACT\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, a few weeks ago Senator Hatch, Senator \nNickles, and I, along with other Senators, introduced S. 2042, the \nPardon Attorney Reform and Integrity Act. The Judiciary Committee has \nnow reported this legislation to the floor. I wanted to say just a few \nwords about why I believe this legislation is needed and why I hope the \nSenate will act quickly.\n  Last September, President Clinton decided to grant clemency to 11 \nmembers of the Puerto Rican terrorist groups FALN and Los Macheteros. \nWhen this decision became known, it was greeted with virtually \nuniversal shock and disbelief, followed by calls for the President to \nreconsider and ultimately by near universal condemnation. The FALN had \nbeen involved in numerous terrorist acts. The most heinous of these \nacts was the bombing of Fraunces Tavern in New York City. In the middle \nof the lunch time rush at this Wall Street tavern, FALN members planted \na bomb. The explosion killed four people and left 55 people wounded. In \naddition, FALN has taken credit for more than 130 bombings, attempted \nbombings, bomb threats and kidnapings. They took credit for the bombing \nof office buildings in New York and Chicago where at least one other \nperson was killed and several more injured.\n  Although it has been suggested that the individuals the President \npardoned were not convicted of direct involvement in these acts, the \nconduct that they were convicted of made clear that they all played \nimportant roles in facilitating the activities of the organization, \nfully aware that the entity in question engaged in just this kind of \nconduct. Despite this, there is no evidence that any of them are \nseriously remorseful about their serious wrongdoing. Singling them out \nfor the extraordinary favor of Presidential clemency is, under these \ncircumstances, frankly inexplicable.\n  Both this body and the House of Representatives passed resolutions \nstating our disapproval of the President's action. Following these \nevents, the Committee on the Judiciary held two hearings on how the \nPresident had made his decision. In the first of these hearings, it was \ndiscovered that Reverend Ikuta, a supporter of clemency for the \nterrorists, had several meetings with the Department of Justice \nconcerning the potential grant of clemency. At the same time, law \nenforcement officials, who attempted to contact the President and the \nDepartment of Justice concerning the clemency, received no response \nfrom the administration. Nor were the victims consulted in any way. The \nson of one of the victims of the Fraunces Tavern bombing was told in \n1998 by the FBI that they were still searching for the FALN member \nthought to have planted the bomb. Meanwhile, the President was \nconsidering granting clemency to individuals who not only were members \nof the group responsible for the bomb in the first place, but also who \nmay have had information about the whereabouts of this primary suspect. \nThe victims of the terrorists' acts were never even informed of the \nPresident's grant of clemency. They had to read it in the newspaper. \nPerhaps the gravest oversight of all is that the terrorists were never \nasked to provide any information about other FALN members who are still \non the FBI most wanted list.\n  The goal of this bill is to try to do what Congress can to prevent \nthis situation from recurring. The bill would require the Department of \nJustice, if asked to investigate a pardon request, to make all \nreasonable efforts to inform the victims that a pardon request is being \nreviewed and give the victims an opportunity to present their views. \nThe Department is also required to notify the victims of a decision to \ngrant clemency as soon as practical after it is made and, if it will \nresult in the release of someone, before release of that person if \npracticable. The bill also requires that the Department of Justice make \nall reasonable efforts to determine the views of law enforcement on \nwhether the person has accepted responsibility for his or her actions \nand whether the person is a danger to any person or society. Finally \nthe Department must determine from federal, state and local law \nenforcement whether the person may have information relevant to any \nongoing investigation, prosecution, or effort to apprehend a fugitive, \nand to determine the effect of a grant of clemency on the threat of \nterrorism or future criminal activity.\n\n  Opponents of this bill argue that it is an unconstitutional \ninfringement on the Presidential pardon power. This is not so. This \nbill dictates a process to be used when the President delegates \ninvestigatory power to the Department of Justice. Accordingly, this \nbill is not a usurpation of the President's pardon power, but within \nthe legitimate exercise of Congress's power, in establishing the \nDepartment of Justice, to ``make all laws which are necessary and \nproper for carrying into Execution'' not only the powers vested in \nCongress but also ``all other powers vested by this Constitution in the \nGovernment of the United States, or in any Department or Officer \nthereof.'' The President's own freedom to exercise the pardon power \nhowever he sees fit is in no way infringed by this bill. In fact, this \nbill only acts to ensure that the President has the information before\n\n[[Page S1381]]\n\nhim to make a well rounded and informed decision. The President can \nignore the information provided by the victims and the law enforcement \nofficers if he chooses to do so. I would hope that he would not. But \nwhile requirements that would force him to give particular weight to \ntheir views would most likely be unconstitutional, requiring the \nDepartment to make this information available to him, for whatever use \nhe chooses to make of it, surely is not. Indeed, the President and the \nDepartment of Justice should be supportive of this bill as it should \nhelp return to the American people confidence in the clemency process \nthat may have been lost following the release of the FALN and Los \nMacheteros terrorists.\n  It is unconscionable that in this instance, the views of the victims \nand law enforcement officers, the parties most affected by both the \ncriminal act and the clemency, were ignored in the decision making \nprocess. This bill goes a long way in helping to prevent a recurrence \nof the defects in process in President Clinton's grant of clemency last \nSeptember to the 11 terrorists. It will enhance the quality of \ninformation available so as to ensure a more balanced basis for the \nPresident's decisions regarding clemency. I am, therefore, pleased the \ncommittee has reported this legislation to the floor of the Senate, and \nI urge its prompt enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1381-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ACTS OF BRUTALITY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the second time in one week, I come to \nthe floor of the Senate to bring attention to an atrocious and \ndespicable act of brutality against innocent men, women, and children.\n  Just 8 days ago, the Government of Sudan bombed nine towns, hospitals \nand feeding centers in the areas of the vast country outside of their \ncontrol. As I said a week ago, they did not hit key rebel facilities or \nstrongholds. However, they did bomb the town of Lui and the only \nrudimentary hospital and a TB clinic for a hundred mile radius.\n  They killed, maimed, and injured dozens of innocent and infirmed \ncivilians.\n  As I said last week, I know this ``target'' well. It is the very \nhospital where I served as a volunteer surgeon and medical missionary \njust two years ago.\n  One of the worst aspects of the bombings is that the Government of \nSudan knew exactly what these targets were. There was no mistaking it. \nRebel forces had even caught government army agents attempting to mine \nthe airstrip earlier in the year.\n  Last Sunday, 4 days after the bombing, the old Soviet cargo planes, \nwhich have been converted into bombers, returned. They dropped no \nbombs, but inspected the damage of the earlier raid and, we suspect, \ncontinued selecting targets.\n  On Tuesday morning, just past 10 a.m. local time, the bomber \nreturned. It dropped 15 more bombs on the Samaritan's Purse hospital it \ntargeted last week.\n  The sad part of the story is that it is not surprising. For years the \nGovernment of Sudan has targeted the relief facilities of organizations \nit deems friendly toward the rebels. That is, those who operate \nexclusively in areas outside of government control or those who \ncriticize the regime in Khartoum.\n  In the town of Yei, the hospital has been bombed so many times, \nbombings of the facility no longer necessary even makes it to wire \nreports.\n  On February 8 of this year, one of those routine bombings of civilian \ntargets was especially horrific, when school children in the Nuba \nMountains region--an isolated area especially devastated by government \nbombings and offensive--were killed as they took their lessons under a \ntree. At least a dozen students and two adults were killed by \nantipersonnel bombs pushed out the cargo doors of the converted cargo \nplanes. These were schoolchildren. They were not rebels nor child \nsoldiers, but children learning to read.\n  In that case, we have good reason to believe that the strike was \nretribution for the local Roman Catholic Bishop, who has been charged \nwith treason for coming to the United States in an effort to publicize \nthe atrocities of his government against its own people. It was a \nschool run by his church and a location that he was known to frequent.\n  In general, the United States policy is pointed in the right \ndirection with respect to Sudan: its primary focus is on ending the war \nthrough multilateral negotiations, and on aiding the areas of greatest \nfood insecurity.\n  But the United States policy is not without serious flaws, the \ngreatest of which is failing to use our full diplomatic and economic \nweight to change the political environment where the Government of \nSudan can repeatedly and intentionally bomb civilian targets, including \nschools and hospitals, and not face a single substantial objection from \nany member of the United Nations Security Council--nor any member of \nthe United Nations.\n  That includes the United States. We do not sufficiently use the \ninternational body to promote peace to even raise objections about the \nmurder of innocent civilians.\n  This failure of the international community to forcefully act or to \nraise even routine objections in international fora in an effort to \nstop the most brutal and devastating war since the Second World War is \nas inexplicable as it is tragic.\n  It is also hypocritical when compared to any number of United Nations \nsponsored peace missions.\n  Why is the United Nations so unwilling or unable to act? Because it \nlacks the necessary leadership among its members. It lacks the type \npublic exposure to the truth of the horrors in Sudan to cause \nsufficient shame and embarrassment to change inaction into action.\n  The United Nations and its members do not suffer from a lack of \ninformation about the war I have described as lurking on the edge of \nthe world's conscience. The United Nations own Special Rapporteur for \nSudan has submitted an extensive report detailing the atrocities and \nsome common sense recommendations for the body to act upon. But nothing \nhas happened.\n  It is behind this veil of obscurity that some of our closest allies' \ninaction has somehow instead become the United States ``isolation'' on \nthe issue. It is behind this veil of obscurity and sense of this being \nan esoteric American issue that inaction has hidden and thrived.\n  That failure, that veil of obscurity, is the greatest tragedy of them \nall. The United Nations was formed to stop or prevent injustice such as \nwhat is happening in Sudan. But it has instead become a vehicle for \nobfuscation of responsibility. it has become the chosen forum for \ndenial and the Sudanese government's charm offensive: a concerted and \neffective public relations effort which portrays them as simply \n``misunderstood'' and the victim of undeserved American vilification.\n  The United Nations should be the forum to pull the war in Sudan from \nthe edge of the world's consciousness, to the center of the world's \nattention. To fail to take every reasonable opportunity to use the \nUnited Nations to generate the necessary embarrassment and shame to \ndrive our complicity and compel nations to act to end the war would be \nthe greatest failure of our policy and a tragic loss of potential for \ngood. It is our failure to fully use the United Nations as an effective \ninstrument to end the war in Sudan which must become a major focus of \nthe United States policy.\n  If the United Nations is not used as a forum for resolution of a \nconflict like this, and if we are not willing to assert American \nleadership within that forum, the unavoidable question becomes what, \nthen, is the purpose of United Nations and our membership therein?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1381-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1381-S1382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST \n                                 WOMEN\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, nearly two decades ago, President Carter \nsubmitted to the Senate the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms \nof Discrimination Against Women, known in shorthand as the ``Womens' \nConvention.''\n  In the two decades since then, the Committee on Foreign Relations has \nacted on the Convention only once. In 1994, the Committee voted to \nreport the treaty by a strong majority of 13 to 5. Unfortunately, the \n103rd Congress ended before the full Senate could act on the \nConvention.\n\n[[Page S1382]]\n\n  Since then, not one hearing has been held in the Committee on Foreign \nRelations. Not one.\n  It is a great mystery to me that a treaty that calls for the \ninternational promotion of civil and human rights for women would not \nbe considered by the Senate.\n  Over 160 nations have become party to this treaty, which entered into \nforce in 1981. To its great discredit, the United States stands outside \nthis treaty with a just handful of other nations.\n  There is hardly anything revolutionary about this treaty. It contains \na specific set of obligations calling on member states to enact legal \nprohibitions on discrimination against women--prohibitions which, in \nlarge part, the United States has already enacted.\n  In fact, if the United States becomes a party to the treaty, we would \nnot need to make any changes to U.S. law in order to comply with the \ntreaty.\n  So what are the opponents of this treaty supposedly concerned about?\n  In 1994, the five Senators who voted against the Convention in the \nCommittee filed ``minority views.'' In it they expressed two concerns.\n  First, the dissenting Senators expressed concern that, in ratifying \nthe Convention, several nations had taken reservations to the treaty, \nand thereby ``cheapened the coin'' of the treaty and the human rights \nnorms that it embodies.\n  To this objection there are two answers. First, no treaty signed by \ndozens of nations will ever be perfect. It will be the product of \nnumerous compromises, some of which will not always be acceptable.\n  That's why the Senate thinks it so important that we retain the \nright, whenever possible, to offer reservations to treaties--to attempt \nto remedy, or if necessary, opt-out, of any bad deals agreed to by our \nnegotiators.\n  Second, this Senate has frequently entered reservations in ratifying \nhuman rights treaties in the 1980s and 1990s--such as the Convention on \nTorture, the Convention on Racial Discrimination, and the International \nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n  In unanimously approving each of these treaties, the Senate imposed \nnumerous reservations and understandings on U.S. ratification. In \napproving the Race Convention, for example, the Senate added three \nreservations, one understanding, and one condition.\n  Did we ``cheapen the coin'' of the Race Convention in doing so? The \nanswer is no, because in entering these reservations we did not \nundermine the central purpose of the treaty--to require nations to \noutlaw racial discrimination.\n  The second objection registered by the five senators who voted \nagainst the Convention in 1994 is that joining the treaty was not the \n``best use'' of our government's ``energies'' in promoting the human \nrights of women around the world.\n  This is a rather remarkable objection. What this group of senators \nwas saying, in short, is that we should reserve our resources--and only \npromote human rights for women at certain times and in certain places.\n  I would hope that every senator would agree that we should promote \nequal rights for women at every opportunity--not when it suits us or \nwhen where it is the ``best use'' of our ``energies.'' Advancing human \nrights and human liberty--for women and for everyone else--is a never-\nending struggle.\n  Of course, the United States has a powerful voice, and we do not need \nto be a party to this Convention in order to speak out on womens' \nrights. But we should join this Convention so we can be heard within \nthe councils of the treaty.\n  Now the Senator from California stepped forward with a simple \nresolution which calls on the Senate to have hearings on the treaty, \nand for the Senate to act on the Convention by March 8, International \nWomens' Day.\n  Unfortunately, the effort to call up this resolution yesterday was \nobjected to. So we are here on the floor today simply to try to raise \nthe profile of this treaty.

Mr. President, there is a lot of information swirling \nabout concerning the Middle East Peace Process, specifically the so \ncalled ``Syrian track.'' Facts and figures are being bandied about \nfreely and there is little to indicate which are fact and which are \nfiction. Therefore I rise today to lay down a marker for the coming \nyear and to express the hope that the administration will consult with \nCongress on a continual basis as this process picks up again.\n  Last year, Congress and the American people were presented with a \nbill for the Middle East peace process that was in excess of $1 \nbillion--that is $1 billion more than the $5 billion plus we already \nspend in the Middle East. And this extra bill was compiled without any \ncongressional input. It was approved, but this is no way to do \nbusiness.\n  The peace process is ongoing, but the President and the Department of \nState should consider themselves on notice from this moment on: This \nCongress will not rubber stamp another Wye Plantation Accord, we will \nnot cough up another check without consultation and due consideration; \nwe will not be left out of our Constitutionally assigned role.\n  I am a strong believer in the Middle East peace process. The \nGovernments of Egypt, Jordan and Israel have shown enormous character \nand courage in making peace, and they deserve our support. The nations \nof Egypt and Jordan, like Israel, need economic and military security \nin a bad neighborhood. They have made real sacrifices to do the right \nthing, and they have the backing of the United States.\n  However, ultimately, peace is not something that can be bought. Both \nIsrael and its Arab partners, be they the Palestinians, the Lebanese or \nthe Syrians, must make peace on their own terms without regard to \nsweeteners or inducements from the United States. The US has always \nplayed a historical role in promoting peace, but ultimately, peace only \nworks when it is in the interests of the parties directly involved. \nShould we help? I believe we can. Should that help be the sole basis of \nan agreement? Unreservedly, no.\n  All of us who follow foreign policy issues are well aware that in \nthis, the last year of the Clinton Administration, the President would \nlike to preside over an historic peace between Israel and its remaining \nenemies in the Arab world. Perhaps we shouldn't blame President Clinton \ntoo much for yearning for a place in the history books. But President \nClinton and his entire foreign policy team need to remember a few \nimportant points: 1: Congress has the power of the purse; 2: We are not \nthe Syrian parliament: We will not rubber stamp any agreement with any \nprice tag; 3: Notwithstanding rumors to the contrary, we are interested \nand wish to be kept apprised of important developments in American \ndiplomacy. In other words, Mr. President, come and talk to us. Keep us \nin the loop.\n  I have read in the newspapers that Israel is looking at the security \nimplications of returning the Golan Heights and is also considering \nrequesting a security package from the United States which will be very \ncostly. There are ongoing discussions between Israel and the Defense \nDepartment on this matter. But Congress has not been briefed. Syria \ntoo, has visions of sugar plum fairies dancing into Damascus with \nbillions in aid; and I am sure the Lebanese will not be too far behind.\n  There will be many reasons to support a peace in the Middle East, but \nmuch will depend upon exactly what commitments will be expected of the \nUnited States. The President must not again make the mistake of signing \nIOUs which, this time, the Congress may have no intention of covering. \nWe are willing partners in peace, but we will not accept the \npresentation of another fait accompli. Mr. President, we look forward \nto hearing from you--often.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1382-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1382-S1383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I rise in recognition of Women's \nHistory Month--a time to honor the many great women leaders from our \npast and present who have served our Nation so well. These women have \nworked diligently to achieve social\n\n[[Page S1383]]\n\nchange and personal triumph often against incredible odds. As \nscientists, writers, doctors, teachers, and mothers, they have shaped \nour world and guided us down the road to prosperity and peace. For far \ntoo long, however, their contributions to the strength and character of \nour society went unrecognized and undervalued.\n  It is also important to recognize the countless American women whose \nnames and great works are known only to their families. They too have \nplayed critical roles in the development of our State and National \nheritage.\n  Women have led efforts to secure not only their own rights, but have \nalso been the guiding force behind many of the other major social \nmovements of our time--the abolitionist movement, the industrial labor \nmovement, and the civil rights movement, to name a few. We also have \nwomen to thank for the establishment of many of our early charitable, \nphilanthropic, and cultural institutions.\n  I am proud of the many women from Maryland whose bravery, hard work, \nand dedication have earned them a place in our Nation's history. They \ninclude Margaret Brent, America's first woman lawyer and landholder. In \n1648, she went before the Maryland General Assembly demanding the right \nto vote. Another brave Maryland woman was Harriet Tubman, hero of the \nUnderground Railroad, who was personally responsible for freeing over \n300 slaves. Dr. Helen Taussig, another great Marylander, in 1945, \ndeveloped the first successful medical procedure to save ``blue \nbabies'' by repairing heart birth defects in children whose blood was \nstarved of oxygen, turning their skin a bluish hue. This breakthrough \nlaid the foundation for modern heart surgery.\n  I would also like to recognize my colleague, another great Maryland \nwoman, Senator Barbara A. Mikulski. One of only nine female Members of \nthe Senate, she has forged a path for women legislators into the \nFederal political arena and has tirelessly fought for recognition of \nthe right of women to equal treatment and opportunities in our society. \nThrough her leadership, the effort to designate March as Women's \nHistory Month has been a resounding success.\n  Other Maryland women leaders include Dr. Lillie Jackson and Enolia \nMcMillan, two great champions of the Civil Rights Movement, and \nHenrietta Szold, the founder of Hadassah, the Women's Zionist \nOrganization of America. Hattie Alexander, a native of Baltimore, was a \nmicrobiologist and pediatrician who won international recognition for \nderiving a serum to combat influenzal meningitis. Rachel Carson, \nfounder of the environmental movement, Billie Holiday, the renowned \njazz singer, and Elizabeth Seton, the first American canonized as a \nsaint were also all from Maryland. The achievements and dedication of \nthese women are a source of inspiration to us all.\n\n  Now more than ever, women are a guiding force in Maryland and a major \npresence in our business sector. As of 1996, there were over 167,000 \nwomen-owned businesses in our State--that amounts to 39 percent of all \nfirms in Maryland. Maryland's women-owned businesses employ over \n301,000 people and generate over $39 billion in sales. Between 1987 and \n1996, the number of women-owned firms in Maryland is estimated to have \nincreased by 88 percent.\n  During Women's History month we have the opportunity to remember and \npraise great women leaders who have opened doors for today's young \nwomen in ways that are often overlooked. Their legacy has enriched our \nlives and deserves prominence in the annals of American history.\n  With this in mind, I have co-sponsored legislation again this \nCongress to establish a National Museum of Women's History Advisory \nCommittee. This Committee would be charged with identifying a site for \nthe National Museum of Women's History and developing strategies for \nraising private funding for the development and maintenance of the \nmuseum. Ultimately, the museum will enlighten the young and old about \nthe key roles women have played in our Nation's history and the many \ncontributions they have made to our culture.\n  However, we must do more than merely recognize the outstanding \naccomplishments women have made. Women's History Month also is a time \nto recognize that women still face substantial obstacles and \ninequities. At every age, women are more likely than their male \ncontemporaries to be poor. A working woman still earns on average only \n74 cents for every dollar earned by a man. A female physician only \nearns about 58 cents to her male counterpart's dollar, and female \nbusiness executives earn about 65 cents for every dollar paid to a male \nexecutive. The average personal income of men over 65 is nearly double \nthat of their female peers. Access to capital for female entrepreneurs \nis still a significant stumbling block, and women business owners of \ncolor are even less likely than white women entrepreneurs to have \nfinancial backing from a bank.\n  To address some of these discrepancies, I have co-sponsored the \nPaycheck Fairness Act which would provide more effective remedies to \nvictims of wage discrimination on the basis of sex. It would enhance \nenforcement of the existing Equal Pay Act and protect employees who \ndiscuss wages with co-workers from employer retaliation.\n  On the other hand, we have made great strides toward ensuring a \nfairer place for women in our society. The college-educated proportion \nof women, although still smaller than the comparable proportion of men, \nhas been increasing rapidly. In 1995, women represented 55 percent of \nthe people awarded bachelor's degrees, 55 percent of people awarded \nmasters', 39 percent of the doctorates, 39 percent of the M.D.'s, and \n43 percent of the law degrees. As recently as the early 1970s, the \nrespective percentages were 43 percent, 40 percent, 14 percent, 8 \npercent, and 5 percent. Women are now the majority in some professional \nand managerial occupations that were largely male until relatively \nrecently.\n  The future does not look so bright for women in many other countries \nwhere women not only lack access to equal opportunities, but even worse \nare subject to dehumanizing social practices and abominable human \nrights violations. For this reason, I have added my name to a \nresolution calling on the Senate to act on the Convention on the \nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.\n  Mr. President, in the dawn of this new millennium, we must renew our \nefforts to ensure that gender no longer predetermines a person's \nopportunities or station in life. It is my hope that we can accelerate \nour progress in securing women's rights. As we celebrate Women's \nHistory Month, let us reaffirm our commitment to the women of this \nNation and to insuring full equality for all of our citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1383-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1383-S1384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            A PARENT'S PLEA\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a week ago, Veronica McQueen didn't have \nthe slightest idea she would be the latest parent thrust into a tragic \nspotlight. Now, the mother of Kayla Rolland, the six-year-old girl who \nwas shot and killed in Mount Morris Township, Michigan, is very much \nthe focus of public attention and empathy.\n  Kayla's mother and parents across the country are heartsick. Parents \ntoo often fear sending their children to school in the morning. They \nare joining the fight against gun violence and demanding that Congress \nmake this country safer for their own children and the nation's \nchildren. As Kayla's mother said, ``I just don't want to see another \nparent have to bury another baby over this, over something that is \npreventable, something that is very, very preventable.''\n  I would like to share some of the thoughts and feelings of mothers \nacross the country. They have written to the Million Mom March, an \norganization fighting for commonsense gun legislation, asking Congress \nto listen to their pleas for safety. I urge Congress to stop listening \nto the NRA and heed the words of parents: pass legislation before more \nchildren's voices are silenced by gunshots.\n  Victoria of Pittsburgh, PA writes: ``It is 4 a.m. and my daughter had \nthat terrifying dream again--the one about the man with the gun--`he'd \nalready shot you and Dad, Mom--and now he's coming for me.' Was my \ndaughter affected by Columbine? I was!''\n  Cindy of Bridgewater, NJ: ``Our children look to their parents for \nprotection. What are we suppose to tell them when we can't?

We are still in shock, \nand as a family of law enforcers, we are doubly affected by this event \n. . .

Someone \nthought he was someone else and walked up to him and ended his life his \ndreams his families dreams for him in an instant. He is gone and the \nworld is a sadder place because of that loss. We have to stop this \nsenseless killing the loss of our children. Our best chance of making \nWashington listen to us is if our voices are one. I will be with those \nwho march in Washington on Mothers day. We have to stop the killing of \nour children.''\n  B. Adams of Littleton, CO: ``My daughter survived Columbine, but \nlooking into the faces of the parents that night who had not found \ntheir children was the hardest thing I've ever done.

How can we face them and not say that \nwe have done all we can to protect them?''\n  Eileen of Palm Beach Gardens, FL: ``My 19 yr. old son Michael was \nmurdered on March 21, 1996 along with his best friend.

Mr. President, I take a moment to recognize a milestone we \nreached today that was simply unthinkable eight short years ago. While \nit has gone largely unnoticed, in my view it represents real hope for \nour children's future.\n  Today, for the first time in 70 years, we bought back part of our \nNation's debt. It was a relatively small amount--$1 billion--compared \nto our $5.7 trillion debt. But at least it shows that we are willing to \npay down the mortgage the federal government took out on our children's \nfuture over the last 30 years.\n  We hear a great deal about wasteful spending, and we need to remain \nvigilant to root out wasted taxpayer dollars. But in my view, the most \nwasteful federal spending is the money we are forced to spend on \ninterest to support our publicly held debt--debt which represents all \nthe tough choices we did not make. Last year, we spent nearly $230 \nbillion on interest payments on the debt. That compares with the \nroughly $38 billion the federal government spent last year on \neducation.\n  Those of us who care deeply about keeping government from spending \nmore than it takes in need to continue to make fiscally responsible \nchoices so we can remove the millstone of debt from the necks of our \nchildren as quickly and responsibly as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1384-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1384-S1385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE AFFORDABLE EDUCATION ACT\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of ``The \nPublic Education Reinvestment, Reinvention, and Responsibility Act of \n2000''--better known as ``Three R's.'' I have been pleased to work with \nthe education community in Wisconsin, as well as Senator Lieberman and \nour other cosponsors, on this important piece of legislation. I believe \nthat this bill represents a realistic, effective approach to improving \npublic education--where 90% of students are educated.\n  We have made great strides in the past six years toward improving \npublic education. Nearly all States now have academic standards in \nplace. More students are taking more challenging courses. Test scores \nhave risen slightly. Dropout rates have decreased.\n  In Wisconsin, educators have worked hard to help students achieve. \nFourth-graders and eighth-graders are showing continued improvement on \nState tests in nearly every subject, particularly in science and math. \nThird-graders are scoring higher on reading tests. Test results show \nsome improvement across all groups, including African American, \ndisabled, and economically disadvantaged groups.\n  Unfortunately, despite all of our best efforts, we still face huge \nchallenges in improving public schools. The most recent TIMSS study of \nstudents from 41 different countries found that many American students \nscore far behind those in other countries. In Wisconsin, scores in \nmath, science and writing are getting better but still need \nimprovement. And test scores of students from low-income families, \nwhile showing some improvement, are still too low.\n  I strongly support the notion that the Federal government must \ncontinue to be a partner with States and local educators as we strive \nto improve public schools. As a nation, it is in all of our best \ninterests to ensure that our children receive the best education \npossible. It is vital to their future success, and the success of our \ncountry.\n  However, addressing problems in education is going to take more than \ncosmetic reform. We are going to have to take a fresh look at the \nstructure of Federal education programs. We need to let go of the tired \npartisan fighting over more spending versus block grants and take a \nmiddle ground approach that will truly help our States, school \ndistricts--and most importantly, our students.\n  Our ``Three R's'' bill does just that. It makes raising student \nachievement for all students--and eliminating the achievement gap \nbetween low-income and more affluent students--our top priorities. To \naccomplish this, our bill centers around three principles.\n  First, we believe that we must continue to make a stronger investment \nin education, and that Federal dollars must be targeted to the neediest \nstudents. A recent GAO study found that Federal education dollars are \nsignificantly more targeted to poor districts than money spent by \nStates. Although Federal funds make up only 6-7% of all money spent on \neducation, it is essential that we target those funds where they are \nneeded the most.\n  Second, we believe that States and local school districts are in the \nbest position to know what their educational needs are. They should be \ngiven more flexibility to determine how they will use Federal dollars \nto meet those needs.\n  Finally--and I believe this is the key component of our approach--we \nbelieve that in exchange for this increased flexibility, there must \nalso be accountability for results. These principles are\n\n[[Page S1385]]\n\na pyramid, with accountability being the base that supports the federal \ngovernment's grant of flexibility and funds.\n  For too long, we have seen a steady stream of Federal dollars flow to \nStates and school districts--regardless of how well they educated their \nstudents. This has to stop. We need to reward schools that do a good \njob. We need to provide assistance and support to schools that are \nstruggling to do a better job. And we need to stop subsidizing failure. \nOur highest priority must be educating children--not perpetuating \nbroken systems.\n  I believe the ``Three R's bill is a strong starting point for taking \na fresh look at public education. We need to build upon all the \nprogress we've made, and work to address the problems we still face. \nThis bill--by using the concepts of increased funding, targeting, \nflexibility--and most importantly, accountability--demonstrates how we \ncan work with our State and local partners to make sure every child \nreceives the highest quality education--a chance to live a successful \nproductive life. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle, as well as education groups in my State, as \nCongress debates ESEA in the coming months.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1385-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Camp Fire \nBoys and Girls as it celebrates its 90th birthday. Founded in 1910 as \nthe Camp Fire Girls, it focuses on educational and leadership programs \nto mentor America's young women, and at the time was the nation's only \norganization specifically for girls. My own state of Minnesota was one \nof the first states to develop a local chapter for Camp Fire Girls, \nwith a small group of eight and their 21-year-old leader.\n  Minnesota Governor John Lind purchased 63 acres on Lake Minnewashta \nin 1924 to provide Camp Fire members with a permanent campground. This \nconcept caught on, as two years later, 1000 feet of shoreline on Green \nLake was purchased for the St. Paul council. Many of the early camping \nventures were for girls in high school. But many councils, like \nMinnesota, developed a Blue Bird program to provide younger girls with \nactivities all their own. This additional age group completed the \nsupport Camp Fire brought to girls up to age 18. To better serve all of \nAmerica's youth, Camp Fire opened its doors and allowed boys to become \nmembers in 1975. In 1994, the St. Paul and Minneapolis councils merged \nand now serve not only the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, but most \nof Southern Minnesota. This partnership has provided Camp Fire the \nopportunity to maintain its flexibility and remain responsive to the \nchanging needs of children.\n  That Camp Fire has consistently adapted to the changes necessitated \nby changing times is perhaps the organization's strongest asset in \nreaching out to America's youth.\n  Camp Fire was not intended to solve the problems of the world, but \nrather provide the right tools to the children who will. From the \nbeginning, Camp Fire has used the ideals behind Work, Health, and Love \n(Wohelo) to guide our youth in developing self-esteem and \nresponsibility. Wohelo was the name of the organization's first camp in \nVermont and more than 50 years later, in 1962, the Wohelo medallion was \ncreated to bestow the highest honor to those who personify the meaning \nof the Camp Fire organization.\n  Today, there are 125 local councils in 41 States serving some 629,000 \nyoung Americans. Camp Fire provides direct access to youth through \ndevelopment programs in three areas: club programs, self-reliance \nprograms, and outdoor programs.\n  Club programs provide children with regular, informal educational \nmeetings in local communities led by volunteers or paid leaders. In \nelementary schools, self-reliance courses are led by trained, certified \nteachers who educate children about personal safety and self-care. Last \nyear, more than 6,000 children were involved in this program in \nMinneapolis alone. And in St. Paul, teens are involved in the teaching \nprocess to broaden their community involvement.

Mr. President, in my hometown of Springfield, IL, \nwe have extraordinary people who have made noteworthy contributions in \nservice to others.\n  Julie Cellini, a freelance writer and community activist, has written \nmany profiles which highlight the lives of these fine neighbors in our \nstate capital.\n  Recently, Julie shared the life story of such a person: Sister Agnes \nClare, O.P.\n  At 103 years of age with a sharp mind, an enduring will to savor each \nday of her life and an irresistible Irish charm, Sister Agnes Clare is \nmore than a living legend. She is an eyewitness to a century of history \nin Springfield; a young observer of Washington, D.C., as the daughter \nof a U.S. Congressman; and most of all, a vivid illustration of the \nlegacy of a life of giving as a member of the Dominican Sisters of \nSpringfield.\n  In this week before the celebration of St. Patrick's birthday, I \nwould like to share with the Senate Julie Cellini's recent feature \nstory on Sister Agnes Clare from the Springfield State Journal-\nRegister. As you read it, you will learn of the Grahams, a great Irish-\nAmerican family, and a woman who has touched so many lives with so much \ngoodness.\n  Mr. President, I ask that this article be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n\n            [From the State Journal-Register, March 5, 2000]\n\n                Golden Opportunities--Sister Agnes Clare\n\n                           (By Julie Cellini)\n\n       Agnes Graham was 11 years old when the race riot of 1908 \n     broke out in Springfield.\n       ``I remember the smashed dishes and glass from the windows \n     of Loper's Restaurant strewn across South Fifth Street,'' she \n     says. ``My mother tried to keep me from reading the \n     newspapers so I wouldn't know all that happened. She always \n     thought children should be trouble free, but it wasn't \n     possible to avoid what was going on.''\n       Now at 103 years old, Agnes Graham has been Sister Agnes \n     Clare O.P. of the Cominican Sisters of Springfield for 80 \n     years. She has lived during three centuries of Springfield \n     history, but her voice still carries a hint of the same \n     incredulousness she might have felt some 92 years ago when \n     she watched her hometown erupt into violence that culminated \n     in the lynching of two black men.\n       ``There was a mob. They became very angry when they \n     couldn't get to the black prisoners in the county jail. They \n     said a black man raped a white woman, but it wasn't true. The \n     town was just torn apart.''\n       By the time the two-day upheaval ended, seven people, \n     blacks and whites, were dead,\n\n[[Page S1386]]\n\n     and 40 black homes and 15 black-owned businesses were \n     destroyed.\n       Whether the race riot is her worst memory from more than a \n     century of living, Sister Agnes Clare won't say. Her voice is \n     steady, but she moves quickly to other events, often telling \n     stories about her childhood in the leafy confines of what \n     once was called ``Aristocracy Hill.''\n       Born in 1987 in a handsome, Lincoln-era house that sill \n     stands at 413 S. Seventh St., Agnes Graham was the youngest \n     of seven children--three girls and four boys. She grew up in \n     an adoring, achieving family headed by James M. Graham, an \n     Irish immigrant who co-founded the family law firm of Graham \n     & Graham. James M. Graham served in the Illinois General \n     Assembly and as Sangamon County state's attorney before being \n     elected to Congress, where he served from 1908 to 1914.\n       Sister Agnes Clare's earliest memories are of life in the \n     Victorian-style, painted-brick house, where water came from a \n     backyard pump and transportation meant hitching up a horse \n     and buggy. She frames them from the perspective of a much \n     loved child who appears to have been the favorite of her \n     older siblings.\n       She recalls the Christmas she was 5 years old (``about the \n     age when I started doubting Santa Clause'') and too sick with \n     the flu to walk downstairs to open gifts. Her brother Hugh, a \n     law student at the University of Illinois, wrapped her in a \n     blanket and carried her in his arms down the long, curved \n     staircase with its polished walnut banister.\n       ``My father had given me a big dollar bill to buy eight \n     presents, she says, ``I spent 30 cents for three bottles of \n     perfume for my mother and sisters, and the place smelled to \n     high heaven. I bought my father two bow ties for 10 cents. I \n     think they were made of paper, and they fastened with safety \n     pins. When I got downstairs, I saw a cup of tea for Santa \n     Claus.\n       ``When I was very young, my father went on a ship to \n     Ireland to visit. I asked him to bring me back a leprechaun, \n     but he said he didn't want me to be disappointed if the \n     leprechauns were too fast for him to catch. What he did bring \n     back was a leprechaun doll in a box, with gray socks and a \n     pipe and bat. He told me it was a dead leprechaun, and that \n     the salt water had killed him. I think I half-believed him, \n     and I went around the neighborhood showing my dead leprechaun \n     to my friends. One of their mother told my mother, `Agnes' \n     imagination is growing up faster than she is.''\n       ``The leprechaun went back into a box,'' she says, ``but \n     he'd get to come out on my birthdays and special occasions.''\n       Now a family heirloom, the doll resides with her great-\n     niece, Sallie Graham.\n       Sister Agnes Clare says he Springfield she grew up in \n     wasn't a small town. There were 50,000 people living here at \n     the beginning of the 20th century. Downtown was populated \n     with family-owned businesses, and people tended to stay at \n     the same job all of their lives.\n       The streets were paved with bricks that popped up without \n     warning. People waited all year for the biggest event on the \n     calendar: the Illinois State Fair.\n       ``My mother baked hams and fried chickens so we had safe \n     food to take to the fair. Lots of people got sick from eating \n     at the fairgrounds because there was no refrigeration. At \n     night, the area around the Old Capitol would be filled with \n     fair performers who put on shows. Acrobats, singers and \n     actors would perform on one side of the square. Then we would \n     rush to the other side to get a front row seat on the ground. \n     Everyone in town seemed to come out, and all the stores \n     stayed open late so people could ship.''\n       A rare treat was a little cash for ice cream, usually \n     provided by big brother Hugh because there was an ice cream \n     shop across from the Graham law office.\n       A change meeting with Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis \n     was a highlight of the years Sister Agnes Clare spent in \n     Washington as the young daughter of an Illinois congressman. \n     She tells how Brandeis and her father worked together to \n     investigate and remove corrupt agents who were swindling the \n     residents of Indian reservations.\n       ``Justice Brandeis came to our home because he was leaving \n     Washington and he wanted to tell my father goodbye. I \n     happened to be hanging on the fence in the front yard, so he \n     gave me his business card and told me to give it to my \n     father. He said my father was a great man.''\n       ``Indians would show up at my father's office in full \n     native dress. My father spent a lot of time away from \n     Washington inspecting the reservations. He told me stories of \n     Indians so badly cared for (that) their feet left bloody \n     footprints in the snow. One agent my father got removed gave \n     an Indian a broken sewing machine for land that had oil and \n     timber on it. The Indians were so grateful, a tribe in South \n     Dakota made my father an honorary member with the title Chief \n     Stand Up Straight.''\n       Years later, when the Graham family home in Springfield was \n     sold, she says, relatives donated her father's papers from \n     that period to Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass.\n       In adulthood, Sister Agnes Clare attended college and was a \n     librarian and a founding teacher at a mission and school in \n     Duluth, Minn. However, her long lifetime often has been \n     attached to a small geographic area bounded by the \n     neighborhood where she was born and extending a few blocks \n     west to the places where she attended school, spent much of \n     her working career and retired to the Sacred Heart Convent in \n     1983.\n       Within those confines, she has lived most of a full, rich \n     life that shows few signs of diminishing.\n       ``Sister Agnes' bones don't support her, so she moves \n     around in a wheel chair,'' says Sister Beth Murphy, \n     communication coordinator for the Springfield Dominican \n     order.\n       ``Other than that, she has no illnesses, and her mind is \n     sharp and clear.''\n       The order has had other nuns who lived to be 100, but \n     Sister Agnes Clare holds the longevity record.\n       ``She's amazing,'' says Sister Murphy. ``She continues to \n     live every day with interest and curiosity. She listens to \n     classical music and follows politics and current events on \n     public radio. She reads the large-print edition of The New \n     York Times every day. Recently I dropped by her room to visit \n     and couldn't find her. She had wheeled herself off to art \n     appreciation class.''\n       Sister Agnes Clare's gaze is steady and assured and her \n     face is remarkably unlined. She occupies a sunny room filled \n     with photos and religious keepsakes. Less than a block away \n     is the former Sacred Heart Academy (now Sacred Heart-Griffin \n     High School), where she worked as a librarian for nearly 60 \n     years.\n       ``No, I didn't plan on becoming a nun,'' she says matter-\n     of-factly. ``I always thought I'd have a lot of children and \n     live in a fairy-tale house. No one lives that way, of course.\n       ``I always loved books, so when I graduated I went across \n     the street from my family's home and got a job at Lincoln \n     Library. The librarians were patient and put up with me while \n     I learned how to do the work. One day I was alone when a man \n     with a gruff voice and a face that looked like leather came \n     in and asked to see the books written by Jack London. Of \n     course, we had `Sea Wolf' and `Call of the Wild' and all the \n     popular London books. I showed him, and then I asked who he \n     was.\n       ``He said he was Jack London. I was so astonished, I forgot \n     to ask for his autograph.''\n       Sister Agnes Clare brushes aside any suggestion that she \n     was a writer, despite her essays published in Catholic Digest \n     and other publications. She once sold an article to The \n     Atlantic Monthly. The piece was a rebuttal to one written by \n     a nun critical of convent life. The editors asked for more of \n     Sister Agnes Clare's work but World War II intervened and \n     life became too busy for writing articles.\n       She has been a prolific letter writer to four generations \n     of Grahams. Carolyn Graham, another grand-niece says each of \n     her four adult children treasures letters from their Aunt \n     Agnes.\n       ``Whenever my kids come home,'' she says, ``they always \n     check in with her. They think she's extraordinary and she \n     is.''\n       After a lifetime that has seen wars and sweeping societal \n     changes and the invention of everything from airplanes to the \n     Internet, Sister Agnes Clare isn't offering any advice on how \n     to live longer than 100 years.\n       An academically engaged life with good health habits \n     probably has helped, and so has genetics. She comes from a \n     long-lived family. Her father lived to age 93 and her brother \n     Huge died at 95. A nephew, Dr. James Graham, continues to \n     practice medicine at age 91.\n       There are, she admits, perks attached to being among the \n     rare triple-digit individuals called centenarians.\n       ``People ask you questions when you get to be my age,'' she \n     says, smiling. ``They even listen to my answers.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1386-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1386-S1387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           LEGISLATION CONCERNING DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was \nan extraordinary man who left a legacy for each of us as Americans and \nalso as Georgians. On a hot summer day, August 28, 1963, Dr. King \ndelivered his now famous and unforgettable ``I Have A Dream'' speech on \nthe steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. His words will \nalways stay with us and help remind our Nation that we must look to our \nown home and family, friends and community, to see what we can do to \nmake a better world for all. As Dr. King himself said, ``When we let \nfreedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, \nfrom every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day \nwhen all of God's children, Black men and White men, Jews and Gentiles, \nProtestants and Catholics will be able to join hands and sing in the \nwords of that old Negro spiritual, `Free at last, Free at last, Thank \nGod Almighty, We are free at last.' ''\n  Thousands of visitors come to our Nation's capital to see where \nMartin Luther King delivered the ``I Have A Dream'' speech. \nUnfortunately, there is not a marker or words to show where he helped \nchange the course of our country's history. To commemorate this \nhistoric event and truly honor Dr. King, today I am introducing \nlegislation which directs the Secretary of the Interior to insert a \nplaque at the exact site of the speech on the steps of the\n\n[[Page S1387]]\n\nLincoln Memorial. It is my hope that this marker will preserve Dr. \nKing's legacy for generations to come. The Secretary of the Interior \nmay accept contributions to help defray the costs of preparing and \ninserting the plaque on the steps. This legislation is noncontroversial \nand is consistent with what has been done previously at the Memorial to \ncommemorate similar events. The bill is a Senate companion to \nlegislation introduced by Representative Ann Northup of Kentucky. I \nlook forward to working with her on securing its enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1387-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF KEITH McCARTY\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, 2\\1/2\\ years ago, when the Balanced \nBudget Act (BBA) was enacted, few Members of Congress paid much \nattention to a small section in the BBA that created a new program for \nhospitals in frontier and rural communities.\n  This program, called the Critical Access Hospital, was buried among \nhundreds of provisions affecting Medicare. Yet, in many ways, it may \nwell be one of the most lasting achievements of that session of \nCongress.\n  The Critical Access Hospital idea is based on a very successful \ndemonstration project in Montana. This project, called the Medical \nAssistance Facility Demonstration Project, was coordinated by the \nMontana Health Research and Education Foundation (MHREF). This \nfoundation is affiliated with MHA, an Association of Montana Health \nCare Providers, formerly the Montana Hospital Association.\n  As is usually the case, many people can claim at least some of the \ncredit for the huge success of the MAF demonstration project. But the \nperson who should claim the lion's share of the credit has never chosen \nto do so. It is that person--Keith McCarty--who I would like to \nrecognize today.\n  Keith McCarty joined MHREF in 1989. At that time, even the concept of \nan MAF was vague. Several years earlier, a citizens' task force had \ndreamed up the idea of a limited service hospital to provide access to \nprimary hospital and health care services in rural and frontier \ncommunities. Acting on the recommendations of the task force, the \nMontana Legislature had created a special licensure category for these \nhospitals.\n  MHA, the state department of health and others seized the opportunity \ncreated by the Legislature and, working with the regional office of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, developed a demonstration \nproject aimed at determining whether MAFs would actually work. Keith \nwas hired with the unenviable task of transforming this amorphous \nconcept into reality, a job few gave him much hope of performing \nsuccessfully.\n  Keith brought a broad range of skills to his job. Trained as a \npsychologist, from 1968 to 1975, he worked with the developmentally \ndisabled in a variety of positions, including serving as the \nSuperintendent of the Boulder, Montana School and Hospital, the state's \nschool for developmentally disabled children. Beginning in 1975, he \nprovided professional contract services for a wide variety of health \ncare and social service organizations.\n  By the time he joined MHREF, Keith was skilled at managing projects, \npreparing grant applications, coordinating and supervising grant-funded \nprojects, program development and evaluation, research and data \nanalysis, facilitating community decision-making and inter-agency \ncooperation. All these were skills he would use in developing the MAF \ndemonstration project.\n  The MAF demonstration project brought its share of challenges. Among \nKeith's toughest challenges was convincing communities that the quality \nof their health care would not decline if they converted to MAF status. \nOnce beyond that hurdle, Keith worked tirelessly with the state's peer \nreview organization, fiscal intermediary, facility licensure and \ncertification bureau and HHS officials to remove other potential \nroadblocks.\n  First one facility made the conversion, then another and before long \nthere were more than twice as many as the project thought might convert \nto MAF status. I pushed for the Medicare waiver in the early 1990s, and \nthe Medical Assistance Facility became a reality.\n  As the demonstration neared completion, Keith worked closely with my \nstaff to draft the Critical Access Hospital legislation that I \nintroduced in 1997 and saw through to final passage as part of the BBA. \nHis insights about how Critical Access Hospitals might function, in \npractical terms, proved invaluable. And the model embodied in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 closely parallels the experience Montana's \nMAFs enjoyed.\n  Keith McCarty retired on December 31, 1999. He retired only after \nensuring that Montana's MAFs were able to seamlessly transition into \nthe new Critical Access Hospital program.\n  His departure from MHREF marks a fitting transition for the Critical \nAccess Hospital program. Once only a dream in the minds of a few people \nin the sparsely-populated areas of central Montana, the Critical Access \nHospital has already become an institution in many communities across \nAmerica.\n  Keith is far too modest to take credit for his labors. So, what he \nwon't say, we should. Keith's efforts--and the MAF demonstration \nproject--have been recognized in special awards from the National Rural \nHealth Association and the American Hospital Association.\n  But perhaps the most fitting tribute that can be paid is to note that \ntoday, in 15 communities in Montana, routine health care services are \nprovided in Critical Access Hospitals. If there had been no MAF \ndemonstration project, health care services in at least half of these \ntowns would no longer be available.\n  I want to acknowledge and thank Keith McCarty for the service he has \nprovided to so many Montanans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1387-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO KEN SULLIVAN\n\n   Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor \nthe Volunteers of America on the occasion of its Founders' Week \nCelebration.\n  Volunteers of America was founded in 1896 by Christian social \nreformers Ballington and Maud Booth in New York with the mission of \n``reaching and uplifting'' the American people. Soon afterwards, more \nthan 140 ``posts'' were established across the nation. One of these \nposts sprang to life in my home state of Minnesota.\n  Volunteers of America serves people in many ways, with a special \nemphasis on human services, housing, and health services. The \norganization is noted for being the nation's largest nonprofit provider \nof quality, affordable housing for low-income families and the elderly. \nCurrently, more than 30,000 people reside in Volunteers of America \nhousing. Along with its commitment to providing homes, Volunteers of \nAmerica also focuses on helping the homeless, through emergency \nshelters, transitional housing, jobs training, and counseling.\n  In Minnesota, Volunteers of America is one of the most important \nproviders of social services and workers with\n\n[[Page S1388]]\n\nchildren, adults, and seniors. Children are provided residential \ntreatment, shelter, and foster care. Adult services include help \nfilling housing needs and skills training for individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities. Senior services include home-delivered \nmeals and home health care assistance.\n  None of this would be possible without the more than 11,000 employees \nand 300,000 volunteers who work with the Volunteers of America. \nVolunteers of America of Minnesota is home to more than 350 employees \nand over 1,000 volunteers. Volunteerism is a community necessity, and I \nextend my utmost thanks and appreciation to those who are providing our \ncountry and my state with such an invaluable resource through their \nparticipation in Volunteers of America.\n  I again applaud the Volunteers of America during this Founders' Week \nfor its extraordinary record of service. For more than 100 years, \nVolunteers of America has been there for countless Minnesotans; given \nits good work and record of success, I am confident this vital \norganization will be with us for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1388-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MS.

At the \nvery heart of this national recognition for his business excellence is \nthe story of a strong, close family, which makes this award all the \nmore special.\n  TIME Magazine has named John W. Whitby, Jr., President of Kent County \nMotor Sales Company, as its recipient of the 2000 Quality Dealer Award. \nThe competition was formidable--Whitby won over 63 other dealers \nnominated for the 31st annual award, from more than 20,500 auto dealers \nnationwide. And make no mistake--this is a coveted award for auto \ndealers. It's the equivalent of TIME's ``Man of the Year'' award for \nautomobile dealers.\n  John operates Kent County Motor Sales in Dover, building on the \nsuccessful business his dad, Jack Whitby founded. Upon accepting the \naward at the National Auto Dealers Association Convention, John readily \ngave credit to his father for the extensive training he received and to \nhis employees and colleagues for their dedication and commitment to \nexcellence.\n  American philosopher and poet, George Santayana, wrote that: ``The \nfamily is one of nature's masterpieces.'' To extend that metaphor: The \nWhitby family is one of Kent County's masterpieces. Not only is John a \ntop business owner, he is a community leader as well. John is a member \nof the Delaware Business Roundtable Greater Dover Committee; the \nCentral Delaware Chamber of Commerce; the Quarterback Club of Kent \nCounty; and, Friends of Capitol Theatre among many other civic \ncontributions. John is continuing the strong Whitby family tradition. \nHe lives in his native Dover, with his wife Diane and two children, \nEmily and Jay.\n  Mr. President, it is with great pride that I commend John Whitby, Jr. \nand his family for this outstanding national award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1388-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IDAHO TEACHER OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize teachers \nacross America for the vital work they do. I come from a family of \neducators, so I have seen firsthand the impact teachers have on \nchildren. They do this because they care about each and every child \nthey teach. These public servants deserve our gratitude and thanks.\n  While I believe this can be said of all teachers, I would like to \nrecognize one particular teacher today who embodies this sentiment. She \nis Nancy Larsen, of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and she was chosen by my \nstate as Educator of the Year.\n  One look at her career shows why she was chosen as the Educator of \nthe Year. She has dedicated eight years of her life to teaching the \nsecond grade, and these eight years have been full of innovation and a \nreal love for education. Not only has she been busy in the classroom, \nshe has also found time for activities which broaden her knowledge and \nmake her a better teacher. For example, she has published articles in \nmagazines such as Learning and Portals: A Journal of the Idaho Council \nInternational Reading Association. She has also designed and presented \nnumerous workshops in the past five years, and participates in many \nprofessional organizations, including serving as President of the \nPanhandle Reading Council.\n  While these activities are important, her classroom work is what \ntruly sets her apart. For example, she actively seeks to involve \nparents in her students' education, realizing that parental involvement \nis key for scholastic success. Her weekly letters on students' \nactivities, her project, ``Family Math Night,'' are further examples of \nher commitment to parents as computer and classroom helpers. There have \nbeen many studies which show that parental involvement increases \nchildren's ability to learn. Nancy know this from her first day on the \njob, and has worked to make this involvement a reality.\n  Her students adore her and her peers respect her. This is what every \nteacher strives for, and Nancy has earned this respect. As one of her \nstudents said, ``I'm really glad to have such a nice teacher.''\n  As you can see, Nancy Larsen is truly a treasure for her school, for \nIdaho, and indeed for the Nation in general. Teachers like Nancy make \neducation a rewarding experience for students and parents alike. I am \nproud that the state of Idaho chose her as its Teacher of the Year. She \nis a great example for the rest of the state and the Nation, and I hope \nthis award gives her a platform so she can help other teachers to have \nthe same success she has.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1388-4", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1388-S1389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RECOGNIZING THE 44TH ANNIVERSARY OF TUNISIAN INDEPENDENCE\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of the \n44th anniversary of Tunisian independence. On March 20, Tunisia--one of \nAmerica's oldest allies--will mark its 44th year of independence, but \nour two nations have been sharing the ideals of freedom and democracy \nfor a much longer time.\n  In 1797, our two nations signed a treaty calling for ``perpetual and \nconstant peace.'' Indeed, for the past 200 years, our two nations have \nenjoyed such a friendship. Whether protecting Mediterranean shipping \nlanes against Barbary pirates, opposing the Nazi war machine in North \nAfrica, or supporting Western interests during the Cold War, the U.S. \ncould count on Tunisia. More recently, Tunisia displayed great courage \nin urging other Arab nations to seek an accord with Israel. Tunisia has \nbuilt on that pioneering stand by playing an important role as an \nhonest and fair broker at delicate points in the Middle East peace \nprocess.\n  By adopting progressive social policies that feature tolerance for \nminorities, equal rights for women, universal education, a modern \nhealth system, and avoiding the pitfall of religious extremism that has \ntormented so many other developing countries, Tunisia has built a \nstable, middle-class society. In stark contrast to its two neighbors \n(Algeria, which has been racked by civil\n\n[[Page S1389]]\n\nwar and persecution for many years, and Libya, whose dictator has \nsupported the most nefarious and subversive kinds of terrorism), \nTunisia has been a quiet and wonderful success. In fact, Tunisia became \nthe first nation south of the Mediterranean to formally associate \nitself with the European Union.\n  Mr. President, Tunisia has been a model for developing countries. It \nhas sustained remarkable economic growth, and undertaken reforms toward \npolitical pluralism. It has been a steadfast ally of the United States \nand has consistently fought for democratic goals and ideals. Tunisia \nhas responded to President Dwight D. Eisenhower's request to consider \nthe U.S. as ``friends and partner'' in the most effective way--by its \nactions.\n  In commemoration of 44 years of independence for Tunisia, I urge my \ncolleagues to reflect on our strong commitment to Tunisian people, who \nare still our friends and partners in North Africa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1389-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            VI HILBERT, WINNER OF THE ``POWER OF ONE'' AWARD\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I am delighted to honor the \nachievements of a remarkable Washingtonian for her work in preserving \nthe culture and traditions of the Pacific Northwest. For all her \nefforts, Upper Skagit elder Vi Hilbert is one of the Washington Women \n2000 ``Power of One'' Award recipients.\n  A native speaker of Lushootseed, Vi has worked tirelessly to preserve \nthe indigenous language of the Puget Sound area as well as the stories \nand history of the Pacific Northwest tribes.\n  In 1983, Vi founded Lushootseed Research which is a non-profit \norganization to preserve the Lushootseed language through audio and \nprinted materials as well as education. Vi taught Lushootseed language \nand literature classes at the University of Washington for 15 years.\n  In addition to preserving her own native tongue, Vi has served to \npreserve art, artifacts and cultural heritage of tribes from all of the \nPacific Northwest. She serves on the advisory board for the Burke \nMuseum and the Seattle Art Museum and is an active board member of \nUnited Indians of All Tribes and Tillicum Village.\n  On behalf of all of us who treasure the heritage of the Pacific \nNorthwest, I thank Vi for all her efforts. She is a tremendous example \nof the ``Power of One.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1389-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Wanda Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1389-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                            PRESIDENT--PM 92\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As provided by the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), as amended \n(Public Law 92-463; 5 U.S.C., App. 2, 6(c)), I hereby submit the \nTwenty-seventh Annual Report on Federal Advisory Committees, covering \nfiscal year 1998.\n  In keeping with my commitment to create a more responsive government, \nthe executive branch continues to implement my policy of maintaining \nthe number of advisory committees within the ceiling of 534 required by \nExecutive Order 12838 of February 10, 1993. Accordingly, the number of \ndiscretionary advisory committees (established under general \ncongressional authorizations) was again held to substantially below \nthat number. During fiscal year 1998, 460 discretionary committees \nadvised executive branch officials. The number of discretionary \ncommittees supported represents a 43 percent reduction in the 801 in \nexistence at the beginning of my Administration.\n  Through the planning process required by Executive Order 12838, the \ntotal number of advisory committees specified mandated by statute also \ncontinues to decline. The 388 such groups supported at the end of \nfiscal year 1998 represents a modest decrease from the 391 in existence \nat the end of fiscal year 1997. However, compared to the 439 advisory \ncommittees mandated by statute at the beginning of my Administration, \nthe net total for fiscal year 1998 reflects nearly a 12 percent \ndecrease since 1993.\n  The executive branch has worked jointly with the Congress to \nestablish a partnership whereby all advisory committees that are \nrequired by statute are regularly reviewed through the legislative \nreauthorization process and that any such new committees proposed \nthrough legislation are closely linked to compelling national \ninterests. Furthermore, my Administration will continue to direct the \nestimated costs to fund required statutory groups in fiscal year 1999, \nor $45.8 million, toward supporting initiatives that reflect the \nhighest priority public involvement efforts.\n  Combined savings achieved through actions taken during fiscal year \n1998 to eliminate all advisory committees that are no longer needed, or \nthat have completed their missions, totaled $7.6 million. This reflects \nthe termination of 47 committees, originally established under both \ncongressional authorities or implemented by executive agency decisions. \nAgencies will continue to review and eliminate advisory committees that \nare obsolete, duplicative, or of a lesser priority than those that \nwould serve a well-defined national interest. New committees will be \nestablished only when they are essential to the conduct of necessary \nbusiness, are clearly in the public's best interests, and when they \nserve to enhance Federal decisionmaking through an open and \ncollaborative process with the American people.\n  I urge the Congress to work closely with the General Services \nAdministration and each department and agency to examine additional \nopportunities for strengthening the contributions made by Federal \nadvisory committees.\n                                                  William J.

Millions of people bear these expenses every day, without any \nhelp.\n  Here's a typical example: A state legislator from Ohio named Barbara \nBoyd testified before my Special Committee on Aging last year. Ms. Boyd \ncared at home for her mother who had Alzheimer's disease and breast \ncancer. Her mother had $20,000 in savings and a monthly Social Security \ncheck. That went quickly. Prescription drugs alone ran $400 a month.\n  Antibiotics, ointments to prevent skin breakdown, incontinence \nsupplies and other expenses cost hundreds of dollars a month. Ms. Boyd \nexhausted her own savings to care for her mother, and exhausted \nherself. She isn't complaining. Family caregivers don't complain. But \nwe can and should use the tax code to ease their burden.\n  Yesterday a bipartisan group of legislators, and two prominent \ngroups--AARP and the Health Insurance Association of America, announced \na consensus agreement on a legislative package to help people with a \nvariety of long-term care needs. Our bill contains a tax deduction to \nencourage individuals to buy long-term care insurance. We want to help \npeople to prepare for their health needs in retirement.\n\n[[Page S1393]]\n\n  The bill also contains a $3,000 tax credit for family caregivers \ncaring for a disabled relative at home. Under this legislation, Ms. \nBoyd's mother could have purchased long-term care insurance long before \nshe developed Alzheimer's. In addition, Ms. Boyd could have used the \ntax credit to help with the costs of the medications and medical \nsupplies for her mother.\n  I'm pleased that we have so much agreement in Washington about \nhelping people with long-term care expenses. The legislators sponsoring \nthis legislation have pushed for long-term care relief for years. \nToday, my colleagues and I will introduce this bill. We'll work to get \nit passed into law as soon as possible. An aging nation has no time to \nwaste in preparing for long-term care. Family caregivers need immediate \nrelief from their expensive and exhausting work.\n  Joining me in introducing this bill is Senator Bob Graham of Florida, \nRepresentative Nancy Johnson, and Representative Karen Thurman.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 2226. A bill to establish a Congressional Trade Office; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                 to create a congressional trade office\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, last year I introduced a bill to \ncreate a Congressional Trade Office. That bill was designed to provide \nthe Congress with new and additional trade expertise that would be \nindependent, non-partisan, and neutral. Today, I am introducing the \nsame bill with several small changes.\n  The role of Congress in trade policy has expanded in the few short \nmonths since I introduced my bill in September. We went through Seattle \nand the failure to launch a new multilateral trade round. The public is \nmore interested in trade issues than ever before. There is a new \nurgency to reconcile labor and environmental issues with trade. We are \non the cusp of seeing China enter the WTO with permanent Normal Trade \nRelations with the United States. The General Accounting Office has \ntold us of the deficiencies in the Executive Branch in following trade \nagreements and monitoring compliance. And, for the first time, trade \nwill be an issue in the Presidential campaign, as well as in Senate and \nHouse races.\n  Congress needs to be much better prepared. And that means we need \naccess to more and better information, independently arrived, at from \npeople whose commitment is to the Congress, and only to the Congress.\n  Congress has the Constitutional authority to provide more effective \nand active oversight of our Nation's trade policy. We must use that \nauthority. Congress should be more active in setting the direction of \ntrade policy. I believe strongly that we must re-assert Congress' \nconstitutionally defined responsibility for international commerce.\n  A Congressional Trade Office would provide the entire Congress, \nthrough the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means \nCommittee, with this additional trade expertise. It would have three \nsets of responsibilities.\n  First, it will monitor compliance with major bilateral, regional, and \nmultilateral trade agreements. Last week, along with Senator Murkowski \nand several other Senators, I introduced the China WTO Compliance Act. \nThat bill is designed to ensure continuing and comprehensive monitoring \nof China's WTO commitments. It is also designed to ensure aggressive \nAdministration action to ensure compliance with those commitments. But \nthat bill deals only with China. Congress needs the independent ability \nto look more closely at agreements with other countries. The \nCongressional Trade Office will analyze the performance under \nkey agreements and evaluate success based on commercial results. It \nwill do this in close consultation with the affected industries. The \nCongressional Trade Office will recommend to the Congress actions \nnecessary to ensure that commitments made to the United States are \nfully implemented. It will also provide annual assessments about the \nagreements' compliance with labor and environmental goals.\n\n  Second, the Congressional Trade Office will have an analytic \nfunction. For example, after the Administration delivers its annual \nNational Trade Estimates report, the NTE, to Congress, it will analyze \nthe major outstanding trade barriers based on the cost to the US \neconomy. It will also provide an analysis of the Administration's Trade \nPolicy Agenda.\n  The Congressional Trade Office will analyze proposed trade \nagreements, including agreements that do not require legislation to \nenter into effect. It will examine the impact of Administration trade \npolicy actions, including an assessment of the Administration's \nargument for not accepting an unfair trade practices case. And it will \nanalyze the trade accounts every quarter, including the global current \naccount, the global trade account, and key bilateral trade accounts.\n  Third, the Congressional Trade Office will be active in dispute \nsettlement deliberations. It will evaluate each WTO decision where the \nUS is a participant. In the case of a US loss, it will explain why it \nlost. In the case of a US win, it will measure the commercial results \nfrom that decision. It will do a similar evaluation for NAFTA disputes. \nCongressional Trade Office staff should participate as observers on the \nUS delegation at dispute settlement panel meetings at the WTO.\n  The Congressional Trade Office is designed to service the Congress. \nIts Director will report to the Senate Finance Committee and the House \nWays and Means Committee. It will also advise other committees on the \nimpact of trade negotiations and the impact of the Administration's \ntrade policy on those committees' areas of jurisdiction.\n  The staff will consist of professionals who have a mix of expertise \nin economics and trade law, plus in various industries and geographic \nregions. My expectation is that staff members will see this as a career \nposition, thus, providing the Congress with long-term institutional \nmemory.\n  The Congressional Trade Office will work closely with other \ngovernment entities involved in trade policy assessment, including the \nCongressional Research Service, the General Accounting Office, and the \nInternational Trade Commission. The Congressional Trade Office will not \nreplace those agencies. Rather, the Congressional Trade Office will \nsupplement their work, and leverage the work of those entities to \nprovide the Congress with timely analysis, information, and advice.\n  Dispute resolution and compliance with trade agreements are central \nelements of US trade policy. The credibility of the global trading \nsystem, and the integrity of American trade law, depend on the belief, \nheld by trade professionals, political leaders, industry \nrepresentatives, workers, farmers, and the public at large, that \nagreements made are agreements followed. They must be fully \nimplemented. There must be effective enforcement. Dispute settlement \nmust be rapid and effective.\n  Often more energy goes into negotiating new agreements than into \nensuring that existing agreements work. The Administration has \nincreased the resources it devotes to compliance, and I support that. \nBut an independent and neutral assessment in the Congress of compliance \nis necessary. It is unrealistic to expect an agency that negotiated an \nagreement to provide a totally objective and dispassionate assessment \nof that agreement's success or failure.\n  Looking at the WTO dispute settlement process, I don't think we even \nknow whether it has been successful or not from the perspective of U.S. \ncommercial interests. A count of wins versus losses tells us nothing. \nThe Congressional Trade Office will give us the facts we need to \nevaluate this process properly.\n  Article I, Section 8, of the U.S. Constitution says: ``The Congress \nshall have power . . . To regulate commerce with foreign nations.'' It \nis our responsibility to provide oversight and direction on US trade \npolicy. The Congressional Trade Office, as I have outlined it today, \nwill provide us in the Congress with the means to do so.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Craig, Mrs. Lincoln, \n        Mr. Johnson, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Robb, Mr. \n        Stevens, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 2227. A bill to amend chapter 79 of title 5, United States Code, \nto allow\n\n[[Page S1394]]\n\nFederal agencies to reimburse their employees for certain adoption \nexpenses, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n             the federal employees adoption assistance act\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in the House, \nCongressmen Bliley and Oberstar and 42 other House Members, as well as \nSenators Landrieu, Craig, Jeffords, Lincoln, Johnson, Lieberman, \nJeffords, Robb, Stevens, and Warner, in introducing a bill to reimburse \nall federal employees up to $2,000 for qualified expenses associated \nwith the adoption of a child and for special-needs adoptions--the \nFederal Employees Adoption Assistance Act of 2000.\n  Every year, couples who are unable to have children of their own \nspend literally thousands of dollars to adopt a child. Statistics show \nthat approximately 2.1 million couples in the Unites States are \ninfertile. One of the main reasons for this is because couples are \nwaiting longer to start a family in order to focus on careers. Many \nseek treatment to conceive a child, but are unsuccessful. For them, \ntheir only hope of having a child of their own is through adoption.\n  The adoption process demands an incredible amount of time and money \nand creates stress that can affect job performance. For this reason \nmany private-sector businesses, such as Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, \nSprint, Prudential, Home Depot, and Freddie Mac, now provide financial \nassistance to employees adopting a child, thus increasing employee \nsatisfaction, productivity, and loyalty and commitment to the employer. \nUnfortunately, the largest employer in the U.S.--the federal \ngovernment--currently provides no financial assistance for adoption \nexpenses to its employees. That is why I am introducing the Federal \nEmployees Adoption Assistance Act.\n  This legislation would allow federal agencies to reimburse employees \nup to $2,000 for all qualified expenses associated with the adoption of \na child, including special-needs children. Any benefit paid by this \nlegislation would come out of funds available for salaries and expenses \nof the relevant agencies. Currently, active-duty armed services \npersonnel receive this adoption benefit, $2,000 per adoption; however, \nno other branch of the federal government covers this expense.\n  A key aspect of adoption that is frequently overlooked, and that I \nhave made sure is addressed in this legislation, is that of special-\nneeds children. Recent estimates show there are currently around \n110,000 special-needs children in foster care who are eligible for \nadoption. Many of these children have physical or mental disabilities \nand need extensive care and therapy. Another common situation is two or \nmore siblings in need of a family willing to take on the responsibility \nof more than one child. Most of these children are currently in foster \ncare waiting to find a permanent home and family of their own, and are \nless likely to be adopted than non-special-needs children.\n  Often, couples who may already have children of their own are \ninterested in opening their home and their hearts to adopt a child or \nchildren with special needs, but are hesitant to do so due to the costs \ninvolved. By providing an adoption reimbursement benefit, many couples \nalready considering adopting special-needs children decide to go ahead \nwith the process. The Federal Employees Adoption Assistance Act \nbroadens the adoption benefits package to include the costs associated \nwith special-needs adoptions.\n  Mr. President, this is why I, along with numerous colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle and in both chambers, are introducing and advocating \nthe passage of this legislation. Additionally, this bipartisan and \nbicameral bill has the endorsement of numerous adoption advocacy \ngroups, including:\n  Bethany Christian Services in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Covenant House, \nThe Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, The Edgewood Children's Center \nin St. Louis, Missouri, Family Voices, The National Adoption Center, \nThe National Council for Adoption, The National Treasury Employees \nUnion, and Voice for Adoption.\n  As a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I believe we \nshould provide incentives to make sure that more children find loving \nparents. I thank my colleagues, Senators Landrieu, Craig, Jeffords, \nLincoln, Johnson, Lieberman, Jeffords, Robb, Stevens, and Warner, \nCongressmen Bliley and Oberstar, and the numerous other House and \nSenate sponsors, as well as the many adoption advocacy groups, for \njoining me in promoting adoption and supporting our civil servants by \ncosponsoring and endorsing this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Bethany Christian Services,\n\n                                  Grand Rapids, MI, March 3, 2000.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond, I have read the draft of the Federal \n     Employees Adoptions Assistance Act that you have proposed. On \n     behalf of Bethany Christian Services, I express my support \n     for this legislation.\n       Bethany is a national child welfare 501(c)3 organization \n     and is located in 31 states. We place close to 1500 children \n     for adoption each year and most of them have some form of \n     ``special need.'' The families that choose to adopt are \n     typically in need of some form of financial assistance.\n       Thank you for your efforts to promote adoption with this \n     proposed legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Glenn De Mots,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Dave Thomas Foundation\n\n\n                                                 for Adoption,\n\n                                        Dublin, OH, March 8, 2000.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: As you know, adoption is a personal \n     thing for me. I was adopted when I was six weeks old, and If \n     I hadn't had a family to care for me, I know, I wouldn't be \n     where I am now. Today over 110,000 children in the United \n     States foster care system are waiting to be adopted. I'd like \n     to see them have the same chance that I had for a loving home \n     and family. I support your efforts to help these children and \n     the families who adopt them through the introduction of the \n     Federal Employees Adoption Assistance Act of 2000.\n       Wendy's began to offer adoption assistance to our employees \n     in 1990, and since then thirty-six employees have adopted. We \n     discovered many advantages to offering adoption benefits. \n     They are a highly valued part of employees' benefits and they \n     make the process of building a family more fair. When a \n     company offers adoptive parents financial assistance and \n     leave comparable to maternity benefits, they are doing what \n     is best for families--and employees appreciate it. Adoption \n     benefits also provide an opportunity to give back to the \n     community. By offering employers adoption benefits we are \n     making it possible for more children to be adopted from the \n     child welfare system. Through our work at Wendy's, we are \n     reminded that building and supporting families is the right \n     thing to do. It costs so little to make a tremendous \n     difference in the lives of families and children.\n       We appreciate your hard work to ensure that this \n     legislation covers a broader range of adoption related \n     expenses. This is especially important because of the unique \n     costs that families who adopt children with special needs \n     incur.\n       Again, thank you for your efforts to encourage the federal \n     government to join the growing number of employers who agree \n     that adoption benefits make good business sense. We commend \n     you for your leadership in this area and hope your fellow \n     Members of Congress will support it.\n           Warm regards,\n                                                      Dave Thomas,\n     Founder.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Covenant House,\n\n                                      New York, NY, March 8, 2000.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: Covenant House is proud to be a \n     supporter of the Federal Employees Adoption Assistance Act of \n     2000. I would like to have joined you for the actual \n     announcement of this legislation but am unable to do so due \n     to a previous commitment.\n       Each year, thousands of youth come to Covenant House \n     lacking the support of a stable family and desperately in \n     need of love and protection. This legislation will encourage \n     federal employees to adopt youth who have this great need and \n     hopefully set an example for employers throughout the nation \n     to provide similar encouragement to their employees who want \n     to adopt a youth. We know so many young people whose lives \n     would have been turned around if only adoption could have \n     been possible for them.\n       Thank you so much for drafting and sponsoring this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                   Sister Mary Rose McGeady, D.C.,\n                                                        President.\n\n[[Page S1395]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                     Edgewood Children Center,\n\n                                 St. Louis, MO, February 16, 2000.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: As you know, at Edgewood Children's \n     Center we often work with children whose own families are \n     unable to care for them. Finding permanent families for those \n     children is usually more of a priority than anything else we \n     do.\n       The ``Federal Employees Adoption Assistance Act'' will \n     support an important group of potential parents in their \n     desire to parent these and other children. Easing the \n     financial burden of adoption will increase the pool of \n     available families and make the way easier for those who \n     choose this important step.\n       Thank for, once again, leading the way on behalf of kids. \n     Know of our strong support of this bill and please let me \n     know of anything we can do to be of assistance.\n           Most sincerely,\n                                               Susan S. Stepleton,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                Family Voices,\n\n                                  Algodones, NM, February 9, 2000.\n     Senator Christopher Bond,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: Family Voices is pleased to write in \n     support of the ``Federal Employees Adoption Assistance Act'' \n     you have proposed. Family Voices, 30,000 members understand \n     the delicate nature of our children with special needs have a \n     loving home to grow up in and a nurturing family to support \n     them.\n       We believe that any assistance that can be provided to help \n     families adopt children with special needs is crucial. \n     Today's changing health care environment and families \n     concerns about growing costs may provide barriers to the \n     adoption of our children with special needs. Your bill simply \n     equals the playing field for our children with special needs \n     and the families who wish to be apart of their lives. Our \n     children deserve a nurturing environment and this bill will \n     encourage adopting families to take a second look at our \n     kids. You have truly addressed a need our children and their \n     future families have and Family Voices stands behind your \n     efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Julie Beckett,\n\n                                      National Policy Coordinator,\n     Family Voices, Inc.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Missouri Coalition of\n\n\n                                          Children's Agencies,\n\n                                Jefferson City, MO, March 4, 2000.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: As you know, the Missouri Coalition of \n     Children's Agencies is the professional association \n     representing sixty-five private child caring agencies in \n     Missouri. The vast majority of these agencies spend a \n     considerable portion of their time attempting to find \n     permanent homes for the abused and neglected children in \n     their care. This function is second only to providing a safe \n     and caring environment for these children.\n       The ``Federal Employees Adoption Assistance Act'' is a \n     great step in providing an important potential group of \n     adoptive parents for children in need of permanent homes. \n     Anything we can do to increase the pool of potential adoptive \n     families can only help increase the chances for the children \n     who most need the love and stability of a permanent home. \n     Reducing the financial burden of adoption is a great step \n     forward for these potential families.\n       We truly appreciate your strong support of children. If \n     there is anything our association or its individual members \n     can do to help in this effort, please let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Joe Ketterlin,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     National Adoption Center,\n\n                                                 Philadelphia, PA.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: For the past four years, the National \n     Adoption Center has been in the forefront of encouraging \n     employers to offer adoption benefits through its Adoption and \n     the Workplace project. During this time, more than 125 \n     employers have implemented benefits' policies, including \n     financial reimbursement for adoption expenses. This support \n     allows families to consider adoption as a viable option and \n     to provide loving homes to children who need permanence.\n       The reaction of adoptive families who receive adoption \n     benefits has been overwhelmingly positive. Many have spoken \n     of their appreciation of their employer's efforts to provide \n     fairness in relation to those who create families \n     biologically and often express their gratitude through \n     greater loyalty and commitment to their workplace.\n       We support the Federal Employees Adoption Assistance Act \n     you are proposing as an effective way of providing financial \n     reimbursement to employees interested in adopting and as a \n     means of encouraging families to consider adoption as a \n     family-building alternative. We feel that this legislation \n     addresses the need for equity, recognizing that families who \n     adopt have traditionally had no employer-supported financial \n     benefits, unlike those who receive maternity coverage.\n       We commend you for this farsighted bill and urge your \n     fellow legislators to support it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Carolyn L. Johnson,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                National Council for Adoption,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 8, 2000.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: I reviewed the draft version of the \n     Federal Employees Adoption Assistance Act that you have \n     proposed and am in support of this legislation. As you know, \n     the National Council For Adoption has taken the position of \n     promoting adoption for the past 20 years. The Federal \n     Employees Adoption Assistance Act provides families with much \n     needed financial assistance to defray the cost of certain \n     adoption expenses. By providing this assistance, hopefully a \n     number of strong families that would not otherwise have the \n     financial ability to adopt a child will have the opportunity \n     to provide a loving home to a child in need of a family.\n       As a supporter of companion legislation sponsored by \n     Representative Tom Bliley and Representative James Oberstar, \n     the National Council for Adoption supports your efforts to \n     enact the Federal Employees Adoption Assistance Act into law \n     this year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               David M. Malutinok,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Statement of Colleen M. Kelley, National President, National Treasury \n   Employees Union, in Support of the Federal Adoption Assistance Act\n\n       The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents \n     over 155,000 federal workers in the Department of the \n     Treasury, Department of Energy, Federal Communications \n     Commission, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Patent and \n     Trademark Office and other agencies announces its strong \n     support for the bipartisan legislation introduced by Senator \n     Kit Bond and Representative Tom Bliley to provide adoption \n     assistance for federal employees.\n       Many federal employees are ready and willing to provide a \n     loving home for a child in need. Sadly, significant financial \n     barriers often exist particularly for the lower and middle \n     grade public servants that make up the membership of our \n     union. This legislation would lessen the financial burden \n     these hopeful parents would bear as they take on the duties \n     of providing love and care for a child in need of a home.\n       The federal government should set the example for employers \n     everywhere in developing compassionate and socially \n     responsible employment and benefit policies. NTEU asks that \n     Congress move quickly on this important legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Voice for Adoption,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 2000.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: On behalf of Voice for Adoption (VFA), I \n     applaud your efforts to help special needs children move from \n     foster care to permanent loving homes. VFA supports the \n     Federal Employees Adoption Assistance Act.\n       Founded in 1996, VFA has more than 70 national and local \n     special needs adoption organizations as members. VFA \n     participants include professionals, parents, and advocates \n     committed to securing adoptive families for America's waiting \n     children.\n       Our distinguished board of directors has more than two \n     hundred years combined experience in the adoption field. \n     VFA's board includes: North American Council on Adoptable \n     Children (NACAC), the National Adoption Center, Adoption \n     Exchange Association (AEA) Child Welfare League of America \n     (CWLA), Children Awaiting Parents (CAP), the Institute for \n     Black Parenting, Three River Adoption Council, Spaulding for \n     Children, Family Builders Adoption Network and The Evan B. \n     Donaldson Adoption Institute. Our aim is to ensure permanent, \n     nurturing families for our nation's most vulnerable children \n     and to strengthen support for families who adopt.\n       In 1998, approximately 520,000 children were in out-of-\n     home, foster, kinship, or residential care. The average age \n     of these children in foster care is 9.5 year old. These \n     children can expect to spend on average more than three years \n     in the foster care system and be moved more than three \n     different times during their stays.\n       The Federal Employees Adoption Assistance Act, which allows \n     up to $2,000 reimbursement for adoption expenses, would \n     encourage employees of the federal government to adopt who \n     would not have been able to afford it otherwise.\n       Again, VFA applauds your leadership with this important \n     piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Courteney Anne Holden,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues and to \nacknowledge the leadership of Senator Bond in introducing the Federal \nEmployees Adoption Assistance Act of 2000.\n  Congress has repeatedly demonstrated strong support for adoption.\n\n[[Page S1396]]\n\n I think there is a clear consensus here that adoption is a positive \nexperience--for children needing homes, for birth parents, and for \nadoptive parents, not to mention for society at large. In recent years, \nwe have shaped federal policies so that they do more to help waiting \nchildren find permanent, loving families.\n  Now we have an opportunity to bring home our advocacy for adoption.\n  The Federal Employees Adoption Assistance Act follows the lead of a \ngrowing number of private sector businesses in establishing an adoption \nbenefit for employees. It is well known that family-friendly workforce \npolicies help attract and retain qualified workers. While adoption \nbenefits generate considerable good will and loyalty among employees, \nthey cost little for employers, because they are relatively rarely \nused. Yet in view of what continues to be a huge price tag for \nadoption--in the tens of thousands of dollars--these benefits can truly \nmake a difference in helping an employee choose this option for \ncreating or expanding a family.\n  By implementing these policies for federal workers, we can underscore \nour strong message of support for adoption and encourage more private \nsector employers to do likewise. At the same time, we will be improving \nthe competitiveness of the federal government in recruiting good \nworkers and helping to increase current workers' job satisfaction and \ncommitment.\n  The benefit that could be provided by the Federal Employees Adoption \nAssistance Act is by no means lavish, but it compares favorably with \nsimilar benefits in the private sector. This policy will be good for \nworkers, good for the federal government, good for taxpayers, and--most \nimportant--good for the more than 100,000 children in this country who \nare eligible for adoption today but still awaiting a permanent, loving \nfamily.\n  I congratulate Senator Bond for bringing this initiative to the \nSenate and encourage all our colleagues to join us in working to pass \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nlegislation that is being introduced by my friend and colleague from \nMissouri, Senator Bond. As Chairman of the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions and a member of the Congressional \nCoalition on Adoption, I have been a long-standing supporter of \nlegislation to make adoption easier. This bill does exactly that by \nrequiring federal agencies to reimburse their employees up to $2,000 \nfor all qualified expenses associated with the adoption of a child. \nBoth this bill and its House companion, introduced by Representatives \nTom Bliley and James Oberstar last August, have gathered the support of \na bipartisan group of legislators and numerous groups in the adoption \ncommunity.\n  Currently, many private sector businesses provide financial \nassistance to employees who wish to adopt a child. These businesses \nunderstand that adoption can be a very time-consuming, exhausting, and \nexpensive process for parents. Relieving the financial burden on their \nemployees will not only help encourage adoption, but also produce a \nhappier and more productive work force.\n  The legislation being introduced today provides a benefit for our own \nhard-working federal employees. In the process, it brings the federal \ngovernment up to par with those private-sector businesses that already \nprovide financial assistance to employees adopting a child. Even \nfurther, it establishes a leadership role for the federal government in \nthis area. This hopefully will encourage even more businesses to assist \ntheir employees financially should they wish to adopt a child.\n  I am proud to stand today with several of my colleagues as co-\nsponsors of the Federal Employees Adoption Assistance Act of 2000. I \nhope the Senate will proceed quickly to pass this legislation. It makes \nsense, both for the approximately 110,000 children currently awaiting \nadoption in the United States, and for those federal employees who are \nwilling and able to provide a home for them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, and Mr. Gorton):\n  S. 2228.

A bill to provide for digital empowerment, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                        digital empowerment act\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Today, I introduce the Digital Empowerment Act. The \ngoal of this legislation is to ensure that every child is computer \nliterate by the eighth grade regardless of race, ethnicity, income, \ngender, geography, or disability.\n  Yesterday, the Senate's Education Committee voted for my amendment to \nestablish this as our national goal. This vote was taken on a \nbipartisan basis and was unanimous. Today, I am introducing this \nlegislation to make this goal a reality. This bill has been a team \neffort. I reached out to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the \nCongressional Black Caucus, to my colleagues, the people throughout \nMaryland, ministers in Baltimore, business leaders, educators, and \npolitical leadership. Why? It is because a digital divide exists in \nAmerica. Those who have access to technology and know how to use it \nwill be ready for the new digital economy. Those who don't will be left \nout and left behind.\n  Low-income urban and rural families are less likely to have access to \nthe Internet and computers. Black and Hispanic families are only two-\nfifths as likely to have Internet access as their white counterparts. \nSome schools have 10 computers in every classroom. In other schools, \nthere are 200 students who share one computer. The private sector is \ndoing important and exciting work, such as Power Up from AOL, but \ntechnology empowerment can't be limited to a few zip codes. What we \nneed is a national policy and national programs.\n  Mr. President, I believe the best antipoverty program is an \neducation. If we practice the ABCs, we will ensure that our children \nhave a good education and will cross this digital divide. Crossing the \ndigital divide is about technology and about children having access to \ntechnology. It is about teachers knowing how to teach children the \ntools of technology so they can cross this digital divide.\n  The ABCs are simply this: Access--each child must have universal \naccess to computers, whether it is in a school, a library, or a \ncommunity center. Many families cannot afford to buy computers for \ntheir homes, but children in America should have access to them through \npublic institutions.\n  We also need to practice the B--best-trained teachers and, I might \nadd, better-paid teachers.\n  But C would be computer literacy for all students by the time they \nfinish eighth grade.\n  My Digital Empowerment Act will, first of all, create a one-stop shop \nfor Federal education technology programs at the Department of \nEducation. Why do we need this? Well, right now, our programs are \nscattered throughout the Department. School superintendents have to \nforage to be able to find that information, and when they do, they find \nthe funding is absolutely spartan or skimpy. That is why my legislation \nalso improves our schools in terms of access to technology and teacher \ntraining.\n  Teachers want to help their students cross the digital divide, but \nthey are facing three major problems. One, they need technology. They \nneed hardware and software. They need training to use the technology \nbecause without training of the teachers or librarians, it is a hollow \nopportunity.\n  In my own home State of Maryland, over 600 teachers from across the \nState volunteered to participate in a tech-prep academy so they could \nbe ready. But hundreds were turned away. For every one teacher who can \nsign up for tech-prep training, four or five are standing in line to do \nso.\n  My bill addresses these concerns. We are going to double funding for \nschool technology and for teacher training. We now spend less than half \na billion dollars on training and technology for our schools. We would \ndouble that to $850 million. But we also have to make sure we go where \nchildren learn, and that is in the community. Right now, what we find \nis that the only reliable source of revenue for wiring schools and \nlibraries is the E-rate. But, the E-rate does not go to community \ncenters.\n\n  Whether it is an African-American church or a community center in an \nAppalachian region or rural parts of the South or the upper regions of \nAlaska, what my legislation would do is help community centers. My \nlegislation would create an E-corps within the AmeriCorps national \nservice program. It would bring AmeriCorps volunteers with special \ntechnology training into our schools and into our communities.\n  I recently had a town hall meeting in an elementary school in \nRiverdale, MD. The teachers and students told me they need extra pairs \nof hands to help out in the computer lab to be able to teach the \nchildren. Also, we want to create 1,000 community tech centers. \nCommunity leaders have told me we need to bring technology to where \nkids learn, not just where we want them to learn. Our legislation would \ncreate 1,000 community-based centers that would be run by community \norganizations such as the YMCA and YWCA, Urban League, or a faith-based \norganization, where children could be there for structured afterschool \nactivities, and also adults could be there earlier in the day to \ndevelop their job skills.\n  Government cannot do this alone. We want public-private partnerships. \nI want to use our Tax Code to encourage public-private partnerships. \nThis bill uses our Tax Code to encourage the donations of technology, \ntechnology training, and technology maintenance for schools, libraries \nand community centers.\n  Mr. President, that is the core of our program. We are living in \nexciting times. The opportunities are tremendous to use technology to \nimprove our lives, to use technology to remove the barriers caused by \nincome, race, or ethnicity. Technology could mean the death of distance \nas a barrier for bringing jobs into the rural areas of our country. We \nwant technology to be the death of discrimination where children have \nbeen left out or left aside. Bringing this technology into schools and \nlibraries would enable children to leapfrog into the future.\n  Technology is the tool, but empowerment is the outcome. We want to be \nsure each child in the United States of America, by being computer \nliterate by the time they are in the eighth grade, will be ready for \nthe new economy. We hope that by setting that as a national goal we \nwill get children to stay in school and know that the future lies in \nworking in this new economy.\n  I thank everybody who worked on this bill with me. I thank everyone \non my staff who helped me, including Julia Frifield, Jill Shapiro, and \nAndrea Vernot. This has truly been a team effort. I am pleased that I \nhave 25 cosponsors from the U.S. Senate on this legislation. I hope \nthat kind of bipartisan support will move this legislation forward.\n  I will conclude by saying this is a tremendous opportunity. This is \nnot about a laundry list of new Government programs. We are here to \nmake the highest and best use of the programs that exist, a wise and \nprudent use of taxpayer funds, and also to say to each child in America \nif you want to learn and get ready for the new economy, your Federal \nGovernment is on your side.\n  I give all praise and thanks to the Dear Lord who has inspired me to \ndo this and gives me the opportunity to serve in the Senate. I truly \nbelieve one person can make a difference. I am trying to do that with \nthis legislation. If we can work together, I know we will be able to \nbring about change--change for our children and change for the better.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to join Senator Mikulski \nin introducing the National Digital Empowerment Act, which seeks to \nclose the gap between those who have technology available to them and \nthose who do not. I commend Senator Mikulski for her commitment to \nconnect every school and community to the Information Superhighway. The \nlegislation we are introducing will help to achieve this goal. It will \nenable students and teachers in all communities to have access to \ncomputers, as well as the training that is necessary to use this \ntechnology effectively.\n\n[[Page S1398]]\n\n  The widening digital divide falls heaviest on those who can least \nafford to be left behind. Recent studies show that the Digital divide \nfor the poorest Americans has grown by 29 percent since 1997, and that \nover 50 percent of schools lack the infrastructure needed to support \nnew technology. In addition, approximately 4 out of 10 teachers report \nthat they have had no training in using the Internet; and a mere 10 \npercent of new teachers reported that they felt prepared to use \ntechnology in their classrooms, while only 13 percent of all public \nschools reported that technology-related training for teachers was \nmandated by the school, district, or teacher certification agencies. \nThis legislation will provide the necessary tools to reverse this \ntrend.\n  It will substantially increase funding for teacher training in \ntechnology, including the creation of Teacher Technology Preparation \nAcademies--teachers who are trained by the Academies would be \nencouraged to return to their schools and act as technology instructors \nfor other teachers; increase funding for school technology; extend the \ncurrent enhanced deduction for computer technology which is currently \ndue to expire in 2001; require HUD to establish e-Villages in all HUD \nhousing programs; authorize and increase funding for the creation of \nCommunity Technology Centers and e-corps within the AmeriCorps; create \na one stop shop clearinghouse of public and private technology efforts \nwithin the U.S. Department of Education to be headed by an Assistant \nSecretary for Technology Education. In addition, the legislation \ndirects the Secretary to implement an Internet-based, one-to-one pilot \nproject that specifically targets the educational needs of K-12 \nstudents in low-income school districts, including hardware, software \nand ongoing support and professional development; and improve the e-\nRate program.\n  After two funding cycles the total e-Rate funding that went to our \nnation's schools and libraries was $3.6 billion nationally, including \n$137.15 million for Michigan. That is a good investment to help prepare \nour children and citizens for the information age of the 21st century. \nBut it is still not sufficient to provide all qualified schools and \nlibraries with the e-Rate discounts they have requested. This \nlegislation would improve the Universal Service Fund by making the e-\nRate application process simpler, and would increase the current cap of \n$2.25 billion and expand eligibility to include structured after school \nprograms, Head Start centers and programs receiving federal job \ntraining funds. The e-Rate has proven itself to be a successful and \npopular program and its time to make it available to everyone who needs \nit.\n  I am especially pleased to be a part of this legislative effort \nbecause it supports some model initiatives that I have established in \nmy home state of Michigan, to create ways in which teachers can become \nmore computer literate and able to integrate technology into the \ncurriculum and to bring technology into every classroom.\n  About 2 years ago, I convened an education technology summit that \nbrought together over 400 business leaders, school administrators, \nschool board members, foundation representatives, deans of Michigan's \ncolleges of education and others to identify ways in which Michigan \ncould excel in the area of Education technology. What I learned was \nthat one of the biggest obstacles to technologically up-do-date \nclassrooms is the lack of training of our teachers in the use of \ntechnology. If teachers don't understand how to integrate computers, \nthe Internet, and other technology into the instructional program, \nstudents won't get full advantage of these innovations, no matter how \nmuch hardware and wiring have been installed.\n  Despite impressive achievements in the utilization of education \ntechnology in a few localities, Michigan as a whole was below the \nnational average in every measure of the use of technology in our \nschools. It ranked 44 in teacher training in the use of technology; and \n10 percent of teachers reported that they had less than 9 hours of \ntechnology training. In addition, Michigan ranked 32 among the states \nin the ratio of students per computer. I have subsequently hosted a \nnumber of working sessions which have resulted in a specific plan of \naction to advance education technology in Michigan.\n  Some key elements of the plan of action include the formation of a \nconsortium that will establish the nation's highest standards for \ntraining new teachers to use technology in the classroom. Beginning \nwith the 1999-2000 academic year, the Consortium for Outstanding \nAchievement in Teaching with Technology {COATT} will award certificates \nof recognition to new teachers who have demonstrated an exceptional \nability to use information technology as a teaching tool.\n  COATT membership includes an impressive slate of higher educational \ninstitutions from Michigan: Albion College, Andrews University, Eastern \nMichigan University, Ferris State University, Lake Superior State \nUniversity, Michigan State University, Oakland University, University \nof Detroit-Mercy, University of Michigan, University of Michigan-\nDearborn, Wayne State University and Western Michigan University. \nNeither the education nor the certificate is mandatory. However, new \nteachers with certificates will have an advantage in the job market and \nschool districts will benefit by knowing which applicants are qualified \nin using technology effectively in their instruction. The letter of \nagreement signed by each COATT member in committing their institution \nto provide the resources to achieve the success of the COATT initiative \nwhich is included at the end of my remarks.\n  Michigan is already recognized as a leader in producing new teachers \nand if we set our minds to it, I'm convinced we can be the best in the \nnation when it comes to teaching teachers how to integrate technology \nin the classroom.\n  Another key element of my plan of action to advance Michigan's \nstanding in education technology is the establishment of the Teach for \nTomorrow Project, TFT, an online delivery system for educational \ntechnology training and credentialing of in-service teachers. By using \ntechnology to teach the technology, lessons can be accessed statewide \nand at time and location which are convenient to the learners. An added \nbonus, which results in an expansion of the use of technology in the \nclassroom, is that teachers who complete TFT teach other teachers what \nthey have learned. Central Michigan University has approved the use of \nTFT materials as a professional development course eligible for 3 \ngraduate credit hours when done in conjunction with local onsite \ntraining.\n  The legislation before us, the National Digital Empowerment Act, will \nspeed the closing of the digital divide not only in my state of \nMichigan, but nationwide. Time is of the essence. We must act \nresponsibly and we must act now!\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the \nCOATT member agreement signed by higher education institutions in \nMichigan.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Consortium for Outstanding Achievement in Teaching With Technology \n                          Letter of Agreement\n\n       We, the undersigned, commit our institutions to be members \n     of the Consortium for Outstanding Achievement in Teaching \n     with Technology (COATT).

A bill to provide tax relief in relation to, and modify the \ntreatment of, members of a reserve component of the Armed Forces, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          THE MILITARY GUARD AND RESERVE FAIRNESS ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \naddressing a very important issue-fairness for the Guard and Reserve \nmembers in our armed forces.\n  Le me begin with a February 3rd report from the Washington Post \ntitled ``A Tough Goodbye: Guard Members Leave for Nine Months in \nBosnia.'' It reads ``Sgt. Deedra Lavoie was alone, after leaving her \ntwo young children with her ex-husband. Sgt. Bill Wozniak, hugging his \n3-year-old daughter, was worried about not having the same job when he \nreturns in nine months. Staff Sgt. Stephen Smith won't have a home to \ncome back to: Movers have cleared out his Annapolis apartment, which he \ncan't afford to keep while overseas.''\n  This brings home, Mr. President, the real hardship that thousands of \nGuards and Reservists, and their families, are facing today.\n  The traditional duty of the National Guards and reservists was to \nkeep domestic peace or fight in wars. But as the number of our Armed \nForces has fallen by more than 1 million personnel since 1988, \nincreasing numbers of our Guards and Reserve members are being pulled \nout of the private sector and into what amounts to at times to be full-\ntime military service.\n  They are often called on to carry out overseas peacekeeping, \nhumanitarian and other missions. Their deployment time is longer than \never before in peacetime. Today we rely heavily on our Guardsmen and \nReservists to support overseas contingency operations. Since 1990, they \nhave been called to service in Operation RESTORE HOPE in Somalia, \nOperation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY in Haiti, Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR/JOINT \nGUARD in Bosnia, Operation STABILIZE in Southeast Asia and Operation \nTASK FORCE FALCON in Kosovo.\n  Mr. President, the statistics speak for themselves:\n  Work days contributed by Guardsmen and Reservists have risen from 1 \nmillion days in 1992, to over 13 million days last year. Without the \nservice of these citizen soldiers, we would need an additional force of \n35,000 soldiers to do the job.\n  43,000 Guardsmen and Reservists have served in Bosnia and Kosovo from \nDecember 1995 through March 1, 2000. This is 33 percent of the total \nArmed Forces personnel participating in that region during that period.\n  Mr. President, Guardsmen and Reservists are willing to do their duty \nand serve when they are called, but increasingly frequent overseas \ndeployments create tremendous hardship for them, and their families, as \nwell their employers. We need to give our reserve forces fair treatment \nby improving the quality of life both for them and their dependents. We \nmust help their employers adjust as well.\n  That's why I am introducing the Military Guard and Reserve Fairness \nAct of 2000. This bill would do the following:\n  First, my legislation would exempt federal tax on the base pay for \nenlisted Guardsmen and Reservists and exempt federal tax on the base \npay of Guard and Reserve officers up to the highest level of that if \nenlisted Guardsmen and Reservists' base pay during their overseas \ndeployment.\n  The majority of Guardsmen and Reservists take pay cuts when called up \nfor involuntary overseas deployment, and sustain a huge financial loss. \nOur active duty military personnel enjoy federal tax exemption on their \nbase pay, why not our Guardsmen and Reservists who perform the same \nduty as full-time military personnel?\n  Secondly, my legislation would provide a tax credit to employers who \nemploy Guardsmen and Reservists. The tax credit would be equal to 50 \npercent of the amount of compensation that would have been paid to an \nemployee during the time that the employee participates in contingency \noperations. However, the credit is capped at $2000 for each individual \nReservist employee and a maximum of $30,000 for all employees. This \nprovision would apply to the self-employed as well.\n  Despite the fact that most businesses are fully supportive of the \nmilitary obligations of their employees, studies show that the \nincreasingly long overseas deployments have created a new strain on \nGuard/Reserve-employer relations. One of the reasons is that the \nunplanned absence of Guard/Reservist-employees creates a variety of \nproblems for employers. Employers have to hire and train temporary \nemployees, budget for overtime, or reschedule work and deadlines. As a \nresult, it increases employer costs, reducing revenue and profits. This \nis particularly problematic for small business and the self-employed.\n  The Defense Department acknowledges the increased use of the Guard \nand Reserve and that unplanned contingency operations do create \nproblems for employers. DOD suggests that a financial incentive may \nhelp to correct some of the problems.\n  The tax credit included in my bill would offset at least some of the \nexpense that Guard and Reserve employers face, and help reduce tension \nwith employees.\n  Third, the Military Guard and Reserve Fairness Act would provide \nfederal income tax deductions for transportation, meals and lodging \nexpenses incurred in performance of Guard and Reserve military duty.\n  Mr. President, many Guardsmen and Reservists have to travel to a \nReserve center, such as a National Guard Armory, far away from their \nhome areas for drills or training.\n  Often Guardsmen and Reservists incur expenses for transportation, \nmeals, lodging and other necessities. Before 1986, members of the Guard \nand Reserve could deduct these costs as business expenses. But the Tax \nReform Act of 1986 eliminated this deduction.\n  This is not fair. This nation requires our Guard and Reserve members \nto perform their duty but also expects them to bear the expense. \nRestoring the deductibility would help restore fairness for Reservists.\n  The Military Guard and Reserve Fairness Act would also include a \nnumber of provisions that would give our Guard and Reserve members fair \ntreatment by improving their quality of life.\n  It would extend space-available travel (``Space-A'') to Reservists \nand the National Guard, to travel outside of the United States--the \nsame level as retired military, and gives the Guardsmen and Reservists \nthe same priority status as active duty personnel when traveling for \ntheir monthly drills.\n  It would grant so-called ``gray area retirees'' the right to travel \nSpace-A under the same conditions as the retired military receiving \nretired pay as well.\n  In addition, my legislation would provide Guardsmen and Reservists, \nwhen traveling to attend monthly military drills, the same billeting \nprivileges as active duty personnel.\n  The bill would also remove the annual Guard and Reserve retirement \npoint maximum--upon which retirement pensions are based--and allow \nretirement pensions to be based upon the actual number of points earned \nannually.\n  Finally, my legislation would extend free legal services to Guardsmen \nand Reservists by Judge Advocate General officers for a time equal to \ntwice the length of their last period of active duty service.\n  Mr. President, our Guard and Reserve members are being called upon to \nperform more overseas active duty assignments to keep pace with the \nrising\n\n[[Page S1400]]\n\nnumber of U.S. peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. I believe that \nthis increase in overseas active-duty assignments for Guard and Reserve \ncomponent members merits the extension of military benefits for our \nNation's citizen soldiers. It is only fair to close these disparities.\n  The passage of my Military Guard and Reserve Fairness Act would \nrestore fairness to our Guard and Reserve members, and it would greatly \nincrease morale and the quality of life for our National Guard and \nReserves and prevent problems of recruitment and retention in the \nfuture. Hence, it would strengthen our national defense and increase \nour military readiness. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of \nour military Guard and Reserves.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Bryan, Mr. L. Chafee, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Moynihan, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mr. Lugar, and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 2232. A bill to promote primary and secondary health promotion and \ndisease prevention services and activities among the elderly, to amend \ntitle XVIII of the Social Security Act to add preventive benefits, and \nfor other purpose; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     medicare wellness act of 2000\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today, along with my colleagues, \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Bingaman, Senator Chafee, Senator Bryan, \nSenator Rockefeller, Senator Kerry, Senator Murray, Senator Moynihan, \nSenator Lugar, and Senator Snowe, I introduce the Medicare Wellness Act \nof 2000.\n  The Medicare Wellness Act represents a concerted effort by myself and \nmy distinguished colleagues to change the fundamental focus of the \nMedicare program.\n  it changes the program from one that simply treats illness and \ndisability, to one that is also proactive.\n  Enhancing the focus on health promotion and disease prevention for \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, despite common misperceptions, declines in health \nstatus are not inevitable with age. A healthier lifestyle, even one \nadopted later in life, can increase active life expectancy and decrease \ndisability.\n  This fact is a major reason why The Medicare Wellness Act has support \nfrom a broad range of groups, including the National Council on Aging, \nPartnership for Prevention, American Heart Association, and the \nNational Osteoporosis Foundation.\n  The most significant aspect of this bill is its addition of several \nnew preventative screening and counseling benefits to the Medicare \nprogram.\n  The benefits being added focus on some of the most prominent, \nunderlying risk factors for illness that face all Medicare \nbeneficiaries, including: screening for hypertension, counseling for \ntobacco cessation, screening for glaucoma, counseling for hormone \nreplacement therapy, screening for vision and hearing loss, nutrition \ntherapy, expanding screening and counseling for osteoporosis, and \nscreening for cholesterol.\n  The new benefits added by The Medicare Wellness Act represent the \nhighest recommendations for Medicare beneficiaries of the Institute of \nMedicine and the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force--recognized as \nthe gold standard within the prevention community.\n  Attaching these prominent risk factors will reduce Medicare \nbeneficiaries' risk for health problems such as stroke, diabetes, and \nosteoporosis, heart disease, and blindness.\n  The addition of these new benefits would accelerate the fundamental \nshift, that began in 1997 under the Balanced Budget Act, in the \nMedicare program from a sickness program to a wellness program.\n  Prior to 1997, only three preventive benefits were available to \nbeneficiaries, pneumococcal vaccines, pap smears, and mammography. \nOther major components of our bill include the establishment of the \nHealthy Seniors Promoting Program.\n  This program will be led by an interagency workgroup within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n  It will being together all the agencies within HHS that address the \nmedical, social and behavioral issues affecting the elderly and \ninstructs them to undertake a series of studies which will increase \nknowledge about the utilization of prevention services among the \nelderly.\n  In addition, The Medicare Wellness Act incorporates an aggressive \napplied and original research effort that will investigate ways to \nimprove the utilization of current and new preventive benefits and to \ninvestigate new methods of improving the health of Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, this latter point is critical. The fact is that there \nare a number of prevention-related services available to Medicare \nbeneficiaries today, including mammograms and colorectal cancer \nscreening. But those services are seriously underutilized.\n\n  In a study published by Dartmouth University this spring (The \nDartmouth Atlas of Health Care 1999), it was found that only 28 percent \nof women age 65-69 receive mammograms and only 12 percent of the \nbeneficiaries were screened for colorectal cancer.\n  These are disturbing figures and they clearly demonstrate the need to \nfind new and better ways to increase the rates of utilization of \nproven, demonstrated prevention services.\n  Our bill would get us the information we need to increase rates of \nutilization for these services. Further, our bill would establish a \nhealth risk appraisal and education program aimed at major behavioral \nrisk factors such as diet, exercise, alcohol and tobacco use, and \ndepression.\n  This program will target both pre-65 individuals and current Medicare \nbeneficiaries. The main goal of this program is to increase awareness \namong individuals of major risk factors that impact on health, to \nchange personal health habits, improve health status, and save the \nMedicare program money. Our bill would require the Medicare Payment \nAdvisory Commission, known as MedPAC, to report to Congress every two \nyears and assess how the program needs to change over time in order to \nreflect modern benefits and treatment.\n  Shockingly, this is information that Congress currently does not \nreceive on a routine basis. And this is a contributing factor to why we \nfind ourselves today in a quandary over the outdated nature of the \nMedicare program. Quite frankly, Medicare hasn't kept up with the rest \nof the health care world. While a vintage wine from the 1960s may be \ndesirable, a health care system that is vintage 1965 is not. We need to \ndo better.\n  Our bill would also require the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to \nconduct a study every five years to assess the scientific validity of \nthe entire preventive benefits package. The study will be presented to \nCongress in a manner that mirrors The Trade Act of 1974. The IOM's \nrecommendations would be presented to Congress in legislative form. \nCongress would then have 60 days to review and then either accept or \nreject the IOM's recommendations for changes to the Medicare program. \nBut Congress could not change the IOM's recommendations.\n\n  This ``fast-track'' process is a deliberate effort to get Congress \nout of the business of micro-managing the Medicare program. While \nlimited to preventive benefits, this will offer a litmus test on a new \napproach to future Medicare decision making.\n  In the aggregate, The Medicare Wellness Act represents the most \ncomprehensive legislative proposal in the 106th Congress for the \nMedicare program focused on health promotion and disease prevention for \nbeneficiaries. It provides new screening and counseling benefits for \nbeneficiaries, it provides critically needed research dollars, and it \ntests new treatment concepts through demonstration programs.\n  The Medicare Wellness Act represents sound health policy based on \nsound science.\n  Before I conclude, I have a few final thoughts.\n  There are many here in Congress who argue that at a time when \nMedicare faces an uncertain financial future, this is the last time to \nbe adding new benefits to a program that can ill afford the benefits it \ncurrently offers. Normally I would agree with this assertion. But the \nissue of prevention is different. The old adage of ``an ounce of \nprevention is worth a pound of cure'' is very relevant here. Does \nmaking preventive benefits available to Medicare beneficiaries ``cost'' \nmoney? Sure it does.\n\n  But the return on the investment, the avoidance of the pound of cure \nand\n\n[[Page S1401]]\n\nthe related improvement in quality of life is unmistakable.\n  Along these lines, a longstanding problem facing lawmakers and \nadvocates of prevention has been the position taken by the \nCongressional Budget Office, as it evaluates the budgetary impact of \nall legislative proposals.\n  Only costs incurred by the Federal Government over the next 10 years \ncan be considered in weighing the ``cost'' of adding new benefits. From \na public health and quality of life standpoint, this premise is \nunacceptable.\n  Among the problems with this practice is that ``savings'' incurred by \nincreasing the availability and utilization of preventive benefits \noften occur over a period of time greater than 10 years.\n  This problem is best illustrated in an examination of the \n``compression of morbidity'' theory developed by Dr. James Fries of \nStanford University over 20 years ago.\n  According to Dr. Fries, by delaying the onset of chronic illness \namong seniors, there is a resulting decrease in the length of time \nillness or disability is present in the latter stages of life. This \n``compression'' improves quality of life and reduces the rate of growth \nin health care costs.\n  But, these changes are gradual and occur over an extended period of \ntime--10, 20, even 30 years.\n  With the average life expectancy of individuals who reach 65 being \nnearly 20 years--20 years for women and 18 years for men--it only makes \nsense to look at services and benefits that improve quality of life and \nreduce costs to the Federal Government for that 20 year lifespan.\n  In addition to increased lifespan, a 10 year budget scoring window \ndoesn't factor into consideration the impact of such services on the \nprivate sector, such as increased productivity and reduced absenteeism, \nfor the many seniors that continue working beyond age 65.\n  The bottom line is, the most important reason to cover preventive \nservices is to improve health.\n  While prevention services in isolation won't reduce costs, they will \nmoderate increases in the utilization and spending on more expensive \nacute and chronic treatment services.\n  As Congress considers different ways to reform Medicare, two basic \nquestions regarding preventive services and the elderly must be part of \nthe debate.\n  (1) Is the value of improved quality of life worth the expenditure? \nAnd,\n  (2) How important is if for the Medicare population to be able to \nmaintain healthy, functional and productive lives?\n  These are just some of the questions we must answer in the coming \ndebate over Medicare reform.\n  While improving Medicare's financial outlook for future generations \nis imperative, we must do it in a way that gives our seniors the \nability to live longer, healthier and valued lives.\n  I believe that by pursuing a prevention strategy that addresses some \nof the most fundamental risk factors for chronic illness and disability \nthat face seniors, we will make an invaluable contribution to the \nMedicare reform debate and, more importantly, to our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would be remiss in pointing out that the \nMedicare Wellness Act represents the first time in this Congress that \nRepublicans and Democrats have gotten together in support of a major \npiece of Medicare reform legislation.\n  This bill represents a health care philosophy that bridges political \nboundaries. It just makes sense. And you see that common sense approach \ntoday from myself and my esteemed colleagues who have joined me in the \nintroduction of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to join us on this important \nbill and to work with us to ensure that the provisions of this bill are \nreflected in any Medicare reform legislation that is debated and voted \non this year in the Senate.\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator \nGraham today in introducing the Medicare Wellness Act of 2000. Our \nnation's rapidly growing senior population and the ongoing search for \ncost-effective health care have led to the development of this \nimportant bipartisan legislation. The goal of the Medicare Wellness Act \nis to increase access to preventive health services, improve the \nquality of life for America's seniors, and increase the cost-\neffectiveness of the Medicare program.\n  Congress created the Medicare program in 1965 to provide health \ninsurance for Americans age 65 and over. From the outset, the program \nhas focused on coverage for hospital services needed for an unexpected \nor intensive illness. In recent years, however, a great escalation in \nprogram expenditures and an increase in knowledge about the value of \npreventive care have forced policy makers to re-evaluate the current \nMedicare benefit package.\n  The Medicare Wellness Act adds to the Medicare program those benefits \nrecommended by the Institute of Medicine and the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force. These include: screening for hypertension, \ncounseling for tobacco cessation, screening for glaucoma, counseling \nfor hormone replacement therapy, screening for vision and hearing loss, \ncholesterol screening, expanded screening and counseling for \nosteoporosis, and nutrition therapy counseling. These services address \nthe most prominent risk facing Medicare beneficiaries.\n  In 1997, Congress added several new preventive benefits to the \nMedicare program through the Balanced Budget Act. These benefits \nincluded annual mammography, diabetes self-management, prostate cancer \nscreening, pelvic examinations, and colorectal cancer screening. \nCongress's next logical step is to incorporate the nine new screening \nand counseling benefits in the Medicare Wellness Act. If these symptoms \nare addressed regularly, beneficiaries will have a head start on \nfighting the conditions they lead to, such as diabetes, lung cancer, \nheart disease, blindness, osteoporosis, and many others.\n  Research suggests that insurance coverage encourages the use of \npreventive and other health care services. The Medicare Wellness Act \nalso eliminates the cost-sharing requirement for new and current \npreventive benefits in the program. Because screening services are \ndirected at people without symptoms, this will further encourage the \nuse of services by reducing the cost barrier to care. Increased use of \nscreening services will mean that problems will be caught earlier, \nwhich will permit more successful treatment. This will save the \nMedicare program money because it is cheaper to screen for an illness \nand treat its early diagnosis than to pay for drastic hospital \nprocedures at a later date.\n  However, financial access is not the only barrier to the use of \npreventive care services. Other barriers include low levels of \neducation of information for beneficiaries. That is why the Medicare \nWellness Act instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \ncoordinate with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the \nHealth Care Financing Administration to establish a Risk Appraisal and \nEducation Program within Medicare. This program will target both \ncurrent beneficiaries and individuals with high risk factors below the \nage of 65. Outreach to these groups will offer questions regarding \nmajor behaviorial risk factors, including the lack of proper nutrition, \nthe use of alcohol, the lack of regular exercise, the use of tobacco, \nand depression. State of the art software, case managers, and nurse \nhotlines will then identify what conditions beneficiaries are at risk \nfor, based on their individual responses to the questions, then refer \nthem to preventive screening services in their area and inform them of \nactions they can take to lead a healthier life.\n\n  The Medicare Wellness Act also establishes the Healthy Seniors \nPromotion Program. This program will bring together all the agencies \nwithin the Department of Health and Human Services that address the \nmedical, social and behavorial issues affecting the elderly to increase \nknowledge about and utilization of prevention services among the \nelderly, and develop better ways to prevent or delay the onset of age-\nrelated disease or disability.\n  Mr. President, now is the time for Medicare to catch up with current \nhealth science. We need a Medicare program that will serve the health \ncare needs of America's seniors by utilizing up-to-date knowledge of \nhealthy aging. Effective health care must address the whole health of \nan individual. A lifestyle that includes proper exercise and\n\n[[Page S1402]]\n\nnutrition, and access to regular disease screening ensures attention to \nthe whole individual, not just a solitary body part. It is time we \nreaffirm our commitment to provide our nation's seniors with quality \nhealth care.\n  It is my hope that my colleagues in Congress will examine this \nlegislation and realize the inadequately of the current package of \npreventive benefits in the Medicare program. We have the opportunity to \ntransform Medicare from an out-dated sickness program to a modern \nwellness program. I want to thank Senator Bob Graham and all the other \ncosponsors of the Medicare Wellness Act who are supporting this bold \nstep towards successful Medicare reform.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenator Graham of Florida and Senator Jeffords of Vermont, in the \nintroduction of the ``Medicare Wellness Act of 2000.''\n  This bipartisan, bicameral measure represents a recognition of the \nrole that health promotion and disease prevention should play in the \ncare available to Medicare beneficiaries. The bill adds several new \npreventative screening and counseling benefits to the Medicare program. \nSpecifically, the act adds screening for hypertension, counseling for \ntobacco cessation, screening for glaucoma, counseling for hormone \nreplacement therapy, and expanded screening and counseling for \nosteoporosis.\n  My colleagues have addressed most of these aspects of the bill so I \nwill focus my remarks on one additional provision that is pivotal in \nachieving improved health outcomes of beneficiaries with several \nchronic diseases. Specifically, the Medicare Wellness Act of 2000 \nprovides for coverage under Part B of the Medicare program for medical \nnutrition therapy services for beneficiaries who have diabetes, \ncardiovascular disease, or renal disease.\n  Medical nutrition therapy refers to the comprehensive nutrition \nservices provided by registered dietitians as part of the health care \nteam. Medical nutrition therapy has proven to be a medically necessary \nand cost effective way of treating and controlling heart disease, \nstroke, diabetes, high cholesterol, and various renal diseases. \nPatients who receive this therapy require fewer hospitalizations and \nmedications and have fewer complications.\n  The treatment of patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease \naccounts for a full 60 percent of Medicare expenditures. In my home \nstate of New Mexico, Native Americans are experiencing an epidemic of \nType II diabetes. Medical nutrition therapy is integral to their \ndiabetes care and to the prevention of progression of the disease. \nInformation from the Indian Health Service shows that medical nutrition \ntherapy provided by professional dietitians results in significant \nimprovements in medical outcomes in Type II diabetics.\n  Mr. President, while medical nutrition therapy services are currently \ncovered under Medicare Part A for inpatient services, there is no \nconsistent Part B coverage policy for medical nutrition.\n  Nutrition counseling is best conducted outside the hospital setting. \nToday, coverage for nutrition therapy in ambulatory settings is at best \ninconsistent, but most often, non existent.\n  Because of the comparatively low treatment costs and the benefits \nassociated with nutrition therapy, expanded coverage will improve the \nquality of care, outcomes and quality of life for Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  Two years ago, my colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig and I requested \nthat the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine study the \nissue of medical nutrition therapy as a benefit for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. The Institute of Medicine released this study last \nDecember entitled: ``The Role of Nutrition in Maintaining Health in the \nNation's Elderly: Evaluating Coverage of Nutrition Services for the \nMedicare Populations.'' This IOM study reaffirms what I have been \nworking toward the past few years. Namely, it recommended that medical \nnutrition therapy, ``upon referral by a physician, be a reimbursable \nbenefit for Medicare beneficiaries.'' The study substantiates evidence \nof improved patient outcomes associated with nutrition care provided by \nregistered dietitians.\n  Mr. President, I again want to thank my colleagues for including \nmedical nutrition therapy as a key component of the Medicare Wellness \nAct. I look forward to working with them toward passage of the act this \nCongress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD (for himself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Kohl, \n        Mr. Grassley, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. Grams):\n  S. 2233. A bill to prohibit the use of, and provide for remediation \nof water contaminated by, methyl tertiary butyl ether; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                          MTBE ELIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation called \nthe ``MTBE Elimination Act of 2000.'' As I so rise, I thank my \ncolleagues who have cosponsored this legislation. They are Senators \nBayh, Abraham, Kohl, Grassley, Durbin, Brownback, and Grams. I \nappreciate their support and I look forward to talking to each of my \ncolleagues about this very important piece of legislation we are \nintroducing today.\n  Mr. President, the MTBE Elimination Act would ban all across the \ncountry, the chemical compound which is termed MTBE for short. Its \nlonger chemical name is methyl tertiary butyl ether.\n  MTBE is one of the world's most widely used chemicals, and is found \nanywhere in the United States. In fact, it is added to approximately 30 \npercent of our Nation's gasoline supplies. Its use in this country \ndates back at least to about 1979 and was originally added to gasoline \nto boost the octane. For many years, oil companies had added lead to \nfuel in order to improve its performance and to boost octane. The \nFederal Government banned lead in the 1970s, and ultimately it was \nreplaced in many cases by MTBE.\n  Later on, in 1990, Congress amended the Clean Air Act and President \nBush at the time signed those amendments. Those amendments required all \nthe smog filled large cities in this country to have an additive in \ntheir gasoline that would make the gasoline approximately 2.7 percent \noxygen by weight. This is commonly referred to as the oxygenate \nrequirement in our Nation's Clean Air Act.\n  The purpose of that oxygenate requirement was to make the oil \ncompanies produce, and our cars use, a cleaner burning fuel. The idea \nwas to clean up the smog in some of our Nation's largest and most \ncongested cities. That program has worked very well over the last 10 \nyears in cleaning up the smog all across the country, in cities like \nNew York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. My home State of Illinois, of \ncourse, has a large metropolitan area in Chicago. The reformulated fuel \nrequirements that were implemented by the 1990 amendments to the Clean \nAir Act have helped greatly in reducing the emissions from our \nautomobiles, in providing cleaner burning fuels, at least as far as our \nair quality is concerned.\n  As I said earlier, about 30 percent of the gasoline used in this \ncountry is reformulated and has an additive in it, most of which is \nMTBE. In the parts of this country that are required to use \nreformulated fuel, over 80 percent of them are using MTBE as their \noxygenate. The other areas are using another oxygenate known as ethanol \nto meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act. In fact, Chicago and \nMilwaukee both use ethanol as opposed to MTBE.\n  It turns out now that we have mounting evidence that MTBE, while it \nworks well in cleaning up smog, has a problem we had not anticipated, \nand one which very regrettably had not been fully investigated before \nwe started down the path that encouraged a dramatic increase in the \nusage of MTBE. MTBE has, in recent years, been detected in the nation's \ndrinking water all across the country, from the east coast to the west \ncoast. In fact, right now the U.S. Geological Survey is performing an \nongoing evaluation of our nation's drinking water, groundwater supplies \nall across the country. They have not yet completed this survey. If you \nlook at this chart, in the States that are in white, the U.S. \nGeological Survey analysis has not yet been performed.\n  But in the States that are in red, those are the States where they \nhave found MTBE in the groundwater. Incidentally, I believe it is \nsomewhere in the neighborhood of 22 States where\n\n[[Page S1403]]\n\nthey have found methyl tertiary butyl ether in the groundwater.\n  In my home State of Illinois, we do not use much MTBE; ethanol is the \noxygenate of choice. But nonetheless, the Illinois Environmental \nProtection Agency has been finding MTBE in our groundwater. So far, \nthey have found MTBE in at least 25 different cities all across the \nState, and many Illinois municipalities have not tested the \ngroundwater. Three of these cities have had to switch their source of \ndrinking water and go to other wells because there was a sufficient \namount of MTBE in that water to make it undrinkable.\n  About a month ago, CBS News, in their program ``60 Minutes,'' did a \nreport on how MTBE has been turning up with greater and greater \nfrequency in our Nation's drinking water supplies. During that report, \nwhich seemed to me to be very well researched, it was noticed that this \nchemical, MTBE, has some very interesting properties.\n  Unlike most of the other components of gasoline which, when it leaks \nout accidentally from underground storage tanks or out of pipes which \ncarry fuel--there are leaks now and then; we try to prevent them, but \nthey do occur--most of the components of gasoline are absorbed in the \nsoil and do not make it down to the ground water.\n  MTBE is a pesky substance, however, that resists microbial degrading \nin the ground and rapidly seeks out the ground water. It resists \ndegrading as it finds its way to the water. Then once it gets into the \nwater, it rapidly spreads. It has properties that, when it is in \ndrinking water in very minute quantities, between 20 to 40 parts per \nbillion, make the drinking water undrinkable. I say undrinkable because \nit makes the water smell and taste like turpentine.\n  There have been studies that have shown that a single cup of MTBE \nrenders 5 million gallons of water undrinkable. I say it makes the \nwater undrinkable. The fact is, we do not know exactly what health \neffects it has on humans who ingest the water. Very few studies have \nbeen done on what happens to humans who consume MTBE. There have been \nstudies of laboratory rats that suggest it is a possible carcinogen, \nand the EPA has recognized MTBE as a possible cause of cancer.\n  We need to do more research on MTBE's effects on human health. We \nsimply do not know all that much about this chemical. However, we do \nknow that most people, when they smell the turpentine-like smell or \ntaste of it, it inspires an instant revulsion and they do not want to \ndrink the water. It is almost a moot point as to whether it has ill \nhealth effects because it makes the water undrinkable. Most humans will \nrecoil at the thought of drinking that type of water.\n  In the ``60 Minutes'' segment I referred to earlier, they went to a \ntown in California where literally most of the town has left because \ntheir water has this MTBE in it. Many of the businesses have closed up, \nmany of the people have left, and for those remaining in that \ncommunity, the State of California is trucking in fresh water for them \nto drink. It is a very serious problem.\n  There have been a few cities around the country--I believe there is \none in the Carolinas, and also Santa Barbara, CA--where they had sued \noil companies and won judgments to clean up the ground water in which \nthey detected MTBE.\n  In order to address this alarming trend of finding this pesky, \nhorrible chemical in our drinking water all across the country with \nincreasing frequency, I, with my colleagues, am introducing the MTBE \nElimination Act. This act will do four things: First, it will phase \nMTBE out gradually over 3 years. The way the bill accomplishes that is \nit amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to add methyl tertiary butyl \nether to the list of proscribed toxic substances in this country.\n  It will eliminate the MTBE over 3 years because it will be hard to \nsimply switch our Nation's gasoline supply overnight. To be realistic, \nit will take a period of time. The bill allows discretion for the EPA \nto establish a timetable and a framework for this MTBE phase-out.\n  Secondly, the bill will require that gasoline which is dispensed at \nthe pump containing MTBE be labeled so people know when they are \nfilling up their car with gasoline that it contains this additive, and \nthis chemical is being used in their community. In many cases, of \ncourse, people are not even aware of this chemical. They have never \nheard of it. We were very surprised in Illinois. We did not think much \nMTBE was even used in Illinois. Then we found it in our ground water.\n\n  Third, the bill authorizes grants for research on MTBE ground water \ncontamination and remediation. It directs resources to do more research \non the health effects of this chemical too. We need to know more about \nthis chemical in order to combat it. Right now we do not fully \nunderstand the health risks. Most of the studies that have been done, \nof which I am aware, are on laboratory mice, and there have been very \nfew studies, if any, on the effects to humans who ingest or inhale this \nchemical.\n  We also need research on how we remediate the chemical, how we clean \nit up because, in addition to all of its other properties, it turns out \nit is very difficult to eliminate. Our normal processes for eliminating \nhazardous chemicals from ground water, in many cases, according to the \nliterature, do not seem to work on MTBE. EPA needs to research this \nissue and help the rest of the country have a body of knowledge, so \nwhen they find MTBE contamination, they know how to clean it up or \nremediate it.\n  The bill contains a section which expresses the sense of the Senate \nthat the EPA, our national Environmental Protection Agency, should \nprovide technical assistance, information, and matching funds to our \nlocal communities that are testing their underground water supplies and \nalso trying to remediate and clean up MTBE that has been detected in \nthose water supplies.\n  Finally, as an afterthought, some of my colleagues may be asking: \nWhat will we do about that portion of the Clean Air Act that requires \nour fuel in this country, at least in the smog-filled large cities, to \nhave an oxygenate in it to reduce smog emissions? There is an answer. \nWe do have an alternative--a renewable source produced from corn or \nother biomass products. It is called ethanol.\n  In my judgment, ethanol will allow us to meet the requirements of the \nClean Air Act all across the country, and it will not require us to \nmake that terrible choice between clean air and clean water. I want our \ncountry to have clean air and clean water and never one at the expense \nof the other. Ethanol, in my judgment, provides the answer to that \nproblem.\n  The USDA recently did a study using ethanol to replace MTBE all \nacross the country. It would mean, on average, about $1 billion in \nadded income to our farmers every year.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. First, I congratulate my colleague for the introduction \nof this legislation. I am happy to cosponsor it. It is truly bipartisan \nlegislation which is of benefit not only to the farmers in our State of \nIllinois but to our Nation.\n  We understand, as most people do in Washington, the benefits of \nethanol when it comes to reducing air pollution. We also understand the \ndangers of MTBE. Where it is used in other States, it has contaminated \nwater supplies.\n  We are in the process of working with the Environmental Protection \nAgency to discuss the future of ethanol and hope it will remain strong.\n  I ask my colleague from Illinois--and I again congratulate him for \nhis leadership in this area--if he can tell me whether his legislation \non the elimination of MTBE is done on a phaseout basis or whether it is \ndone to a date certain?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Yes. I thank the Senator and appreciate his support. \nI appreciate his cosponsorship of this legislation.\n  My bill would ban MTBE within 3 years after the enactment of this \nlaw. It would leave the exact timetable up to the EPA. They could set \nparameters within that 3 years. But within 3 years after the bill is \nsigned into law, we would expect MTBE to be gone.\n  Following up on that, as Senator Durbin said, we have been working \nvery hard, particularly with Senator Grassley, Senator Harkin, and \nSenators from all over the country, in trying to clean up MTBE, and \nalso trying\n\n[[Page S1404]]\n\nto promote renewable sources of fuels, such as ethanol. That discussion \nabout the importance of renewable fuels is made much more important now \nas we see our dependence on foreign oil and the high prices of oil in \nrecent weeks.\n  But this is an issue that has bipartisan support. Senator Durbin is a \nDemocrat; I am a Republican. But the ethanol issue has always been \nbipartisan. I look forward to working with my friends and colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle so that we can continue to work on improving \nour Nation's clean air and water and also our farm economy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the bill in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2233\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``MTBE Elimination Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) a single cup of MTBE, equal to the quantity found in 1 \n     gallon of gasoline oxygenated with MTBE, renders all of the \n     water in a 5,000,000-gallon well undrinkable;\n       (2) the physical properties of MTBE allow MTBE to pass \n     easily from gasoline to air to water, or from gasoline \n     directly to water, but MTBE does not--\n       (A) readily attach to soil particles; or\n       (B) naturally degrade;\n       (3) the development of tumors and nervous system disorders \n     in mice and rats has been linked to exposure to MTBE and \n     tertiary butyl alcohol and formaldehyde, which are 2 \n     metabolic byproducts of MTBE;\n       (4) reproductive and developmental studies of MTBE indicate \n     that exposure of a pregnant female to MTBE through inhalation \n     can--\n       (A) result in maternal toxicity; and\n       (B) have possible adverse effects on a developing fetus;\n       (5) the Health Effects Institute reported in February 1996 \n     that the studies of MTBE support its classification as a \n     neurotoxicant and suggest that its primary effect is likely \n     to be in the form of acute impairment;\n       (6) people with higher levels of MTBE in the bloodstream \n     are significantly more likely to report more headaches, eye \n     irritation, nausea, dizziness, burning of the nose and \n     throat, coughing, disorientation, and vomiting as compared \n     with those who have lower levels of MTBE in the bloodstream;\n       (7) available information has shown that MTBE significantly \n     reduces the efficiency of technologies used to remediate \n     water contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons;\n       (8) the costs of remediation of MTBE water contamination \n     throughout the United States could run into the billions of \n     dollars;\n       (9) although several studies are being conducted to assess \n     possible methods to remediate drinking water contaminated by \n     MTBE, there have been no engineering solutions to make such \n     remediation cost-efficient and practicable;\n       (10) the remediation of drinking water contaminated by \n     MTBE, involving the stripping of millions of gallons of \n     contaminated ground water, can cost millions of dollars per \n     municipality;\n       (11) the average cost of a single industrial cleanup \n     involving MTBE contamination is approximately $150,000;\n       (12) the average cost of a single cleanup involving MTBE \n     contamination that is conducted by a small business or a \n     homeowner is approximately $37,000;\n       (13) the reformulated gasoline program under section 211(k) \n     of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(k)) has resulted in \n     substantial reductions in the emissions of a number of air \n     pollutants from motor vehicles, including volatile organic \n     compounds, carbon monoxide, and mobile-source toxic air \n     pollutants, including benzene;\n       (14) in assessing oxygenate alternatives, the Blue Ribbon \n     Panel of the Environmental Protection Agency determined that \n     ethanol, made from domestic grain and potentially from \n     recycled biomass, is an effective fuel-blending component \n     that--\n       (A) provides carbon monoxide emission benefits and high \n     octane; and\n       (B) appears to contribute to the reduction of the use of \n     aromatics, providing reductions in emissions of toxic air \n     pollutants and other air quality benefits;\n       (15) the Department of Agriculture concluded that ethanol \n     production and distribution could be expanded to meet the \n     needs of the reformulated gasoline program in 4 years, with \n     negligible price impacts and no interruptions in supply; and\n       (16) because the reformulated gasoline program is a source \n     of clean air benefits, and ethanol is a viable alternative \n     that provides air quality and economic benefits, research and \n     development efforts should be directed to assess \n     infrastructure and meet other challenges necessary to allow \n     ethanol use to expand sufficiently to meet the requirements \n     of the reformulated gasoline program as the use of MTBE is \n     phased out.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     should provide technical assistance, information, and \n     matching funds to help local communities--\n       (1) test drinking water supplies; and\n       (2) remediate drinking water contaminated with methyl \n     tertiary butyl ether.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my Illinois \ncolleague, Senator Fitzgerald, as a cosponsor of his legislation \nbanning MTBE. MTBE contaminates water, and it has been found in water \nthroughout the United States.\n  With every day that passes, more water is being contaminated. Oddly \nenough, we have passed a clean air bill to clean up the air, and the \noil companies have used a product to meet the requirements of the clean \nair bill that contaminates the water.\n  But there is an additive to the gasoline that will clean up the air \nas well as not contaminate the water. I will talk about that in just a \nminute.\n  It is simple: With every day that passes, more water is being \ncontaminated.\n  Last August, the Senate soundly passed a resolution that I \ncosponsored with Senator Boxer of California calling for an MTBE ban.\n  In the face of damaging, irresponsible action by the Clinton \nadministration, it is time we put some force to our Senate position. \nHow long must Americans suffer this dilatory charade by President \nClinton's administration, also by\n\n[[Page S1405]]\n\nthe petroleum industry, and particularly by California officials? I say \nCalifornia officials because they have asked that the Clean Air Act of \n1990 be gutted.\n  I have intentionally held my fire until after the California primary \nbecause I would not want anyone to misconstrue my motives in an attempt \nto undermine Vice President Gore's political ambitions. But today I \nthink it is time to say it as it really is: President Clinton, Vice \nPresident Gore, and the Environmental Protection Agency's \nAdministrator, Carol Browner, have been dragging their feet--and \ndragging their feet too long.\n  They gave the oil and the MTBE industry everything they wanted. At \nthe request of big oil, they threw out regulations proposed by \nPresident Bush which would have, by some estimates, tripled and even \nquadrupled ethanol production. This was done on the first day of the \nClinton administration.\n  Instead, when they finally got around to putting some rules out, the \nadministration approved regulations that guaranteed a virtual MTBE \nmonopoly in the reformulated gasoline market.\n  This decision by the Clinton administration, way back then in the \nearly part of the administration, opened wide the door for petroleum \ncompanies to use MTBE and thus contaminate our water.\n  With egg on its face, with an environmental disaster on its hands, \nthe Clinton administration continues to delay and also duck its \nleadership responsibilities.\n  A replacement for MTBE exists today, but most oil companies refuse to \nuse it. The Environmental Protection Agency's Director, Carol Browner, \nhas been told time and time again, in every imaginable way possible, \nhow MTBE can be replaced, and in California totally replaced this very \nday.\n  But she, as other Clinton-Gore officials, always seems to come up \nwith some sort of excuse, a reason for delay, some other hurdle.\n  Last week, as the congressional delegation met with our Governor from \nIowa, we were told that Carol Browner asked for more information on \nthis subject about the supply of an alternative to MTBE--which is \nethanol--that she needed more information. It happens to be information \nthat the Environmental Protection Agency already has.\n\n  The new hurdle she is creating is the question: Is there enough of \nthis alternative, ethanol? You might ask: Enough for what? To replace \nall MTBE today or tomorrow? That is kind of insulting. It is also \nincredible.\n  I want to illustrate how it is insulting and incredible with this \npoint. Imagine the following: You have a brush fire sweeping to the \ncity's edge, devouring home after home. Panicked citizens call 911, but \nthe fire engines remain silent. The home owners scream to the fire \ndepartment: Why won't you come to our rescue? The fire chief says: We \ndon't have enough water to save the whole city, and until we can save \nall, we will save none.\n  It is absurd. Of course it is. Yet an equally absurd and dangerous \nline has been drawn by most California big oil companies and their \npolitical apologists. In the face of the largest environmental crisis \nof this generation--which is the contamination of water by the \npetroleum companies' controlled product, MTBE--Californians are being \nheld hostage, forced to buy water-contaminating, MTBE-laced gasoline, \neven though a superior MTBE replacement is available, and available \nthis very day--not tomorrow, not next year, but today.\n  California Governor Davis' so-called ``ban'' allows MTBE to be sold \n``full bore, business-as-usual'' until the end of the year 2002.\n  Worse yet, California legislators dropped the deadline altogether. \nBut why the wait? Well, we are told there is not enough of this MTBE \nalternative and thus the illogical decree imposed: No MTBE will be \nremoved until all MTBE is removed. And with every day that passes, more \nof our water is contaminated. Think of this: A mere teacup of MTBE \nrenders undrinkable 5 million gallons of water. CBS's ``60 Minutes,'' \nreferred to by my colleague from Illinois, reported California has \nalready identified 10,000 ground water sites contaminated by MTBE and \nthat ``one internal study conducted by Chevron found that MTBE has \ncontaminated ground water at 80 percent of the 400 sites that the \ncompany tested.''\n  Yet big oil holds you hostage, forcing you to buy MTBE-laced gasoline \nuntil either the Clinton-Gore administration or Congress guts one of \nthe most successful Clean Air Act programs, the reformulated gasoline \noxygenate requirement. So big oil is hoping that gullible bureaucrats \nand politicians conclude that MTBE is not the real problem but, \ninstead, the real problem happens to be the oxygenate provisions of the \n1990 Clean Air Act. Get rid of the oxygenate requirement and, presto, \nMTBE disappears.\n  People in my State are not buying that line. Iowa has no oxygenate \nrequirement. Yet MTBE has been found in 29 percent of our water \nsupplies tested. Let it be clear, let there be absolutely no \nmisunderstanding: Iowa's water and the water in every Senator's State \nwas contaminated by a product that big oil added to their gasoline, and \nit was not contaminated by the Clear Air Act. Big oil did everything it \ncould to persuade Clinton-Gore appointees and judges in our courts to \nguarantee that MTBE monopolized the Clean Air Act's oxygenate market.\n\n  Our colleagues need to understand that nearly 500 million gallons of \nMTBE are sold every year throughout the United States, not to meet the \noxygenate requirements of the Clean Air Act that I have been talking \nabout up to this point, but as an octane enhancer in markets all over \nthe United States where the oxygenate requirements under the Clean Air \nAct to clean up the smog don't even apply.\n  So your water is in danger whether you live in a city that has to \nmeet the oxygenate requirements of the 1990 Clean Air Act or not \nbecause big oil uses the poison MTBE as an octane enhancer lots of \nplaces. So that gets us to a point where they want us to believe that \nchanging the 1990 Clean Air Act is the solution to all the problems. I \nask, how will gutting the Clean Air Act's oxygenate requirements \nprotect the rest of America's water, if most gallons of gasoline have \nMTBE in them for octane enhancement outside the Clean Air Act? Well, \nthat answer is pretty simple. It is not going to clean it up until we \nget rid of all MTBE. We need to, then, ban MTBE, which this bill we are \nintroducing today does, not ban the Clean Air Act, or at least not gut \nit by eliminating the oxygenate requirements of it, which big oil says \nis the solution to our problem.\n  Then we get to what is the superior MTBE replacement that is \navailable today. My colleagues don't have to wait for me to tell them \nwhat my answer is to that, but I will. It is ethanol, which is nothing \nmore than grain alcohol. Let's get that clear. We are talking about \nMTBE, a poisonous product, poisoning the water in California, where the \noxygenate requirements are, but also in the rest of the country where \nit is used as an octane enhancer, and grain alcohol on the other hand \nthat you can drink. Ethanol can be made from other things as well. It \ncan be made from California rice straw. It can be made from Idaho \npotato waste. It can be made from Florida sugarcane, North Dakota sugar \nbeets, New York municipal waste, Washington wood and paper waste, and a \nhost of other biodegradable waste products. Ethanol is not only good \nfor your air, but if it did get into your water, your only big decision \nwould be whether to add some ice and tonic before you drink it.\n  As my colleagues know, I am a teetotaler, so I am not going to \npretend to advise you on the proper cocktail mixes. Today there is \nenough ethanol in storage and from what can be produced from idle \nethanol facilities to displace all of the MTBE California uses in a \nwhole year. It is available today not tomorrow, not the year 2002. And \nmore facilities to produce it are in the works.\n  But big oil proclaims there is not enough ethanol. Translation, as \nfar as I can tell: We, as big oil, don't control ethanol; farmers \ncontrol it. So we don't want to use it.\n  They argue that ethanol is too difficult to transport. Translation: \nWe would rather import Middle East MTBE from halfway across the world \nthan transport ethanol from the Midwest of our great country. Big oil \nwhines: Keeping the oxygenate requirement will give ethanol a monopoly. \nThis is a whale of a tale, and it is kind\n\n[[Page S1406]]\n\nof hard to translate into sensible English. Since it takes half as much \nethanol as MTBE to produce a gallon of reformulated gasoline, big oil \nwill reap a 6.2-percent increase in the amount of plain gasoline used \nin reformulated gasoline. So how in the world does boosting by a \nwhopping 6.2 percent gasoline's share of the reformulated gasoline \nmarket constitute a monopoly for ethanol? That issue has been raised \nwith Senators on the environmental committee.\n\n  Currently, MTBE constitutes 3 percent of our total transportation \nfuel market. Ethanol, if it replaces all MTBE, would, therefore, gain a \n1.5-percent share. Think about that. A 1.5-percent market share, if it \nis ethanol, is defined as a monopoly share. But a 3-percent market \nshare, if it is MTBE, is not a monopoly.\n  I think it is pretty simple to get it because the translation of this \nbig oil babble is this: Market share, as small as 1.5 percent, if not \ncontrolled by big oil, shall henceforth be legally defined as a \nmonopoly. Market share at any level, 3 percent to 100 percent, if it is \ncontrolled by big oil, shall never be defined as a monopoly. It is such \na bizarre proposition that a mere 1.5 percent of market equals a \nmonopoly.\n  Big oil claims ethanol is too expensive. Let me translate that for \nyou: We prefer--meaning oil--our cozy relationship with OPEC that \nallows us to price gouge Americans rather than sell at half the price \nan oxygenate controlled by American farmers and ethanol producers.\n  I hope you caught that. If not, you ought to brace yourself, sit down \nwith your cup of coffee, get anything dangerous out of your hands. The \nMarch 7, 2000, west coast spot wholesale price for gasoline was $1.27 \nper gallon. MTBE sold for just over $1.17 per gallon, 10 cents less. \nBut ethanol came right in at the same price, $1.17 a gallon. Now, \nremember, it takes twice as much MTBE as it does ethanol to meet the \nClean Air Act's oxygenate requirement. In other words, at the March 7 \nprices, oxygenates made from ethanol cost petroleum marketers half as \nmuch as the oxygenate made from their product, MTBE.\n  So even though big oil has at its disposal an oxygenated alternate to \nMTBE, which costs half as much, and that will protect our water \nsupplies, big oil, with the help of the Clinton administration, \ncontinues to hold hostage the people of California and other Americans \nwho are forced to use MTBE.\n  Last summer, I asked President Clinton to announce that he would deny \nCalifornia's request to waive the oxygenate requirement. I asked him to \nannounce that he would veto any legislation that would provide for such \na waiver. I have heard nothing on this subject. No answer to my letter \nhas come from the President. His silence, and that of Vice President \nGore and the rest of the administration, is very deafening.\n  American farmers are suffering the worst prices in about 23 to 25 \nyears. If farmers are allowed to replace MTBE with ethanol, farm income \nwill jump $1 billion per year. But, no, increasing farm income through \nthe marketplace, both domestic and foreign, seems to be of no interest \nto the Clinton-Gore administration, considering their unwillingness to \nact and make these public statements that would send a clear signal, as \nfar as this consideration is concerned, that MTBE's days of poisoning \nthe water are over, replacing that with something that is safe, \nsomething that will help the farmers, and something that will send a \nclear signal to OPEC that we are done with our days being dependent \nupon them for our oil supplies and our energy.\n\n  In the process of doing that, they would help clean up our \nenvironment as well. But that doesn't seem to be of any concern to this \nadministration either when it comes to MTBE. It seems, unfortunately, \nthat the only thing on the collective mind of this administration is \nthe Vice President running for President, his legacy, his partisan \npolitics; everybody's eyes are on the next election.\n  So I repeat, MTBE is the problem, not the Clean Air Act, as the big \noil companies want us to believe. The answer to all this is so simple \nand clear:\n  As our bill does, ban MTBE, but don't gut the Clean Air Act's \noxygenate requirement.\n  Let America's farmers fill this void with ethanol, and let them fill \nit today.\n  It will boost farm income by $1 billion per year and help lessen our \nreliance upon foreign oil, and it will not keep us at the whims of OPEC \nquite so much.\n  It will keep our air clean, and it will protect our water supplies.\n  So all of those things sound good, don't they? Ethanol. It is that \nsimple. It is good, good, good. I might be wasting my breath, but I \nwill make this plea one more time. It is the same plea I made in a \nletter to the President last June or July, which was: President \nClinton, reject the waiver request today and declare that you will veto \nany legislation that would allow a waiver of the oxygenate requirements \nof the 1990 Clean Air Act. I assure you, Mr. President, if you do that, \nthe water-polluting MTBE will be replaced as fast as our farmers can \ndeliver the ethanol, and that is pretty darned swift. Do it today, \nPresident Clinton. Please do it today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \ntoday in introducing this timely and important legislation to help the \nnation respond to growing concerns about the threats to public health \nand the environment caused by methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE.\n  There is gathering evidence that MTBE, which is added to gasoline to \nreduce its impact on air quality, poses a threat to human health and \nthe environment. Preliminary testing indicates groundwater has been \ncontaminated in many areas of the country. The MTBE Elimination Act \nprovides for a three-year phase out of the use MTBE. The legislation \nalso provides resources for research, local testing programs, and \nlabeling so that we can identify the size of the problem and move \nforward with meaningful solutions.\n  Addressing the health and environmental threats posed by MTBE is only \nhalf of the answer. While we move to phase out MTBE, we also need to be \nmaking decisions about the future of the reformulated fuels program and \nthe oxygenate requirement in the Clean Air Act. The Reformulated \nGasoline Program has significantly reduced emissions of air pollutants \nfrom motor vehicles, including volatile organic compounds, carbon \nmonoxide, and mobile-source air toxics, such as benzene. It is \nimportant that we evaluate the options available for maintaining and \nenhancing these benefits.\n  The first step is evaluating the obvious options, ethanol. In its \nassessment of oxygenate alternatives, the EPA's Blue Ribbon Panel found \nthat ethanol is ``an effective fuel-bending component, made from \ndomestic grain and potentially from recycled biomass, that provides \nhigh octane, carbon monoxide emission benefits, and appears to \ncontribute to the reduction of the use of aromatics with related toxics \nand other air quality benefits.'\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture, in its report ``Economic Analysis \nof Replacing MTBE with Ethanol in the United States, ``concluded that \nethanol production and distribution could be expanded to meet the needs \nof the Reformulated Gasoline Program by 2004 with no supply \ninterruptions or significant price impacts.\n  We do not have to choose between clean air and clean water. Evidence \nthat MTBE presents a risk to water quality does not mean that we have \nto end our efforts for cleaner fuels. Ethanol is a clean, safe \nalternative that has the potential to serve a larger national market. \nAs a country, we are beginning to recognize the benefits that biofuels \ncan provide to the environment. Recent oil price increases also remind \nus of how important domestic sources of energy are to our national \nsecurity. This bill is a necessary step in minimizing the public health \nand environment damage attributable to MTBE. I believe it can also be \nthe start of a serious discussion on the opportunities that ethanol and \nother biofuels provide to maximize clean, safe and economically viable \nenergy options for America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER:\n  S. 2234. A bill to designate certain facilities of the United States \nPostal Service; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n[[Page S1407]]\n\n joel t. broyhill postal building and the joseph l. fisher post office\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join my colleague in the House of \nRepresentatives, Congressman Wolf, in introducing legislation to honor \ntwo former Representatives from Virginia's 10th district which \ndesignates two postal buildings in Northern Virginia after Joel T. \nBroyhill and Joseph L. Fisher.\n  The Honorable Joel Broyhill, was the first member elected to \nVirginia's newly created 10th district. He served in the House of \nRepresentatives for twenty-two years. A native of Hopewell, Virginia, \nCongressman Broyhill is also a decorated veteran and served as captain \nin the 106th Infantry Division in WWII. During the war, he was taken \nprisoner by the Germans and held in a POW camp after fighting in the \ninfamous and costly ``Battle of Bulge.''\n  Congressman Broyhill currently resides in Arlington, Virginia. I \nbelieve renaming the postal building at 8409 Lee Highway in Merrifield, \nVirginia would be appropriate in recognition of his honorable and \nextensive political and military careers.\n  I would also like to honor another former Representative from the \n10th District, the late Honorable Joseph L. Fisher. Congressman Fisher \nhad a notable political career in the local, state and federal \ngovernment.\n  Congressman Fisher, who held a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard \nUniversity, began his career in public service as an economist with the \nU.S. Department of State. After his service in World War II, he became \na member of the Arlington County Board. He began a three-term service \nin the House of Representatives when he was elected in 1974, defeating \nthe incumbent Republican Joel Broyhill.\n  Subsequent to his service in the House, among other positions, \nCongressman Fisher served as secretary of the Virginia Department of \nHuman Resources and was a professor of political economy at George \nMason University.\n  Congressman Fisher's commitment to public service should be \nrecognized with the designation of the post office located at 3118 \nWashington Boulevard in Arlington, Virginia as the Joseph L. Fisher \nPost Office.\n  Joseph Fisher passed away in 1992 at his home in Arlington, Virginia. \nHe is survived by his wife, Margaret, their seven children, sixteen \ngrandchildren, and two great grandchildren.\n  I seek my colleagues to support legislation to honor these two former \nmembers in recognition of their distinguished public service.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 2235. A bill to amend the Public Health Act to revise the \nperformance standards and certification process for organ procurement \norganizations; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n        organ procurement organization certification act of 2000\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself \nand my colleagues, Senators Murkowski, Dodd, Torricelli, and Hutchinson \nto introduce the Organ Procurement Organization Certification Act to \nimprove the performance evaluation and certification process that the \nHealth Care Financing Administration currently uses for organ \nprocurement organizations (OPOs).\n  Recent advantages in technology have dramatically increased the \nnumber of patients who could benefit from organ transplants. \nUnfortunately, however, while there has been some interest in the \nnumber of organ donors, the supply of organs in the United States has \nnot kept pace with the growing number of transplant candidates, and the \ngap between transplant demand and organ supply continues to widen. \nAccording to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), there are now \n68,220 patients in the United States on the waiting list for a \ntransplant.\n  Our nation's 60 organ procurement organizations (OPOs) play a \ncritical role in procuring and placing organs and are therefore key to \nour efforts to increase the number and quality of organs available for \ntransplant. They provide all of the services necessary in a particular \ngeographic region for coordinating the identification of potential \ndonors, requests for donation, and recovery and transport of organs. \nThe professionals in the OPOs evaluate potential donors, discuss \ndonation with family members, and arrange for the surgical removal of \ndonated organs. They are also responsible for preserving the organs and \nmaking arrangements for their distribution according to national organ \nsharing policies. Finally, the OPOs provide information and education \nto medical professionals and the general public to encourage organ and \ntissue donation to increase the availability of organs for \ntransplantation.\n  According to a 1999 report of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) \nentitled ``Organ Procurement and Transplantation: Assessing Current \nPolicies and the Potential Impact of the DHHS Final Rule'', a major \nimpediment to greater accountability and improved performance on the \npart of OPOs is the current lack of a reliable and valid method for \nassessing donor potential and OPO performance.\n  The HCFA's current certification process for OPOs sets an arbitrary, \npopulation-based performance standard for certifying OPOs based on \ndonors per million of population in their service areas. It sets a \nstandard for acceptable performance based on five criteria: donors \nrecovered per million, kidneys recovered per million, kidneys \ntransplanted per million, extrarenal organs (heart, liver, pancreas and \nlungs) recovered per million, and extrarenal organs transplanted per \nmillion. The HCFA assesses the OPOs' adherence to these standards every \ntwo years. Each OPO must meet at least 75 percent of the national mean \nfor four of these five categories to be recertified as the OPO for a \nparticular area and to receive Medicare and Medicaid payments. Without \nHCFA certification, an OPO cannot continue to operate.\n  The GAO, the IOM, the Harvard School of Public Health and others all \nhave criticized HCFA's use of this population-based standard to measure \nOPO performance. According to the GAO, ``HCFA's current performance \nstandard does not accurately assess OPOs' ability to meet the goal of \nacquiring all usable organs because it is based on the total \npopulation, not the number of potential donors, within the OPOs' \nservice areas.''\n  OPO service areas vary widely in the distribution of deaths by cause, \nunderlying health conditions, age, and race. These variations can pose \nsignificant advantages or disadvantages to an OPO's ability to procure \norgans, and a major problem with HCFA's current performance assessment \nis that it does not account for these variations. An extremely \neffective OPO that is getting a high yield of organs from the potential \ndonors in its service area may appear to be performing poorly because \nit has a disproportionate share of elderly people or a high rate of \npeople infected with HIV or AIDS, which eliminates them for \nconsideration as an organ donor. At the same time, an ineffective OPO \nmay appear to be performing well because it is operating in a service \narea with a high proportion of potential donors.\n  For example, organ donors typically die from head trauma and \naccidental injuries, and these rates can vary dramatically from region \nto region. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n(CDC), in 1991, the number of drivers fatally injured in traffic \naccidents in Maine was 15.54 per 100,000 population. In Alabama, \nhowever, it was 29.56, giving the OPO serving that state a tremendous \nadvantage over the New England Organ Bank, which serves Maine, but not \nfor a very good reason!\n  Use of this population-based method to evaluate OPO performance may \nwell result in the decertification of OPOs that are actually excellent \nperformers. Under HCFA's current regulatory practice, OPOs are \ndecertified if they fail to meet the 75th percentile of the national \nmeans on 4 of the 5 performance areas. In this process, which resembles \na game of musical chairs, it is a mathematical certainty that some OPOs \nwill fail in each cycle, no matter how much they might individually \nimprove.\n  Moreover, unlike other HCFA certification programs, the certification \nprocess for OPOs lacks any provision for corrective action plans to \nremedy deficient performance and also lacks a clearly defined due \nprocess component for resolving conflicts. The current system therefore \nforces OPOs to compete on the basis of an imperfect grading system, \nwith no guarantee of an opportunity for fair hearing based on their \nactual performance. This situation pressures many OPOs to focus on the\n\n[[Page S1408]]\n\ncertification process itself rather than on activities and methods to \nincrease donation, undermining what should be the overriding goal of \nthe program. Moreover, the current two-year cycle--which is shorter \nthan other certification programs administered by HCFA--provides little \nopportunity to examine trends and even less incentive for OPOs to mount \nlong-term interventions.\n\n  The legislation we are introducing today has three major objectives. \nFirst, it imposes a moratorium on the current recertification process \nfor OPOs and the use of population-based performance measurements. \nUnder our bill, the certification of qualified OPOs will remain in \nplace through January 1, 2002, for those OPOs that have been certified \nas a January 1, 2000, and that meet other qualification requirements \napart from the current performance standards. Second, the bill requires \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate new rules \ngoverning OPO recertification by January 1, 2002. These new rules are \nto rely on outcome and process performance measures based on evidence \nof organ donor potential and other relevant factors, and \nrecertification for OPOs shall not be required until they are \npromulgated. Finally, the bill provides for the filing and approval of \na corrective action plan by an OPO that fails to meet the standards, a \ngrace period to permit corrective action, an opportunity to appeal a \ndecertification to the Secretary on substantive and procedural grounds \nand a four-year certification cycle.\n  Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today makes much needed \nimprovements in the flawed process that HCFA currently uses to certify \nand assess OPO performance, and I urge all of my colleagues to join us \nas cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2235\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Organ Procurement \n     Organization Certification Act of 2000''.\n\n      SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Organ procurement organizations play an important role \n     in the effort to increase organ donation in the United \n     States.\n       (2) The current process for the certification and \n     recertification of organ procurement organizations conducted \n     by the Department of Health and Human Services has created a \n     level of uncertainty that is interfering with the \n     effectiveness of organ procurement organizations in raising \n     the level of organ donation.\n       (3) The General Accounting Office, the Institute of \n     Medicine, and the Harvard School of Public Health have \n     identified substantial limitations in the organ procurement \n     organization certification and recertification process and \n     have recommended changes in that process.\n       (4) The limitations in the recertification process include:\n       (A) An exclusive reliance on population-based measures of \n     performance that do not account for the potential in the \n     population for organ donation and do not permit consideration \n     of other outcome and process standards that would more \n     accurately reflect the relative capability and performance of \n     each organ procurement organization.\n       (B) An immediate decertification of organ procurement \n     organizations solely on the basis of the performance \n     measures, without an appropriate opportunity to file and a \n     grace period to pursue a corrective action plan.\n       (C) A lack of due process to appeal to the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services for recertification on either \n     substantive or procedural grounds.\n       (5) The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the \n     authority under section 1138(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-8(b)(1)(A)(i)) to extend the \n     period for recertification of an organ procurement \n     organization from 2 to 4 years on the basis of its past \n     practices in order to avoid the inappropriate disruption of \n     the nation's organ system.\n       (6) The Secretary of Health and Human Services can use the \n     extended period described in paragraph (5) for \n     recertification of all organ procurement organizations to--\n       (A) develop improved performance measures that would \n     reflect organ donor potential and interim outcomes, and to \n     test these measures to ensure that they accurately measure \n     performance differences among the organ procurement \n     organizations; and\n       (B) improve the overall certification process by \n     incorporating process as well as outcome performance \n     measures, and developing equitable processes for corrective \n     action plans and appeals.\n\n      SEC. 3. CERTIFICATION AND RECERTIFICATION OF ORGAN \n                   PROCUREMENT ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n       Section 371(b)(1) of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 273(b)(1)) is amended:\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (D) through (G) as \n     subparagraphs (E) through (H), respectively;\n       (2) by realigning the margin of subparagraph (F) (as so \n     redesignated) so as to align with subparagraph (E) (as so \n     redesignated); and\n       (3) by inserting after subparagraph (C) the following:\n       ``(D) notwithstanding any other provision of law, has met \n     the other requirements of this section and has been certified \n     or recertified by the Secretary within the previous 4-year \n     period as meeting the performance standards to be a qualified \n     organ procurement organization through a process that \n     either--\n       ``(i) granted certification or recertification within such \n     4-year period with such certification or recertification in \n     effect as of January 1, 2000, and remaining in effect through \n     the earlier of--\n       ``(I) January 1, 2002; or\n       ``(II) the completion of recertification under the \n     requirements of clause (ii); or\n       ``(ii) is defined through regulations that are promulgated \n     by the Secretary by not later than January 1, 2002, that--\n       ``(I) require recertifications of qualified organ \n     procurement organizations not more frequently than once every \n     4 years;\n       ``(II) rely on outcome and process performance measures \n     that are based on empirical evidence of organ donor potential \n     and other related factors in each service area of qualified \n     organ procurement organizations;\n       ``(III) use multiple outcome measures as part of the \n     certification process;\n       ``(IV) provide for the filing and approval of a corrective \n     action plan by a qualified organ procurement organization \n     that fails to meet the performance standards and a grace \n     period of not less than 3 years during which such \n     organization can implement the corrective action plan without \n     risk of decertification; and\n       ``(V) provide for a qualified organ procurement \n     organization to appeal a decertification to the Secretary on \n     substantive and procedural grounds;''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 2236. A bill to establish programs to improve the health and \nsafety of children receiving child care outside the home, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n           day care health and safety improvement act of 2000\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, each day, more than 13 million children \nunder the age of 6 spend some part of their day in child care. In my \nhome state of Tennessee 264,000 children will attend day care, and half \nof all children younger than three will spend some or all of their day \nbeing cared for by someone other than their parents. With these large \nnumber of children receiving child care services, there has been some \nevidence to suggest that we need to work to make these settings safer \nwhile improving the health of children in child care settings.\n  The potential danger in child care settings has been evident in my \nhome state of Tennessee. Tragically, within the span of 2 years, there \nhave been 4 deaths in child care settings in Memphis, Tennessee. \nOverall, reports of abandoned, mistreated, and unnecessarily endangered \nchildren have been reported in the Tennessee press over the last few \nyears. I salute the Memphis Commercial Appeal, for their in-depth \nreporting on day care health and safety issues which has helped bring \nthis serious matter to public attention.\n  However, I would caution that this is not just a concern in Memphis \nor Tennessee; it is nationwide and it needs to be addressed. There is \nalarming evidence to suggest that more must be done to improve the \nhealth and safety of children in child care settings.\n  For example, a 1998 Consumer Product Safety Commission Study revealed \nthat two-thirds of the 200 licensed child care settings investigated \nexhibited safety hazards, such as insufficient child safety gates, \ncribs with soft bedding, and unsafe playgrounds.\n  In 1997 alone, 31,000 children ages 4 and younger were treated in \nhospital emergency rooms for injuries sustained in child care or school \nsettings. And, quite tragically, since 1990, more than 56 children have \ndied in child care settings nationwide.\n  Child care health and safety issues are regulated at the state and \nlocal levels, which work diligently to ensure that child care settings \nare as safe as possible. I have worked closely with the Tennessee \nDepartment of Human\n\n[[Page S1409]]\n\nServices on how best to address the issue and quickly realized one of \nthe main problems was the lack of resources that the state could draw \nupon to improve health and safety.\n  To help address this issue and protect our children, I have joined \nwith Senator Dodd, the recognized leader in Congress on child care \nissues, to introduce the ``Children's Day Care Health and Safety \nImprovement Act,'' which will establish a state block grant program, \nauthorizing $200 million for states to carry out activities related to \nthe improvement of the health and safety of children in child care \nsettings.\n  These grants may be used for the following activities:\n  To train and educate child care providers to prevent injuries and \nillnesses and to promote health-related practices;\n  To improve and enforce child care provider licensing, regulation, and \nregistration, by conducting more inspections of day care providers to \nensure that they are carrying out state and local guidelines to ensure \nthat our children are safe;\n  To rehabilitate child care facilities to meet health and safety \nstandards, like the proper placement of fire exits and smoke detectors, \nthe proper disposal of sewage and garbage, and ensuring that play \nground equipment is safe;\n  To employ health consultants to give health and safety advice to \nchild care providers, such as CPR training, first aid training, \nprevention of sudden infant death syndrome, and how to recognize the \nsigns of child abuse and neglect;\n  To provide assistance to enhance child care providers' ability to \nserve children with disabilities;\n  To conduct criminal background checks on child care providers, to \nensure that day care providers are credible and reliable as they care \nfor our children;\n  To provide information to parents on what factors to consider in \nchoosing a safe and healthy day care setting for their children. \nParents must know that the setting they are choosing have a proven \nsafety record; and\n  To improve the safety of transportation of children in child care.\n  I am pleased that Tennessee is carrying out many of the activities \nauthorized under the ``Children's Day Care Health and Safety Act.'' \nUnder this bill, Tennessee would receive an estimated $4.2 million to \nhelp expand health and safety activities.\n  Mr. President, as a father, I understand the parental bond. A \nparent's number one concern is the safety, protection and health of \ntheir children. Parents need to be reassured their children are safe \nwhen they rely on others to care for their children. I am hopeful that \nthis legislation will give Tennessee, and all states, the needed \nresources to implement necessary reforms and activities which they \ndetermine will improve the health and safety conditions of child care \nproviders as they care for our children.\n  I want to thank Senator Dodd for joining me in this effort and for \nthe work of his staff, Jeanne Ireland. I would also like to thank the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, the Children's Defense Fund and the \nNational Association for the Education of Young children for their \ninput and letters of support for this bill. I would also like to thank \nGovernor Sundquist and members of the Tennessee Department of Human \nServices, especially, Ms. Deborah Neill, the Director of Child Care, \nAdult and Community Programs, for their input on this important and \nneeded legislation. And finally, I would like to thank and acknowledge \nthe assistance of the Mayor of Memphis, the Honorable W. W. Herenton \nand his staff, who have been of great help in developing this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2236\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Christopher Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Dodd and Frist: On behalf of the 55,000 \n     members of the American Academy of Pediatrics, I would like \n     to applaud you for introducing the ``Children's Day Care \n     Health and Safety Improvement Act.''\n       The Academy and its members, along with many others, have \n     been working for years attempting to ensure that all children \n     receive high-quality child care and early education. Yet, the \n     statistics about the health and safety of child care setting \n     are very disturbing. Multiple studies have found that many \n     child care arrangements not only fail to give children the \n     type of intellectual stimulation and emotional support they \n     need, but actually compromise the health and safety of the \n     youngsters in their care.\n       One review of state child care regulations in 47 states \n     found that more than half of the states' safety-related \n     regulations had inadequate or no standards for 24 out of the \n     36 safety topics examined. Most notable were the inattention \n     to playground safety, choking hazards, and firearms. Studies \n     of child care settings themselves have also been \n     disheartening. One four-state study found that only one in \n     seven child care centers (14%) were rated as good quality. \n     Another study found that 13 percent of regulated and 50 \n     percent of nonregulated family child care providers offer \n     care that is inadequate. The Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission reports that about 31,000 children, 4 years old \n     and younger, were treated in U.S. hospital emergency rooms \n     for injuries at child care/school settings in 1997, and that \n     the agency knows of at least 56 children who have died in \n     child care setting since 1990.\n       By providing states with funds for activities specifically \n     aimed at improving the health and safety of child care, your \n     bill should help to reduce the incidence of preventable \n     illness, injury, disability, and even death, for the millions \n     of children who spend their days in out-of-home child care.\n       The ``Children's Day Care Health and Safety Improvement \n     Act'' is much-needed legislation, and we look forward to \n     working with you to support its enactment. Thank you for your \n     continued dedication to improving children's lives.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Donald E.

The \n     bill recognizes the wide range of activities that must be \n     addressed in order to ensure the health and safety for \n     children in child care. New resources to states targeted on \n     these various activities will make a significant impact on \n     their efforts to move forward.\n       We look forward to working with you towards the passage of \n     this important bill.

We are pleased that you share our \n     concerns, about the need to improve the health and safety of \n     children in a variety of child care settings and support a \n     federal partnership with states, communities, and providers \n     in meeting that goal.\n       The Child Care Health and Safety Improvement Act that you \n     will be introducing today seeks to strengthen state licensing \n     and other regulatory standards and enforcement, linkages \n     between child care providers and health services providers, \n     and training to child care providers in injury prevention and \n     health promotion. This legislation addresses many of our \n     concerns and reflects NAEYC principles for ensuring that \n     child care settings are healthy and safe learning \n     environments.\n       As this bill moves forward, we would be happy to work to \n     make further improvements in the legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Adele Robinson,\n                                   Director of Policy Development.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Frist in \nintroducing The Children's Day Care Health and Safety Act, legislation \nthat I believe will have a significant impact on the well-being of the \n13 million children who spend some part of every day in child care.\n\n[[Page S1411]]\n\n  Each morning, millions of parents drop their children off at a child \ncare center, a neighbor's home, or their church's day care center, \nassuming--or at least hoping--that their children will be safe and well \ncared for. And, in the vast majority of circumstances that's the case. \nBut, unfortunately, there is alarming evidence to suggest that, far too \noften, unsafe child care settings are compromising the health of our \nchildren.\n  In 1997 alone, 31,000 children ages 4 and younger were treated in \nhospital emergency rooms for injuries sustained in child care or school \nsettings. Since 1990, more than 55 children have died while in child \ncare settings.\n  Perhaps most tragically, many of these deaths and injuries were most \nlikely preventable--if providers were knowledgeable about basic health \nand safety practices and if states did a better job of developing and \nenforcing strong health and safety regulations.\n  Almost all child care providers want to give good care to the \nchildren in their charge. Despite the fact that we pay child care \nproviders abysmally--typically below poverty wages with no paid sick \nleave--individuals join this profession because they love children and \nwant to help them grow and thrive. But, we do far too little to support \nproviders in making sure that the environment they provide to our \nchildren is a safe and healthy one.\n  Many child care providers are unaware of the importance of removing \nsoft bedding from cribs--which presents a suffocation hazard for \ninfants and increases the likelihood of child dying from SIDS. Many \nchild care providers are also unaware of the need to place window-blind \ncords out of reach. Consequently, one child every month strangles in \nthe loop of a cord.\n  An investigation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission revealed \nthat two-thirds of licensed child care settings surveyed exhibited \nthese type of safety hazards, as well as other, such as insufficient \nchild safety gates and unsafe playgrounds.\n  Some states have taken action to improve health and safety practices. \nFor example, Connecticut requires child care centers to receive at \nleast monthly visits from a nurse or pediatrician, who can advise \nproviders on concerns ranging from the basics, like the importance of \nhandwashing after diaper-changing, to more complex issues, such as how \nto accommodate the special needs of a child with a disability.\n  But, many states are hard-pressed simply to meet the enormous demand \nfor child care from working families and families transitioning off \nwelfare. With all the pressure to create child care slots and to help \nfamilies find any kind of care, unfortunately, child care health and \nsafety often becomes an afterthought.\n  A survey of state child care standards found that only one-third of \nstates had minimally acceptable child care quality regulations. Two-\nthirds of states had regulations that didn't even address the basics--\nprovider training, safe environments and appropriate ratios. And in \nmany cases, even when there are good standards on the books, \nenforcement is lax.\n  Too often we view finding safe, high quality child care as a problem \nparents should struggle with on their own. It's time we recognize that \nunsafe child care is a public health crisis, not a personal problem.\n  That's why I'm so pleased to join Senator Frist today in introducing \nlegislation that would provide grants to the states to reduce child \ncare health and safety hazards. Grants could be used for a broad range \nof activities that we know have the greatest impact on health and \nsafety, such as training and educating providers on injury and illness \nprevention; improving health and safety standards; improving \nenforcement of standards, including increased surprise inspections; \nrenovating child care centers and family day care homes; helping \nproviders serve children with disabilities; and conducting criminal \nbackground checks on child care providers.\n  I am also pleased that this legislation has been endorsed by the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, the Children's Defense Fund, and the \nNational Association for the Education of Young Children.\n  Sadly just as our children grow--the number of child care abuses and \nhazards has grown over the years, as well. This measure can help ensure \nthat critically important safeguards are provided so that day care is a \nsafe haven, not a hazard.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 2237. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the deductibility of premiums for any medigap insurance policy of \nMedicare+Choice plan which contains an outpatient prescription drug \nbenefit, and to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide \nauthority to expand existing medigap insurance policies; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                     SENIORS' SECURITY ACT OF 2000\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Seniors' Security Act of 2000--a bill that will address the growing \nproblem of prescription drug coverage for senior citizens.\n  As we are all aware, seniors' access to prescription drugs is an \nimportant issue. Currently, traditional fee-for service Medicare covers \nfew drugs for seniors. At the same time, however, prescription drugs \nare an increasing component of seniors' health care. For these reasons, \nI believe that it is time Congress worked to increase American seniors' \naccess to prescription drugs.\n  The Senior's Security Act of 2000 will increase seniors' access to \nprescription drugs in two ways. First, it will extend tax equity to \nseniors by allowing them to deduct the cost of health insurance that \ncontains a qualified prescription drug benefit. We already provide such \nfavorable tax treatment for employer-provided health insurance and are \nmoving toward doing so for the self-employed. If we are truly concerned \nabout seniors' access to prescription drugs, we should do the same for \nthem.\n  In addition, SSA 2000 will also allow both current and future seniors \nto deduct the cost of long-term care insurance from their taxes and \nmake long-term care insurance available through employer-provided \nflexible spending accounts (FSAs).\n  SSA 2000 also provides for the design by National Association of \nInsurance Commissioners (NAIC) of additional Medigap policies in order \nto make prescription drug coverage more accessible and affordable. This \nprocess follows that which produced the existing Medigap policies. SSA \n2000 also directs the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) to \nanalyze and report on the salient issues in the design of prescription \ndrug benefit policies. MedPAC is directed to issue their findings in a \nJune 1, 2000 report to Congress and the NAIC in order to aid in \ndesigning new Medigap policies.\n  I believe SSA 2000 will make prescription drug coverage cheaper, both \ndirectly and indirectly. More than 18 million seniors have an income \ntax liability that can be reduced by this reform; by increasing the \nnumber of participants and making new Medigap policies a available, the \nbill will indirectly reduce the cost of coverage, as well. Unlike some \nother proposed reform measures in this area, it preserves and \nstrengthens the private insurance market--it contains no mandates, no \nprice controls, and preserve all existing Medigap policies--rather than \njeopardizing or eliminating it.\n  This bill does not attempt to address the issue of prescription drug \ncoverage for every senior; instead, it is the answer for a portion of \nthe senior population who have been paying at least part of the costs \nfor their health care and prescription drugs, but still need and \ndeserve to have a reduction in their out-of-pocket expenses. The \nSeniors' Security Act of 2000 is the best way to provide relief to this \ngroup of seniors, while at the same time continuing to work towards \nsolutions for those seniors who aren't as economically secure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2237\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate 3 counties in the State of Montana as \nHigh Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas and authorize funding for drug \ncontrol activities in those areas; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             Admitting Montana to the Rocky Mountain HIDTA\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce critical \nlegislation in the fight against methamphetamine use in rural America.\n  Methamphetamine, also known as ``meth'' is a powerful and addictive \ndrug. Considered by many youths to be\n\n[[Page S1414]]\n\na casual, soft-core drug with few lasting effects, meth can actually \ncause more long-term damage to the body than cocaine or crack.\n  I recently invited General Barry McCaffrey, our drug czar, along with \nDr. Don Vereen, his deputy, to Montana to focus attention on the \nproblem of meth use. Their visit was well-received by residents of our \nstate, and much-needed. The fact is, there are a good many talented \nMontanans working on the meth problem, but they have few resources with \nwhich to wage the battle. Moreover, their efforts are often fragmented, \nnot coordinated to the extent they could be, particularly among the \ntreatment, prevention, and law enforcement communities.\n  To make their job easier, Montana has petitioned to be considered \npart of the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area \n(HIDTA). Although the Rocky Mountain HIDTA authorities have stated \ntheir willingness to include Montana in its organization, they lack the \nresources to make that happen.\n  The bill I am introducing today would authorize funding to make \nMontana's admission to the Rocky Mountain HIDTA a reality. Here's why \nthat's necessary.\n  In 1998, the number of juveniles charged with drug-related or violent \ncrimes in the Yellowstone County Youth Court rose by 30 percent. In \nLame Deer--the community of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation--\nkids as young as 8 years old have been seen for meth addiction. Last \nNovember in our state, a meth lab blew up in Great Falls, leading to a \nhalf dozen arrests. Meth use in Montana has doubled in the past few \nyears. Cases are growing and the states law enforcement can no longer \nfight the problem.\n  Mr. President, the DEA reported an increase of meth lab seizures in \nMontana of 900% from 1993 to 1998. And according to the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy, based on methamphetamine admission rates \nper 100,000 persons, Montana is one of eight states with a ``serious \nmethamphetamine problem.''\n  The meth problem is particularly severe on Montana's Indian \nreservations, of which our state has seven. Life is hard there. In some \nreservation towns, over half of the working age adults are unemployed. \nBecause meth is cheap and relatively easy to make, these lower-income \nindividuals are a natural target for meth peddlers. Without viable \nemployment options, too often these young people turn to drugs.\n  And that's the case throughout Montana, not just on the reservations. \nIn 1998, Montana ranked 47th in the nation in per-capita personal \nincome, 50th in personal income from wages and salaries, and second in \nthe nation for the number of people who work two or more jobs.\n  Since poverty and drug use often go hand in hand, it came as little \nsurprise to me when a recent report showed a dramatic uptick in the \nincidence of drug abuse in rural America.\n  The report, commissioned by the Drug Enforcement Administration and \nfunded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, focused primarily on \n13- and 14-year-olds. It showed that eighth graders in rural America \nare 83 percent more likely to use crack cocaine than their urban \ncounterparts. They are 50 percent more likely to use cocaine, 34 \npercent more likely to smoke marijuana, 29 percent more likely to drink \nalcohol. Even more shocking, the report showed that rural eighth \ngraders were 104 percent more likely to use amphetamines, including \nmethamphetamine. Let me clarify, Mr. President. That is double the rate \nof urban eighth graders.\n  The bill I am proposing today would provide Montana the resources to \nput forth a coordinated effort in the fight against meth in Montana. By \nadmitting Yellowstone, Cascade and Missoula counties to the Rocky \nMountain HIDTA, Montana can focus its efforts on the three largest \nproblem areas for meth use. It would increase law enforcement and \nforensic personnel in Montana; coordinate efforts to exchange \ninformation among law enforcement agencies; and engage in a public \ninformation campaign to educate the public about the dangers of meth \nuse.\n  Mr. President, the time has come to fight this scourge. Montana is \nunder seige by meth, and we must do all we can to stop it--for the good \nof our state and those around us.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Bennett, \n        and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 2239. A bill to authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to provide \ncost sharing for the endangered fish recovery implementation programs \nfor the Upper Colorado River and San Juan River basins; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n   cost sharing for endangered fish recovery implementation programs\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nauthorize the Bureau of Reclamation to provide cost sharing for the \nendangered fish recovery implementation programs for the Upper Colorado \nRiver and San Juan River basins.\n  This legislation is the product of years of meetings between water \ndistricts, power users, state and federal government and environmental \ngroups. It authorizes federal and non-federal funding of an Upper Basin \nRecovery Program for endangered species in the Colorado River Basin and \nthe San Juan River Basin. The goal of the program is to recover the \nColorado pikeminnow, humpback chub, razorback sucker and bonytail chub \nwhile continuing to meet future water supply needs in the Upper Basin \nstates of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico.\n  To date, more than $20 million has been spent for capital projects to \nrecover the endangered fish. Failure to recover the endangered species \ncould result in limitations on current and future water diversions and \nuse in the Upper Basin states. The legislation provides Congress and \nthe Upper Basin stakeholders a finite Recovery Program under an \nauthorized spending cap.\n  The legislation authorizes $100 million for capital construction, \noperations and maintenance to implement other aspects of the program \nthat include fish ladders, hatchery facilities, removal of non-native \nspecies and habitat restoration. The cost sharing program authorizes \n$46 million of federal funds to the Bureau of Reclamation and the \nremaining $54 million will be generated from state contributions not to \nexceed $17 million; contributions from power revenues up to $17 million \nand the remaining $20 million from replacement power credit and capital \ncost of water.\n  The States of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming all support the \nprogram. Other supporters include: the Colorado River Energy \nDistributors Association, the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish \nRecovery Implementation Program, the Environmental Defense Fund, The \nNature Conservancy, Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District, \nColorado River Water Conservation District, Southern Ute Indian Tribe \nand Colorado Water Congress.\n  It is critical to affirm the federal government's commitment to the \nimplementation of the Recovery Programs. The bill reflects compromise \non all sides of the issue and recognizes that protection of endangered \nspecies can coincide with water development and water use. The \nparticipants want to move ahead with this program and are willing to \nhelp share in the costs. I urge my Senate colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO:\n  S. 2241. A bill to amend title XVII of the Social Security Act to \nadjust wages and wage-related costs for certain items and services \nfurnished in geographically reclassified hospitals; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nMedicare Wage-Index Reclassification Act of 2000. This bill will amend \nthe Social Security Act to redirect additional Medicare reimbursements \nto rural hospitals. Currently, hospitals throughout the country are \nlosing Medicare reimbursements, which results in severe implications \nfor surrounding communities.\n  As you know, in an attempt to keep Medicare from consuming its \nlimited reserves, Congress enacted the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 \n(BBA), which made sweeping changes in the manner that health care \nproviders are reimbursed for services rendered to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. These were the most significant modifications in the \nhistory of the program.\n\n[[Page S1415]]\n\n  All of the problems with the BBA--whether hospitals, nursing \nfacilities, home health agencies, or skilled nursing facilities--are \nespecially acute in rural states, where Medicare payments are a bigger \npercentage of hospital revenues and profit margins are generally much \nlower. These facilities were already managed at a highly efficient \nlevel and had ``cut the fat out of the system.'' Therefore, the cuts \nimplemented in the BBA hit the rural communities in Idaho and \nthroughout the United States in a very significant and serious way.\n  In the 1st session, the Senate Finance Committee did a tremendous job \nof bringing forth legislation that adjusted Medicare payments to health \ncare providers hurt by cuts ordered in the BBA. While this was a \nmeaningful step, the Senate must continue to address the inequities in \nthe system.\n  My bill would expand wage-index reclassification by requiring the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to deem a hospital that has been \nreclassified for purposes of its inpatient wage-index to also \nreclassify for purposes of other services which are provider-based and \nfor which payments are adjusted using a wage-index. In other words, \nthis legislation would require the Secretary to use a hospital's \nreclassification wage-index to adjust payments for hospital outpatient, \nskilled nursing facility, home health, and other services, providing \nthose entities are provider-based. This change should have been made in \nBBA when Congress required that prospective payment systems be \nestablished for these other services. As such, this change would \naddress an issue that has been left unaddressed for several years.\n  It makes sense that, if a hospital has been granted reclassification \nby the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board for certain \ninpatient services, it also be granted wage-index reclassification for \noutpatient and other services. It is estimated that this provision \nwould help approximately 400 hospitals, 90 percent which are rural. \nFurthermore, this provision would be budget neutral.\n  I know my colleagues in the Senate share my commitment of promoting \naccess to health care services in rural areas. Expanding wage-index \ngeographic reclassification will allow hospitals to recoup lost funds \nand use those funds to address patients' needs in an appropriate, \neffective, and meaningful way. I encourage my colleagues to co-sponsor \nthe Medicare Wage-Index Reclassification Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2241\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act \nof 1998 to improve the process for identifying the functions of the \nFederal Government that are not inherently governmental functions, for \ndetermining the appropriate organizations for the performance of such \nfunctions on the basis of competition, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                    THE FAIR ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2000\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nimprove the implementation of legislation that Congress passed in 1998, \nthe Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act.\n  It has been 45 years, since President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued \nBureau of the Budget Bulletin 55-4, proclaiming, ``It is the policy of \nthe Government to rely on the private sector to supply the products and \nservices the Government needs.''\n  Why is it, then, the Federal government has identified some one \nmillion positions on its payroll that are commercial in nature? As the \nauthor of the FAIR Act, I had hoped that my legislation would have put \ninto place a process, albeit 45 years later, to substantively implement \nIke's policy.\n  Despite almost a half-century of policy that ``the Federal government \nshould not start or carry on any activity to provide a commercial \nproduct or service if the product or service can be procured from the \nprivate sector'' more than 100 agencies have released FAIR Act \ninventories identifying some one million commercial Federal positions. \nOf these, 440,000 are in civilian agencies and more than 65 percent \nhave been exempted from potential outsourcing. In the Department of \nDefense, 504,000 non-uniformed positions are considered commercial, but \n196,000 or 39 percent are exempt from outsourcing.\n  The first year experience with the FAIR Act raises fundamental \nquestions. If it has been the Federal Government's policy for 45 years \nto rely on the private sector for commercially available goods and \nservices, how did we get to the point where despite claims of \n``reinventing government,'' ``the smallest Federal workforce since the \nKennedy Administration'' and other political rhetoric, we have one \nmillion Federal employees engaged in commercial activities? How is it \nthat of those one million positions, roughly half will not even be \nstudied to determine if government or private sector performance \nprovides the best value to the taxpayers?\n  The FAIR Act was intended to shed sunshine on the Federal \nGovernment's commercial activities. Its purpose was to tell the \nAmerican people what its government does and put in place a process to \ndetermine how to best get the job done. Unfortunately, implementation \nof the law has fallen short of these expectations.\n  The law requires agencies to inventory activities and positions that \nare not inherently governmental. Inventories are published so that \ninterested parties, both public and private, can challenge inclusions \nor omissions from the list. However, the Office of Management and \nBudget (OMB) has overstepped its authority by creating a series of \n``reason codes'' that enable agencies to declare activities commercial \nbut exempt from potential outsourcing, and then declaring such reason \ncode designations outside the challenge process. As a result, 482,000 \npositions, roughly half the government's entire FAIR inventory, has \nbeen declared commercial, but exempt from potential outsourcing, \npublic-private competition, or challenge. That is wrong, inconsistent \nwith the law and down right un-FAIR.\n  Manipulation of the process has also cast a long shadow on the \nsunshine Congress was seeking. Take for example the Department of \nEnergy. Of 11,765 commercial positions on its inventory, just 618 are \n``commercial competitive.'' Within the agency's Bonneville Power \nAdministration (BPA), 1,263 of the agency's 2,267 commercial positions \nwere classified as ``management'' and of these 1,259 were considered \n``commercial, in-house core,'' exempt from\n\n[[Page S1416]]\n\nfurther review. Unfortunately, DoE is not alone in gaming the system. \nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which has 4,500 employees, has \ninventoried all its positions in just two categories.\n  These practices, too, are un-FAIR, particularly for federal \nemployees. How can BPA or Corps of Engineers' employees tell if their \npositions are slated for potential outsourcing? How is the private \nsector to determine if the positions the Corps has on its inventory \ninvolve management of campgrounds, integration of their computer \nsystems, designing a dam, mapping a flood plain, or painting the walls \nof an office building if all these activities are aggregated into two \nbroad categories? These actions fail to shed sunshine and render the \nFAIR Act challenge process moot.\n  The FAIR Act also requires a ``review'' of commercial activities that \nsurvive the inventory and challenge process ``within a reasonable \ntime.'' The Act's legislative history clearly demonstrates Congress \nintended for such a review to be either direct outsourcing or a public-\nprivate competition similar to that envisioned in OMB Circular A-76. To \ndate, OMB has not issued guidance on how it will implement such \nreviews, nor has it established a timetable.\n  Due to OMB's dismal performance thus far, it is clear that Congress \nwill have to pass a package of FAIR Act amendments to make sure the job \nis done right. Today I introduce legislation to do just that.\n  This legislation is largely technical in nature but the major \nprovisions would improve the accuracy and usefulness of the \ninventories, make sure Federal employees are notified when their jobs \nappear on the inventories, fortify the review process, require a report \non the portability of federal employees' pension benefits, ban federal \nagencies from performing any commercial activity for other federal \nagencies or state and local governments unless a cost comparison is \nconducted and prohibits the conversion of any activity on a FAIR Act \ninventory to Federal Prison Industries.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member \nLieberman of the Government Affairs Committee to see that this common \nsense legislation is enacted into law this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Cleland, \n        Mrs. Murray, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Abraham, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 2243. A bill to reauthorize certain programs of the Small Business \nAdministration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness.\n\n\n     National Women's Business Council Re-Authorization Act of 2000\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I, along with Senators Snowe, \nKerry, Cleland, Murray, Mikulski, Abraham, and Jeffords, am introducing \nthe National Women's Business Council Re-authorization Act of 2000. \nThis legislation would ensure that one of our most valued resources may \ncontinue its work in support of women's business ownership. The bi-\npartisan National Women's Business Council has provided important \nadvice and counsel to the Congress since it was established in 1988. At \nthat time, there were 2.4 million women business owners documented; \ntoday, there are over 9 million women who own and operate businesses in \nevery sector, from home based services to construction trades to high \ntech giants. Women are changing the face of our economy at an \nunprecedented rate, and the Council has been our eyes and ears as we \nanticipate the needs of this burgeoning entrepreneurial sector. The 15 \nappointees to the Council, all prominent business women, have been hard \nat work during the last three years. Some of their accomplishments \ninclude: hosting Summit '98, a national economic forum that produced a \nMaster Plan of initiatives and recommendations to sustain and grow the \nentrepreneurial economy; preparing a Best Practices Guide for \nContracting with Woman, and issuing a comprehensive statistical study \nof 11 years of federal contracting with women owned businesses; co-\nhosting a series of highly regarded policy forums with the Federal \nReserve in 10 cities, including New Orleans, Louisiana, on capital \naccess issues facing entrepreneurs and working to secure the collection \nof data on women-owned businesses by the Bureau of the Census, and \nfunding new research on a range of issues concerning women's business \ndevelopment.\n  Recently, the Council has stepped up efforts to increase access to \ncredit for women-owned businesses. This spring, the Council will \nrelease a report in collaboration with the Milken Institute, which will \nidentify model programs that have been successful in increasing the \nflow of credit to small, women owned businesses, especially those in \nthe retail, service or high tech sectors. The Council is also working \nto increase investments in women-led firms by launching Springboard \n2000, a national series of women's venture capital forums. Building on \nthe momentum of its highly successful Silicon Valley event in January, \nthe Council will host at least two more forums showcasing women-led \nbusinesses before private, corporate and venture capital investors. As \nmy colleague Senator Kerry has said so often, the equity markets are \nthe last frontier for women entrepreneurs. The Council's venture \ncapital fairs provide women entrepreneurs with much needed access to \ncapital so that they can launch and grow their high tech businesses.\n  The Council is leading the effort to increase access to competitive \ncontracting opportunities by working with federal agencies and women's \nbusiness organizations. Later this year, the Council will release an \nextensive report on the characteristics and experiences of the over \n5,000 women business owners who have been successful in receiving \nfederal contracts. We eagerly look forward to reviewing their findings.\n  Under the chairmanship of Kay Koplovitz, the Council has indeed taken \na bold new approach in its advocacy of the fastest growing business \nsector. As a result of the Council's work this year, we will know more \nthan ever about women's business enterprise, their economic trends, the \ncharacteristics of their owners and their public and private sector \nneeds. The Council has been a powerful resource for policy makers by \nproviding valuable data, information and recommendations which are \nessential if we are to assist our communities in sustaining the \nunparalleled number of new businesses launched in the last 7 years.\n  It is for these reasons and more that I am introducing legislation to \nre-authorize the Council for another three years. It is imperative that \nthe National Women's Business Council continues its great work and \nexpands its activities to support initiatives that are creating the \ninfrastructure for women's entrepreneurship at the state and local \nlevel.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 2244. A bill to increase participation in employee stock purchase \nplans and individual retirement plans so that American workers may \nshare in the growth in the United States economy attributable to \ninternational trade agreements; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    working families trade bonus Act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, many working Americans fell like they've \nbeen left on the sidelines in the high-stakes game of international \ntrade. As U.S. companies expand overseas, corporate profits soar. \nWorkers standby watching for some tangible benefits for their own \npocketbooks. A May 1999 Los Angeles Times story captured Americans' \nskepticism toward trade. The story found just over half the public in \nMarch 1994 believed that treaties such as NAFTA would create U.S. jobs, \nwith only 32% fearing jobs loss. But by December 1998, the attitudes \nhad flip-flopped. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that 58% of \nAmericans believed that trade had reduced U.S. jobs and wages.\n  Nowhere has Americans' growing alienation from the world trading \nsystem been more evident than at the November 1999 World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) Ministerial meeting. The nightly news was filled \nwith the pictures of workers protesting the WTO in the streets of \nSeattle. This sense of alienation will continue to grow unless workers \nthemselves start to see more direct benefits from trade.\n  The legislation I am pleased to introduce today with Senator Baucus \nis an effort to narrow America's dividend divide in world trade. Our \nbill, The Working Families Trade Bonus Act, says\n\n[[Page S1417]]\n\nthat when companies win from world trade, workers should win, too. The \nbill would do this by encouraging companies to give their workers added \nTrade Bonus stock options--which workers at Fortune magazine's top 100 \nU.S. companies identified as one of the key reasons they work for the \ncompany. And for the millions of working Americans who don't have stock \nplans--farmers, self-employed and small business people--the bill would \nallow them to double the maximum allowable annual IRA contribution.\n  The bill specifically targets workers who are often excluded by \ncompany stock option plans--those at the lower end of company pay \nscales. The Trade Bonus program prohibits a company from discriminating \nin favor of highly compensated employees and requires that all \nemployees be allowed to purchase the maximum amount of stock allowed by \nlaw at the lowest price allowed by law. The program would not allow \ncompanies to substitute stock options for regular compensation. \nTogether, these safeguards assure that all workers are included in the \ntrade winner's circle.\n  Proponents of free trade, like Senator Baucus and myself, have done a \nlot of talking about its benefits. Manufactured goods are the \ncenterpiece of our nation's export--accounting for nearly two-thirds of \ntotal U.S. exports of goods and services. Exports support about one in \nevery five American factory jobs. These jobs pay about 15 percent more \non average than non-export-related jobs, require more skills and are \nless prone to economic downturns than those accounted for fully one-\nthird of our nation's economic growth, and since 1950, international \ntrade flows have grown twice as fast as the economy. Yet, most workers \nhave few good things to say about free trade because they've never seen \nany direct benefits from it. It's time to turn the rhetoric about free \ntrade into real benefits for workers. It's time to widen the winner's \ncircle to make sure that American workers share directly in the rewards \nof free trade.\n\n  Our legislation would require the Secretary of Commerce to determine \nannually, beginning with 1998, whether international trade has \ncontributed to an increase in U.S. GDP. This determination would be \nincluded in the President's budget for the subsequent fiscal year. For \nevery year in which the Secretary makes a determination that trade has \ncontributed to an increase in the U.S. GDP, employers would be \nencouraged to contribute additional compensation up to $2,000 per \nworker per year to employee stock purchase plans. These additional \ncontributions to an employee's stock purchase plan--the Trade Bonus--\nwould not be subject to capital gains tax. For workers who are not \neligible for an employee stock purchase plan Trade Bonus, the bill \nallows them to double the allowable annual amount of their IRA \ncontribution--to a maximum of $4,000.\n  For employers with 100 or fewer employees that do not have employee \nstock purchase plans, the bill would give them a significant incentive \nto create them; the bill offers a one-time tax credit to help offset \nall the administrative fees directly related to establishing an \nemployee stock purchase plan. It would also provide limited tax credits \nfor three subsequent years for costs directly related to IRS compliance \nand employee education about the Trade Bonus program. The language of \nthis section is drawn from previous legislation and assures that the \ntax credit applies only to the actual cost of creating the employee \nstock purchase plan and not to services that may be related to \nretirement planning, such as tax preparation, accounting, legal or \nbrokerage services.\n  The bill sets out guidelines for employers establishing or expanding \nan employee stock purchase plan under the Trade Bonus program, \nincluding that employees be eligible for the maximum amount of $2,000 \nat the lowest price allowed by law; that employers make the plan \navailable to the widest range of employees without discrimination in \nfavor of highly compensated employees; that employers ensure that the \ntrade bonus is in addition to compensation an employee would normally \nreceive (and that safeguards be in place to do so); and that it does \nnot result in lack of diversification of an employee's assets.\n  Here's how the Working Families Trade Bonus Act would work. As under \ncurrent law, employee stock purchase plans offer stock to participants \nat a discount. The current minimum purchase price is the lesser of 85% \nof the value of the stock on the date of the grant of the options \n(usually the beginning of the purchase period) or 85% of the value of \nthe stock when the option is exercised--usually the end of the purchase \nperiod. This means that, in the period during which the stock has \nappreciated, the employee can get the benefit of the appreciation and, \nin a period during which the stock has depreciated, the employee might \nstill be able to buy employer stock at a discounted price, or, if the \nplan provides, could decline to purchase the stock.\n\n  For example, let's say the President announces in the budget for FY \n2001 that international trade contributed to growth in US GDP in 1999. \nFleet of Foot Shoes, an athletic shoe manufacturer in Florence, Oregon, \ndecides to award its workers the full $2,000 trade bonus on February 1, \n2000. If a share of Fleet of Foot stock is worth $100 on the date of \nthe grant of the option and $200 when the option is exercised, say \nDecember 2001, the employees' purchase price can be as low as $85. This \nmeans the employee can purchase stock worth $200 for only $85, so the \nemployee is able to purchase more than 40 shares of stock for the price \nof only 20 shares. Alternatively, if the stock is worth $50 when the \noption is exercised, the employee is able to purchase stock worth $50 \nfor only $42.50.\n  Here is how the tax benefit would work. Under current law, employees \nwho hold qualified stock at least two years from the date of grant of \nthe option and one year from the purchase of the stock are entitled to \na capital gains tax break until the point they sell the stock. If an \nemployee chooses to sell stock purchased through the Trade Bonus and \nthe purchase price was less than the fair market value on the date the \noption was granted, then the difference between the purchase price and \nthe fair market value will be taxed as ordinary income in the year the \nstock is sold. Under my proposal, the remainder of the gain that would \notherwise be taxed as a capital gain in the same year would not be \ntaxed. So, using the Trade Bonus, if an employee pays $85 to buy a \nshare of stock whose fair market value is $100, holds onto the share \nfor more than the required two years and then sells it for $150, the \n$15 discount on the original purchase price would be taxed as ordinary \nincome, but the employee would not pay capital gains tax on the $50 \nincrease in the value of the share of stock.\n  About one-half of all American adults own stock today, and stocks are \nnow the largest asset families own, exceeding even home equity. \nFortune's January 2000 survey found 36 of the 58 publicly held \ncompanies on the top 100 list offer options to all employees. According \nto a 1998 survey of Oregon technology companies, almost two-thirds of \nOregon's technology companies offer stock options. In today's tight \nemployment market where companies compete to attract and retain the \nbest employees, stock purchase plans are becoming increasingly common. \nThe National Center for Employee Ownership estimates that seven and a \nhalf million Americans work for companies that make stock options \navailable, and that employees own nine percent of total corporate \nequity in the United States. A recent Federal Reserve study found that \none-third of the firms it surveyed offer stock options to employees \nother than executives.\n  Our legislation will build upon this trend. The Working Families \nTrade Bonus Opportunity Act will give workers the chance to share \ndirectly in the benefits of free trade. This legislation will help put \nreal money into the pockets of working Americans, and help move stock \noptions out of the corner office and onto the shop floor.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthat certain small businesses are permitted to use the cash method of \naccounting even if they use merchandise or inventory; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n       small business accounting method clarification act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \naddresses an issue of growing concern to small businesses across the \nnation--tax accounting methods. And I am pleased to be joined in this \neffort by my colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley.\n  While this topic may lack the notoriety of some other tax issues \ncurrently in the spotlight like the estate tax or alternative minimum \ntax, it goes to the heart of a business' daily operations--reflecting \nits income and expenses. And because it is such a fundamental issue, \none may ask: ``What's the big deal?'' Hasn't this been settled long \nago?'' Regrettably, recent efforts by the Treasury Department and \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) have muddied what many small business \nowners have long seen as a settled issue.\n  To many small business owners, tax accounting simply means that they \nrecord cash receipts when they come in and the cash they pay when they \nwrite a check for a business expense. The difference is income, which \nis subject to taxes. In its simplest form, this is known as the ``cash \nreceipts and disbursements'' method of accounting--or the ``cash \nmethod'' for short. It is easy to understand, it is simple to undertake \nin daily business operations, and for the vast majority of small \nenterprises, it matches their income with the related expenses in a \ngiven year. Coincidentally, it's also the method of accounting used by \nthe Federal Government to keep track of the $1.7 trillion in tax \nrevenues it collects each year as well as all of its expenditures for \nsalaries and expenses, procurement, and the cost of various government \nprograms.\n  Unfortunately, the IRS has taken a different view in recent years \nwith respect to small businesses on the cash method. In too many cases, \nthe IRS contends that a small business should report its income when \nall events have occurred to establish the business' right to receipt \nand the amount can reasonably be determined. Similar principles are \napplied to determine when a business may recognize an expense. This \nmethod of accounting is known as ``accrual accounting.'' The reality of \naccrual accounting for a small business is that it may be\n\n[[Page S1420]]\n\ndeemed to have income well before the cash is actually received and an \nexpense long after the cash is actually paid. As a result, accrual \naccounting can create taxable income for a small business that has yet \nto receive the cash necessary to pay the taxes.\n  While the IRS argues that the accrual method of accounting produces a \nmore accurate reflection of ``economic income,'' it also produces a \nmajor headache for small enterprise. Few entrepreneurs have the time or \nexperience to undertake accrual accounting, which forces them to hire \ncostly accountants and tax preparers. By some estimates, accounting \nfees can increase as much as 50% when accrual accounting is required, \nexcluding the cost of high-tech computerized accounting systems that \nsome businesses must install. For the brave few that try to handle the \naccounting on their own, the accrual method often leads to major \nmistakes, resulting in tax audits and additional costs for professional \nhelp to sort the whole mess out--not to mention the interest and \npenalties that the IRS may impose as a result of the mistake.\n  To make matters even worse, the IRS recently began focusing on small \nservice providers who use some merchandise in the performance of their \nservice. In an e-mail sent to practitioners in my State of Missouri and \nin Kansas, the IRS' local district office took special aim at the \nconstruction industry asserting that ``[t]axpayers in the construction \nindustry who are on the cash method of accounting may be using an \nimproper method. The cash method is permissible only if materials are \nnot an income producing factor.'' For these lucky service providers, \nthe IRS now asserts that the use of merchandise requires the business \nto undertake an additional and even more onerous form of bookkeeping--\ninventory accounting.\n  Let's be clear about the kind of taxpayer at issue here. It's the \nhome builder who by necessity must purchase wood, nails, dry wall, and \nhost of other items to provide the service of constructing a house. \nSimilarly, it's a painting contractor who will often purchase the paint \nwhen she renders the service of painting the interior of a house. These \nservice providers generally purchase materials to undertake a specific \nproject and at its end, little or no merchandise remains. They may even \narrange for the products to be delivered directly to their client. In \neither case, the IRS insists that inventory accounting is now required.\n  Mr. President, if we thought that accrual accounting is complicated \nand burdensome, imagining in having to keep track of all the boards, \nnails, and paint used in the home builder's and painter's jobs each \nyear. And the IRS doesn't stop at inventory accounting for these \nservice providers. Instead, they use it as the first step to imposing \noverall accrual accounting--a one-two punch for the small service \nprovider when it comes to compliance burdens.\n  Even more troubling is the cost of an audit for these unsuspecting \nservice providers who have never known they were required to use \ninventories or accrual accounting. According to a survey of \npractitioners by the Padgett Business Services Foundation, audits of \nbusinesses on the issue of merchandise used in the performance of \nservices resulted in tax deficiencies from $2,000 to $14,000, with an \naverage of $7,200. That's a pretty steep price to pay for an accounting \nmethod error that the IRS has for years never enforced.\n  In many cases, like retailing, inventory accounting makes sense. \nPurchasing or manufacturing products and subsequently selling them is \nthe heart of a retail business, and keeping track of those products is \na necessary reality. But for a service provider with incidental \nmerchandise, like a roofing contractor, inventory accounting is nothing \nshort of an unnecessary government-imposed compliance cost.\n  The bill I'm introducing today, the Small Business Tax Accounting \nSimplification Act of 2000, addresses both of these issues. First, it \nestablishes a clear threshold for when small businesses may use the \ncash method of accounting. Simply put, if a business has an average of \n$5 million in annual gross receipts or less during the preceding three \nyears, it may use the cash method. Plain and simple--no complicated \nformula; no guessing if you made the right assumptions and arrived at \nthe right answer. If the business exceeds the threshold, it may still \nseek to establish, as under current law, that the cash method clearly \nreflects its income.\n  Some may argue that this provision is unnecessary because section \n448(b) and (c) already provide a $5 million gross receipts test with \nrespect to accrual accounting. That's a reasonable position since many \nin Congress back in 1986 intended section 448 to provide relief for \nsmall business taxpayers using the cash method. Unfortunately, the IRS \nhas twisted this section to support its quest to force as many small \nbusinesses as possible into costly accrual accounting. The IRS \nconstrues section 448 as merely a $5 million ceiling above which a \nbusiness can never use the cash method. My bill corrects this \nmisinterpretation once and for all--if a business has average gross \nreceipts of $5 million or less, it is free to use cash accounting.\n  Second, for small service providers, the Small Business Tax \nAccounting Simplification Act, creates a straightforward threshold for \ninventory accounting. If the amount paid for merchandise by a small \nservice provider is less than 50% of its gross receipts, based on its \nprior year's figures, no inventory accounting would be required. Above \nthat level, the taxpayer would look more like a retail business and \ninventory accounting may make sense.\n  These two thresholds set forth in my bill are common sense answers to \nan increasing burden for small businesses in this country. In addition, \nit sends a clear signal to the IRS: stop wasting scarce resources \nforcing small businesses to adopt complex and costly accounting methods \nwhen the benefit to the Treasury is simply a matter of timing. Whether \na small business uses the cash or accrual method or inventory \naccounting or not, in the end, the government will still collect the \nsame amount of taxes--maybe not all this year, but very likely early in \nthe next year. What small business can go very long without collecting \nwhat it is owed or paying its bills?\n  To date, the Treasury Department's answer has been to suggest a $1 \nmillion threshold under which a small business could escape accrual \naccounting and presumably inventories. While it is a step in the right \ndirection, it simply doesn't go far enough. Even ignoring inflation, if \na million dollar threshold were sufficient, why would Congress have \ntried to enact a $5 million threshold 14 years ago? My bill completes \nthe job that the Treasury Department has been unable or unwilling to \ndo.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today is substantially \nsimilar to the bill introduced in the other body by my good friend and \nfellow Missourian, Jim Talent (H.R. 2273). With the strong support he \nhas built among his colleagues in the other chamber and in the small \nbusiness community, I expect to continue the momentum in the Senate and \nachieve some much needed relief from unnecessary compliance burdens and \ncosts for America's small businesses.\n  The call for tax simplification has been growing increasingly loud in \nrecent years, and the bill I offer today provides an excellent \nopportunity for us to advance the ball well down the field. This is not \na partisan issue; it's a small business issue. And I urge my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to join me in this common sense legislation \nfor the benefit of America's small enterprises, which contribute so \ngreatly to this country's economic engine.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a copy \nof the bill and a description of its provisions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2246\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Tax \n     Accounting Simplification Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION OF CASH ACCOUNTING RULES FOR SMALL \n                   BUSINESS.\n\n       Section 446 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating \n     to general rule for methods of accounting) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(g) Small Business Taxpayers Permitted To Use Cash \n     Accounting Method Without Limitation.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, a taxpayer shall not\n\n[[Page S1421]]\n\n     be required to use an accrual method of accounting for any \n     taxable year, if the average annual gross receipts of such \n     taxpayer (or any predecessor) for the 3-year-period ending \n     with the preceding taxable year does not exceed $5,000,000. \n     The rules of paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 448(c) shall \n     apply for purposes of the preceding sentence. In the case of \n     a C corporation or a partnership which has a C corporation as \n     a partner, the first sentence of this subsection shall apply \n     only if such C corporation or partnership meets the \n     requirements of section 448(b)(3).''.\n       (b) Clarification of Inventory Rules for Small Business.--\n     Section 471 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \n     general rule for inventories) is amended by redesignating \n     subsection (c) as subsection (d) and by inserting after \n     subsection (b) the following new subsection:\n       ``(c) Small Business Service Providers Not Required To Use \n     Inventories.--A taxpayer shall not be required to use \n     inventories under this section for a taxable year if the \n     amounts paid for merchandise sold during the preceding \n     taxable year were less than 50 percent of the gross receipts \n     received during such preceding taxable year. For purposes of \n     this subsection, gross receipts for any taxable year shall be \n     reduced by returns and allowances made during such year.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Small Business Tax Accounting Simplification Act of 2000--Description \n                             of Provisions\n\n       The bill amends section 446 of the Internal Revenue Code to \n     provide a clear threshold for small businesses to use the \n     cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, instead \n     of accrual accounting. To qualify, the business must have $5 \n     million or less in average annual gross receipts based on the \n     preceding three years.\n       The bill also amends section 471 of the Internal Revenue \n     Code to provide a small service provider exception to the \n     inventory accounting rules. Under this provision, if the \n     amount spent on merchandise by a service provider is less \n     than 50% of its gross receipts, inventory accounting under \n     section 471 would not be required. This 50% test is based on \n     the service provider's purchases and gross receipts in the \n     preceding taxable year.\n       Both provisions of the bill would be effective beginning on \n     the date of enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1397-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1397-S1421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Levin, \nMr. Sarbanes, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Reid, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \nDorgan, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Cleland, and Mrs. \nFeinstein):\n  S. 2229. A bill to provide for digital empowerment, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                        digital empowerment act\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Today, I introduce the Digital Empowerment Act. The \ngoal of this legislation is to ensure that every child is computer \nliterate by the eighth grade regardless of race, ethnicity, income, \ngender, geography, or disability.\n  Yesterday, the Senate's Education Committee voted for my amendment to \nestablish this as our national goal. This vote was taken on a \nbipartisan basis and was unanimous. Today, I am introducing this \nlegislation to make this goal a reality. This bill has been a team \neffort. I reached out to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the \nCongressional Black Caucus, to my colleagues, the people throughout \nMaryland, ministers in Baltimore, business leaders, educators, and \npolitical leadership. Why? It is because a digital divide exists in \nAmerica. Those who have access to technology and know how to use it \nwill be ready for the new digital economy. Those who don't will be left \nout and left behind.\n  Low-income urban and rural families are less likely to have access to \nthe Internet and computers. Black and Hispanic families are only two-\nfifths as likely to have Internet access as their white counterparts. \nSome schools have 10 computers in every classroom. In other schools, \nthere are 200 students who share one computer. The private sector is \ndoing important and exciting work, such as Power Up from AOL, but \ntechnology empowerment can't be limited to a few zip codes. What we \nneed is a national policy and national programs.\n  Mr. President, I believe the best antipoverty program is an \neducation. If we practice the ABCs, we will ensure that our children \nhave a good education and will cross this digital divide. Crossing the \ndigital divide is about technology and about children having access to \ntechnology. It is about teachers knowing how to teach children the \ntools of technology so they can cross this digital divide.\n  The ABCs are simply this: Access--each child must have universal \naccess to computers, whether it is in a school, a library, or a \ncommunity center. Many families cannot afford to buy computers for \ntheir homes, but children in America should have access to them through \npublic institutions.\n  We also need to practice the B--best-trained teachers and, I might \nadd, better-paid teachers.\n  But C would be computer literacy for all students by the time they \nfinish eighth grade.\n  My Digital Empowerment Act will, first of all, create a one-stop shop \nfor Federal education technology programs at the Department of \nEducation. Why do we need this? Well, right now, our programs are \nscattered throughout the Department. School superintendents have to \nforage to be able to find that information, and when they do, they find \nthe funding is absolutely spartan or skimpy. That is why my legislation \nalso improves our schools in terms of access to technology and teacher \ntraining.\n  Teachers want to help their students cross the digital divide, but \nthey are facing three major problems. One, they need technology. They \nneed hardware and software. They need training to use the technology \nbecause without training of the teachers or librarians, it is a hollow \nopportunity.\n  In my own home State of Maryland, over 600 teachers from across the \nState volunteered to participate in a tech-prep academy so they could \nbe ready. But hundreds were turned away. For every one teacher who can \nsign up for tech-prep training, four or five are standing in line to do \nso.\n  My bill addresses these concerns. We are going to double funding for \nschool technology and for teacher training. We now spend less than half \na billion dollars on training and technology for our schools. We would \ndouble that to $850 million. But we also have to make sure we go where \nchildren learn, and that is in the community. Right now, what we find \nis that the only reliable source of revenue for wiring schools and \nlibraries is the E-rate. But, the E-rate does not go to community \ncenters.\n\n  Whether it is an African-American church or a community center in an \nAppalachian region or rural parts of the South or the upper regions of \nAlaska, what my legislation would do is help community centers. My \nlegislation would create an E-corps within the AmeriCorps national \nservice program. It would bring AmeriCorps volunteers with special \ntechnology training into our schools and into our communities.\n  I recently had a town hall meeting in an elementary school in \nRiverdale, MD. The teachers and students told me they need extra pairs \nof hands to help out in the computer lab to be able to teach the \nchildren. Also, we want to create 1,000 community tech centers. \nCommunity leaders have told me we need to bring technology to where \nkids learn, not just where we want them to learn. Our legislation would \ncreate 1,000 community-based centers that would be run by community \norganizations such as the YMCA and YWCA, Urban League, or a faith-based \norganization, where children could be there for structured afterschool \nactivities, and also adults could be there earlier in the day to \ndevelop their job skills.\n  Government cannot do this alone. We want public-private partnerships. \nI want to use our Tax Code to encourage public-private partnerships. \nThis bill uses our Tax Code to encourage the donations of technology, \ntechnology training, and technology maintenance for schools, libraries \nand community centers.\n  Mr. President, that is the core of our program. We are living in \nexciting times. The opportunities are tremendous to use technology to \nimprove our lives, to use technology to remove the barriers caused by \nincome, race, or ethnicity. Technology could mean the death of distance \nas a barrier for bringing jobs into the rural areas of our country. We \nwant technology to be the death of discrimination where children have \nbeen left out or left aside. Bringing this technology into schools and \nlibraries would enable children to leapfrog into the future.\n  Technology is the tool, but empowerment is the outcome. We want to be \nsure each child in the United States of America, by being computer \nliterate by the time they are in the eighth grade, will be ready for \nthe new economy. We hope that by setting that as a national goal we \nwill get children to stay in school and know that the future lies in \nworking in this new economy.\n  I thank everybody who worked on this bill with me. I thank everyone \non my staff who helped me, including Julia Frifield, Jill Shapiro, and \nAndrea Vernot. This has truly been a team effort. I am pleased that I \nhave 25 cosponsors from the U.S. Senate on this legislation. I hope \nthat kind of bipartisan support will move this legislation forward.\n  I will conclude by saying this is a tremendous opportunity. This is \nnot about a laundry list of new Government programs. We are here to \nmake the highest and best use of the programs that exist, a wise and \nprudent use of taxpayer funds, and also to say to each child in America \nif you want to learn and get ready for the new economy, your Federal \nGovernment is on your side.\n  I give all praise and thanks to the Dear Lord who has inspired me to \ndo this and gives me the opportunity to serve in the Senate. I truly \nbelieve one person can make a difference. I am trying to do that with \nthis legislation. If we can work together, I know we will be able to \nbring about change--change for our children and change for the better.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to join Senator Mikulski \nin introducing the National Digital Empowerment Act, which seeks to \nclose the gap between those who have technology available to them and \nthose who do not. I commend Senator Mikulski for her commitment to \nconnect every school and community to the Information Superhighway. The \nlegislation we are introducing will help to achieve this goal. It will \nenable students and teachers in all communities to have access to \ncomputers, as well as the training that is necessary to use this \ntechnology effectively.\n\n[[Page S1398]]\n\n  The widening digital divide falls heaviest on those who can least \nafford to be left behind. Recent studies show that the Digital divide \nfor the poorest Americans has grown by 29 percent since 1997, and that \nover 50 percent of schools lack the infrastructure needed to support \nnew technology. In addition, approximately 4 out of 10 teachers report \nthat they have had no training in using the Internet; and a mere 10 \npercent of new teachers reported that they felt prepared to use \ntechnology in their classrooms, while only 13 percent of all public \nschools reported that technology-related training for teachers was \nmandated by the school, district, or teacher certification agencies. \nThis legislation will provide the necessary tools to reverse this \ntrend.\n  It will substantially increase funding for teacher training in \ntechnology, including the creation of Teacher Technology Preparation \nAcademies--teachers who are trained by the Academies would be \nencouraged to return to their schools and act as technology instructors \nfor other teachers; increase funding for school technology; extend the \ncurrent enhanced deduction for computer technology which is currently \ndue to expire in 2001; require HUD to establish e-Villages in all HUD \nhousing programs; authorize and increase funding for the creation of \nCommunity Technology Centers and e-corps within the AmeriCorps; create \na one stop shop clearinghouse of public and private technology efforts \nwithin the U.S. Department of Education to be headed by an Assistant \nSecretary for Technology Education. In addition, the legislation \ndirects the Secretary to implement an Internet-based, one-to-one pilot \nproject that specifically targets the educational needs of K-12 \nstudents in low-income school districts, including hardware, software \nand ongoing support and professional development; and improve the e-\nRate program.\n  After two funding cycles the total e-Rate funding that went to our \nnation's schools and libraries was $3.6 billion nationally, including \n$137.15 million for Michigan. That is a good investment to help prepare \nour children and citizens for the information age of the 21st century. \nBut it is still not sufficient to provide all qualified schools and \nlibraries with the e-Rate discounts they have requested. This \nlegislation would improve the Universal Service Fund by making the e-\nRate application process simpler, and would increase the current cap of \n$2.25 billion and expand eligibility to include structured after school \nprograms, Head Start centers and programs receiving federal job \ntraining funds. The e-Rate has proven itself to be a successful and \npopular program and its time to make it available to everyone who needs \nit.\n  I am especially pleased to be a part of this legislative effort \nbecause it supports some model initiatives that I have established in \nmy home state of Michigan, to create ways in which teachers can become \nmore computer literate and able to integrate technology into the \ncurriculum and to bring technology into every classroom.\n  About 2 years ago, I convened an education technology summit that \nbrought together over 400 business leaders, school administrators, \nschool board members, foundation representatives, deans of Michigan's \ncolleges of education and others to identify ways in which Michigan \ncould excel in the area of Education technology. What I learned was \nthat one of the biggest obstacles to technologically up-do-date \nclassrooms is the lack of training of our teachers in the use of \ntechnology. If teachers don't understand how to integrate computers, \nthe Internet, and other technology into the instructional program, \nstudents won't get full advantage of these innovations, no matter how \nmuch hardware and wiring have been installed.\n  Despite impressive achievements in the utilization of education \ntechnology in a few localities, Michigan as a whole was below the \nnational average in every measure of the use of technology in our \nschools. It ranked 44 in teacher training in the use of technology; and \n10 percent of teachers reported that they had less than 9 hours of \ntechnology training. In addition, Michigan ranked 32 among the states \nin the ratio of students per computer. I have subsequently hosted a \nnumber of working sessions which have resulted in a specific plan of \naction to advance education technology in Michigan.\n  Some key elements of the plan of action include the formation of a \nconsortium that will establish the nation's highest standards for \ntraining new teachers to use technology in the classroom. Beginning \nwith the 1999-2000 academic year, the Consortium for Outstanding \nAchievement in Teaching with Technology {COATT} will award certificates \nof recognition to new teachers who have demonstrated an exceptional \nability to use information technology as a teaching tool.\n  COATT membership includes an impressive slate of higher educational \ninstitutions from Michigan: Albion College, Andrews University, Eastern \nMichigan University, Ferris State University, Lake Superior State \nUniversity, Michigan State University, Oakland University, University \nof Detroit-Mercy, University of Michigan, University of Michigan-\nDearborn, Wayne State University and Western Michigan University. \nNeither the education nor the certificate is mandatory. However, new \nteachers with certificates will have an advantage in the job market and \nschool districts will benefit by knowing which applicants are qualified \nin using technology effectively in their instruction. The letter of \nagreement signed by each COATT member in committing their institution \nto provide the resources to achieve the success of the COATT initiative \nwhich is included at the end of my remarks.\n  Michigan is already recognized as a leader in producing new teachers \nand if we set our minds to it, I'm convinced we can be the best in the \nnation when it comes to teaching teachers how to integrate technology \nin the classroom.\n  Another key element of my plan of action to advance Michigan's \nstanding in education technology is the establishment of the Teach for \nTomorrow Project, TFT, an online delivery system for educational \ntechnology training and credentialing of in-service teachers. By using \ntechnology to teach the technology, lessons can be accessed statewide \nand at time and location which are convenient to the learners. An added \nbonus, which results in an expansion of the use of technology in the \nclassroom, is that teachers who complete TFT teach other teachers what \nthey have learned. Central Michigan University has approved the use of \nTFT materials as a professional development course eligible for 3 \ngraduate credit hours when done in conjunction with local onsite \ntraining.\n  The legislation before us, the National Digital Empowerment Act, will \nspeed the closing of the digital divide not only in my state of \nMichigan, but nationwide. Time is of the essence. We must act \nresponsibly and we must act now!\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the \nCOATT member agreement signed by higher education institutions in \nMichigan.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Consortium for Outstanding Achievement in Teaching With Technology \n                          Letter of Agreement\n\n       We, the undersigned, commit our institutions to be members \n     of the Consortium for Outstanding Achievement in Teaching \n     with Technology (COATT). In doing so our institutions accept \n     the following requirements:\n       (1) Each institution shall designate a facility liaison to \n     COATT. This person will participate in an annual review of \n     the COATT standards and participate in periodic meetings with \n     other core members of the COATT organization.\n       (2) Each institution shall designate a person to act as a \n     point of contact within the institution for potential COATT \n     candidates.\n       (3) Each institution shall promote COATT to potential \n     candidates. This might occur through flyers, regular \n     newsletters, publications, placement files, etc.\n       (4) Each institution shall provide adequate and relevant \n     learning opportunities in the application of educational \n     technology for students who wish to acquire COATT \n     certification.\n       (5) Each institution shall provide adequate resources for \n     COATT applicants to produce, maintain, and gain access to \n     their COATT digital portfolios.\n       (6) Each institution shall be responsible for recommending \n     and pre-certifying COATT applicants.\n       (7) Each institution shall involve its faculty and other \n     qualified personnel in COATT evaluation teams.\n       By signing below, we understand that we are committing our \n     institutions to provide the personnel, resources, and \n     opportunities described in the above seven points. We \n     recognize that this level of commitment is crucial to the \n     success of the COATT initiative.\n         Reuben Rubio, Director of the Ferguson Center for \n           Technology-Aided Teaching,\n\n[[Page S1399]]\n\n           Albion College; Dr. Niels-Erik Andreasen, President, \n           Andrews University; Dr. Jerry Robbins, Dean of the \n           School of Education, Eastern Michigan University; Dr. \n           Nancy Cooley, Dean of the College of Education, Ferris \n           State University; Dr. David L.

A bill to provide tax relief in relation to, and modify the \ntreatment of, members of a reserve component of the Armed Forces, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          THE MILITARY GUARD AND RESERVE FAIRNESS ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \naddressing a very important issue-fairness for the Guard and Reserve \nmembers in our armed forces.\n  Le me begin with a February 3rd report from the Washington Post \ntitled ``A Tough Goodbye: Guard Members Leave for Nine Months in \nBosnia.'' It reads ``Sgt. Deedra Lavoie was alone, after leaving her \ntwo young children with her ex-husband. Sgt. Bill Wozniak, hugging his \n3-year-old daughter, was worried about not having the same job when he \nreturns in nine months. Staff Sgt. Stephen Smith won't have a home to \ncome back to: Movers have cleared out his Annapolis apartment, which he \ncan't afford to keep while overseas.''\n  This brings home, Mr. President, the real hardship that thousands of \nGuards and Reservists, and their families, are facing today.\n  The traditional duty of the National Guards and reservists was to \nkeep domestic peace or fight in wars. But as the number of our Armed \nForces has fallen by more than 1 million personnel since 1988, \nincreasing numbers of our Guards and Reserve members are being pulled \nout of the private sector and into what amounts to at times to be full-\ntime military service.\n  They are often called on to carry out overseas peacekeeping, \nhumanitarian and other missions. Their deployment time is longer than \never before in peacetime. Today we rely heavily on our Guardsmen and \nReservists to support overseas contingency operations. Since 1990, they \nhave been called to service in Operation RESTORE HOPE in Somalia, \nOperation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY in Haiti, Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR/JOINT \nGUARD in Bosnia, Operation STABILIZE in Southeast Asia and Operation \nTASK FORCE FALCON in Kosovo.\n  Mr. President, the statistics speak for themselves:\n  Work days contributed by Guardsmen and Reservists have risen from 1 \nmillion days in 1992, to over 13 million days last year. Without the \nservice of these citizen soldiers, we would need an additional force of \n35,000 soldiers to do the job.\n  43,000 Guardsmen and Reservists have served in Bosnia and Kosovo from \nDecember 1995 through March 1, 2000. This is 33 percent of the total \nArmed Forces personnel participating in that region during that period.\n  Mr. President, Guardsmen and Reservists are willing to do their duty \nand serve when they are called, but increasingly frequent overseas \ndeployments create tremendous hardship for them, and their families, as \nwell their employers. We need to give our reserve forces fair treatment \nby improving the quality of life both for them and their dependents. We \nmust help their employers adjust as well.\n  That's why I am introducing the Military Guard and Reserve Fairness \nAct of 2000. This bill would do the following:\n  First, my legislation would exempt federal tax on the base pay for \nenlisted Guardsmen and Reservists and exempt federal tax on the base \npay of Guard and Reserve officers up to the highest level of that if \nenlisted Guardsmen and Reservists' base pay during their overseas \ndeployment.\n  The majority of Guardsmen and Reservists take pay cuts when called up \nfor involuntary overseas deployment, and sustain a huge financial loss. \nOur active duty military personnel enjoy federal tax exemption on their \nbase pay, why not our Guardsmen and Reservists who perform the same \nduty as full-time military personnel?\n  Secondly, my legislation would provide a tax credit to employers who \nemploy Guardsmen and Reservists. The tax credit would be equal to 50 \npercent of the amount of compensation that would have been paid to an \nemployee during the time that the employee participates in contingency \noperations. However, the credit is capped at $2000 for each individual \nReservist employee and a maximum of $30,000 for all employees. This \nprovision would apply to the self-employed as well.\n  Despite the fact that most businesses are fully supportive of the \nmilitary obligations of their employees, studies show that the \nincreasingly long overseas deployments have created a new strain on \nGuard/Reserve-employer relations. One of the reasons is that the \nunplanned absence of Guard/Reservist-employees creates a variety of \nproblems for employers. Employers have to hire and train temporary \nemployees, budget for overtime, or reschedule work and deadlines. As a \nresult, it increases employer costs, reducing revenue and profits. This \nis particularly problematic for small business and the self-employed.\n  The Defense Department acknowledges the increased use of the Guard \nand Reserve and that unplanned contingency operations do create \nproblems for employers. DOD suggests that a financial incentive may \nhelp to correct some of the problems.\n  The tax credit included in my bill would offset at least some of the \nexpense that Guard and Reserve employers face, and help reduce tension \nwith employees.\n  Third, the Military Guard and Reserve Fairness Act would provide \nfederal income tax deductions for transportation, meals and lodging \nexpenses incurred in performance of Guard and Reserve military duty.\n  Mr. President, many Guardsmen and Reservists have to travel to a \nReserve center, such as a National Guard Armory, far away from their \nhome areas for drills or training.\n  Often Guardsmen and Reservists incur expenses for transportation, \nmeals, lodging and other necessities. Before 1986, members of the Guard \nand Reserve could deduct these costs as business expenses. But the Tax \nReform Act of 1986 eliminated this deduction.\n  This is not fair. This nation requires our Guard and Reserve members \nto perform their duty but also expects them to bear the expense. \nRestoring the deductibility would help restore fairness for Reservists.\n  The Military Guard and Reserve Fairness Act would also include a \nnumber of provisions that would give our Guard and Reserve members fair \ntreatment by improving their quality of life.\n  It would extend space-available travel (``Space-A'') to Reservists \nand the National Guard, to travel outside of the United States--the \nsame level as retired military, and gives the Guardsmen and Reservists \nthe same priority status as active duty personnel when traveling for \ntheir monthly drills.\n  It would grant so-called ``gray area retirees'' the right to travel \nSpace-A under the same conditions as the retired military receiving \nretired pay as well.\n  In addition, my legislation would provide Guardsmen and Reservists, \nwhen traveling to attend monthly military drills, the same billeting \nprivileges as active duty personnel.\n  The bill would also remove the annual Guard and Reserve retirement \npoint maximum--upon which retirement pensions are based--and allow \nretirement pensions to be based upon the actual number of points earned \nannually.\n  Finally, my legislation would extend free legal services to Guardsmen \nand Reservists by Judge Advocate General officers for a time equal to \ntwice the length of their last period of active duty service.\n  Mr. President, our Guard and Reserve members are being called upon to \nperform more overseas active duty assignments to keep pace with the \nrising\n\n[[Page S1400]]\n\nnumber of U.S. peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. I believe that \nthis increase in overseas active-duty assignments for Guard and Reserve \ncomponent members merits the extension of military benefits for our \nNation's citizen soldiers. It is only fair to close these disparities.\n  The passage of my Military Guard and Reserve Fairness Act would \nrestore fairness to our Guard and Reserve members, and it would greatly \nincrease morale and the quality of life for our National Guard and \nReserves and prevent problems of recruitment and retention in the \nfuture. Hence, it would strengthen our national defense and increase \nour military readiness. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of \nour military Guard and Reserves.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Bryan, Mr. L. Chafee, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Moynihan, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mr. Lugar, and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 2232. A bill to promote primary and secondary health promotion and \ndisease prevention services and activities among the elderly, to amend \ntitle XVIII of the Social Security Act to add preventive benefits, and \nfor other purpose; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     medicare wellness act of 2000\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today, along with my colleagues, \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Bingaman, Senator Chafee, Senator Bryan, \nSenator Rockefeller, Senator Kerry, Senator Murray, Senator Moynihan, \nSenator Lugar, and Senator Snowe, I introduce the Medicare Wellness Act \nof 2000.\n  The Medicare Wellness Act represents a concerted effort by myself and \nmy distinguished colleagues to change the fundamental focus of the \nMedicare program.\n  it changes the program from one that simply treats illness and \ndisability, to one that is also proactive.\n  Enhancing the focus on health promotion and disease prevention for \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, despite common misperceptions, declines in health \nstatus are not inevitable with age. A healthier lifestyle, even one \nadopted later in life, can increase active life expectancy and decrease \ndisability.\n  This fact is a major reason why The Medicare Wellness Act has support \nfrom a broad range of groups, including the National Council on Aging, \nPartnership for Prevention, American Heart Association, and the \nNational Osteoporosis Foundation.\n  The most significant aspect of this bill is its addition of several \nnew preventative screening and counseling benefits to the Medicare \nprogram.\n  The benefits being added focus on some of the most prominent, \nunderlying risk factors for illness that face all Medicare \nbeneficiaries, including: screening for hypertension, counseling for \ntobacco cessation, screening for glaucoma, counseling for hormone \nreplacement therapy, screening for vision and hearing loss, nutrition \ntherapy, expanding screening and counseling for osteoporosis, and \nscreening for cholesterol.\n  The new benefits added by The Medicare Wellness Act represent the \nhighest recommendations for Medicare beneficiaries of the Institute of \nMedicine and the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force--recognized as \nthe gold standard within the prevention community.\n  Attaching these prominent risk factors will reduce Medicare \nbeneficiaries' risk for health problems such as stroke, diabetes, and \nosteoporosis, heart disease, and blindness.\n  The addition of these new benefits would accelerate the fundamental \nshift, that began in 1997 under the Balanced Budget Act, in the \nMedicare program from a sickness program to a wellness program.\n  Prior to 1997, only three preventive benefits were available to \nbeneficiaries, pneumococcal vaccines, pap smears, and mammography. \nOther major components of our bill include the establishment of the \nHealthy Seniors Promoting Program.\n  This program will be led by an interagency workgroup within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n  It will being together all the agencies within HHS that address the \nmedical, social and behavioral issues affecting the elderly and \ninstructs them to undertake a series of studies which will increase \nknowledge about the utilization of prevention services among the \nelderly.\n  In addition, The Medicare Wellness Act incorporates an aggressive \napplied and original research effort that will investigate ways to \nimprove the utilization of current and new preventive benefits and to \ninvestigate new methods of improving the health of Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, this latter point is critical. The fact is that there \nare a number of prevention-related services available to Medicare \nbeneficiaries today, including mammograms and colorectal cancer \nscreening. But those services are seriously underutilized.\n\n  In a study published by Dartmouth University this spring (The \nDartmouth Atlas of Health Care 1999), it was found that only 28 percent \nof women age 65-69 receive mammograms and only 12 percent of the \nbeneficiaries were screened for colorectal cancer.\n  These are disturbing figures and they clearly demonstrate the need to \nfind new and better ways to increase the rates of utilization of \nproven, demonstrated prevention services.\n  Our bill would get us the information we need to increase rates of \nutilization for these services. Further, our bill would establish a \nhealth risk appraisal and education program aimed at major behavioral \nrisk factors such as diet, exercise, alcohol and tobacco use, and \ndepression.\n  This program will target both pre-65 individuals and current Medicare \nbeneficiaries. The main goal of this program is to increase awareness \namong individuals of major risk factors that impact on health, to \nchange personal health habits, improve health status, and save the \nMedicare program money. Our bill would require the Medicare Payment \nAdvisory Commission, known as MedPAC, to report to Congress every two \nyears and assess how the program needs to change over time in order to \nreflect modern benefits and treatment.\n  Shockingly, this is information that Congress currently does not \nreceive on a routine basis. And this is a contributing factor to why we \nfind ourselves today in a quandary over the outdated nature of the \nMedicare program. Quite frankly, Medicare hasn't kept up with the rest \nof the health care world. While a vintage wine from the 1960s may be \ndesirable, a health care system that is vintage 1965 is not. We need to \ndo better.\n  Our bill would also require the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to \nconduct a study every five years to assess the scientific validity of \nthe entire preventive benefits package. The study will be presented to \nCongress in a manner that mirrors The Trade Act of 1974. The IOM's \nrecommendations would be presented to Congress in legislative form. \nCongress would then have 60 days to review and then either accept or \nreject the IOM's recommendations for changes to the Medicare program. \nBut Congress could not change the IOM's recommendations.\n\n  This ``fast-track'' process is a deliberate effort to get Congress \nout of the business of micro-managing the Medicare program. While \nlimited to preventive benefits, this will offer a litmus test on a new \napproach to future Medicare decision making.\n  In the aggregate, The Medicare Wellness Act represents the most \ncomprehensive legislative proposal in the 106th Congress for the \nMedicare program focused on health promotion and disease prevention for \nbeneficiaries. It provides new screening and counseling benefits for \nbeneficiaries, it provides critically needed research dollars, and it \ntests new treatment concepts through demonstration programs.\n  The Medicare Wellness Act represents sound health policy based on \nsound science.\n  Before I conclude, I have a few final thoughts.\n  There are many here in Congress who argue that at a time when \nMedicare faces an uncertain financial future, this is the last time to \nbe adding new benefits to a program that can ill afford the benefits it \ncurrently offers. Normally I would agree with this assertion. But the \nissue of prevention is different. The old adage of ``an ounce of \nprevention is worth a pound of cure'' is very relevant here. Does \nmaking preventive benefits available to Medicare beneficiaries ``cost'' \nmoney? Sure it does.\n\n  But the return on the investment, the avoidance of the pound of cure \nand\n\n[[Page S1401]]\n\nthe related improvement in quality of life is unmistakable.\n  Along these lines, a longstanding problem facing lawmakers and \nadvocates of prevention has been the position taken by the \nCongressional Budget Office, as it evaluates the budgetary impact of \nall legislative proposals.\n  Only costs incurred by the Federal Government over the next 10 years \ncan be considered in weighing the ``cost'' of adding new benefits. From \na public health and quality of life standpoint, this premise is \nunacceptable.\n  Among the problems with this practice is that ``savings'' incurred by \nincreasing the availability and utilization of preventive benefits \noften occur over a period of time greater than 10 years.\n  This problem is best illustrated in an examination of the \n``compression of morbidity'' theory developed by Dr. James Fries of \nStanford University over 20 years ago.\n  According to Dr. Fries, by delaying the onset of chronic illness \namong seniors, there is a resulting decrease in the length of time \nillness or disability is present in the latter stages of life. This \n``compression'' improves quality of life and reduces the rate of growth \nin health care costs.\n  But, these changes are gradual and occur over an extended period of \ntime--10, 20, even 30 years.\n  With the average life expectancy of individuals who reach 65 being \nnearly 20 years--20 years for women and 18 years for men--it only makes \nsense to look at services and benefits that improve quality of life and \nreduce costs to the Federal Government for that 20 year lifespan.\n  In addition to increased lifespan, a 10 year budget scoring window \ndoesn't factor into consideration the impact of such services on the \nprivate sector, such as increased productivity and reduced absenteeism, \nfor the many seniors that continue working beyond age 65.\n  The bottom line is, the most important reason to cover preventive \nservices is to improve health.\n  While prevention services in isolation won't reduce costs, they will \nmoderate increases in the utilization and spending on more expensive \nacute and chronic treatment services.\n  As Congress considers different ways to reform Medicare, two basic \nquestions regarding preventive services and the elderly must be part of \nthe debate.\n  (1) Is the value of improved quality of life worth the expenditure? \nAnd,\n  (2) How important is if for the Medicare population to be able to \nmaintain healthy, functional and productive lives?\n  These are just some of the questions we must answer in the coming \ndebate over Medicare reform.\n  While improving Medicare's financial outlook for future generations \nis imperative, we must do it in a way that gives our seniors the \nability to live longer, healthier and valued lives.\n  I believe that by pursuing a prevention strategy that addresses some \nof the most fundamental risk factors for chronic illness and disability \nthat face seniors, we will make an invaluable contribution to the \nMedicare reform debate and, more importantly, to our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would be remiss in pointing out that the \nMedicare Wellness Act represents the first time in this Congress that \nRepublicans and Democrats have gotten together in support of a major \npiece of Medicare reform legislation.\n  This bill represents a health care philosophy that bridges political \nboundaries. It just makes sense. And you see that common sense approach \ntoday from myself and my esteemed colleagues who have joined me in the \nintroduction of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to join us on this important \nbill and to work with us to ensure that the provisions of this bill are \nreflected in any Medicare reform legislation that is debated and voted \non this year in the Senate.\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator \nGraham today in introducing the Medicare Wellness Act of 2000. Our \nnation's rapidly growing senior population and the ongoing search for \ncost-effective health care have led to the development of this \nimportant bipartisan legislation. The goal of the Medicare Wellness Act \nis to increase access to preventive health services, improve the \nquality of life for America's seniors, and increase the cost-\neffectiveness of the Medicare program.\n  Congress created the Medicare program in 1965 to provide health \ninsurance for Americans age 65 and over. From the outset, the program \nhas focused on coverage for hospital services needed for an unexpected \nor intensive illness. In recent years, however, a great escalation in \nprogram expenditures and an increase in knowledge about the value of \npreventive care have forced policy makers to re-evaluate the current \nMedicare benefit package.\n  The Medicare Wellness Act adds to the Medicare program those benefits \nrecommended by the Institute of Medicine and the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force. These include: screening for hypertension, \ncounseling for tobacco cessation, screening for glaucoma, counseling \nfor hormone replacement therapy, screening for vision and hearing loss, \ncholesterol screening, expanded screening and counseling for \nosteoporosis, and nutrition therapy counseling. These services address \nthe most prominent risk facing Medicare beneficiaries.\n  In 1997, Congress added several new preventive benefits to the \nMedicare program through the Balanced Budget Act. These benefits \nincluded annual mammography, diabetes self-management, prostate cancer \nscreening, pelvic examinations, and colorectal cancer screening. \nCongress's next logical step is to incorporate the nine new screening \nand counseling benefits in the Medicare Wellness Act. If these symptoms \nare addressed regularly, beneficiaries will have a head start on \nfighting the conditions they lead to, such as diabetes, lung cancer, \nheart disease, blindness, osteoporosis, and many others.\n  Research suggests that insurance coverage encourages the use of \npreventive and other health care services. The Medicare Wellness Act \nalso eliminates the cost-sharing requirement for new and current \npreventive benefits in the program. Because screening services are \ndirected at people without symptoms, this will further encourage the \nuse of services by reducing the cost barrier to care. Increased use of \nscreening services will mean that problems will be caught earlier, \nwhich will permit more successful treatment. This will save the \nMedicare program money because it is cheaper to screen for an illness \nand treat its early diagnosis than to pay for drastic hospital \nprocedures at a later date.\n  However, financial access is not the only barrier to the use of \npreventive care services. Other barriers include low levels of \neducation of information for beneficiaries. That is why the Medicare \nWellness Act instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \ncoordinate with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the \nHealth Care Financing Administration to establish a Risk Appraisal and \nEducation Program within Medicare. This program will target both \ncurrent beneficiaries and individuals with high risk factors below the \nage of 65. Outreach to these groups will offer questions regarding \nmajor behaviorial risk factors, including the lack of proper nutrition, \nthe use of alcohol, the lack of regular exercise, the use of tobacco, \nand depression. State of the art software, case managers, and nurse \nhotlines will then identify what conditions beneficiaries are at risk \nfor, based on their individual responses to the questions, then refer \nthem to preventive screening services in their area and inform them of \nactions they can take to lead a healthier life.\n\n  The Medicare Wellness Act also establishes the Healthy Seniors \nPromotion Program. This program will bring together all the agencies \nwithin the Department of Health and Human Services that address the \nmedical, social and behavorial issues affecting the elderly to increase \nknowledge about and utilization of prevention services among the \nelderly, and develop better ways to prevent or delay the onset of age-\nrelated disease or disability.\n  Mr. President, now is the time for Medicare to catch up with current \nhealth science. We need a Medicare program that will serve the health \ncare needs of America's seniors by utilizing up-to-date knowledge of \nhealthy aging. Effective health care must address the whole health of \nan individual. A lifestyle that includes proper exercise and\n\n[[Page S1402]]\n\nnutrition, and access to regular disease screening ensures attention to \nthe whole individual, not just a solitary body part. It is time we \nreaffirm our commitment to provide our nation's seniors with quality \nhealth care.\n  It is my hope that my colleagues in Congress will examine this \nlegislation and realize the inadequately of the current package of \npreventive benefits in the Medicare program. We have the opportunity to \ntransform Medicare from an out-dated sickness program to a modern \nwellness program. I want to thank Senator Bob Graham and all the other \ncosponsors of the Medicare Wellness Act who are supporting this bold \nstep towards successful Medicare reform.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenator Graham of Florida and Senator Jeffords of Vermont, in the \nintroduction of the ``Medicare Wellness Act of 2000.''\n  This bipartisan, bicameral measure represents a recognition of the \nrole that health promotion and disease prevention should play in the \ncare available to Medicare beneficiaries. The bill adds several new \npreventative screening and counseling benefits to the Medicare program. \nSpecifically, the act adds screening for hypertension, counseling for \ntobacco cessation, screening for glaucoma, counseling for hormone \nreplacement therapy, and expanded screening and counseling for \nosteoporosis.\n  My colleagues have addressed most of these aspects of the bill so I \nwill focus my remarks on one additional provision that is pivotal in \nachieving improved health outcomes of beneficiaries with several \nchronic diseases. Specifically, the Medicare Wellness Act of 2000 \nprovides for coverage under Part B of the Medicare program for medical \nnutrition therapy services for beneficiaries who have diabetes, \ncardiovascular disease, or renal disease.\n  Medical nutrition therapy refers to the comprehensive nutrition \nservices provided by registered dietitians as part of the health care \nteam. Medical nutrition therapy has proven to be a medically necessary \nand cost effective way of treating and controlling heart disease, \nstroke, diabetes, high cholesterol, and various renal diseases. \nPatients who receive this therapy require fewer hospitalizations and \nmedications and have fewer complications.\n  The treatment of patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease \naccounts for a full 60 percent of Medicare expenditures. In my home \nstate of New Mexico, Native Americans are experiencing an epidemic of \nType II diabetes. Medical nutrition therapy is integral to their \ndiabetes care and to the prevention of progression of the disease. \nInformation from the Indian Health Service shows that medical nutrition \ntherapy provided by professional dietitians results in significant \nimprovements in medical outcomes in Type II diabetics.\n  Mr. President, while medical nutrition therapy services are currently \ncovered under Medicare Part A for inpatient services, there is no \nconsistent Part B coverage policy for medical nutrition.\n  Nutrition counseling is best conducted outside the hospital setting. \nToday, coverage for nutrition therapy in ambulatory settings is at best \ninconsistent, but most often, non existent.\n  Because of the comparatively low treatment costs and the benefits \nassociated with nutrition therapy, expanded coverage will improve the \nquality of care, outcomes and quality of life for Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  Two years ago, my colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig and I requested \nthat the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine study the \nissue of medical nutrition therapy as a benefit for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. The Institute of Medicine released this study last \nDecember entitled: ``The Role of Nutrition in Maintaining Health in the \nNation's Elderly: Evaluating Coverage of Nutrition Services for the \nMedicare Populations.'' This IOM study reaffirms what I have been \nworking toward the past few years. Namely, it recommended that medical \nnutrition therapy, ``upon referral by a physician, be a reimbursable \nbenefit for Medicare beneficiaries.'' The study substantiates evidence \nof improved patient outcomes associated with nutrition care provided by \nregistered dietitians.\n  Mr. President, I again want to thank my colleagues for including \nmedical nutrition therapy as a key component of the Medicare Wellness \nAct. I look forward to working with them toward passage of the act this \nCongress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD (for himself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Kohl, \n        Mr. Grassley, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. Grams):\n  S. 2233. A bill to prohibit the use of, and provide for remediation \nof water contaminated by, methyl tertiary butyl ether; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                          MTBE ELIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation called \nthe ``MTBE Elimination Act of 2000.'' As I so rise, I thank my \ncolleagues who have cosponsored this legislation. They are Senators \nBayh, Abraham, Kohl, Grassley, Durbin, Brownback, and Grams. I \nappreciate their support and I look forward to talking to each of my \ncolleagues about this very important piece of legislation we are \nintroducing today.\n  Mr. President, the MTBE Elimination Act would ban all across the \ncountry, the chemical compound which is termed MTBE for short. Its \nlonger chemical name is methyl tertiary butyl ether.\n  MTBE is one of the world's most widely used chemicals, and is found \nanywhere in the United States. In fact, it is added to approximately 30 \npercent of our Nation's gasoline supplies. Its use in this country \ndates back at least to about 1979 and was originally added to gasoline \nto boost the octane. For many years, oil companies had added lead to \nfuel in order to improve its performance and to boost octane. The \nFederal Government banned lead in the 1970s, and ultimately it was \nreplaced in many cases by MTBE.\n  Later on, in 1990, Congress amended the Clean Air Act and President \nBush at the time signed those amendments. Those amendments required all \nthe smog filled large cities in this country to have an additive in \ntheir gasoline that would make the gasoline approximately 2.7 percent \noxygen by weight. This is commonly referred to as the oxygenate \nrequirement in our Nation's Clean Air Act.\n  The purpose of that oxygenate requirement was to make the oil \ncompanies produce, and our cars use, a cleaner burning fuel. The idea \nwas to clean up the smog in some of our Nation's largest and most \ncongested cities. That program has worked very well over the last 10 \nyears in cleaning up the smog all across the country, in cities like \nNew York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. My home State of Illinois, of \ncourse, has a large metropolitan area in Chicago. The reformulated fuel \nrequirements that were implemented by the 1990 amendments to the Clean \nAir Act have helped greatly in reducing the emissions from our \nautomobiles, in providing cleaner burning fuels, at least as far as our \nair quality is concerned.\n  As I said earlier, about 30 percent of the gasoline used in this \ncountry is reformulated and has an additive in it, most of which is \nMTBE. In the parts of this country that are required to use \nreformulated fuel, over 80 percent of them are using MTBE as their \noxygenate. The other areas are using another oxygenate known as ethanol \nto meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act. In fact, Chicago and \nMilwaukee both use ethanol as opposed to MTBE.\n  It turns out now that we have mounting evidence that MTBE, while it \nworks well in cleaning up smog, has a problem we had not anticipated, \nand one which very regrettably had not been fully investigated before \nwe started down the path that encouraged a dramatic increase in the \nusage of MTBE. MTBE has, in recent years, been detected in the nation's \ndrinking water all across the country, from the east coast to the west \ncoast. In fact, right now the U.S. Geological Survey is performing an \nongoing evaluation of our nation's drinking water, groundwater supplies \nall across the country. They have not yet completed this survey. If you \nlook at this chart, in the States that are in white, the U.S. \nGeological Survey analysis has not yet been performed.\n  But in the States that are in red, those are the States where they \nhave found MTBE in the groundwater. Incidentally, I believe it is \nsomewhere in the neighborhood of 22 States where\n\n[[Page S1403]]\n\nthey have found methyl tertiary butyl ether in the groundwater.\n  In my home State of Illinois, we do not use much MTBE; ethanol is the \noxygenate of choice. But nonetheless, the Illinois Environmental \nProtection Agency has been finding MTBE in our groundwater. So far, \nthey have found MTBE in at least 25 different cities all across the \nState, and many Illinois municipalities have not tested the \ngroundwater. Three of these cities have had to switch their source of \ndrinking water and go to other wells because there was a sufficient \namount of MTBE in that water to make it undrinkable.\n  About a month ago, CBS News, in their program ``60 Minutes,'' did a \nreport on how MTBE has been turning up with greater and greater \nfrequency in our Nation's drinking water supplies. During that report, \nwhich seemed to me to be very well researched, it was noticed that this \nchemical, MTBE, has some very interesting properties.\n  Unlike most of the other components of gasoline which, when it leaks \nout accidentally from underground storage tanks or out of pipes which \ncarry fuel--there are leaks now and then; we try to prevent them, but \nthey do occur--most of the components of gasoline are absorbed in the \nsoil and do not make it down to the ground water.\n  MTBE is a pesky substance, however, that resists microbial degrading \nin the ground and rapidly seeks out the ground water. It resists \ndegrading as it finds its way to the water. Then once it gets into the \nwater, it rapidly spreads. It has properties that, when it is in \ndrinking water in very minute quantities, between 20 to 40 parts per \nbillion, make the drinking water undrinkable. I say undrinkable because \nit makes the water smell and taste like turpentine.\n  There have been studies that have shown that a single cup of MTBE \nrenders 5 million gallons of water undrinkable. I say it makes the \nwater undrinkable. The fact is, we do not know exactly what health \neffects it has on humans who ingest the water. Very few studies have \nbeen done on what happens to humans who consume MTBE. There have been \nstudies of laboratory rats that suggest it is a possible carcinogen, \nand the EPA has recognized MTBE as a possible cause of cancer.\n  We need to do more research on MTBE's effects on human health. We \nsimply do not know all that much about this chemical. However, we do \nknow that most people, when they smell the turpentine-like smell or \ntaste of it, it inspires an instant revulsion and they do not want to \ndrink the water. It is almost a moot point as to whether it has ill \nhealth effects because it makes the water undrinkable. Most humans will \nrecoil at the thought of drinking that type of water.\n  In the ``60 Minutes'' segment I referred to earlier, they went to a \ntown in California where literally most of the town has left because \ntheir water has this MTBE in it. Many of the businesses have closed up, \nmany of the people have left, and for those remaining in that \ncommunity, the State of California is trucking in fresh water for them \nto drink. It is a very serious problem.\n  There have been a few cities around the country--I believe there is \none in the Carolinas, and also Santa Barbara, CA--where they had sued \noil companies and won judgments to clean up the ground water in which \nthey detected MTBE.\n  In order to address this alarming trend of finding this pesky, \nhorrible chemical in our drinking water all across the country with \nincreasing frequency, I, with my colleagues, am introducing the MTBE \nElimination Act. This act will do four things: First, it will phase \nMTBE out gradually over 3 years. The way the bill accomplishes that is \nit amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to add methyl tertiary butyl \nether to the list of proscribed toxic substances in this country.\n  It will eliminate the MTBE over 3 years because it will be hard to \nsimply switch our Nation's gasoline supply overnight. To be realistic, \nit will take a period of time. The bill allows discretion for the EPA \nto establish a timetable and a framework for this MTBE phase-out.\n  Secondly, the bill will require that gasoline which is dispensed at \nthe pump containing MTBE be labeled so people know when they are \nfilling up their car with gasoline that it contains this additive, and \nthis chemical is being used in their community. In many cases, of \ncourse, people are not even aware of this chemical. They have never \nheard of it. We were very surprised in Illinois. We did not think much \nMTBE was even used in Illinois. Then we found it in our ground water.\n\n  Third, the bill authorizes grants for research on MTBE ground water \ncontamination and remediation. It directs resources to do more research \non the health effects of this chemical too. We need to know more about \nthis chemical in order to combat it. Right now we do not fully \nunderstand the health risks. Most of the studies that have been done, \nof which I am aware, are on laboratory mice, and there have been very \nfew studies, if any, on the effects to humans who ingest or inhale this \nchemical.\n  We also need research on how we remediate the chemical, how we clean \nit up because, in addition to all of its other properties, it turns out \nit is very difficult to eliminate. Our normal processes for eliminating \nhazardous chemicals from ground water, in many cases, according to the \nliterature, do not seem to work on MTBE. EPA needs to research this \nissue and help the rest of the country have a body of knowledge, so \nwhen they find MTBE contamination, they know how to clean it up or \nremediate it.\n  The bill contains a section which expresses the sense of the Senate \nthat the EPA, our national Environmental Protection Agency, should \nprovide technical assistance, information, and matching funds to our \nlocal communities that are testing their underground water supplies and \nalso trying to remediate and clean up MTBE that has been detected in \nthose water supplies.\n  Finally, as an afterthought, some of my colleagues may be asking: \nWhat will we do about that portion of the Clean Air Act that requires \nour fuel in this country, at least in the smog-filled large cities, to \nhave an oxygenate in it to reduce smog emissions? There is an answer. \nWe do have an alternative--a renewable source produced from corn or \nother biomass products. It is called ethanol.\n  In my judgment, ethanol will allow us to meet the requirements of the \nClean Air Act all across the country, and it will not require us to \nmake that terrible choice between clean air and clean water. I want our \ncountry to have clean air and clean water and never one at the expense \nof the other. Ethanol, in my judgment, provides the answer to that \nproblem.\n  The USDA recently did a study using ethanol to replace MTBE all \nacross the country. It would mean, on average, about $1 billion in \nadded income to our farmers every year.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. First, I congratulate my colleague for the introduction \nof this legislation. I am happy to cosponsor it. It is truly bipartisan \nlegislation which is of benefit not only to the farmers in our State of \nIllinois but to our Nation.\n  We understand, as most people do in Washington, the benefits of \nethanol when it comes to reducing air pollution. We also understand the \ndangers of MTBE. Where it is used in other States, it has contaminated \nwater supplies.\n  We are in the process of working with the Environmental Protection \nAgency to discuss the future of ethanol and hope it will remain strong.\n  I ask my colleague from Illinois--and I again congratulate him for \nhis leadership in this area--if he can tell me whether his legislation \non the elimination of MTBE is done on a phaseout basis or whether it is \ndone to a date certain?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Yes. I thank the Senator and appreciate his support. \nI appreciate his cosponsorship of this legislation.\n  My bill would ban MTBE within 3 years after the enactment of this \nlaw. It would leave the exact timetable up to the EPA. They could set \nparameters within that 3 years. But within 3 years after the bill is \nsigned into law, we would expect MTBE to be gone.\n  Following up on that, as Senator Durbin said, we have been working \nvery hard, particularly with Senator Grassley, Senator Harkin, and \nSenators from all over the country, in trying to clean up MTBE, and \nalso trying\n\n[[Page S1404]]\n\nto promote renewable sources of fuels, such as ethanol. That discussion \nabout the importance of renewable fuels is made much more important now \nas we see our dependence on foreign oil and the high prices of oil in \nrecent weeks.\n  But this is an issue that has bipartisan support. Senator Durbin is a \nDemocrat; I am a Republican. But the ethanol issue has always been \nbipartisan. I look forward to working with my friends and colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle so that we can continue to work on improving \nour Nation's clean air and water and also our farm economy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the bill in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2233\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``MTBE Elimination Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) a single cup of MTBE, equal to the quantity found in 1 \n     gallon of gasoline oxygenated with MTBE, renders all of the \n     water in a 5,000,000-gallon well undrinkable;\n       (2) the physical properties of MTBE allow MTBE to pass \n     easily from gasoline to air to water, or from gasoline \n     directly to water, but MTBE does not--\n       (A) readily attach to soil particles; or\n       (B) naturally degrade;\n       (3) the development of tumors and nervous system disorders \n     in mice and rats has been linked to exposure to MTBE and \n     tertiary butyl alcohol and formaldehyde, which are 2 \n     metabolic byproducts of MTBE;\n       (4) reproductive and developmental studies of MTBE indicate \n     that exposure of a pregnant female to MTBE through inhalation \n     can--\n       (A) result in maternal toxicity; and\n       (B) have possible adverse effects on a developing fetus;\n       (5) the Health Effects Institute reported in February 1996 \n     that the studies of MTBE support its classification as a \n     neurotoxicant and suggest that its primary effect is likely \n     to be in the form of acute impairment;\n       (6) people with higher levels of MTBE in the bloodstream \n     are significantly more likely to report more headaches, eye \n     irritation, nausea, dizziness, burning of the nose and \n     throat, coughing, disorientation, and vomiting as compared \n     with those who have lower levels of MTBE in the bloodstream;\n       (7) available information has shown that MTBE significantly \n     reduces the efficiency of technologies used to remediate \n     water contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons;\n       (8) the costs of remediation of MTBE water contamination \n     throughout the United States could run into the billions of \n     dollars;\n       (9) although several studies are being conducted to assess \n     possible methods to remediate drinking water contaminated by \n     MTBE, there have been no engineering solutions to make such \n     remediation cost-efficient and practicable;\n       (10) the remediation of drinking water contaminated by \n     MTBE, involving the stripping of millions of gallons of \n     contaminated ground water, can cost millions of dollars per \n     municipality;\n       (11) the average cost of a single industrial cleanup \n     involving MTBE contamination is approximately $150,000;\n       (12) the average cost of a single cleanup involving MTBE \n     contamination that is conducted by a small business or a \n     homeowner is approximately $37,000;\n       (13) the reformulated gasoline program under section 211(k) \n     of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(k)) has resulted in \n     substantial reductions in the emissions of a number of air \n     pollutants from motor vehicles, including volatile organic \n     compounds, carbon monoxide, and mobile-source toxic air \n     pollutants, including benzene;\n       (14) in assessing oxygenate alternatives, the Blue Ribbon \n     Panel of the Environmental Protection Agency determined that \n     ethanol, made from domestic grain and potentially from \n     recycled biomass, is an effective fuel-blending component \n     that--\n       (A) provides carbon monoxide emission benefits and high \n     octane; and\n       (B) appears to contribute to the reduction of the use of \n     aromatics, providing reductions in emissions of toxic air \n     pollutants and other air quality benefits;\n       (15) the Department of Agriculture concluded that ethanol \n     production and distribution could be expanded to meet the \n     needs of the reformulated gasoline program in 4 years, with \n     negligible price impacts and no interruptions in supply; and\n       (16) because the reformulated gasoline program is a source \n     of clean air benefits, and ethanol is a viable alternative \n     that provides air quality and economic benefits, research and \n     development efforts should be directed to assess \n     infrastructure and meet other challenges necessary to allow \n     ethanol use to expand sufficiently to meet the requirements \n     of the reformulated gasoline program as the use of MTBE is \n     phased out.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     should provide technical assistance, information, and \n     matching funds to help local communities--\n       (1) test drinking water supplies; and\n       (2) remediate drinking water contaminated with methyl \n     tertiary butyl ether.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my Illinois \ncolleague, Senator Fitzgerald, as a cosponsor of his legislation \nbanning MTBE. MTBE contaminates water, and it has been found in water \nthroughout the United States.\n  With every day that passes, more water is being contaminated. Oddly \nenough, we have passed a clean air bill to clean up the air, and the \noil companies have used a product to meet the requirements of the clean \nair bill that contaminates the water.\n  But there is an additive to the gasoline that will clean up the air \nas well as not contaminate the water. I will talk about that in just a \nminute.\n  It is simple: With every day that passes, more water is being \ncontaminated.\n  Last August, the Senate soundly passed a resolution that I \ncosponsored with Senator Boxer of California calling for an MTBE ban.\n  In the face of damaging, irresponsible action by the Clinton \nadministration, it is time we put some force to our Senate position. \nHow long must Americans suffer this dilatory charade by President \nClinton's administration, also by\n\n[[Page S1405]]\n\nthe petroleum industry, and particularly by California officials? I say \nCalifornia officials because they have asked that the Clean Air Act of \n1990 be gutted.\n  I have intentionally held my fire until after the California primary \nbecause I would not want anyone to misconstrue my motives in an attempt \nto undermine Vice President Gore's political ambitions. But today I \nthink it is time to say it as it really is: President Clinton, Vice \nPresident Gore, and the Environmental Protection Agency's \nAdministrator, Carol Browner, have been dragging their feet--and \ndragging their feet too long.\n  They gave the oil and the MTBE industry everything they wanted. At \nthe request of big oil, they threw out regulations proposed by \nPresident Bush which would have, by some estimates, tripled and even \nquadrupled ethanol production. This was done on the first day of the \nClinton administration.\n  Instead, when they finally got around to putting some rules out, the \nadministration approved regulations that guaranteed a virtual MTBE \nmonopoly in the reformulated gasoline market.\n  This decision by the Clinton administration, way back then in the \nearly part of the administration, opened wide the door for petroleum \ncompanies to use MTBE and thus contaminate our water.\n  With egg on its face, with an environmental disaster on its hands, \nthe Clinton administration continues to delay and also duck its \nleadership responsibilities.\n  A replacement for MTBE exists today, but most oil companies refuse to \nuse it. The Environmental Protection Agency's Director, Carol Browner, \nhas been told time and time again, in every imaginable way possible, \nhow MTBE can be replaced, and in California totally replaced this very \nday.\n  But she, as other Clinton-Gore officials, always seems to come up \nwith some sort of excuse, a reason for delay, some other hurdle.\n  Last week, as the congressional delegation met with our Governor from \nIowa, we were told that Carol Browner asked for more information on \nthis subject about the supply of an alternative to MTBE--which is \nethanol--that she needed more information. It happens to be information \nthat the Environmental Protection Agency already has.\n\n  The new hurdle she is creating is the question: Is there enough of \nthis alternative, ethanol? You might ask: Enough for what? To replace \nall MTBE today or tomorrow? That is kind of insulting. It is also \nincredible.\n  I want to illustrate how it is insulting and incredible with this \npoint. Imagine the following: You have a brush fire sweeping to the \ncity's edge, devouring home after home. Panicked citizens call 911, but \nthe fire engines remain silent. The home owners scream to the fire \ndepartment: Why won't you come to our rescue? The fire chief says: We \ndon't have enough water to save the whole city, and until we can save \nall, we will save none.\n  It is absurd. Of course it is. Yet an equally absurd and dangerous \nline has been drawn by most California big oil companies and their \npolitical apologists. In the face of the largest environmental crisis \nof this generation--which is the contamination of water by the \npetroleum companies' controlled product, MTBE--Californians are being \nheld hostage, forced to buy water-contaminating, MTBE-laced gasoline, \neven though a superior MTBE replacement is available, and available \nthis very day--not tomorrow, not next year, but today.\n  California Governor Davis' so-called ``ban'' allows MTBE to be sold \n``full bore, business-as-usual'' until the end of the year 2002.\n  Worse yet, California legislators dropped the deadline altogether. \nBut why the wait? Well, we are told there is not enough of this MTBE \nalternative and thus the illogical decree imposed: No MTBE will be \nremoved until all MTBE is removed. And with every day that passes, more \nof our water is contaminated. Think of this: A mere teacup of MTBE \nrenders undrinkable 5 million gallons of water. CBS's ``60 Minutes,'' \nreferred to by my colleague from Illinois, reported California has \nalready identified 10,000 ground water sites contaminated by MTBE and \nthat ``one internal study conducted by Chevron found that MTBE has \ncontaminated ground water at 80 percent of the 400 sites that the \ncompany tested.''\n  Yet big oil holds you hostage, forcing you to buy MTBE-laced gasoline \nuntil either the Clinton-Gore administration or Congress guts one of \nthe most successful Clean Air Act programs, the reformulated gasoline \noxygenate requirement. So big oil is hoping that gullible bureaucrats \nand politicians conclude that MTBE is not the real problem but, \ninstead, the real problem happens to be the oxygenate provisions of the \n1990 Clean Air Act. Get rid of the oxygenate requirement and, presto, \nMTBE disappears.\n  People in my State are not buying that line. Iowa has no oxygenate \nrequirement. Yet MTBE has been found in 29 percent of our water \nsupplies tested. Let it be clear, let there be absolutely no \nmisunderstanding: Iowa's water and the water in every Senator's State \nwas contaminated by a product that big oil added to their gasoline, and \nit was not contaminated by the Clear Air Act. Big oil did everything it \ncould to persuade Clinton-Gore appointees and judges in our courts to \nguarantee that MTBE monopolized the Clean Air Act's oxygenate market.\n\n  Our colleagues need to understand that nearly 500 million gallons of \nMTBE are sold every year throughout the United States, not to meet the \noxygenate requirements of the Clean Air Act that I have been talking \nabout up to this point, but as an octane enhancer in markets all over \nthe United States where the oxygenate requirements under the Clean Air \nAct to clean up the smog don't even apply.\n  So your water is in danger whether you live in a city that has to \nmeet the oxygenate requirements of the 1990 Clean Air Act or not \nbecause big oil uses the poison MTBE as an octane enhancer lots of \nplaces. So that gets us to a point where they want us to believe that \nchanging the 1990 Clean Air Act is the solution to all the problems. I \nask, how will gutting the Clean Air Act's oxygenate requirements \nprotect the rest of America's water, if most gallons of gasoline have \nMTBE in them for octane enhancement outside the Clean Air Act? Well, \nthat answer is pretty simple. It is not going to clean it up until we \nget rid of all MTBE. We need to, then, ban MTBE, which this bill we are \nintroducing today does, not ban the Clean Air Act, or at least not gut \nit by eliminating the oxygenate requirements of it, which big oil says \nis the solution to our problem.\n  Then we get to what is the superior MTBE replacement that is \navailable today. My colleagues don't have to wait for me to tell them \nwhat my answer is to that, but I will. It is ethanol, which is nothing \nmore than grain alcohol. Let's get that clear. We are talking about \nMTBE, a poisonous product, poisoning the water in California, where the \noxygenate requirements are, but also in the rest of the country where \nit is used as an octane enhancer, and grain alcohol on the other hand \nthat you can drink. Ethanol can be made from other things as well. It \ncan be made from California rice straw. It can be made from Idaho \npotato waste. It can be made from Florida sugarcane, North Dakota sugar \nbeets, New York municipal waste, Washington wood and paper waste, and a \nhost of other biodegradable waste products. Ethanol is not only good \nfor your air, but if it did get into your water, your only big decision \nwould be whether to add some ice and tonic before you drink it.\n  As my colleagues know, I am a teetotaler, so I am not going to \npretend to advise you on the proper cocktail mixes. Today there is \nenough ethanol in storage and from what can be produced from idle \nethanol facilities to displace all of the MTBE California uses in a \nwhole year. It is available today not tomorrow, not the year 2002. And \nmore facilities to produce it are in the works.\n  But big oil proclaims there is not enough ethanol. Translation, as \nfar as I can tell: We, as big oil, don't control ethanol; farmers \ncontrol it. So we don't want to use it.\n  They argue that ethanol is too difficult to transport. Translation: \nWe would rather import Middle East MTBE from halfway across the world \nthan transport ethanol from the Midwest of our great country. Big oil \nwhines: Keeping the oxygenate requirement will give ethanol a monopoly. \nThis is a whale of a tale, and it is kind\n\n[[Page S1406]]\n\nof hard to translate into sensible English. Since it takes half as much \nethanol as MTBE to produce a gallon of reformulated gasoline, big oil \nwill reap a 6.2-percent increase in the amount of plain gasoline used \nin reformulated gasoline. So how in the world does boosting by a \nwhopping 6.2 percent gasoline's share of the reformulated gasoline \nmarket constitute a monopoly for ethanol? That issue has been raised \nwith Senators on the environmental committee.\n\n  Currently, MTBE constitutes 3 percent of our total transportation \nfuel market. Ethanol, if it replaces all MTBE, would, therefore, gain a \n1.5-percent share. Think about that. A 1.5-percent market share, if it \nis ethanol, is defined as a monopoly share. But a 3-percent market \nshare, if it is MTBE, is not a monopoly.\n  I think it is pretty simple to get it because the translation of this \nbig oil babble is this: Market share, as small as 1.5 percent, if not \ncontrolled by big oil, shall henceforth be legally defined as a \nmonopoly. Market share at any level, 3 percent to 100 percent, if it is \ncontrolled by big oil, shall never be defined as a monopoly. It is such \na bizarre proposition that a mere 1.5 percent of market equals a \nmonopoly.\n  Big oil claims ethanol is too expensive. Let me translate that for \nyou: We prefer--meaning oil--our cozy relationship with OPEC that \nallows us to price gouge Americans rather than sell at half the price \nan oxygenate controlled by American farmers and ethanol producers.\n  I hope you caught that. If not, you ought to brace yourself, sit down \nwith your cup of coffee, get anything dangerous out of your hands. The \nMarch 7, 2000, west coast spot wholesale price for gasoline was $1.27 \nper gallon. MTBE sold for just over $1.17 per gallon, 10 cents less. \nBut ethanol came right in at the same price, $1.17 a gallon. Now, \nremember, it takes twice as much MTBE as it does ethanol to meet the \nClean Air Act's oxygenate requirement. In other words, at the March 7 \nprices, oxygenates made from ethanol cost petroleum marketers half as \nmuch as the oxygenate made from their product, MTBE.\n  So even though big oil has at its disposal an oxygenated alternate to \nMTBE, which costs half as much, and that will protect our water \nsupplies, big oil, with the help of the Clinton administration, \ncontinues to hold hostage the people of California and other Americans \nwho are forced to use MTBE.\n  Last summer, I asked President Clinton to announce that he would deny \nCalifornia's request to waive the oxygenate requirement. I asked him to \nannounce that he would veto any legislation that would provide for such \na waiver. I have heard nothing on this subject. No answer to my letter \nhas come from the President. His silence, and that of Vice President \nGore and the rest of the administration, is very deafening.\n  American farmers are suffering the worst prices in about 23 to 25 \nyears. If farmers are allowed to replace MTBE with ethanol, farm income \nwill jump $1 billion per year. But, no, increasing farm income through \nthe marketplace, both domestic and foreign, seems to be of no interest \nto the Clinton-Gore administration, considering their unwillingness to \nact and make these public statements that would send a clear signal, as \nfar as this consideration is concerned, that MTBE's days of poisoning \nthe water are over, replacing that with something that is safe, \nsomething that will help the farmers, and something that will send a \nclear signal to OPEC that we are done with our days being dependent \nupon them for our oil supplies and our energy.\n\n  In the process of doing that, they would help clean up our \nenvironment as well. But that doesn't seem to be of any concern to this \nadministration either when it comes to MTBE. It seems, unfortunately, \nthat the only thing on the collective mind of this administration is \nthe Vice President running for President, his legacy, his partisan \npolitics; everybody's eyes are on the next election.\n  So I repeat, MTBE is the problem, not the Clean Air Act, as the big \noil companies want us to believe. The answer to all this is so simple \nand clear:\n  As our bill does, ban MTBE, but don't gut the Clean Air Act's \noxygenate requirement.\n  Let America's farmers fill this void with ethanol, and let them fill \nit today.\n  It will boost farm income by $1 billion per year and help lessen our \nreliance upon foreign oil, and it will not keep us at the whims of OPEC \nquite so much.\n  It will keep our air clean, and it will protect our water supplies.\n  So all of those things sound good, don't they? Ethanol. It is that \nsimple. It is good, good, good. I might be wasting my breath, but I \nwill make this plea one more time. It is the same plea I made in a \nletter to the President last June or July, which was: President \nClinton, reject the waiver request today and declare that you will veto \nany legislation that would allow a waiver of the oxygenate requirements \nof the 1990 Clean Air Act. I assure you, Mr. President, if you do that, \nthe water-polluting MTBE will be replaced as fast as our farmers can \ndeliver the ethanol, and that is pretty darned swift. Do it today, \nPresident Clinton. Please do it today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \ntoday in introducing this timely and important legislation to help the \nnation respond to growing concerns about the threats to public health \nand the environment caused by methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE.\n  There is gathering evidence that MTBE, which is added to gasoline to \nreduce its impact on air quality, poses a threat to human health and \nthe environment. Preliminary testing indicates groundwater has been \ncontaminated in many areas of the country. The MTBE Elimination Act \nprovides for a three-year phase out of the use MTBE. The legislation \nalso provides resources for research, local testing programs, and \nlabeling so that we can identify the size of the problem and move \nforward with meaningful solutions.\n  Addressing the health and environmental threats posed by MTBE is only \nhalf of the answer. While we move to phase out MTBE, we also need to be \nmaking decisions about the future of the reformulated fuels program and \nthe oxygenate requirement in the Clean Air Act. The Reformulated \nGasoline Program has significantly reduced emissions of air pollutants \nfrom motor vehicles, including volatile organic compounds, carbon \nmonoxide, and mobile-source air toxics, such as benzene. It is \nimportant that we evaluate the options available for maintaining and \nenhancing these benefits.\n  The first step is evaluating the obvious options, ethanol. In its \nassessment of oxygenate alternatives, the EPA's Blue Ribbon Panel found \nthat ethanol is ``an effective fuel-bending component, made from \ndomestic grain and potentially from recycled biomass, that provides \nhigh octane, carbon monoxide emission benefits, and appears to \ncontribute to the reduction of the use of aromatics with related toxics \nand other air quality benefits.'\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture, in its report ``Economic Analysis \nof Replacing MTBE with Ethanol in the United States, ``concluded that \nethanol production and distribution could be expanded to meet the needs \nof the Reformulated Gasoline Program by 2004 with no supply \ninterruptions or significant price impacts.\n  We do not have to choose between clean air and clean water. Evidence \nthat MTBE presents a risk to water quality does not mean that we have \nto end our efforts for cleaner fuels. Ethanol is a clean, safe \nalternative that has the potential to serve a larger national market. \nAs a country, we are beginning to recognize the benefits that biofuels \ncan provide to the environment. Recent oil price increases also remind \nus of how important domestic sources of energy are to our national \nsecurity. This bill is a necessary step in minimizing the public health \nand environment damage attributable to MTBE. I believe it can also be \nthe start of a serious discussion on the opportunities that ethanol and \nother biofuels provide to maximize clean, safe and economically viable \nenergy options for America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER:\n  S. 2234. A bill to designate certain facilities of the United States \nPostal Service; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n[[Page S1407]]\n\n joel t. broyhill postal building and the joseph l. fisher post office\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join my colleague in the House of \nRepresentatives, Congressman Wolf, in introducing legislation to honor \ntwo former Representatives from Virginia's 10th district which \ndesignates two postal buildings in Northern Virginia after Joel T. \nBroyhill and Joseph L. Fisher.\n  The Honorable Joel Broyhill, was the first member elected to \nVirginia's newly created 10th district. He served in the House of \nRepresentatives for twenty-two years. A native of Hopewell, Virginia, \nCongressman Broyhill is also a decorated veteran and served as captain \nin the 106th Infantry Division in WWII. During the war, he was taken \nprisoner by the Germans and held in a POW camp after fighting in the \ninfamous and costly ``Battle of Bulge.''\n  Congressman Broyhill currently resides in Arlington, Virginia. I \nbelieve renaming the postal building at 8409 Lee Highway in Merrifield, \nVirginia would be appropriate in recognition of his honorable and \nextensive political and military careers.\n  I would also like to honor another former Representative from the \n10th District, the late Honorable Joseph L. Fisher. Congressman Fisher \nhad a notable political career in the local, state and federal \ngovernment.\n  Congressman Fisher, who held a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard \nUniversity, began his career in public service as an economist with the \nU.S. Department of State. After his service in World War II, he became \na member of the Arlington County Board. He began a three-term service \nin the House of Representatives when he was elected in 1974, defeating \nthe incumbent Republican Joel Broyhill.\n  Subsequent to his service in the House, among other positions, \nCongressman Fisher served as secretary of the Virginia Department of \nHuman Resources and was a professor of political economy at George \nMason University.\n  Congressman Fisher's commitment to public service should be \nrecognized with the designation of the post office located at 3118 \nWashington Boulevard in Arlington, Virginia as the Joseph L. Fisher \nPost Office.\n  Joseph Fisher passed away in 1992 at his home in Arlington, Virginia. \nHe is survived by his wife, Margaret, their seven children, sixteen \ngrandchildren, and two great grandchildren.\n  I seek my colleagues to support legislation to honor these two former \nmembers in recognition of their distinguished public service.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 2235. A bill to amend the Public Health Act to revise the \nperformance standards and certification process for organ procurement \norganizations; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n        organ procurement organization certification act of 2000\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself \nand my colleagues, Senators Murkowski, Dodd, Torricelli, and Hutchinson \nto introduce the Organ Procurement Organization Certification Act to \nimprove the performance evaluation and certification process that the \nHealth Care Financing Administration currently uses for organ \nprocurement organizations (OPOs).\n  Recent advantages in technology have dramatically increased the \nnumber of patients who could benefit from organ transplants. \nUnfortunately, however, while there has been some interest in the \nnumber of organ donors, the supply of organs in the United States has \nnot kept pace with the growing number of transplant candidates, and the \ngap between transplant demand and organ supply continues to widen. \nAccording to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), there are now \n68,220 patients in the United States on the waiting list for a \ntransplant.\n  Our nation's 60 organ procurement organizations (OPOs) play a \ncritical role in procuring and placing organs and are therefore key to \nour efforts to increase the number and quality of organs available for \ntransplant. They provide all of the services necessary in a particular \ngeographic region for coordinating the identification of potential \ndonors, requests for donation, and recovery and transport of organs. \nThe professionals in the OPOs evaluate potential donors, discuss \ndonation with family members, and arrange for the surgical removal of \ndonated organs. They are also responsible for preserving the organs and \nmaking arrangements for their distribution according to national organ \nsharing policies. Finally, the OPOs provide information and education \nto medical professionals and the general public to encourage organ and \ntissue donation to increase the availability of organs for \ntransplantation.\n  According to a 1999 report of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) \nentitled ``Organ Procurement and Transplantation: Assessing Current \nPolicies and the Potential Impact of the DHHS Final Rule'', a major \nimpediment to greater accountability and improved performance on the \npart of OPOs is the current lack of a reliable and valid method for \nassessing donor potential and OPO performance.\n  The HCFA's current certification process for OPOs sets an arbitrary, \npopulation-based performance standard for certifying OPOs based on \ndonors per million of population in their service areas. It sets a \nstandard for acceptable performance based on five criteria: donors \nrecovered per million, kidneys recovered per million, kidneys \ntransplanted per million, extrarenal organs (heart, liver, pancreas and \nlungs) recovered per million, and extrarenal organs transplanted per \nmillion. The HCFA assesses the OPOs' adherence to these standards every \ntwo years. Each OPO must meet at least 75 percent of the national mean \nfor four of these five categories to be recertified as the OPO for a \nparticular area and to receive Medicare and Medicaid payments. Without \nHCFA certification, an OPO cannot continue to operate.\n  The GAO, the IOM, the Harvard School of Public Health and others all \nhave criticized HCFA's use of this population-based standard to measure \nOPO performance. According to the GAO, ``HCFA's current performance \nstandard does not accurately assess OPOs' ability to meet the goal of \nacquiring all usable organs because it is based on the total \npopulation, not the number of potential donors, within the OPOs' \nservice areas.''\n  OPO service areas vary widely in the distribution of deaths by cause, \nunderlying health conditions, age, and race. These variations can pose \nsignificant advantages or disadvantages to an OPO's ability to procure \norgans, and a major problem with HCFA's current performance assessment \nis that it does not account for these variations. An extremely \neffective OPO that is getting a high yield of organs from the potential \ndonors in its service area may appear to be performing poorly because \nit has a disproportionate share of elderly people or a high rate of \npeople infected with HIV or AIDS, which eliminates them for \nconsideration as an organ donor. At the same time, an ineffective OPO \nmay appear to be performing well because it is operating in a service \narea with a high proportion of potential donors.\n  For example, organ donors typically die from head trauma and \naccidental injuries, and these rates can vary dramatically from region \nto region. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n(CDC), in 1991, the number of drivers fatally injured in traffic \naccidents in Maine was 15.54 per 100,000 population. In Alabama, \nhowever, it was 29.56, giving the OPO serving that state a tremendous \nadvantage over the New England Organ Bank, which serves Maine, but not \nfor a very good reason!\n  Use of this population-based method to evaluate OPO performance may \nwell result in the decertification of OPOs that are actually excellent \nperformers. Under HCFA's current regulatory practice, OPOs are \ndecertified if they fail to meet the 75th percentile of the national \nmeans on 4 of the 5 performance areas. In this process, which resembles \na game of musical chairs, it is a mathematical certainty that some OPOs \nwill fail in each cycle, no matter how much they might individually \nimprove.\n  Moreover, unlike other HCFA certification programs, the certification \nprocess for OPOs lacks any provision for corrective action plans to \nremedy deficient performance and also lacks a clearly defined due \nprocess component for resolving conflicts. The current system therefore \nforces OPOs to compete on the basis of an imperfect grading system, \nwith no guarantee of an opportunity for fair hearing based on their \nactual performance. This situation pressures many OPOs to focus on the\n\n[[Page S1408]]\n\ncertification process itself rather than on activities and methods to \nincrease donation, undermining what should be the overriding goal of \nthe program. Moreover, the current two-year cycle--which is shorter \nthan other certification programs administered by HCFA--provides little \nopportunity to examine trends and even less incentive for OPOs to mount \nlong-term interventions.\n\n  The legislation we are introducing today has three major objectives. \nFirst, it imposes a moratorium on the current recertification process \nfor OPOs and the use of population-based performance measurements. \nUnder our bill, the certification of qualified OPOs will remain in \nplace through January 1, 2002, for those OPOs that have been certified \nas a January 1, 2000, and that meet other qualification requirements \napart from the current performance standards. Second, the bill requires \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate new rules \ngoverning OPO recertification by January 1, 2002. These new rules are \nto rely on outcome and process performance measures based on evidence \nof organ donor potential and other relevant factors, and \nrecertification for OPOs shall not be required until they are \npromulgated. Finally, the bill provides for the filing and approval of \na corrective action plan by an OPO that fails to meet the standards, a \ngrace period to permit corrective action, an opportunity to appeal a \ndecertification to the Secretary on substantive and procedural grounds \nand a four-year certification cycle.\n  Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today makes much needed \nimprovements in the flawed process that HCFA currently uses to certify \nand assess OPO performance, and I urge all of my colleagues to join us \nas cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2235\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Organ Procurement \n     Organization Certification Act of 2000''.\n\n      SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Organ procurement organizations play an important role \n     in the effort to increase organ donation in the United \n     States.\n       (2) The current process for the certification and \n     recertification of organ procurement organizations conducted \n     by the Department of Health and Human Services has created a \n     level of uncertainty that is interfering with the \n     effectiveness of organ procurement organizations in raising \n     the level of organ donation.\n       (3) The General Accounting Office, the Institute of \n     Medicine, and the Harvard School of Public Health have \n     identified substantial limitations in the organ procurement \n     organization certification and recertification process and \n     have recommended changes in that process.\n       (4) The limitations in the recertification process include:\n       (A) An exclusive reliance on population-based measures of \n     performance that do not account for the potential in the \n     population for organ donation and do not permit consideration \n     of other outcome and process standards that would more \n     accurately reflect the relative capability and performance of \n     each organ procurement organization.\n       (B) An immediate decertification of organ procurement \n     organizations solely on the basis of the performance \n     measures, without an appropriate opportunity to file and a \n     grace period to pursue a corrective action plan.\n       (C) A lack of due process to appeal to the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services for recertification on either \n     substantive or procedural grounds.\n       (5) The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the \n     authority under section 1138(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-8(b)(1)(A)(i)) to extend the \n     period for recertification of an organ procurement \n     organization from 2 to 4 years on the basis of its past \n     practices in order to avoid the inappropriate disruption of \n     the nation's organ system.\n       (6) The Secretary of Health and Human Services can use the \n     extended period described in paragraph (5) for \n     recertification of all organ procurement organizations to--\n       (A) develop improved performance measures that would \n     reflect organ donor potential and interim outcomes, and to \n     test these measures to ensure that they accurately measure \n     performance differences among the organ procurement \n     organizations; and\n       (B) improve the overall certification process by \n     incorporating process as well as outcome performance \n     measures, and developing equitable processes for corrective \n     action plans and appeals.\n\n      SEC. 3. CERTIFICATION AND RECERTIFICATION OF ORGAN \n                   PROCUREMENT ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n       Section 371(b)(1) of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 273(b)(1)) is amended:\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (D) through (G) as \n     subparagraphs (E) through (H), respectively;\n       (2) by realigning the margin of subparagraph (F) (as so \n     redesignated) so as to align with subparagraph (E) (as so \n     redesignated); and\n       (3) by inserting after subparagraph (C) the following:\n       ``(D) notwithstanding any other provision of law, has met \n     the other requirements of this section and has been certified \n     or recertified by the Secretary within the previous 4-year \n     period as meeting the performance standards to be a qualified \n     organ procurement organization through a process that \n     either--\n       ``(i) granted certification or recertification within such \n     4-year period with such certification or recertification in \n     effect as of January 1, 2000, and remaining in effect through \n     the earlier of--\n       ``(I) January 1, 2002; or\n       ``(II) the completion of recertification under the \n     requirements of clause (ii); or\n       ``(ii) is defined through regulations that are promulgated \n     by the Secretary by not later than January 1, 2002, that--\n       ``(I) require recertifications of qualified organ \n     procurement organizations not more frequently than once every \n     4 years;\n       ``(II) rely on outcome and process performance measures \n     that are based on empirical evidence of organ donor potential \n     and other related factors in each service area of qualified \n     organ procurement organizations;\n       ``(III) use multiple outcome measures as part of the \n     certification process;\n       ``(IV) provide for the filing and approval of a corrective \n     action plan by a qualified organ procurement organization \n     that fails to meet the performance standards and a grace \n     period of not less than 3 years during which such \n     organization can implement the corrective action plan without \n     risk of decertification; and\n       ``(V) provide for a qualified organ procurement \n     organization to appeal a decertification to the Secretary on \n     substantive and procedural grounds;''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 2236. A bill to establish programs to improve the health and \nsafety of children receiving child care outside the home, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n           day care health and safety improvement act of 2000\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, each day, more than 13 million children \nunder the age of 6 spend some part of their day in child care. In my \nhome state of Tennessee 264,000 children will attend day care, and half \nof all children younger than three will spend some or all of their day \nbeing cared for by someone other than their parents. With these large \nnumber of children receiving child care services, there has been some \nevidence to suggest that we need to work to make these settings safer \nwhile improving the health of children in child care settings.\n  The potential danger in child care settings has been evident in my \nhome state of Tennessee. Tragically, within the span of 2 years, there \nhave been 4 deaths in child care settings in Memphis, Tennessee. \nOverall, reports of abandoned, mistreated, and unnecessarily endangered \nchildren have been reported in the Tennessee press over the last few \nyears. I salute the Memphis Commercial Appeal, for their in-depth \nreporting on day care health and safety issues which has helped bring \nthis serious matter to public attention.\n  However, I would caution that this is not just a concern in Memphis \nor Tennessee; it is nationwide and it needs to be addressed. There is \nalarming evidence to suggest that more must be done to improve the \nhealth and safety of children in child care settings.\n  For example, a 1998 Consumer Product Safety Commission Study revealed \nthat two-thirds of the 200 licensed child care settings investigated \nexhibited safety hazards, such as insufficient child safety gates, \ncribs with soft bedding, and unsafe playgrounds.\n  In 1997 alone, 31,000 children ages 4 and younger were treated in \nhospital emergency rooms for injuries sustained in child care or school \nsettings. And, quite tragically, since 1990, more than 56 children have \ndied in child care settings nationwide.\n  Child care health and safety issues are regulated at the state and \nlocal levels, which work diligently to ensure that child care settings \nare as safe as possible. I have worked closely with the Tennessee \nDepartment of Human\n\n[[Page S1409]]\n\nServices on how best to address the issue and quickly realized one of \nthe main problems was the lack of resources that the state could draw \nupon to improve health and safety.\n  To help address this issue and protect our children, I have joined \nwith Senator Dodd, the recognized leader in Congress on child care \nissues, to introduce the ``Children's Day Care Health and Safety \nImprovement Act,'' which will establish a state block grant program, \nauthorizing $200 million for states to carry out activities related to \nthe improvement of the health and safety of children in child care \nsettings.\n  These grants may be used for the following activities:\n  To train and educate child care providers to prevent injuries and \nillnesses and to promote health-related practices;\n  To improve and enforce child care provider licensing, regulation, and \nregistration, by conducting more inspections of day care providers to \nensure that they are carrying out state and local guidelines to ensure \nthat our children are safe;\n  To rehabilitate child care facilities to meet health and safety \nstandards, like the proper placement of fire exits and smoke detectors, \nthe proper disposal of sewage and garbage, and ensuring that play \nground equipment is safe;\n  To employ health consultants to give health and safety advice to \nchild care providers, such as CPR training, first aid training, \nprevention of sudden infant death syndrome, and how to recognize the \nsigns of child abuse and neglect;\n  To provide assistance to enhance child care providers' ability to \nserve children with disabilities;\n  To conduct criminal background checks on child care providers, to \nensure that day care providers are credible and reliable as they care \nfor our children;\n  To provide information to parents on what factors to consider in \nchoosing a safe and healthy day care setting for their children. \nParents must know that the setting they are choosing have a proven \nsafety record; and\n  To improve the safety of transportation of children in child care.\n  I am pleased that Tennessee is carrying out many of the activities \nauthorized under the ``Children's Day Care Health and Safety Act.'' \nUnder this bill, Tennessee would receive an estimated $4.2 million to \nhelp expand health and safety activities.\n  Mr. President, as a father, I understand the parental bond. A \nparent's number one concern is the safety, protection and health of \ntheir children. Parents need to be reassured their children are safe \nwhen they rely on others to care for their children. I am hopeful that \nthis legislation will give Tennessee, and all states, the needed \nresources to implement necessary reforms and activities which they \ndetermine will improve the health and safety conditions of child care \nproviders as they care for our children.\n  I want to thank Senator Dodd for joining me in this effort and for \nthe work of his staff, Jeanne Ireland. I would also like to thank the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, the Children's Defense Fund and the \nNational Association for the Education of Young children for their \ninput and letters of support for this bill. I would also like to thank \nGovernor Sundquist and members of the Tennessee Department of Human \nServices, especially, Ms. Deborah Neill, the Director of Child Care, \nAdult and Community Programs, for their input on this important and \nneeded legislation. And finally, I would like to thank and acknowledge \nthe assistance of the Mayor of Memphis, the Honorable W. W. Herenton \nand his staff, who have been of great help in developing this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2236\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Christopher Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Dodd and Frist: On behalf of the 55,000 \n     members of the American Academy of Pediatrics, I would like \n     to applaud you for introducing the ``Children's Day Care \n     Health and Safety Improvement Act.''\n       The Academy and its members, along with many others, have \n     been working for years attempting to ensure that all children \n     receive high-quality child care and early education. Yet, the \n     statistics about the health and safety of child care setting \n     are very disturbing. Multiple studies have found that many \n     child care arrangements not only fail to give children the \n     type of intellectual stimulation and emotional support they \n     need, but actually compromise the health and safety of the \n     youngsters in their care.\n       One review of state child care regulations in 47 states \n     found that more than half of the states' safety-related \n     regulations had inadequate or no standards for 24 out of the \n     36 safety topics examined. Most notable were the inattention \n     to playground safety, choking hazards, and firearms. Studies \n     of child care settings themselves have also been \n     disheartening. One four-state study found that only one in \n     seven child care centers (14%) were rated as good quality. \n     Another study found that 13 percent of regulated and 50 \n     percent of nonregulated family child care providers offer \n     care that is inadequate. The Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission reports that about 31,000 children, 4 years old \n     and younger, were treated in U.S. hospital emergency rooms \n     for injuries at child care/school settings in 1997, and that \n     the agency knows of at least 56 children who have died in \n     child care setting since 1990.\n       By providing states with funds for activities specifically \n     aimed at improving the health and safety of child care, your \n     bill should help to reduce the incidence of preventable \n     illness, injury, disability, and even death, for the millions \n     of children who spend their days in out-of-home child care.\n       The ``Children's Day Care Health and Safety Improvement \n     Act'' is much-needed legislation, and we look forward to \n     working with you to support its enactment. Thank you for your \n     continued dedication to improving children's lives.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Donald E.

We are pleased that you share our \n     concerns, about the need to improve the health and safety of \n     children in a variety of child care settings and support a \n     federal partnership with states, communities, and providers \n     in meeting that goal.\n       The Child Care Health and Safety Improvement Act that you \n     will be introducing today seeks to strengthen state licensing \n     and other regulatory standards and enforcement, linkages \n     between child care providers and health services providers, \n     and training to child care providers in injury prevention and \n     health promotion. This legislation addresses many of our \n     concerns and reflects NAEYC principles for ensuring that \n     child care settings are healthy and safe learning \n     environments.\n       As this bill moves forward, we would be happy to work to \n     make further improvements in the legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Adele Robinson,\n                                   Director of Policy Development.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Frist in \nintroducing The Children's Day Care Health and Safety Act, legislation \nthat I believe will have a significant impact on the well-being of the \n13 million children who spend some part of every day in child care.\n\n[[Page S1411]]\n\n  Each morning, millions of parents drop their children off at a child \ncare center, a neighbor's home, or their church's day care center, \nassuming--or at least hoping--that their children will be safe and well \ncared for. And, in the vast majority of circumstances that's the case. \nBut, unfortunately, there is alarming evidence to suggest that, far too \noften, unsafe child care settings are compromising the health of our \nchildren.\n  In 1997 alone, 31,000 children ages 4 and younger were treated in \nhospital emergency rooms for injuries sustained in child care or school \nsettings. Since 1990, more than 55 children have died while in child \ncare settings.\n  Perhaps most tragically, many of these deaths and injuries were most \nlikely preventable--if providers were knowledgeable about basic health \nand safety practices and if states did a better job of developing and \nenforcing strong health and safety regulations.\n  Almost all child care providers want to give good care to the \nchildren in their charge. Despite the fact that we pay child care \nproviders abysmally--typically below poverty wages with no paid sick \nleave--individuals join this profession because they love children and \nwant to help them grow and thrive. But, we do far too little to support \nproviders in making sure that the environment they provide to our \nchildren is a safe and healthy one.\n  Many child care providers are unaware of the importance of removing \nsoft bedding from cribs--which presents a suffocation hazard for \ninfants and increases the likelihood of child dying from SIDS. Many \nchild care providers are also unaware of the need to place window-blind \ncords out of reach. Consequently, one child every month strangles in \nthe loop of a cord.\n  An investigation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission revealed \nthat two-thirds of licensed child care settings surveyed exhibited \nthese type of safety hazards, as well as other, such as insufficient \nchild safety gates and unsafe playgrounds.\n  Some states have taken action to improve health and safety practices. \nFor example, Connecticut requires child care centers to receive at \nleast monthly visits from a nurse or pediatrician, who can advise \nproviders on concerns ranging from the basics, like the importance of \nhandwashing after diaper-changing, to more complex issues, such as how \nto accommodate the special needs of a child with a disability.\n  But, many states are hard-pressed simply to meet the enormous demand \nfor child care from working families and families transitioning off \nwelfare. With all the pressure to create child care slots and to help \nfamilies find any kind of care, unfortunately, child care health and \nsafety often becomes an afterthought.\n  A survey of state child care standards found that only one-third of \nstates had minimally acceptable child care quality regulations. Two-\nthirds of states had regulations that didn't even address the basics--\nprovider training, safe environments and appropriate ratios. And in \nmany cases, even when there are good standards on the books, \nenforcement is lax.\n  Too often we view finding safe, high quality child care as a problem \nparents should struggle with on their own. It's time we recognize that \nunsafe child care is a public health crisis, not a personal problem.\n  That's why I'm so pleased to join Senator Frist today in introducing \nlegislation that would provide grants to the states to reduce child \ncare health and safety hazards. Grants could be used for a broad range \nof activities that we know have the greatest impact on health and \nsafety, such as training and educating providers on injury and illness \nprevention; improving health and safety standards; improving \nenforcement of standards, including increased surprise inspections; \nrenovating child care centers and family day care homes; helping \nproviders serve children with disabilities; and conducting criminal \nbackground checks on child care providers.\n  I am also pleased that this legislation has been endorsed by the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, the Children's Defense Fund, and the \nNational Association for the Education of Young Children.\n  Sadly just as our children grow--the number of child care abuses and \nhazards has grown over the years, as well. This measure can help ensure \nthat critically important safeguards are provided so that day care is a \nsafe haven, not a hazard.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 2237. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the deductibility of premiums for any medigap insurance policy of \nMedicare+Choice plan which contains an outpatient prescription drug \nbenefit, and to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide \nauthority to expand existing medigap insurance policies; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                     SENIORS' SECURITY ACT OF 2000\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Seniors' Security Act of 2000--a bill that will address the growing \nproblem of prescription drug coverage for senior citizens.\n  As we are all aware, seniors' access to prescription drugs is an \nimportant issue. Currently, traditional fee-for service Medicare covers \nfew drugs for seniors. At the same time, however, prescription drugs \nare an increasing component of seniors' health care. For these reasons, \nI believe that it is time Congress worked to increase American seniors' \naccess to prescription drugs.\n  The Senior's Security Act of 2000 will increase seniors' access to \nprescription drugs in two ways. First, it will extend tax equity to \nseniors by allowing them to deduct the cost of health insurance that \ncontains a qualified prescription drug benefit. We already provide such \nfavorable tax treatment for employer-provided health insurance and are \nmoving toward doing so for the self-employed. If we are truly concerned \nabout seniors' access to prescription drugs, we should do the same for \nthem.\n  In addition, SSA 2000 will also allow both current and future seniors \nto deduct the cost of long-term care insurance from their taxes and \nmake long-term care insurance available through employer-provided \nflexible spending accounts (FSAs).\n  SSA 2000 also provides for the design by National Association of \nInsurance Commissioners (NAIC) of additional Medigap policies in order \nto make prescription drug coverage more accessible and affordable. This \nprocess follows that which produced the existing Medigap policies. SSA \n2000 also directs the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) to \nanalyze and report on the salient issues in the design of prescription \ndrug benefit policies. MedPAC is directed to issue their findings in a \nJune 1, 2000 report to Congress and the NAIC in order to aid in \ndesigning new Medigap policies.\n  I believe SSA 2000 will make prescription drug coverage cheaper, both \ndirectly and indirectly. More than 18 million seniors have an income \ntax liability that can be reduced by this reform; by increasing the \nnumber of participants and making new Medigap policies a available, the \nbill will indirectly reduce the cost of coverage, as well. Unlike some \nother proposed reform measures in this area, it preserves and \nstrengthens the private insurance market--it contains no mandates, no \nprice controls, and preserve all existing Medigap policies--rather than \njeopardizing or eliminating it.\n  This bill does not attempt to address the issue of prescription drug \ncoverage for every senior; instead, it is the answer for a portion of \nthe senior population who have been paying at least part of the costs \nfor their health care and prescription drugs, but still need and \ndeserve to have a reduction in their out-of-pocket expenses. The \nSeniors' Security Act of 2000 is the best way to provide relief to this \ngroup of seniors, while at the same time continuing to work towards \nsolutions for those seniors who aren't as economically secure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2237\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate 3 counties in the State of Montana as \nHigh Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas and authorize funding for drug \ncontrol activities in those areas; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             Admitting Montana to the Rocky Mountain HIDTA\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce critical \nlegislation in the fight against methamphetamine use in rural America.\n  Methamphetamine, also known as ``meth'' is a powerful and addictive \ndrug. Considered by many youths to be\n\n[[Page S1414]]\n\na casual, soft-core drug with few lasting effects, meth can actually \ncause more long-term damage to the body than cocaine or crack.\n  I recently invited General Barry McCaffrey, our drug czar, along with \nDr. Don Vereen, his deputy, to Montana to focus attention on the \nproblem of meth use. Their visit was well-received by residents of our \nstate, and much-needed. The fact is, there are a good many talented \nMontanans working on the meth problem, but they have few resources with \nwhich to wage the battle. Moreover, their efforts are often fragmented, \nnot coordinated to the extent they could be, particularly among the \ntreatment, prevention, and law enforcement communities.\n  To make their job easier, Montana has petitioned to be considered \npart of the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area \n(HIDTA). Although the Rocky Mountain HIDTA authorities have stated \ntheir willingness to include Montana in its organization, they lack the \nresources to make that happen.\n  The bill I am introducing today would authorize funding to make \nMontana's admission to the Rocky Mountain HIDTA a reality. Here's why \nthat's necessary.\n  In 1998, the number of juveniles charged with drug-related or violent \ncrimes in the Yellowstone County Youth Court rose by 30 percent. In \nLame Deer--the community of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation--\nkids as young as 8 years old have been seen for meth addiction. Last \nNovember in our state, a meth lab blew up in Great Falls, leading to a \nhalf dozen arrests. Meth use in Montana has doubled in the past few \nyears. Cases are growing and the states law enforcement can no longer \nfight the problem.\n  Mr. President, the DEA reported an increase of meth lab seizures in \nMontana of 900% from 1993 to 1998. And according to the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy, based on methamphetamine admission rates \nper 100,000 persons, Montana is one of eight states with a ``serious \nmethamphetamine problem.''\n  The meth problem is particularly severe on Montana's Indian \nreservations, of which our state has seven. Life is hard there. In some \nreservation towns, over half of the working age adults are unemployed. \nBecause meth is cheap and relatively easy to make, these lower-income \nindividuals are a natural target for meth peddlers. Without viable \nemployment options, too often these young people turn to drugs.\n  And that's the case throughout Montana, not just on the reservations. \nIn 1998, Montana ranked 47th in the nation in per-capita personal \nincome, 50th in personal income from wages and salaries, and second in \nthe nation for the number of people who work two or more jobs.\n  Since poverty and drug use often go hand in hand, it came as little \nsurprise to me when a recent report showed a dramatic uptick in the \nincidence of drug abuse in rural America.\n  The report, commissioned by the Drug Enforcement Administration and \nfunded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, focused primarily on \n13- and 14-year-olds. It showed that eighth graders in rural America \nare 83 percent more likely to use crack cocaine than their urban \ncounterparts. They are 50 percent more likely to use cocaine, 34 \npercent more likely to smoke marijuana, 29 percent more likely to drink \nalcohol. Even more shocking, the report showed that rural eighth \ngraders were 104 percent more likely to use amphetamines, including \nmethamphetamine. Let me clarify, Mr. President. That is double the rate \nof urban eighth graders.\n  The bill I am proposing today would provide Montana the resources to \nput forth a coordinated effort in the fight against meth in Montana. By \nadmitting Yellowstone, Cascade and Missoula counties to the Rocky \nMountain HIDTA, Montana can focus its efforts on the three largest \nproblem areas for meth use. It would increase law enforcement and \nforensic personnel in Montana; coordinate efforts to exchange \ninformation among law enforcement agencies; and engage in a public \ninformation campaign to educate the public about the dangers of meth \nuse.\n  Mr. President, the time has come to fight this scourge. Montana is \nunder seige by meth, and we must do all we can to stop it--for the good \nof our state and those around us.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Bennett, \n        and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 2239. A bill to authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to provide \ncost sharing for the endangered fish recovery implementation programs \nfor the Upper Colorado River and San Juan River basins; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n   cost sharing for endangered fish recovery implementation programs\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nauthorize the Bureau of Reclamation to provide cost sharing for the \nendangered fish recovery implementation programs for the Upper Colorado \nRiver and San Juan River basins.\n  This legislation is the product of years of meetings between water \ndistricts, power users, state and federal government and environmental \ngroups. It authorizes federal and non-federal funding of an Upper Basin \nRecovery Program for endangered species in the Colorado River Basin and \nthe San Juan River Basin. The goal of the program is to recover the \nColorado pikeminnow, humpback chub, razorback sucker and bonytail chub \nwhile continuing to meet future water supply needs in the Upper Basin \nstates of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico.\n  To date, more than $20 million has been spent for capital projects to \nrecover the endangered fish. Failure to recover the endangered species \ncould result in limitations on current and future water diversions and \nuse in the Upper Basin states. The legislation provides Congress and \nthe Upper Basin stakeholders a finite Recovery Program under an \nauthorized spending cap.\n  The legislation authorizes $100 million for capital construction, \noperations and maintenance to implement other aspects of the program \nthat include fish ladders, hatchery facilities, removal of non-native \nspecies and habitat restoration. The cost sharing program authorizes \n$46 million of federal funds to the Bureau of Reclamation and the \nremaining $54 million will be generated from state contributions not to \nexceed $17 million; contributions from power revenues up to $17 million \nand the remaining $20 million from replacement power credit and capital \ncost of water.\n  The States of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming all support the \nprogram. Other supporters include: the Colorado River Energy \nDistributors Association, the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish \nRecovery Implementation Program, the Environmental Defense Fund, The \nNature Conservancy, Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District, \nColorado River Water Conservation District, Southern Ute Indian Tribe \nand Colorado Water Congress.\n  It is critical to affirm the federal government's commitment to the \nimplementation of the Recovery Programs. The bill reflects compromise \non all sides of the issue and recognizes that protection of endangered \nspecies can coincide with water development and water use. The \nparticipants want to move ahead with this program and are willing to \nhelp share in the costs. I urge my Senate colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO:\n  S. 2241. A bill to amend title XVII of the Social Security Act to \nadjust wages and wage-related costs for certain items and services \nfurnished in geographically reclassified hospitals; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nMedicare Wage-Index Reclassification Act of 2000. This bill will amend \nthe Social Security Act to redirect additional Medicare reimbursements \nto rural hospitals. Currently, hospitals throughout the country are \nlosing Medicare reimbursements, which results in severe implications \nfor surrounding communities.\n  As you know, in an attempt to keep Medicare from consuming its \nlimited reserves, Congress enacted the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 \n(BBA), which made sweeping changes in the manner that health care \nproviders are reimbursed for services rendered to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. These were the most significant modifications in the \nhistory of the program.\n\n[[Page S1415]]\n\n  All of the problems with the BBA--whether hospitals, nursing \nfacilities, home health agencies, or skilled nursing facilities--are \nespecially acute in rural states, where Medicare payments are a bigger \npercentage of hospital revenues and profit margins are generally much \nlower. These facilities were already managed at a highly efficient \nlevel and had ``cut the fat out of the system.'' Therefore, the cuts \nimplemented in the BBA hit the rural communities in Idaho and \nthroughout the United States in a very significant and serious way.\n  In the 1st session, the Senate Finance Committee did a tremendous job \nof bringing forth legislation that adjusted Medicare payments to health \ncare providers hurt by cuts ordered in the BBA. While this was a \nmeaningful step, the Senate must continue to address the inequities in \nthe system.\n  My bill would expand wage-index reclassification by requiring the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to deem a hospital that has been \nreclassified for purposes of its inpatient wage-index to also \nreclassify for purposes of other services which are provider-based and \nfor which payments are adjusted using a wage-index. In other words, \nthis legislation would require the Secretary to use a hospital's \nreclassification wage-index to adjust payments for hospital outpatient, \nskilled nursing facility, home health, and other services, providing \nthose entities are provider-based. This change should have been made in \nBBA when Congress required that prospective payment systems be \nestablished for these other services. As such, this change would \naddress an issue that has been left unaddressed for several years.\n  It makes sense that, if a hospital has been granted reclassification \nby the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board for certain \ninpatient services, it also be granted wage-index reclassification for \noutpatient and other services. It is estimated that this provision \nwould help approximately 400 hospitals, 90 percent which are rural. \nFurthermore, this provision would be budget neutral.\n  I know my colleagues in the Senate share my commitment of promoting \naccess to health care services in rural areas. Expanding wage-index \ngeographic reclassification will allow hospitals to recoup lost funds \nand use those funds to address patients' needs in an appropriate, \neffective, and meaningful way. I encourage my colleagues to co-sponsor \nthe Medicare Wage-Index Reclassification Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2241\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act \nof 1998 to improve the process for identifying the functions of the \nFederal Government that are not inherently governmental functions, for \ndetermining the appropriate organizations for the performance of such \nfunctions on the basis of competition, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                    THE FAIR ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2000\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nimprove the implementation of legislation that Congress passed in 1998, \nthe Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act.\n  It has been 45 years, since President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued \nBureau of the Budget Bulletin 55-4, proclaiming, ``It is the policy of \nthe Government to rely on the private sector to supply the products and \nservices the Government needs.''\n  Why is it, then, the Federal government has identified some one \nmillion positions on its payroll that are commercial in nature? As the \nauthor of the FAIR Act, I had hoped that my legislation would have put \ninto place a process, albeit 45 years later, to substantively implement \nIke's policy.\n  Despite almost a half-century of policy that ``the Federal government \nshould not start or carry on any activity to provide a commercial \nproduct or service if the product or service can be procured from the \nprivate sector'' more than 100 agencies have released FAIR Act \ninventories identifying some one million commercial Federal positions. \nOf these, 440,000 are in civilian agencies and more than 65 percent \nhave been exempted from potential outsourcing. In the Department of \nDefense, 504,000 non-uniformed positions are considered commercial, but \n196,000 or 39 percent are exempt from outsourcing.\n  The first year experience with the FAIR Act raises fundamental \nquestions. If it has been the Federal Government's policy for 45 years \nto rely on the private sector for commercially available goods and \nservices, how did we get to the point where despite claims of \n``reinventing government,'' ``the smallest Federal workforce since the \nKennedy Administration'' and other political rhetoric, we have one \nmillion Federal employees engaged in commercial activities? How is it \nthat of those one million positions, roughly half will not even be \nstudied to determine if government or private sector performance \nprovides the best value to the taxpayers?\n  The FAIR Act was intended to shed sunshine on the Federal \nGovernment's commercial activities. Its purpose was to tell the \nAmerican people what its government does and put in place a process to \ndetermine how to best get the job done. Unfortunately, implementation \nof the law has fallen short of these expectations.\n  The law requires agencies to inventory activities and positions that \nare not inherently governmental. Inventories are published so that \ninterested parties, both public and private, can challenge inclusions \nor omissions from the list. However, the Office of Management and \nBudget (OMB) has overstepped its authority by creating a series of \n``reason codes'' that enable agencies to declare activities commercial \nbut exempt from potential outsourcing, and then declaring such reason \ncode designations outside the challenge process. As a result, 482,000 \npositions, roughly half the government's entire FAIR inventory, has \nbeen declared commercial, but exempt from potential outsourcing, \npublic-private competition, or challenge. That is wrong, inconsistent \nwith the law and down right un-FAIR.\n  Manipulation of the process has also cast a long shadow on the \nsunshine Congress was seeking. Take for example the Department of \nEnergy. Of 11,765 commercial positions on its inventory, just 618 are \n``commercial competitive.'' Within the agency's Bonneville Power \nAdministration (BPA), 1,263 of the agency's 2,267 commercial positions \nwere classified as ``management'' and of these 1,259 were considered \n``commercial, in-house core,'' exempt from\n\n[[Page S1416]]\n\nfurther review. Unfortunately, DoE is not alone in gaming the system. \nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which has 4,500 employees, has \ninventoried all its positions in just two categories.\n  These practices, too, are un-FAIR, particularly for federal \nemployees. How can BPA or Corps of Engineers' employees tell if their \npositions are slated for potential outsourcing? How is the private \nsector to determine if the positions the Corps has on its inventory \ninvolve management of campgrounds, integration of their computer \nsystems, designing a dam, mapping a flood plain, or painting the walls \nof an office building if all these activities are aggregated into two \nbroad categories? These actions fail to shed sunshine and render the \nFAIR Act challenge process moot.\n  The FAIR Act also requires a ``review'' of commercial activities that \nsurvive the inventory and challenge process ``within a reasonable \ntime.'' The Act's legislative history clearly demonstrates Congress \nintended for such a review to be either direct outsourcing or a public-\nprivate competition similar to that envisioned in OMB Circular A-76. To \ndate, OMB has not issued guidance on how it will implement such \nreviews, nor has it established a timetable.\n  Due to OMB's dismal performance thus far, it is clear that Congress \nwill have to pass a package of FAIR Act amendments to make sure the job \nis done right. Today I introduce legislation to do just that.\n  This legislation is largely technical in nature but the major \nprovisions would improve the accuracy and usefulness of the \ninventories, make sure Federal employees are notified when their jobs \nappear on the inventories, fortify the review process, require a report \non the portability of federal employees' pension benefits, ban federal \nagencies from performing any commercial activity for other federal \nagencies or state and local governments unless a cost comparison is \nconducted and prohibits the conversion of any activity on a FAIR Act \ninventory to Federal Prison Industries.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member \nLieberman of the Government Affairs Committee to see that this common \nsense legislation is enacted into law this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Cleland, \n        Mrs. Murray, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Abraham, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 2243. A bill to reauthorize certain programs of the Small Business \nAdministration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness.\n\n\n     National Women's Business Council Re-Authorization Act of 2000\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I, along with Senators Snowe, \nKerry, Cleland, Murray, Mikulski, Abraham, and Jeffords, am introducing \nthe National Women's Business Council Re-authorization Act of 2000. \nThis legislation would ensure that one of our most valued resources may \ncontinue its work in support of women's business ownership. The bi-\npartisan National Women's Business Council has provided important \nadvice and counsel to the Congress since it was established in 1988. At \nthat time, there were 2.4 million women business owners documented; \ntoday, there are over 9 million women who own and operate businesses in \nevery sector, from home based services to construction trades to high \ntech giants. Women are changing the face of our economy at an \nunprecedented rate, and the Council has been our eyes and ears as we \nanticipate the needs of this burgeoning entrepreneurial sector. The 15 \nappointees to the Council, all prominent business women, have been hard \nat work during the last three years. Some of their accomplishments \ninclude: hosting Summit '98, a national economic forum that produced a \nMaster Plan of initiatives and recommendations to sustain and grow the \nentrepreneurial economy; preparing a Best Practices Guide for \nContracting with Woman, and issuing a comprehensive statistical study \nof 11 years of federal contracting with women owned businesses; co-\nhosting a series of highly regarded policy forums with the Federal \nReserve in 10 cities, including New Orleans, Louisiana, on capital \naccess issues facing entrepreneurs and working to secure the collection \nof data on women-owned businesses by the Bureau of the Census, and \nfunding new research on a range of issues concerning women's business \ndevelopment.\n  Recently, the Council has stepped up efforts to increase access to \ncredit for women-owned businesses. This spring, the Council will \nrelease a report in collaboration with the Milken Institute, which will \nidentify model programs that have been successful in increasing the \nflow of credit to small, women owned businesses, especially those in \nthe retail, service or high tech sectors. The Council is also working \nto increase investments in women-led firms by launching Springboard \n2000, a national series of women's venture capital forums. Building on \nthe momentum of its highly successful Silicon Valley event in January, \nthe Council will host at least two more forums showcasing women-led \nbusinesses before private, corporate and venture capital investors. As \nmy colleague Senator Kerry has said so often, the equity markets are \nthe last frontier for women entrepreneurs. The Council's venture \ncapital fairs provide women entrepreneurs with much needed access to \ncapital so that they can launch and grow their high tech businesses.\n  The Council is leading the effort to increase access to competitive \ncontracting opportunities by working with federal agencies and women's \nbusiness organizations. Later this year, the Council will release an \nextensive report on the characteristics and experiences of the over \n5,000 women business owners who have been successful in receiving \nfederal contracts. We eagerly look forward to reviewing their findings.\n  Under the chairmanship of Kay Koplovitz, the Council has indeed taken \na bold new approach in its advocacy of the fastest growing business \nsector. As a result of the Council's work this year, we will know more \nthan ever about women's business enterprise, their economic trends, the \ncharacteristics of their owners and their public and private sector \nneeds. The Council has been a powerful resource for policy makers by \nproviding valuable data, information and recommendations which are \nessential if we are to assist our communities in sustaining the \nunparalleled number of new businesses launched in the last 7 years.\n  It is for these reasons and more that I am introducing legislation to \nre-authorize the Council for another three years. It is imperative that \nthe National Women's Business Council continues its great work and \nexpands its activities to support initiatives that are creating the \ninfrastructure for women's entrepreneurship at the state and local \nlevel.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 2244. A bill to increase participation in employee stock purchase \nplans and individual retirement plans so that American workers may \nshare in the growth in the United States economy attributable to \ninternational trade agreements; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    working families trade bonus Act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, many working Americans fell like they've \nbeen left on the sidelines in the high-stakes game of international \ntrade. As U.S. companies expand overseas, corporate profits soar. \nWorkers standby watching for some tangible benefits for their own \npocketbooks. A May 1999 Los Angeles Times story captured Americans' \nskepticism toward trade. The story found just over half the public in \nMarch 1994 believed that treaties such as NAFTA would create U.S. jobs, \nwith only 32% fearing jobs loss. But by December 1998, the attitudes \nhad flip-flopped. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that 58% of \nAmericans believed that trade had reduced U.S. jobs and wages.\n  Nowhere has Americans' growing alienation from the world trading \nsystem been more evident than at the November 1999 World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) Ministerial meeting. The nightly news was filled \nwith the pictures of workers protesting the WTO in the streets of \nSeattle. This sense of alienation will continue to grow unless workers \nthemselves start to see more direct benefits from trade.\n  The legislation I am pleased to introduce today with Senator Baucus \nis an effort to narrow America's dividend divide in world trade. Our \nbill, The Working Families Trade Bonus Act, says\n\n[[Page S1417]]\n\nthat when companies win from world trade, workers should win, too. The \nbill would do this by encouraging companies to give their workers added \nTrade Bonus stock options--which workers at Fortune magazine's top 100 \nU.S. companies identified as one of the key reasons they work for the \ncompany. And for the millions of working Americans who don't have stock \nplans--farmers, self-employed and small business people--the bill would \nallow them to double the maximum allowable annual IRA contribution.\n  The bill specifically targets workers who are often excluded by \ncompany stock option plans--those at the lower end of company pay \nscales. The Trade Bonus program prohibits a company from discriminating \nin favor of highly compensated employees and requires that all \nemployees be allowed to purchase the maximum amount of stock allowed by \nlaw at the lowest price allowed by law. The program would not allow \ncompanies to substitute stock options for regular compensation. \nTogether, these safeguards assure that all workers are included in the \ntrade winner's circle.\n  Proponents of free trade, like Senator Baucus and myself, have done a \nlot of talking about its benefits. Manufactured goods are the \ncenterpiece of our nation's export--accounting for nearly two-thirds of \ntotal U.S. exports of goods and services. Exports support about one in \nevery five American factory jobs. These jobs pay about 15 percent more \non average than non-export-related jobs, require more skills and are \nless prone to economic downturns than those accounted for fully one-\nthird of our nation's economic growth, and since 1950, international \ntrade flows have grown twice as fast as the economy. Yet, most workers \nhave few good things to say about free trade because they've never seen \nany direct benefits from it. It's time to turn the rhetoric about free \ntrade into real benefits for workers. It's time to widen the winner's \ncircle to make sure that American workers share directly in the rewards \nof free trade.\n\n  Our legislation would require the Secretary of Commerce to determine \nannually, beginning with 1998, whether international trade has \ncontributed to an increase in U.S. GDP. This determination would be \nincluded in the President's budget for the subsequent fiscal year. For \nevery year in which the Secretary makes a determination that trade has \ncontributed to an increase in the U.S. GDP, employers would be \nencouraged to contribute additional compensation up to $2,000 per \nworker per year to employee stock purchase plans. These additional \ncontributions to an employee's stock purchase plan--the Trade Bonus--\nwould not be subject to capital gains tax. For workers who are not \neligible for an employee stock purchase plan Trade Bonus, the bill \nallows them to double the allowable annual amount of their IRA \ncontribution--to a maximum of $4,000.\n  For employers with 100 or fewer employees that do not have employee \nstock purchase plans, the bill would give them a significant incentive \nto create them; the bill offers a one-time tax credit to help offset \nall the administrative fees directly related to establishing an \nemployee stock purchase plan. It would also provide limited tax credits \nfor three subsequent years for costs directly related to IRS compliance \nand employee education about the Trade Bonus program. The language of \nthis section is drawn from previous legislation and assures that the \ntax credit applies only to the actual cost of creating the employee \nstock purchase plan and not to services that may be related to \nretirement planning, such as tax preparation, accounting, legal or \nbrokerage services.\n  The bill sets out guidelines for employers establishing or expanding \nan employee stock purchase plan under the Trade Bonus program, \nincluding that employees be eligible for the maximum amount of $2,000 \nat the lowest price allowed by law; that employers make the plan \navailable to the widest range of employees without discrimination in \nfavor of highly compensated employees; that employers ensure that the \ntrade bonus is in addition to compensation an employee would normally \nreceive (and that safeguards be in place to do so); and that it does \nnot result in lack of diversification of an employee's assets.\n  Here's how the Working Families Trade Bonus Act would work. As under \ncurrent law, employee stock purchase plans offer stock to participants \nat a discount. The current minimum purchase price is the lesser of 85% \nof the value of the stock on the date of the grant of the options \n(usually the beginning of the purchase period) or 85% of the value of \nthe stock when the option is exercised--usually the end of the purchase \nperiod. This means that, in the period during which the stock has \nappreciated, the employee can get the benefit of the appreciation and, \nin a period during which the stock has depreciated, the employee might \nstill be able to buy employer stock at a discounted price, or, if the \nplan provides, could decline to purchase the stock.\n\n  For example, let's say the President announces in the budget for FY \n2001 that international trade contributed to growth in US GDP in 1999. \nFleet of Foot Shoes, an athletic shoe manufacturer in Florence, Oregon, \ndecides to award its workers the full $2,000 trade bonus on February 1, \n2000. If a share of Fleet of Foot stock is worth $100 on the date of \nthe grant of the option and $200 when the option is exercised, say \nDecember 2001, the employees' purchase price can be as low as $85. This \nmeans the employee can purchase stock worth $200 for only $85, so the \nemployee is able to purchase more than 40 shares of stock for the price \nof only 20 shares. Alternatively, if the stock is worth $50 when the \noption is exercised, the employee is able to purchase stock worth $50 \nfor only $42.50.\n  Here is how the tax benefit would work. Under current law, employees \nwho hold qualified stock at least two years from the date of grant of \nthe option and one year from the purchase of the stock are entitled to \na capital gains tax break until the point they sell the stock. If an \nemployee chooses to sell stock purchased through the Trade Bonus and \nthe purchase price was less than the fair market value on the date the \noption was granted, then the difference between the purchase price and \nthe fair market value will be taxed as ordinary income in the year the \nstock is sold. Under my proposal, the remainder of the gain that would \notherwise be taxed as a capital gain in the same year would not be \ntaxed. So, using the Trade Bonus, if an employee pays $85 to buy a \nshare of stock whose fair market value is $100, holds onto the share \nfor more than the required two years and then sells it for $150, the \n$15 discount on the original purchase price would be taxed as ordinary \nincome, but the employee would not pay capital gains tax on the $50 \nincrease in the value of the share of stock.\n  About one-half of all American adults own stock today, and stocks are \nnow the largest asset families own, exceeding even home equity. \nFortune's January 2000 survey found 36 of the 58 publicly held \ncompanies on the top 100 list offer options to all employees. According \nto a 1998 survey of Oregon technology companies, almost two-thirds of \nOregon's technology companies offer stock options. In today's tight \nemployment market where companies compete to attract and retain the \nbest employees, stock purchase plans are becoming increasingly common. \nThe National Center for Employee Ownership estimates that seven and a \nhalf million Americans work for companies that make stock options \navailable, and that employees own nine percent of total corporate \nequity in the United States. A recent Federal Reserve study found that \none-third of the firms it surveyed offer stock options to employees \nother than executives.\n  Our legislation will build upon this trend. The Working Families \nTrade Bonus Opportunity Act will give workers the chance to share \ndirectly in the benefits of free trade. This legislation will help put \nreal money into the pockets of working Americans, and help move stock \noptions out of the corner office and onto the shop floor. I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2244\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthat certain small businesses are permitted to use the cash method of \naccounting even if they use merchandise or inventory; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n       small business accounting method clarification act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \naddresses an issue of growing concern to small businesses across the \nnation--tax accounting methods. And I am pleased to be joined in this \neffort by my colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley.\n  While this topic may lack the notoriety of some other tax issues \ncurrently in the spotlight like the estate tax or alternative minimum \ntax, it goes to the heart of a business' daily operations--reflecting \nits income and expenses. And because it is such a fundamental issue, \none may ask: ``What's the big deal?'' Hasn't this been settled long \nago?'' Regrettably, recent efforts by the Treasury Department and \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) have muddied what many small business \nowners have long seen as a settled issue.\n  To many small business owners, tax accounting simply means that they \nrecord cash receipts when they come in and the cash they pay when they \nwrite a check for a business expense. The difference is income, which \nis subject to taxes. In its simplest form, this is known as the ``cash \nreceipts and disbursements'' method of accounting--or the ``cash \nmethod'' for short. It is easy to understand, it is simple to undertake \nin daily business operations, and for the vast majority of small \nenterprises, it matches their income with the related expenses in a \ngiven year. Coincidentally, it's also the method of accounting used by \nthe Federal Government to keep track of the $1.7 trillion in tax \nrevenues it collects each year as well as all of its expenditures for \nsalaries and expenses, procurement, and the cost of various government \nprograms.\n  Unfortunately, the IRS has taken a different view in recent years \nwith respect to small businesses on the cash method. In too many cases, \nthe IRS contends that a small business should report its income when \nall events have occurred to establish the business' right to receipt \nand the amount can reasonably be determined. Similar principles are \napplied to determine when a business may recognize an expense. This \nmethod of accounting is known as ``accrual accounting.'' The reality of \naccrual accounting for a small business is that it may be\n\n[[Page S1420]]\n\ndeemed to have income well before the cash is actually received and an \nexpense long after the cash is actually paid. As a result, accrual \naccounting can create taxable income for a small business that has yet \nto receive the cash necessary to pay the taxes.\n  While the IRS argues that the accrual method of accounting produces a \nmore accurate reflection of ``economic income,'' it also produces a \nmajor headache for small enterprise. Few entrepreneurs have the time or \nexperience to undertake accrual accounting, which forces them to hire \ncostly accountants and tax preparers. By some estimates, accounting \nfees can increase as much as 50% when accrual accounting is required, \nexcluding the cost of high-tech computerized accounting systems that \nsome businesses must install. For the brave few that try to handle the \naccounting on their own, the accrual method often leads to major \nmistakes, resulting in tax audits and additional costs for professional \nhelp to sort the whole mess out--not to mention the interest and \npenalties that the IRS may impose as a result of the mistake.\n  To make matters even worse, the IRS recently began focusing on small \nservice providers who use some merchandise in the performance of their \nservice. In an e-mail sent to practitioners in my State of Missouri and \nin Kansas, the IRS' local district office took special aim at the \nconstruction industry asserting that ``[t]axpayers in the construction \nindustry who are on the cash method of accounting may be using an \nimproper method. The cash method is permissible only if materials are \nnot an income producing factor.'' For these lucky service providers, \nthe IRS now asserts that the use of merchandise requires the business \nto undertake an additional and even more onerous form of bookkeeping--\ninventory accounting.\n  Let's be clear about the kind of taxpayer at issue here. It's the \nhome builder who by necessity must purchase wood, nails, dry wall, and \nhost of other items to provide the service of constructing a house. \nSimilarly, it's a painting contractor who will often purchase the paint \nwhen she renders the service of painting the interior of a house. These \nservice providers generally purchase materials to undertake a specific \nproject and at its end, little or no merchandise remains. They may even \narrange for the products to be delivered directly to their client. In \neither case, the IRS insists that inventory accounting is now required.\n  Mr. President, if we thought that accrual accounting is complicated \nand burdensome, imagining in having to keep track of all the boards, \nnails, and paint used in the home builder's and painter's jobs each \nyear. And the IRS doesn't stop at inventory accounting for these \nservice providers. Instead, they use it as the first step to imposing \noverall accrual accounting--a one-two punch for the small service \nprovider when it comes to compliance burdens.\n  Even more troubling is the cost of an audit for these unsuspecting \nservice providers who have never known they were required to use \ninventories or accrual accounting. According to a survey of \npractitioners by the Padgett Business Services Foundation, audits of \nbusinesses on the issue of merchandise used in the performance of \nservices resulted in tax deficiencies from $2,000 to $14,000, with an \naverage of $7,200. That's a pretty steep price to pay for an accounting \nmethod error that the IRS has for years never enforced.\n  In many cases, like retailing, inventory accounting makes sense. \nPurchasing or manufacturing products and subsequently selling them is \nthe heart of a retail business, and keeping track of those products is \na necessary reality. But for a service provider with incidental \nmerchandise, like a roofing contractor, inventory accounting is nothing \nshort of an unnecessary government-imposed compliance cost.\n  The bill I'm introducing today, the Small Business Tax Accounting \nSimplification Act of 2000, addresses both of these issues. First, it \nestablishes a clear threshold for when small businesses may use the \ncash method of accounting. Simply put, if a business has an average of \n$5 million in annual gross receipts or less during the preceding three \nyears, it may use the cash method. Plain and simple--no complicated \nformula; no guessing if you made the right assumptions and arrived at \nthe right answer. If the business exceeds the threshold, it may still \nseek to establish, as under current law, that the cash method clearly \nreflects its income.\n  Some may argue that this provision is unnecessary because section \n448(b) and (c) already provide a $5 million gross receipts test with \nrespect to accrual accounting. That's a reasonable position since many \nin Congress back in 1986 intended section 448 to provide relief for \nsmall business taxpayers using the cash method. Unfortunately, the IRS \nhas twisted this section to support its quest to force as many small \nbusinesses as possible into costly accrual accounting. The IRS \nconstrues section 448 as merely a $5 million ceiling above which a \nbusiness can never use the cash method. My bill corrects this \nmisinterpretation once and for all--if a business has average gross \nreceipts of $5 million or less, it is free to use cash accounting.\n  Second, for small service providers, the Small Business Tax \nAccounting Simplification Act, creates a straightforward threshold for \ninventory accounting. If the amount paid for merchandise by a small \nservice provider is less than 50% of its gross receipts, based on its \nprior year's figures, no inventory accounting would be required. Above \nthat level, the taxpayer would look more like a retail business and \ninventory accounting may make sense.\n  These two thresholds set forth in my bill are common sense answers to \nan increasing burden for small businesses in this country. In addition, \nit sends a clear signal to the IRS: stop wasting scarce resources \nforcing small businesses to adopt complex and costly accounting methods \nwhen the benefit to the Treasury is simply a matter of timing. Whether \na small business uses the cash or accrual method or inventory \naccounting or not, in the end, the government will still collect the \nsame amount of taxes--maybe not all this year, but very likely early in \nthe next year. What small business can go very long without collecting \nwhat it is owed or paying its bills?\n  To date, the Treasury Department's answer has been to suggest a $1 \nmillion threshold under which a small business could escape accrual \naccounting and presumably inventories. While it is a step in the right \ndirection, it simply doesn't go far enough. Even ignoring inflation, if \na million dollar threshold were sufficient, why would Congress have \ntried to enact a $5 million threshold 14 years ago? My bill completes \nthe job that the Treasury Department has been unable or unwilling to \ndo.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today is substantially \nsimilar to the bill introduced in the other body by my good friend and \nfellow Missourian, Jim Talent (H.R. 2273). With the strong support he \nhas built among his colleagues in the other chamber and in the small \nbusiness community, I expect to continue the momentum in the Senate and \nachieve some much needed relief from unnecessary compliance burdens and \ncosts for America's small businesses.\n  The call for tax simplification has been growing increasingly loud in \nrecent years, and the bill I offer today provides an excellent \nopportunity for us to advance the ball well down the field. This is not \na partisan issue; it's a small business issue. And I urge my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to join me in this common sense legislation \nfor the benefit of America's small enterprises, which contribute so \ngreatly to this country's economic engine.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a copy \nof the bill and a description of its provisions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2246\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Tax \n     Accounting Simplification Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION OF CASH ACCOUNTING RULES FOR SMALL \n                   BUSINESS.\n\n       Section 446 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating \n     to general rule for methods of accounting) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(g) Small Business Taxpayers Permitted To Use Cash \n     Accounting Method Without Limitation.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, a taxpayer shall not\n\n[[Page S1421]]\n\n     be required to use an accrual method of accounting for any \n     taxable year, if the average annual gross receipts of such \n     taxpayer (or any predecessor) for the 3-year-period ending \n     with the preceding taxable year does not exceed $5,000,000. \n     The rules of paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 448(c) shall \n     apply for purposes of the preceding sentence. In the case of \n     a C corporation or a partnership which has a C corporation as \n     a partner, the first sentence of this subsection shall apply \n     only if such C corporation or partnership meets the \n     requirements of section 448(b)(3).''.\n       (b) Clarification of Inventory Rules for Small Business.--\n     Section 471 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \n     general rule for inventories) is amended by redesignating \n     subsection (c) as subsection (d) and by inserting after \n     subsection (b) the following new subsection:\n       ``(c) Small Business Service Providers Not Required To Use \n     Inventories.--A taxpayer shall not be required to use \n     inventories under this section for a taxable year if the \n     amounts paid for merchandise sold during the preceding \n     taxable year were less than 50 percent of the gross receipts \n     received during such preceding taxable year. For purposes of \n     this subsection, gross receipts for any taxable year shall be \n     reduced by returns and allowances made during such year.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Small Business Tax Accounting Simplification Act of 2000--Description \n                             of Provisions\n\n       The bill amends section 446 of the Internal Revenue Code to \n     provide a clear threshold for small businesses to use the \n     cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, instead \n     of accrual accounting. To qualify, the business must have $5 \n     million or less in average annual gross receipts based on the \n     preceding three years.\n       The bill also amends section 471 of the Internal Revenue \n     Code to provide a small service provider exception to the \n     inventory accounting rules. Under this provision, if the \n     amount spent on merchandise by a service provider is less \n     than 50% of its gross receipts, inventory accounting under \n     section 471 would not be required. This 50% test is based on \n     the service provider's purchases and gross receipts in the \n     preceding taxable year.\n       Both provisions of the bill would be effective beginning on \n     the date of enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1421-1",

Mr. President, today I introduce a Resolution which \nwould express the support of Congress for activities that will raise \npublic awareness of multiple sclerosis.\n  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, often disabling disease of the \ncentral nervous system. Symptoms can range from mild numbness in the \nlimbs to paralysis and blindness. Most people with MS are diagnosed \nbetween the ages of 20 and 40, but the unpredictable physical and \nemotional effects of this debilitating disease can be lifelong. The \nprogress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot \nyet be predicted, but advances in research and treatment are giving \nhope to those affected by the disease. It is known that MS afflicts \ntwice as many women as men, however, once an individual is diagnosed \nwith MS their symptoms can be effectively managed and complications \navoided through regular medical care.\n  Nationally, it is estimated that between 250,000 and 350,000 \nindividuals\n\n[[Page S1423]]\n\nsuffer from MS, which is approximately 1 out of every 1,000 people. In \nRhode Island, the rate is slightly higher--1.5 out of every 1,000. Over \n3,000 individuals and their families in my home state are affected by \nthis disease.\n  It is my hope that through this resolution we can bring greater \nattention to the devastating affects of this disease, while also \nbuilding support for additional research. It is through more intensive \nresearch efforts by agencies such as the National Institutes of Health \nthat we will better understand some of the potential causes of this \ndisease, as well as develop more effective methods of treatment, and \nmaybe someday prevention. Indeed, it is only with greater resources \nthat we can build public awareness about MS and enhance our scientific \nunderstanding of this mysterious illness.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude \nto the National Multiple Sclerosis Society as well as the Rhode Island \nChapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society for their encouragement and \nassistance in developing this important Resolution. It is through their \ngrassroots efforts that individuals suffering from MS can get \ninformation about their disease as well as learn more about resources \navailable in their communities, research being conducted, and support \nservices for family members. Their support is essential to those who \nhave been afflicted with MS, and I hope that through this resolution \nthe Congress can assist in bolstering these important efforts.\n  In closing, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nimportant Resolution to raise awareness and encourage people to become \nmore educated about this debilitating disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1423-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 94--PROVIDING FOR A CONDITIONAL \n                  ADJOURNMENT OR RECESS OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. LOTT submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

Con. Res. 95\n\n       Whereas on March 16, 1988, Saddam Hussein attacked the \n     Iraqi Kurdish city of Halabja with chemical weapons, \n     including nerve gas, VX, and mustard gas;\n       Whereas more than 5,000 men, women, and children were \n     murdered in Halabja by Saddam Hussein's chemical warfare, in \n     gross violation of international law;\n       Whereas the attack on Halabja was part of a systemic, \n     genocidal attack on the Kurds of Iraq known as the ``Anfal \n     Campaign'';\n       Whereas the Anfal Campaign resulted in the death of more \n     than 180,000 Iraqi Kurdish men, women, and children;\n       Whereas, despite the passage of 12 years, there has been no \n     successful attempt by the United States, the United Nations, \n     or other bodies of the international community to bring the \n     perpetrators of the Halabja massacre to justice;\n       Whereas the Senate and the House of Representatives have \n     repeatedly noted the atrocities committed by the Saddam \n     Hussein regime;\n       Whereas the Senate and the House of Representatives have on \n     16 separate occasions called upon successive Administrations \n     to work toward the creation of an International Tribunal to \n     prosecute the war crimes of the Saddam Hussein regime;\n       Whereas in successive fiscal years monies have been \n     authorized to create a record of the human rights violations \n     of the Saddam Hussein regime and to pursue the creation of an \n     international tribunal and the indictment of Saddam Hussein \n     and members of his regime;\n       Whereas the Saddam Hussein regime continues the brutal \n     repression of the people of Iraq, including the denial of \n     basic human, political, and civil rights to Sunni, Shiite, \n     and Kurdish Iraqis, as well as other minority groups;\n       Whereas the Secretary General of the United Nations has \n     documented annually the failure of the Saddam Hussein regime \n     to deliver basic necessities to the Iraqi people despite \n     ample supplies of food in Baghdad warehouses;\n       Whereas the Saddam Hussein regime has at its disposal more \n     than $12,000,000,000 per annum (at current oil prices) to \n     expend on all categories of human needs;\n       Whereas, notwithstanding a complete lack of restriction on \n     the purchase of food by the Government of Iraq, infant \n     mortality rates in areas controlled by Saddam Hussein remain \n     above pre-war levels, in stark contrast to rates in United \n     Nations-controlled Kurdish areas, which are below pre-war \n     levels; and\n       Whereas it is unconscionable that after the passage of 12 \n     years the brutal Saddam Hussein dictatorship has gone \n     unpunished for the murder of hundreds of thousands of \n     innocent Iraqis, the use of banned chemical weapons on the \n     people of Iraqi Kurdistan, and innumerable other human rights \n     violations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) commemorates the suffering of the people of Halabja and \n     all the victims of the Anfal Campaign;\n       (2) condemns the Saddam Hussein regime for its continued \n     brutality towards the Iraqi people;\n       (3) strongly urges the President to act forcefully within \n     the United Nations and the United Nations Security Council to \n     constitute an international tribunal for Iraq;\n       (4) calls upon the President to move rapidly to efficiently \n     use funds appropriated by Congress to create a record of the \n     crimes of the Saddam Hussein regime;\n       (5) recognizes that Saddam Hussein's record of brutality \n     and belligerency threaten both the people of Iraq and the \n     entire Persian Gulf region; and\n       (6) reiterates that it should be the policy of the United \n     States to support efforts to remove the regime headed by \n     Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the \n     emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime, \n     as set forth in Public Law 105-338.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1423-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1423-S1424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 267--EXECUTIVE RESOLUTION DIRECTING THE RETURN OF \n                   CERTAIN TREATIES TO THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Mr. HELMS, from the Committee on Foreign Relations, reported the \nfollowing original resolution; which was placed on the Executive \nCalendar:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nHagel, submit the National Fragile X Awareness Week Resolution. This \nmeasure will establish July 17 through July 23 as National Fragile X \nAwareness Week.\n  Fragile X is the leading known cause of mental retardation. Despite \nthe devastating impact of the disease, the disorder is relatively \nunknown to many, even in the medical community, largely due to its \nfairly recent discovery.\n  Today, one in 2,000 males and one in 4,000 females have the gene \ndefect. One in every 260 women is a carrier. Current studies estimate \nthat as many as 90,000 Americans suffer from Fragile X, yet up to 80 to \n90 percent of them are undiagnosed. It does not effect one racial or \nethnic group more than another, and it is found in every socioeconomic \ngroup.\n  Scientists have only known exactly what causes Fragile X since 1991. \nThe disorder results from a defect in a single gene. Other diseases \ncaused by single gene defects include cystic fibrosis and muscular \ndystrophy. In fact, the incidence of Fragile X is similar to that of \ncystic fibrosis.\n  Fragile X occurs when a specific gene, which should hold a string of \nmolecules that repeat six to fifty times, over-expands, causing the \ngene to hold anywhere from 200 to 1,000 copies of the same sequence, \nrepeating over and over, much like a record skipping out of control. \nThe result of this error is that instructions needed for the creation \nof a specific protein in the brain are lost. Consequently, the Fragile \nX protein is either low or absent in the affected person. The lower the \nlevel of the protein, the more severe the resulting disabilities.\n  People with Fragile X have effects ranging from mild learning \ndisabilities to severe mental retardation. Behavioral problems \nassociated with Fragile X include aggression, anxiety, and seizures. \nThe effects on both the victims of the disorder and their families are \nprofound, taking a huge emotional and financial toll. People with \nFragile X have a normal life expectancy but usually incur special costs \nthat on average add up to over $2 million over their lifetime. Because \nit is inherited, many families have more than one child with Fragile X.\n  Recent advances in Fragile X research now make it possible to test \ndefinitively for the disorder through DNA analysis. Yet many doctors \nare still not familiar with Fragile X, and subtle symptoms in early \nchildhood can make it difficult to detect.\n\n  Today, in our country, thousands of children have Fragile X, but \ntheir parents have never heard of the disease. These parents know \nsomething is wrong, but they cannot give the problem a name, and \nneither can any doctor they have consulted. They may know their child \nhas mental retardation, but they do not know why. They do not know that \nif they have more children, those children may also be at risk. They do \nnot know there are treatments for the problem. They do not know that \nsomeone is working on a cure.\n  the same holds true for many adults in our society. They are living \nin group homes and in institutions around the country. They have been \ncared for during entire lifetimes by devoted family members. Yet they \nhave never had a diagnosis beyond ``mental retardation.''\n  The need to raise the profile of Fragile X across our nation is \nclear. The impact of the current lack of understanding of this disorder \nis that all too often it is years before the diagnosis is made. As a \nresult, early intervention and treatment are delayed--treatment that \ncould help to mitigate the effects of the disorder.\n  We also hope that by raising awareness we can communicate the good \nnews about Fragile X. Now that scientists have identified the missing \nprotein that causes the disorder, there is hope for a cure. And because \nFragile X is the only single-gene disease known to directly impact \nhuman intelligence, understanding the disease can give us insight into \nhuman intelligence and learning and into dealing with other single gene \ndefects. Understanding Fragile X may also unlock some of the mysteries \nof autism, schizophrenia, and other neurological disorders. But we need \nto fund research efforts into this devastating disease.\n  Mr. President, this resolution seeks to raise awareness in both the \ngeneral population and the medical community about the presence and \neffects of Fragile X. By doing so, we hope to promote earlier diagnosis \nof the disease, more effective treatment, and support for research that \nwill one day lead to a cure.\n\n[[Page S1425]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1424-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1424-S1425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 268--DESIGNATING JULY 17 THROUGH JULY 23 AS \n                 ``NATIONAL FRAGILE X AWARENESS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Robb, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. \nKerrey) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

By doing so, we hope to promote earlier diagnosis \nof the disease, more effective treatment, and support for research that \nwill one day lead to a cure.\n\n[[Page S1425]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1425-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 269--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT \n   TO UNITED STATES RELATIONS WITH THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, GIVEN THE \n    RUSSIAN FEDERATION'S CONDUCT IN CHECHNYA, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. HELMS submitted the following resolution, which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 269\n\n       Whereas the Senate of the United States unanimously passed \n     Senate Resolution 262 on February 24th, 2000, to condemn the \n     indiscriminate use of force by the Government of the Russian \n     Federation against the people of Chechnya, to prompt peace \n     negotiations between the Government of the Russian Federation \n     and the Government of Chechnya led by elected President Aslan \n     Maskhadov, and to prompt the Government of the Russian \n     Federation to immediately grant international organizations \n     full and unimpeded access in Chechnya and the surrounding \n     regions so that they can provide much needed humanitarian \n     assistance and investigate alleged atrocities and war crimes;\n       Whereas the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate \n     received credible evidence and testimony reporting that \n     Russian forces in Chechnya caused the deaths of countless \n     thousands of innocent civilians; caused the displacement of \n     well over 250,000 innocents; forcibly relocated refugee \n     populations; and have committed widespread atrocities, \n     including summary executions, torture, and rape;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has \n     repeatedly violated the principles of the freedom of the \n     press by subjecting journalists, such as Radio Free Liberty/\n     Radio Europe correspondent Andrei Babitsky, who oppose or \n     question its policies to censorship, intimidation, \n     harassment, incarceration, and violence;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation continues \n     its military campaign in Chechnya, including the use of \n     indiscriminate force, causing further dislocation of people \n     from their homes, the deaths of noncombatants and widespread \n     suffering;\n       Whereas this war contributes to ethnic hatred and religious \n     intolerance within the Russian Federation, jeopardizes \n     prospects for the establishment of democracy in the Russian \n     Federation, undercuts the ability of the international \n     community to trust the Russian Federation as a signatory to \n     international agreements, generates political instability \n     within the Russian Federation, and is a threat to the peace \n     in the region; and\n       Whereas the Senate expresses its concern over the war and \n     humanitarian tragedy in Chechnya, and its desire for a \n     peaceful and durable settlement to the conflict: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the indifference of most Western governments, including \n     that of the United States, toward this conflict has \n     encouraged the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     intensify and expand its military campaign in Chechnya, \n     further contributing to the suffering of the Chechen people;\n       (2) the Acting President of the Russian Federation, \n     Vladimir Putin, is directly responsible for the conduct of \n     Russian troops in and around Chechnya and accountable for war \n     crimes and atrocities committed by them against the Chechen \n     people;\n       (3) the Acting President of the Russian Federation should--\n       (A) immediately cease the military operations in Chechnya \n     and initiate negotiations toward a just peace with the \n     leadership of the Chechen government, including President \n     Aslan Maskhadov;\n       (B) grant international missions immediate full and \n     unimpeded access into Chechnya and surrounding regions so \n     that they can monitor and report on the situation there and \n     investigate alleged atrocities and war crimes;\n       (C) allow international humanitarian agencies immediate \n     full and unimpeded access to Chechen civilians, including \n     those in refugee, detention and so-called ``filtration \n     camps'' or any other facility where citizens of Chechnya are \n     detained; and\n       (D) investigate fully the atrocities committed in Chechnya, \n     including those alleged in Alkhan-Yurt and Grozny, and \n     initiate prosecutions against officers and soldiers accused \n     of those atrocities;\n       (4) the President of the United States should--\n       (A) affirm respect for human rights, democratic rule of \n     law, and international accountability as a foundation of \n     United States foreign policy;\n       (B) affirm respect for human rights, democratic rule of \n     law, and international accountability as a precondition to \n     United States-Russian cooperation;\n       (C) reevaluate United States foreign policy toward the \n     Russian Federation given its conduct in Chechnya, \n     remilitarization, and questionable commitment to democracy;\n       (D) support societal forces in the Russian Federation \n     fighting to preserve democracy there, including empowering \n     human rights activists and promoting programs designed to \n     strengthen the independent media, trade unions, political \n     parties, civil society, and the democratic rule of law;\n       (E) promote peace negotiations between the Government of \n     the Russian Federation and the leadership of the Chechen \n     government, including President Aslan Maskhadov, through \n     third-party mediation by the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the United Nations, or other \n     appropriate parties;\n       (F) endorse the call of the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Human Rights for an investigation of alleged \n     war crimes committed by the Russian military in Chechnya; and\n       (G) take tangible steps to demonstrate to the Government of \n     the Russian Federation that the United States strongly \n     condemns its conduct in Chechnya and its unwillingness to \n     find a just political solution to the conflict in Chechnya, \n     including--\n       (i) a refusal to participate in bilateral summit meetings \n     with the Government of the Russian Federation;\n       (ii) a call for the suspension of the Russian Federation \n     from the forum of G-7 plus 1 state; and\n       (iii) a suspension of financial assistance to the Russian \n     Federation provided through the International Monetary Fund, \n     the World Bank, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, \n     and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation; and\n       (5) the President of the United States should not reverse \n     the actions taken under paragraph (4)(G) until the Government \n     of the Russian Federation has--\n       (A) ceased its military operations in Chechnya and \n     initiated negotiations toward a just peace with the \n     leadership of the Chechen government led by President Aslan \n     Maskhadov;\n       (B) provided full and unimpeded access into and around \n     Chechnya to international missions to monitor and report on \n     the situation there and to investigate alleged atrocities and \n     war crimes;\n       (C) granted international humanitarian agencies immediate \n     full and unimpeded access to Chechen civilians, including \n     those in refugee, detention, and so-called ``filtration \n     camps'' or any other facility where citizens of Chechnya are \n     detained;

Res. 271\n\n       Whereas the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission \n     on Human Rights in Geneva, Switzerland, provides a forum for \n     discussing human rights and expressing international support \n     for improved human rights performance;\n       Whereas in 1999, the Senate passed Senate Resolution 45 \n     urging the United States to introduce and make all necessary \n     efforts to pass a resolution condemning human rights \n     practices of the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     at the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission on \n     Human Rights in Geneva, Switzerland;\n       Whereas the United States thereafter introduced a \n     resolution condemning human rights practices of the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China at the annual \n     meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in \n     Geneva, Switzerland;\n       Whereas this resolution was kept off the agenda of the full \n     Commission by a ``no-action'' motion of the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China, had no cosponsors, and received \n     little support from European and other industrialized nations \n     and did not pass;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State and \n     international human rights organizations, the human rights \n     record of the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     has deteriorated sharply over the past year and authorities \n     of the People's Republic of China continue to commit \n     widespread and well-documented human rights abuses in China;\n       Whereas such abuses stem from an intolerance of dissent and \n     fear of civil unrest on the part of authorities in the \n     People's Republic of China and from a failure to adequately \n     enforce laws in the People's Republic of China that protect \n     basic freedoms;\n       Whereas such abuses violate internationally accepted norms \n     of conduct enshrined by the Universal Declaration of Human \n     Rights;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China has signed the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but has \n     yet to take the necessary steps to make it legally binding;\n       Whereas authorities in the People's Republic of China have \n     recently escalated efforts to extinguish expressions of \n     protest or criticism and have detained scores of citizens \n     associated with attempts to organize a legal democratic \n     opposition, as well as religious leaders, academics, and \n     members of minority groups;\n       Whereas these efforts underscore that the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China continues to commit serious human \n     rights abuses that must be condemned; and\n       Whereas the United States will again introduce a resolution \n     condemning human rights practices of the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China at the annual meeting of the \n     United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, \n     Switzerland, on March 20, 2000: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That (a) the Senate supports the decision of the \n     Administration to introduce a resolution at the 56th Session \n     of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, \n     Switzerland, calling upon the People's Republic of China to \n     end its human rights abuses.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that the United States \n     should make every effort necessary to pass such a resolution, \n     including through initiating high level contact between the \n     Administration and representatives of the European Union and \n     other governments, and ensuring that the resolution be placed \n     on the full United Nations Human Rights Commission's agenda \n     by aggressively enlisting support for the resolution and \n     soliciting cosponsorship of it by other governments.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am offering a resolution in \nsupport of the President's decision to introduce a China resolution at \nthe annual meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva on March \n20th and urging the President to make every effort necessary to pass \nit. This important resolution calls on China to end its human rights \nabuses.\n  The President must ensure that this resolution be placed on the \nagenda of the full Human Rights Commission. He must enlist support for \nthis resolution by other governments, especially by the European Union, \nand get them to cosponsor it. Year after year China has used a \nparliamentary tactic known as a ``no-action'' motion so that \nresolutions condemning its human rights abuses are struck down before \nthey are even placed on the agenda of the full Commission. We must not \nallow this to happen this year.\n  Last year the Senate passed a resolution urging the United States to \nintroduce a resolution condemning China's human rights practices at the \n1999 Geneva meeting. Although the administration introduced a \nresolution, it was kept off the agenda of the full Commission by a \n``no-action'' motion of China. It had no co-sponsors and received \nlittle support from European and other industrialized nations. The \nresolution did not pass because it didn't even come up.\n  This year the President announced in January his decision to again \nintroduce a resolution in Geneva condemning China's human rights \npractices. According to the Administration the goal of the resolution \nis to ``shine an international spotlight directly on China's human \nrights practices'' through ``international action.'' But, as of today, \nthere has been little international action. The resolution still has no \nco-sponsors.\n  When President Clinton formally delinked trade and human rights in \n1994, he pledged, on the record, that the US would ``step up its \nefforts, in cooperation with other states, to insist that the United \nNations Human Rights Commission pass a resolution dealing with the \nserious human rights abuses in China.'' While the U.S. has claimed an \nintention at least to speak out on human rights, the substance of US-\nChina relations--trade, military contacts, high level summits--go \nfoward while Chinese leaders continue to crack down on dissidents \nthroughout the country of over one billion.\n  The Chinese government continues to commit widespread abuses and has \ntaken actions that flagrantly violate the commitment it has made to \nrespect internationally-recognized human rights. Just this week Mary \nRichardson, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, announced that \nshe is deeply concerned about the deterioration in China's human rights \npractices. Mr. Shen Guofang, China's Deputy Representative at the \nUnited Nations said, ``China now has the best human rights situation in \nits history.'' This is unbelievable. Is the current system the best \nChina has to offer its own citizens? If this is so, this issue will \nremain a point of contention between China and the international \ncommunity.\n  In January, China convicted two of the last leaders of the Chinese \nDemocracy Party. These disgraceful arrests were part of a further \ncrackdown by the government on efforts to form the country's first \nopposition party. The arrests worked--they effectively obliterated the \nParty. But those fighting for democracy in China have not forgotten \nthose they have lost, and they continue to fight.\n  Chinese authorities blocked the delivery of foreign donations to help \nthe families of people killed in the crackdown on the Tiananmen student \ndemocracy movement. Mr. Lu Wenhe, a Chinese citizen who has lived in \nthe US for twenty years, was detained in Beijing on his way to meet a \nwoman whose 17-year-old son was shot dead by soldiers in 1989. Mr. Lu \nwas forced to sign over his check to an officer of the Shanghai State \nSecurity Bureau. Donors stopped payment on the check but Chinese \nauthorities continued to harass Mr. Lu's parents in Shanghai to come up \nwith the money or risk losing their apartment and car.\n  And China continues to limit freedom of information. In January \nChinese authorities arrested a scholar from Pennsylvania. Mr. Song, a \nlibrarian at Dickinson College and a scholar of China's cultural \nrevolution, was formally charged with ``the purchase and illegal \nprovision of intelligence to foreigners.'' He was held for over four \nmonths. The ``intelligence'' that he is charged with possessing were \ndocuments that were already published as part of a collection of \nhistorical materials relating to the Cultural Revolution. Nothing could \nbetter illustrate the Chinese authorities' determination to suppress \nhistory or thought than the arrest of a scholar engaged in historical \nresearch.\n  Since September, Beijing has arrested thousands of practitioners of \nFalun Gong and Zhong Gong, both popular spiritual movements, whose \nthreats to the regime are that they are not under the Party's control. \nPresident Zemin announced in January that crushing the Falum Gong \nmovement was one of the ``three major political struggles'' of 1999.\n  The Department of State's 1999 Country Reports on Human Rights \nPractices details an extraordinary amount of human rights violations. \nIn October a Falum Gong practitioner in Shandong died from being beaten \nwhile in police custody. The official media reported she had died from \na heart attack. According to Chinese authorities, two others who died \nin police custody jumped from a moving train. In March the Western \npress reported a 1997 case in which police executed four farmers in \nrural China over a monetary dispute.\n\n[[Page S1427]]\n\n  The arrested dissidents and their courageous supporters deserve our \nfull backing, and the administration's, in their historic struggle to \nbring democracy to China. In light of China's still deteriorating human \nrights record, I urge the administration to make all efforts necessary \nto pass its resolution in Geneva. Past experience has demonstrated \nthat, when the United States has applied sustained pressure, the \nChinese authorities have responded in ways that signal their \nwillingness to engage on the issue of human rights. This pressure needs \nto be exercised now.\n  By ensuring that this resolution be placed on the agenda of the full \nHuman Rights Commission, and enlisting support of the resolution and \nsoliciting cosponsors of it by other governments, the United States can \ntruly ``shine an international spotlight directly on China's human \nrights practices'' through ``international action,'' and not just pay \nit lip service. The US must demonstrate its true commitment to securing \nChina's adherence to human rights standards.\n  It is time for the United States to provide the leadership on which \nthe people of China depend. We must take action to get this important \nresolution passed. The UN Human Rights Commission is the major \ninternational body which oversees the human rights conditions of all \nstates. Getting this resolution placed on the agenda of the full Human \nRights Commission will foster substantive debate on human rights in \nChina and Tibet.\n  As Americans, we must take action and lead the international effort \nto condemn the human rights situation in China and Tibet. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in passing this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1427-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 272--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nUNITED STATES SHOULD REMAIN ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE TO \n    PROMOTE LONG-TERM PEACE, STABILITY, AND PROSPERITY; CONTINUE TO \n    VIGOROUSLY OPPOSE THE BRUTAL REGIME OF SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC WHILE \n    SUPPORTING THE EFFORTS OF THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION; AND FULLY \n                      IMPLEMENT THE STABILITY PACT\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 272\n\n       Whereas the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) \n     March 24, 1999 through June 10, 1999 bombing of the Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia focused the attention of the \n     international community on southeastern Europe;\n       Whereas the international community, in particular the \n     United States and the European Union, made a commitment at \n     the conclusion of the bombing campaign to integrate \n     southeastern Europe into the broader European community;\n       Whereas there is an historic opportunity for the \n     international community to help the people of southeastern \n     Europe break the cycle of violence, retribution, and revenge \n     and move towards respect for minority rights, establishment \n     of the rule of law, and the further development of democratic \n     governments;\n       Whereas the Stability Pact was established in July 1999 \n     with the goal of promoting cooperation among the countries of \n     southeastern Europe, with a focus on long-term political \n     stability and peace, security, democratization, and economic \n     reconstruction and development;\n       Whereas the effective implementation of the Stability Pact \n     is important to the long-term peace and stability in the \n     region;\n       Whereas the people and Government of the Former Yugoslav \n     Republic of Macedonia have a positive record of respect for \n     minority rights, the rule of law, and democratic traditions \n     since independence;\n       Whereas the people of Croatia have recently elected leaders \n     that respect minority rights, the rule of law, and democratic \n     traditions;\n       Whereas positive developments in the Former Yugoslav \n     Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Croatia will \n     clearly indicate to the people of Serbia that economic \n     progress and integration into the international community is \n     only possible if Milosevic is removed from power; and\n       Whereas the Republic of Slovenia continues to serve as a \n     model for the region as it moves closer to European Union and \n     NATO membership: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) welcomes the tide of democratic change in southeastern \n     Europe, particularly the free and fair elections in Croatia, \n     and the regional cooperation taking place under the umbrella \n     of the Stability Pact;\n       (2) recognizes that in this trend, the regime of Slobodan \n     Milosevic is ever more an anomaly, the only government in the \n     region not democratically elected, and an obstacle to peace \n     and neighborly relations in the region;\n       (3) expresses its sense that the United States cannot have \n     normal relations with Belgrade as long as the Milosevic \n     regime is in power;\n       (4) views Slobodan Milosevic as a brutal indicted war \n     criminal, responsible for immeasurable bloodshed, ethnic \n     hatred, and human rights abuses in southeastern Europe in \n     recent years;\n       (5) considers international sanctions an essential tool to \n     isolate the Milosevic regime and promote democracy, and urges \n     the Administration to intensify, focus, and expand those \n     sanctions that most effectively target the regime and its key \n     supporters;\n       (6) supports strongly the efforts of the Serbian people to \n     establish a democratic government and endorses their call for \n     early, free, and fair elections;\n       (7) looks forward to establishing a normal relationship \n     with a new democratic government in Serbia, which will permit \n     an end to Belgrade's isolation and the opportunity to restore \n     the historically friendly relations between the Serbian and \n     American people;\n       (8) expresses the readiness of the Senate, once there is a \n     democratic government in Serbia, to review conditions for \n     Serbia's full reintegration into the international community;\n       (9) expresses its readiness to assist a future democratic \n     government in Serbia to build a democratic, peaceful, and \n     prosperous society, based on the same principle of respect \n     for international obligations, as set out by the Organization \n     for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the United \n     Nations, which guide the relations of the United States with \n     other countries in southeastern Europe;\n       (10) calls upon the United States and other Western \n     democracies to publicly announce and demonstrate to the \n     Serbian people the magnitude of assistance they could expect \n     after democratization; and\n       (11) recognizes the progress in democratic and market \n     reform made by Montenegro, which can serve as a model for \n     Serbia, and urges a peaceful resolution of political \n     differences over the abrogation of Montenegro's rights under \n     the federal constitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1427-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1427-S1428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 273--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING MARCH 11, 2000, \n                    AS ``NATIONAL GIRL SCOUT WEEK''\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Hatch, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \nWarner, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Bond, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. \nHelms, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Craig, Mr. Domenici, and Ms. Collins) \nsubmitted the following resolution;

as follows:\n\n       On page 3, strike lines 2 through 16 and insert the \n     following:\n       (1) March 10, 2000 should be recognized as the Tibetan Day \n     of Commemoration in solemn remembrance of those Tibetans who \n     sacrificed, suffered, and died during the Lhasa uprising, and \n     in affirmation of the inherent rights of the Tibetan people \n     to determine their own future; and\n       (2) March 10, 2000 should serve as an occasion to renew \n     calls by the President, Congress, and other United States \n     Government officials on the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China to enter into serious negotiations with the \n     Dalai Lama or his representatives until such a time as a \n     peaceful solution, satisfactory to both sides, is achieved.\n       In the preamble, strike all the whereas clauses and insert \n     the following:\n       Whereas during the period of 1949-1950, the newly \n     established communist govenment of the People's Republic of \n     China sent an army to invade Tibet;\n       Whereas the Tibetan army was ill equipped and outnumbered, \n     and the People's Liberation Army overwhelmed Tibetan \n     defenses;\n       Whereas, on May 23, 1951, a delegation sent from the \n     capital city of Lhasa to Peking to negotiate with the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China was forced under \n     duress to accept a Chinese-drafted 17-point agreement that \n     incorporated Tibet into China but promised to preserve \n     Tibetan political, cultural, and religious institutions;\n       Whereas during the period of 1951-1959, the failure of the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China to uphold \n     guarantees to autonomy contained in the 17-Point Agreement \n     and the imposition of socialist reforms resulted in \n     widespread oppression and brutality;\n       Whereas on March 10, 1959, the people of Lhasa, fearing for \n     the life of the Dalai Lama, surrounded his palace, organized \n     a permanent guard, and called for the withdrawal of the \n     Chinese from Tibet and the restoration of Tibet's \n     independence;\n       Whereas on March 17, 1959, the Dalai Lama escaped in \n     disguise during the night after two mortar shells exploded \n     within the walls of his palace and, before crossing the \n     Indian border into exile two weeks later, repudiated the 17-\n     Point Agreement;\n       Whereas during the ``Lhasa uprising'' begun on March 10, \n     1959, Chinese statistics estimate 87,000 Tibetans were \n     killed, arrested, or deported to labor camps, and only a \n     small percentage of the thousands who attempted to escape to \n     India survived Chinese military attacks, malnutrition, cold, \n     and disease;\n       Whereas for the past forty years, the Dalai Lama has worked \n     in exile to find ways to allow Tibetans to determine the \n     future status of Tibet and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize \n     for his efforts in 1989;\n       Whereas it is the policy of the United States to support \n     substantive dialogue between the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China and the Dalai Lama or his representatives;\n       Whereas the State Department's 1999 Country Report on Human \n     Rights Practices finds that ``Chinese government authorities \n     continued to commit serious human rights abuses in Tibet, \n     including instances of torture, arbitrary arrest, detention \n     without public trial, and lengthy detention of Tibetan \n     nationalists for peacefully expressing their political or \n     religious views.'';\n       Whereas President Jiang Zemin pointed out in a press \n     conference with President Clinton on June 27, 1997, that if \n     the Dalai Lama recognizes that Tibet is an inalienable part \n     of China and Taiwan is a province of China, then the door to \n     negotiate is open;\n       Whereas all efforts by the U.S. and private parties to \n     enable the Dalai Lama to find a negotiated solution have \n     failed;\n       Whereas the Dalai Lama has specifically stated that he is \n     not seeking independence and is committed to finding a \n     negotiated solution within the framework enunciated by Deng \n     Xiaoping in 1979; and\n       Whereas China has signed but failed to ratify the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the \n     International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural \n     Rights: Now, therefore, be it\n\n       Amend the title of the resolution to read as follows: \n     ``Recognizing the plight of the Tibetan people on the forty-\n     first anniversary of Tibet's 1959 Lhasa uprising and calling \n     for serious negotiations between China and the Dalai Lama to \n     achieve a peaceful solution to the situation in Tibet.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1428-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARINGS\n\n\n subcommittee on national parks, historic preservation, and recreation\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.

SOCIAL SECURITY REPORTING IMPROVEMENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Social Security Advisory Board, the Technical Panel \n     on Assumptions and Methods of the Social Security Advisory \n     Board (in this section referred to as the ``Panel''), and the \n     Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security \n     Administration should be commended for their professional, \n     nonpartisan work to project the future financial operations \n     of the social security program established under title II of \n     the Social Security Act.\n       (2) The Panel reported its recommendations in November \n     1999.\n       (3) The Panel recommended a series of changes to current \n     projections of the financial operations of the social \n     security program which would, if adopted, increase existing \n     estimates of the program's unfunded liabilities.\n       (4) The Panel further recommended the use of standards of \n     comparison that emphasize program sustainability, such as \n     showing the program's projected annual income rates, cost \n     rates, and balances with an emphasis that is equal to 75-year \n     program solvency.\n       (5) The Panel further recommended that reform proposals be \n     evaluated using standards of comparison that include the \n     proposal's impact on the Federal unified budget, as well as a \n     recognition of the funding shortfalls present under current \n     law.\n       (6) The Panel made several other recommendations that are \n     worthy of consideration, involving issues that include, but \n     are not limited to, workforce participation, poverty rates \n     among the elderly, and assumptions regarding equity \n     investment returns.\n       (7) Adoption of the Panel's recommendations would assist in \n     developing a fiscally responsible reform solution that avoids \n     passing hidden costs to future taxpayers.\n       (b) Expansion of Annual Report of the Trustees of the \n     Social Security Trust Funds and Other Reporting \n     Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 201(c) of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 401(c)) is amended by inserting before the \n     penultimate sentence the following: ``Such report also shall \n     include the information described in subsection (n).''.\n       (2) Additional contents of board of trustees' report.--\n     Section 201 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(n) For purposes of subsection (c), the information \n     described in this subsection is the information (including \n     changes to information that, as of the date of enactment of \n     this subsection, is required to be included in the report \n     required under subsection (c)), recommended in the November \n     1999 report of the Technical Panel on Assumptions and Methods \n     of the Social Security Advisory Board under the headings \n     `Presentation Issues' and `Methodology', that the Board of \n     Trustees determines is practicable and appropriate to the \n     purposes of such report.

measures of the long-term sustainability \n     of the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance program \n     established under this title with an emphasis equal to \n     actuarial solvency, by highlighting the program's projected \n     annual income rates, cost rates, and annual balances \n     throughout the 75-year valuation window used by the Board of \n     Trustees.\n       ``(2) Presenting a clear and explicit projection of such \n     program's unfunded liabilities.\n       ``(3) Presenting benefit levels and tax rates throughout \n     the long-range valuation period that reflect the estimates \n     included in the report of the Board of Trustees of the Trust \n     Funds regarding the percentage of benefits that can be funded \n     under currently projected program revenues, and the \n     percentage that taxes would need to be increased in order to \n     fund promised benefits.''.\n       (3) Annual report from the commissioner of social \n     security.--Section 704 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     904) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n\n                      ``Annual Report to Congress\n\n

of the Treasury, and the Director of \n     the Office of Management and Budget, on the effects upon \n     national savings levels and on the fiscal operations of the \n     Federal Government of enacted provisions of law relating to \n     the Federal old-age, survivors, and disability insurance \n     benefits program established under title II.\n       ``(2) Estimates of average lifetime

of benefits that can \n     be funded under such enacted provisions of law.''.\n       (4) Effective date.--The amendments made by this subsection \n     shall apply with respect to reports made for calendar years \n     beginning after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Sense of Congress Regarding Social Security Reform \n     Legislation.--It is the sense of Congress that Congress and \n     the President should not miss a critical opportunity to enact \n     comprehensive bipartisan social security reform legislation \n     that meets the standard of 75-year actuarial solvency and \n     also addresses the following issues:\n       (1) The permanent sustainability of the social security \n     program.\n       (2) The long-term impact of reform upon the fiscal \n     operations of the Federal Government as a whole.\n       (3) The need for a clear and explicit presentation of the \n     anticipated reduction in the social security program's \n     unfunded liabilities.\n       (4) Ensured continued solvency under alternative \n     assumptions regarding mortality, fertility, rates of return, \n     and other appropriate economic and demographic assumptions.\n       (5) The total amount of retirement income provided under \n     proposed reform in comparison to a standard that explicitly \n     recognizes the benefit reductions or tax increases that \n     enacted provisions of law relating to the social security \n     program would require, according to the estimates in the most \n     recent report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age \n     and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and Federal Disability \n     Insurance Trust Fund.\n       (6) The long-term impact of the current projections of \n     insolvency and of alternative reform proposals upon workforce \n     participation, poverty among the elderly, national savings \n     levels, and other issues identified by the Panel.\n       (d) Sense of Congress Regarding Implementation of \n     Recommendations.--It is the sense of Congress that the \n     recommendations of the Panel should be implemented to the \n     extent deemed reasonable by the Board of Trustees of the \n     Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the \n     Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, in consultation with \n     the agencies and offices that have research, estimating, and \n     reporting responsibilities pertinent to the social security \n     program.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            amendment

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 273, \nsubmitted earlier by Senator Hutchison of Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 273) designating the week beginning \n     March 11, 2000, as ``National Girl Scout Week.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this year commemorates the 88th \nanniversary of the founding of this outstanding organization and \ndesignates the week of March 11, 2000 as National\n\n[[Page S1431]]\n\nGirl Scout week. I am joined in supporting this resolution by Senator \nMikulski and Senator Hatch.\n  On March 16, 1950, the Girl Scouts of the United States of America \nbecame the first national organization for girls to be granted a \nFederal charter by Congress.\n  The Girl Scout Organization has long been dedicated to inspiring \ngirls and young women with the highest ideals of character, conduct, \nand service to others to that they may become model citizens in their \ncommunities. It is not easy growing up, particularly in today's \nsociety. The Girl Scouts is one organization that has consistently \nguided young women in their formative years.\n  For 88 years, the Girl Scout movement has provided valuable \nleadership skills for countless girls and young women across the \nnation. Today, overall membership in the Girl Scouts is the highest it \nhas been in 26 years, with 2.7 million girls and over 850,000 adult \nvolunteers. I am proud to say that I, too, was a Girl Scout.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senator Mikulski in support of this \nlegislation which designates the week beginning March 11, 2000, as \n``National Girl Scout Week.'' I ask our colleagues to join us.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I proudly rise today to pay tribute to the \nGirl Scouts of the U.S.A. on the occasion of the 88th anniversary of \nits founding. To honor an organization that gives back so much to our \ncommunities, Congress has established March 12-18 as National Girl \nScout Week.\n  Created in 1912 by Juliette Gordon Law, the first Girl Scout group \nconsisted of only 18 girls. Since then, the Girl Scouts have evolved \ninto the largest voluntary organization for girls in the world. Nearly \n3.5 million active members strive toward excellence in character, \nconduct, patriotism and service--attributes that are vital to a young \nperson's development. The Girl Scouts have given direction to over 40 \nmillion American women throughout its rich 86-year history.\n  Girl Scouting empowers young women from every background with the \ntools they will need to be the outstanding leaders of the future. For \nexample, we all know about those famous Girl Scout cookies. I have \ncertainly enjoyed my fair share. Through their annual cookie sales, \ngirls learn valuable life lessons in goal setting, money management, \nand community involvement.\n  Of course, there is much more to scouting than the sale of cookies, \nsuch as the organization's long tradition of serving others without the \nexpectation of reward. Girls are encouraged to incorporate service into \ntheir lives, whether it takes the form of common, everyday acts around \nthe house or community service work outside the home. Instilled with \ncompassion for others, Girl Scouts head into the world as caring, \nvaluable members of society.\n  Additionally, I take this opportunity to commend the 850,000 adult \nvolunteers who serve as leaders for the Girl Scouts. Their devotion to \nproviding opportunities for girls to meet their potential is \nunparalleled. In my home state of Minnesota, nearly 20,000 volunteers \ndevote their time and energy to over 60,000 Girl Scouts. Clearly, \nwithout these dedicated volunteers, the Girl Scouts would not provide \nthe effective leadership it offers today.\n  For 88 years, the members and adult volunteers of the Girl Scouts of \nthe U.S.A. have worked tirelessly for the betterment of this nation. I \ncongratulate them on their achievements and wish for them a prosperous \nfuture as the Girl Scouts continue to nurture the lives of America's \nyoung women.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and any statements relating to the resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 273) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 273\n\n       Whereas March 12, 2000, is the 88th anniversary of the \n     founding of the Girl Scouts of the United States of America;\n       Whereas on March 16, 1950, the Girl Scouts of the United \n     States of America became the first national organization for \n     girls to be granted a Federal charter by Congress;\n       Whereas through annual reports required to be submitted to \n     Congress by its charter, the Girl Scouts of the United States \n     of America regularly informs Congress of its progress and \n     program initiatives;\n       Whereas the Girl Scouts of the United States of America is \n     dedicated to inspiring girls and young women with the highest \n     ideals of character, conduct, and service to others so that \n     they may become model citizens in their communities;\n       Whereas the Girl Scouts of the United States of America \n     offers girls aged 5 through 17 a variety of opportunities to \n     develop strong values and life skills and provides a wide \n     range of activities to meet girls' interests and needs;\n       Whereas the Girl Scouts of the United States of America has \n     a membership of nearly 3,000,000 girls and over 900,000 adult \n     volunteers, and is one of the preeminent organizations in the \n     United States committed to girls growing strong in mind, \n     body, and spirit; and\n       Whereas by fostering in girls and young women the qualities \n     on which the strength of the United States depends, the Girl \n     Scouts of the United States of America, for 88 years, has \n     significantly contributed to the advancement of the United \n     States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning March 11, 2000, as \n     ``National Girl Scout Week''; and\n       (2) requests the President to issue a proclamation \n     designating the week beginning March 11, 2000, as ``National \n     Girl Scout Week'' and calling on the people of the United \n     States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1431-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RESOLUTION INDEFINITELY POSTPONED--S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate new \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 440, S. 1653.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1653) to reauthorize and amend the National Fish \n     and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am pleased that the \nSenate today has unanimously passed S. 1653, a bill to reauthorize and \namend the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. The Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, which I chair, reported this bill, again \nunanimously, last month. At that time, I noted how important it was to \nget the local communities and businesses involved in protecting the \nenvironment.\n  The Foundation was created in 1984 because Congress saw the need to \ncreate a private, nonprofit organization that could build public-\nprivate partnerships and consensus, where previously there had only \nbeen acrimony and, many times, contentious litigation. It was also \nenvisioned that the Foundation would serve as an important tool in our \neffort to make a difference on the ground in communities throughout the \nUnited States. In its 16 years of existence the Foundation has more \nthan lived up to our original expectations.\n  We have long known that the Federal government does not have all the \nfinancial resources necessary to solve the numerous environmental \nproblems that exist in our country. We also know that local communities \ncare and know more about their natural environment than the agencies in \nWashington, D.C. More often than not local communities recognize \nproblems before they become environmental disasters that require \nsignificant amounts of money to resolve, if they can even be resolved. \nIn order to ensure that the funds are available to local communities \nthe Foundation has established something called ``challenge grants.''\n  ``Challenge grants'' are a mixture of federal and non-federal funds \ndirected to on-the-ground conservation projects. They are called \n``challenge grants'' because any grant awarded is expected to be \nmatched by non-federal dollars. During this time of fiscal constraint, \nit is important to use all available resources to help us protect the \nenvironment. Local communities, states, individuals, nonprofit \norganizations and\n\n[[Page S1432]]\n\nbusinesses can apply to the Foundation for a ``challenge grant'' for a \nspecific project in one of five major areas: conservation education, \nwetlands and private lands, neotropical bird conservation, fisheries \nconservation and management, and wildlife and habitat management.\n  Since 1984, the Foundation has raised over $305 million in private \ndonations using $135 million in Federal funds as leverage. Last year \nalone, they raised more than $50 million using $17 million of federal \nseed money. With these funds, the Foundation has financed more than \n3,500 conservation projects throughout the United States and in 35 \nother countries. This is an extremely impressive record. Moreover, all \nof the Foundation's operating costs are covered by private donations, \nwhich means that federal and private dollars given for conservation are \nspent only on conservation.\n  The Foundation's 1999 annual report was just released, and I \nencourage all my colleagues to take a look at the number of \npartnerships that the Foundation has forged with, and the range of \ninnovative projects that they have spearheaded. The organizations that \nthe Foundation works with are a virtual who's who in the business \nworld. Let me take a few minutes to discuss some of the projects they \nare currently working on.\n  The Foundation has pioneered some notable conservation programs, \nincluding implementing the North American Waterfowl Management plan, \nPartners in Flight for neotropical birds, Bring Back the Natives \nProgram, the Exxon Save the Tiger Fund, and the establishment of the \nConservation Plan for Sterling Forest in New York and New Jersey, to \nname a few.\n  The Shell Oil Company has pledged $5 million to the Foundation over \nthe next five years to create the Shell Marine Habitat Program, a \nmatching grant program. The Shell Marine Habitat Program supports \nproblem-solving habitat restoration projects, practical research, \neducation programs and innovative partnerships to preserve the Gulf of \nMexico and Gulf coast marine environments. Funding is focused on \nefforts to reduce hypoxia and red and brown tides, and to protect \nbarrier islands, coral reefs and other marine habitats. Last year alone \n$3.4 million were spent on these efforts, $3.15 million of which was \nfrom Shell and other private donors. More importantly, this project is \nreceiving a significant amount of local support. A day-long effort last \nyear to restore saltmarsh habitat had over 1,500 volunteers who planted \n57,000 plants. It is these kinds of efforts that will make a \nsignificant difference to the health of the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Another fine example is the Budweiser Outdoor Programs. For six weeks \nlast fall, a percentage of all bottles and cans of Budweiser sold was \nallocated for conservation purposes. The Foundation partnership with \nBudweiser resulted in more than a quarter of a million dollars that \nwill help conserve vital elk and deer habitat, enhance wetlands and \nsustain healthy upland game bird populations in the Rocky Mountains.\n  In New Hampshire the Foundation worked closely with local \norganizations to purchase a 60-acre conservation easement along the \nentire shoreline of Clarksville Pond. Clarksville Pond is a beautiful \narea located in the heart of the Northern Forest. The owners of this \nland own a small campground that they needed to make some improvements \nwhich they could not afford. The sale of a permanent public access \nconservation easement was one way the property owners could raise the \nnecessary funds without selling their land, and losing their \nlivelihood. This is a win-win situation for everyone involved. The \nproperty owners were able to keep their land, the public was granted \npermanent access to the pond, and this beautiful area will remain \nundeveloped.\n  As I said, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation has more than \nfulfilled the hopes of its original sponsors. It has helped to bring \ncooperative solutions to some difficult natural resource issues and is \nbecoming widely recognized for its innovative approach to solving \nenvironmental problems. I strongly support the Foundation's work and \nwant it to continue its important conservation efforts.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is quite simple. It makes three key \nchanges to current law. First, the bill would expand the Foundation's \ngoverning Board of Directors from 15 members to 25 members. This will \nallow a greater number of individuals with a strong interest in \nconservation to actively participate in, and contribute to, the \nFoundation's activities.\n  The bill's second key feature would expand the Foundation's \njurisdiction. Currently, the Foundation is only authorized to work with \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration. S. 1653 would authorize them to work with all agencies \nwithin the Department of the Interior and the Department of Commerce. \nMr. President, it is my view that the Foundation has an excellent track \nrecord, and all the agencies within the Departments of the Interior and \nCommerce should benefit from their knowledge and experience.\n  Finally, the bill would reauthorize appropriations to the Department \nof the Interior and the Department of Commerce through 2004.\n  Mr. President, last year this bill passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent, but unfortunately the House was unable to duplicate our \nefforts. I believe that this legislation will produce real conservation \nbenefits and I thank my colleagues for once again giving the bill their \nsupport.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the passage of \nS. 1653, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act \nAmendments, a bipartisan bill that will encourage cooperative \napproaches to wildlife conservation.\n  By way of background, in 1984, with broad bipartisan support, \nCongress created the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, a nonprofit \ncorporation with the mission of conserving our nation's fish, wildlife, \nplant, and other natural resources.\n  Over the past 15 years, the Foundation has established a solid track \nrecord. It has achieved on-the-ground results. it has also stretched \nfederal dollars and built public-private partnerships essential to \nconservation efforts. All told, the Foundation has provided more than \n3,500 grants to over 940 private local organizations, state and country \ngovernments, tribes, federal and interstate agencies, and colleges and \nuniversities in all 50 states.\n  By requiring grantees to match Foundation grants with non-federal \nfunds, the $135 million in federal funds invested by the Foundation \nhave been leveraged to deliver more than $440 million to natural \nresource conservation efforts. Significantly, these funds are used to \nhelp build public-private partnerships among individual landowners, \ngovernment and tribal agencies, conservation organizations, and \nbusiness. The result is the development of consensus, locally-driven \nsolutions to the challenges involved in protecting and managing fish, \nwildlife, plants, and other natural resources.\n  In my home state of Montana, where fishing, hunting, and the \nenjoyment of our natural resources are deeply ingrained into our way of \nlife, the Foundation has made important contributions to conservation \nefforts. These contributions include supporting environmental \neducation, habitat restoration and protection, resource management, and \nthe development of conservation policy.\n  In 2000, the Foundation will support nine important projects in \nMontana, for a total $821,700. These projects include restoring arctic \ngrayling within their historic range in the upper Missouri River basin; \nimproving trout passage through the Milltown Dam to assist fluvial \nwestslope cutthroat and bull trout moving upstream to spawn; supporting \nthe Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee; supporting a comprehensive K \nthru 12 environmental education program for 300 Bitterroot Valley \nstudents; and partnerships with private landowners to conserve \nMontana's shortgrass prairie habitat and the bird species it supports.\n  Let me describe one of these efforts in a little more detail. In \nNorthwest Montana, westslope cutthroat and bull trout have declined \nthroughout their historic range over the last 100 years, in part \nbecause of barriers that limit their spawning migrations.\n  To address this problem, the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and \nParks, working with the Blackfoot Chapter of Trout Unlimited will \ncapture, tag, and transport mature\n\n[[Page S1433]]\n\nwestslope cutthroat and bull trout around Milltown Dam near Missoula \nand release them upstream of the dam so the fish can continue their \nspawning migration in the upper Clark Fork watershed (including the \nBlackfork River and its tributaries, and the Rock Creek drainage). \nRadio transmitters will be implanted in the fish to monitor their \nspawning sites and success.\n  This is just one example. Over the years, the Foundation has funded \n187 projects and delivered a total of almost $13 million to \nconservation projects in Montana.\n  Mr. President, even with these accomplishments, the need to conserve \nthe nation's natural resources remains. Today, in too many areas of the \ncountry, the health and sustainability of fish, wildlife, and plants, \nand the habitats on which they depend, are threatened. Bitter disputes \ncontinue to arise among interests when solutions to difficult natural \nresource problems are sought. Tight budgets often severely limit the \nability of governments and private entities to adequately address \nconservation challenges. Because of all these factors, the Foundation, \nwhich promotes conservation by building partnerships and consensus, is \nas important today as it was in 1984.\n  The bill we are considering, the National Fish and Wildlife \nFoundation Establishment Act Amendments, will increase the Foundation's \nability to carry out its mission. First and foremost, the legislation \nauthorizes federal appropriations through 2004 to support the \nFoundation's work. The legislation also strengthens the Foundation by \nincreasing the size of its board of directors and allowing board \nmembers to be removed for nonperformance. Finally, the bill broadens \nthe Foundation's authority by allowing it to work with all agencies \nwithin the Departments of Interior and Commerce.\n  The legislation is nearly identical to legislation the Senate passed \nlast year.\n  Mr. President, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation has provided \nvaluable assistance to this nation's natural resource conservation \nefforts over the past 15 years. If the legislation we are considering \ntoday is enacted, I have no doubt that the Foundation will continue its \nsolid record of accomplishment. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1653) was read a third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1653\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 60) recognizing the plight of the \n     Tibetan people on the 40th anniversary of Tibet's attempt to \n     restore its independence and calling for serious negotiations \n     between China and the Dalai Lama to achieve a peaceful \n     solution to the situation in Tibet.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, S. Res. 60, makes March 10, 2000 the Tibetan \nDay of Commemoration. This marks the forty-first anniversary of the \n1959 Lhasa uprising over the course of which over 87,000 Tibetans were \nkilled, arrested, or deported to labor camps by the People's Liberation \nArmy. So tomorrow, we honor the memory of the\n\n[[Page S1435]]\n\nmore than 87,000 Tibetans who struggled for the preservation of Tibet. \nWe also honor the 6 million Tibetans today who keep alive the hope of \nfreedom in Tibet and the tens of thousands of exiles who hope to return \nhome.\n  The Dalai Lama of Tibet has issued a statement for this anniversary \nwhich I would ask unanimous consent appear in the record immediately \nfollowing my remarks. My distinguished colleague from California, \nSenator Feinstein, has also issued a statement in favor of this \nresolution and commemorating the 41st anniversary of the Lhasa \nuprising.\n  From 1949, when the new communist government in Beijing sent an army \nto invade Tibet, through to the present, Tibet has been a victim of PLA \ntyranny, oppression, and cultural genocide. Unfortunately, there has \nbeen no respite from persecution over the past year and Tibetans in the \nworld today are facing the very real and unfortunate threat of seeing \ntheir homeland and culture obliterated. According to the most recent \nState Department Report on Human Rights, ``Chinese government \nauthorities continued to commit serious human rights abuses in Tibet, \nincluding instances of torture, arbitrary arrest, detention without \npublic trial, and lengthy detention of Tibetan nationalists for \npeacefully expressing their political or religious views.'' Things \ncontinue to get worse in Tibet, and this resolution recognizes their \nongoing struggle with the PRC.\n  President Clinton has demonstrated an interest in Tibet and has \nspoken to President Jiang Zemin both privately and publicly, urging him \nto begin serious negotiations with the Dalai Lama. I urge President \nClinton in the final months of his administration to match his rhetoric \nwith actions and do what he can to get negotiations started between the \nDalai Lama and the People's Republic of China.\n  I am pleased that we have acted today to formally recognize the \ncontinual denial of basic rights to the people of Tibet and to \nencourage a peaceful resolution between China and the Dalai Lama, or \nhis representatives, as an entire body. We can agree unanimously and in \na bipartisan manner that there should be a peaceful resolution to this \nsituation and that this Senate can stand united in our support for the \nTibetan people, the preservation of their culture, and the right for \nthem to negotiate peacefully for an end to over 50 years of brutal rule \nby the PRC.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement of the Dalai \nLama be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement of His Holiness the Dalai Lama on the Occasion of the 41st \n      Anniversary of the Tibetan National Uprising March 10, 2000\n\n       My sincere greetings to my fellow countrymen in Tibet as \n     well as in exile and to our friends and supporters all over \n     the world on the occasion of the 41st anniversary of the \n     Tibetan National Uprising Day of 1959.\n       We are at the beginning of the 21st century. If we look at \n     the events that took place in the 20th century mankind made \n     tremendous progress in improving our material well-being. At \n     the same time, there was massive destruction, both in terms \n     of human lives and physical structures as peoples and nations \n     sought recourse to confrontation instead of dialogue to \n     resolve bilateral and multilateral problems. The 20th century \n     was therefore in a way a century of war and bloodshed. I \n     believe that we have learned valuable lessons through these \n     experiences. It is clear that any solution resulting from \n     violence or confrontation is not lasting. I firmly believe \n     that it is only through peaceful means that we can develop \n     better understanding between ourselves. We must make this new \n     century a century of peace and dialogue.\n       We commemorate this March 10th anniversary at a time when \n     the state of affairs of our freedom struggle is complex and \n     multifarious, yet the spirit of resistance of our people \n     inside Tibet continues to increase. It is also encouraging to \n     note that worldwide support for our cause is increasing. \n     Unfortunately, on the part of Beijing there is an evident \n     lack of political will and courage to address the issue of \n     Tibet sensibly and pragmatically through dialogue.\n       Right from the beginning, ever since the time of our exile, \n     we have believed in hoping for the best but preparing for the \n     worst. In this same spirit, we have tried our best to reach \n     out to the Chinese government to bring about a process of \n     dialogue and reconciliation for many years. We have also been \n     building bridges with our overseas Chinese brothers and \n     sisters, including those in Taiwan, and to enhance \n     significantly mutual understanding, respect and solidarity. \n     At the same time we have continued with our work of \n     strengthening the base of our exiled community by creating \n     awareness about the true nature of the Tibetan struggle, \n     preserving Tibetan values, promoting nonviolence, augmenting \n     democracy and expanding the network of our supporters \n     throughout the world.\n       It is with great sadness I report that the human rights \n     situation in Tibet today has taken a critical turn in recent \n     years. The ``strike hard'' and ``patriotic re-education'' \n     campaigns against Tibetan religion and patriotism have \n     intensified with each passing year. In some spheres of life \n     we are witnessing the return of an atmosphere of \n     intimidation, coercion and fear, reminiscent of the days of \n     the Cultural Revolution. In 1999 alone there have been six \n     known cases of deaths resulting from torture and abuse. \n     Authorities have expelled a total of 1,432 monks and nuns \n     from their monasteries and nunneries for refusing to either \n     oppose Tibetan freedom or to denounce me. There are 615 known \n     and documented Tibetan political prisoners in Tibet. Since \n     1996, a total of 11,409 monks and nuns have been expelled \n     from their places of worship and study. It is obvious that \n     there has been little change with regard to China's \n     ruthless political objective in Tibet since the early \n     sixties when the late Panchen Lama, who personally \n     witnessed Communist China's occupation of Tibet from the \n     50s to the beginning of the 60s, wrote his famous 70,000 \n     character petition. Even today the present young \n     reincarnate Panchen Lama is under virtual house arrest, \n     making him the youngest political prisoner in the world. I \n     am deeply concerned about this.\n       The most alarming trend in Tibet is the flood of Chinese \n     settlers who continue to come to Tibet to take advantage of \n     Tibet's opening to market capitalism. This along with the \n     widespread disease of prostitution, gambling and karaoke \n     bars, which the authorities quietly encourage, is undermining \n     the traditional social norms and moral values of the Tibetan \n     people. These, more than brute force, are successful in \n     reducing the Tibetans to a minority in their own country and \n     alienating them from their traditional beliefs and values.\n       This sad state of affairs in Tibet does nothing to \n     alleviate the suffering of the Tibetan people or to bring \n     stability and unity to the People's Republic of China. If \n     China is seriously concerned about unity, she must make \n     honest efforts to win over the hearts of the Tibetans and not \n     attempt to impose her will on them. It is the responsibility \n     of those in power, who rule and govern, to ensure that \n     policies towards all its ethnic groups are based on equality \n     and justice in order to prevent separation. Though lies and \n     falsehood may deceive people temporarily and the use of force \n     may control human beings physically, it is only through \n     proper understanding, fairness and mutual respect that human \n     beings can be genuinely convinced and satisfied.\n       The Chinese authorities see the distinct culture and \n     religion of Tibet as the principal cause for separation. \n     Accordingly, there is an attempt to destroy the integral core \n     of the Tibetan civilization and identity. New measures of \n     restrictions in the fields of culture, religion and education \n     coupled with the unabated influx of Chinese immigrants to \n     Tibet amount to a policy of cultural genocide.\n       It is true that the root cause of the Tibetan resistance \n     and freedom struggle lies in Tibet's long history, its \n     distinct and ancient culture, and its unique identity. The \n     Tibetan issue is much more complex and deeper than the simple \n     official version Beijing upholds. History is history and no \n     one can change the past. One cannot simply retain what one \n     wants and abandon what one does not want. It is best left to \n     historians and legal experts to study the case objectively \n     and make their own judgements. In matters of history \n     political decisions are not necessary. I am therefore looking \n     towards the future.\n       Because of lack of understanding, appreciation and respect \n     for Tibet's distinct culture, history and identity China's \n     Tibet policies have been consistently misguided. In occupied \n     Tibet there is little room for truth. The use of force and \n     coercion as the principal means to rule and administer Tibet \n     compel Tibetans to lie out of fear and local officials to \n     hide the truth and create false facts in order to suit and to \n     please Beijing and its stewards in Tibet. As a result China's \n     treatment of Tibet continues to evade the realities in Tibet. \n     This approach is shortsighted and counter-productive. \n     These policies are narrow-minded and reveal the ugly face \n     of racial and cultural arrogance and a deep sense of \n     political insecurity. The development concerning the \n     flights of Agya Rinpoche, the Abbot of Kumbum Monastery, \n     and more recently Karmapa Rinpoche are cases in point. \n     However, the time has passed when in the name of national \n     sovereignty and integrity a state can continue to apply \n     such ruthless policies with impunity and escape \n     international condemnation. Moreover, the Chinese people \n     themselves will deeply regret the destruction of Tibet's \n     ancient and rich cultural heritage. I sincerely believe \n     that our rich culture and spirituality not only can \n     benefit millions of Chinese but can also enrich China \n     itself.\n       It is unfortunate that some leaders of the People's \n     Republic of China seem to be hoping for the Tibetan issue to \n     disappear with the passage of time. Such thinking on the part \n     of the Chinese leaders is to repeat the miscalculations made \n     in the past. Certainly, no\n\n[[Page S1436]]\n\n     Chinese leader would have thought back in 1949/50 and then in \n     1959 that in 2000 China would still be grappling with the \n     issue of Tibet. The old generation of Tibetans has gone, a \n     second and a third generation of Tibetans have emerged. \n     Irrespective of the passage of time the freedom struggle of \n     the Tibetan people continues with undiminished determination. \n     It is clear that this is not a struggle for the cause of one \n     man nor is it that of one generation of Tibetans. It is \n     therefore obvious that generations of Tibetans to come will \n     continue to cherish, honor and commit themselves to this \n     freedom struggle. Sooner or later, the Chinese leadership \n     will have to face this fact.\n       The Chinese leaders refuse to believe that I am not seeking \n     separation but genuine autonomy for the Tibetans. They are \n     quite openly accusing me of lying. They are free to come and \n     visit our communities in exile to find out the truth for \n     themselves.\n       It has been my consistent endeavor to find a peaceful and \n     mutually acceptable solution to the Tibetan problem. My \n     approach envisages that Tibet enjoy genuine autonomy within \n     the framework of the People's Republic of China. Such a \n     mutually beneficial solution would contribute to the \n     stability and unity of China--their two topmost priorities--\n     while at the same time the Tibetans would be ensured of the \n     basic right to preserve their own civilization and to protect \n     the delicate environment of the Tibetan plateau.\n       In the absence of any positive response from the Chinese \n     government to my overtures over the years, I am left with no \n     alternative but to appeal to the members of the international \n     community. It is clear now that only increased and concerted \n     international efforts will persuade Beijing to change its \n     policy on Tibet. In spite of immediate negative reactions \n     from the Chinese side, I strongly believe that such \n     expressions of international concern and support are \n     essential for creating an environment conducive for the \n     peaceful resolution of the Tibetan problem. On my part, I \n     remain committed to the process of dialogue. It is my firm \n     belief that dialogue and a willingness to look with honesty \n     and clarity at the reality of Tibet can lead us to a viable \n     solution.\n       I would like to take this opportunity to thank the numerous \n     individuals, governments, members of parliaments, non-\n     governmental organizations and various religious orders for \n     their support. The sympathy and support shown to our cause by \n     a growing number of well-informed Chinese brothers and \n     sisters is of special significance and a great encouragement \n     to us Tibetans. I also wish to convey my greetings and \n     express my deep sense of appreciation to our supporters all \n     over the world who are commemorating this anniversary today. \n     Above all I would like to express on behalf of the Tibetans \n     our gratitude to the people and the Government of India for \n     their unsurpassed generosity and support during these past \n     forty years of our exile.\n       With my homage to the brave men and women of Tibet who have \n     died for the cause of our freedom, I pray for an early end to \n     the sufferings of our people.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an amendment \nat the desk to the resolution be agreed to, the resolution, as amended, \nbe agreed to, the amendment to the preamble be agreed to, and the \npreamble, as amended, be agreed to, the title amendment be agreed to, \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and, finally, any \nstatements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2884) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2884\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a complete substitute)\n\n       On page 3, strike lines 2 through 16 and insert the \n     following:\n       (1) March 10, 2000 should be recognized as the Tibetan Day \n     of Commemoration in solemn remembrance of those Tibetans who \n     sacrificed, suffered, and died during the Lhasa uprising, and \n     in affirmation of the inherent rights of the Tibetan people \n     to determine their own future; and\n       (2) March 10, 2000 should serve as an occasion to renew \n     calls by the President, Congress, and other United States \n     Government officials on the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China to enter into serious negotiations with the \n     Dalai Lama or his representatives until such a time as a \n     peaceful solution, satisfactory to both sides, is achieved.\n       In the preamble, strike all the whereas clauses and insert \n     the following:\n       Whereas during the period 1949-1950, the newly established \n     communist government of the People's Republic of China sent \n     an army to invade Tibet;\n       Whereas the Tibetan army was ill equipped and outnumbered, \n     and the People's Liberation Army overwhelmed Tibetan \n     defenses;\n       Whereas, on May 23, 1951, a delegation sent from the \n     capital city of Lhasa to Peking to negotiate with the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China was forced under \n     duress to accept a Chinese-drafted 17-point agreement that \n     incorporated Tibet into China but promised to preserve \n     Tibetan political, cultural, and religious institutions;\n       Whereas during the period of 1951-1959, the failure of the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China to uphold \n     guarantees to autonomy contained in the 17-Point Agreement \n     and the imposition of socialist reforms resulted in \n     widespread oppression and brutality;\n       Whereas on March 10, 1959, the people of Lhasa, fearing for \n     the life of the Dalai Lama, surrounded his palace, organized \n     a permanent guard, and called for the withdrawal of the \n     Chinese from Tibet and the restoration of Tibet's \n     independence;\n       Whereas on March 17, 1959, the Dalai Lama escaped in \n     disguise during the night after two mortar shells exploded \n     within the walls of his palace and, before crossing the \n     Indian border into exile two weeks later, repudiated the 17-\n     Point Agreement;\n       Whereas during the `Lhasa uprising' begun on March 10, \n     1959, Chinese statistics estimate 87,000 Tibetans were \n     killed, arrested, or deported to labor camps, and only a \n     small percentage of the thousands who attempted to escape to \n     India survived Chinese military attacks, malnutrition, cold, \n     and disease;\n       Whereas for the past forty years, the Dalai Lama has worked \n     in exile to find ways to allow Tibetans to determine the \n     future status of Tibet and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize \n     for his efforts in 1989;\n       Whereas it is the policy of the United States to support \n     substantive dialogue between the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China and the Dalai Lama or his representatives;\n       Whereas the State Department's 1999 Country Report on Human \n     Rights Practices finds that ``Chinese government authorities \n     continued to commit serious human rights abuses in Tibet, \n     including instances of torture, arbitrary arrest, detention \n     without public trial, and lengthy detention of Tibetan \n     nationalists for peacefully expressing their political or \n     religious views.'';\n       Whereas President Jiang Zemin pointed out in a press \n     conference with President Clinton on June 27, 1997, that if \n     the Dalai Lama recognizes that Tibet is an inalienable part \n     of China and Taiwan is a province of China, then the door to \n     negotiate is open;\n       Whereas all efforts by the U.S. and private parties to \n     enable the Dalai Lama to find a negotiated solution have \n     failed;\n       Whereas the Dalai Lama has specifically stated that he is \n     not seeking independence and is committed to finding a \n     negotiated solution within the framework enunciated by Deng \n     Xiaoping in 1979; and\n       Whereas China has signed but failed to ratify the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the \n     International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural \n     Rights: Now, therefore, be it\n       Amend the title of the resolution to read as follows: \n     ``Recognizing the plight of the Tibetan people on the forty-\n     first anniversary of Tibet's 1959 Lhasa uprising and calling \n     for serious negotiations between China and the Dalai Lama to \n     achieve a peaceful solution to the situation in Tibet.''.\n\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 95\n\n       Whereas on March 16, 1988, Saddam Hussein attacked the \n     Iraqi Kurdish city of Halabja with chemical weapons, \n     including nerve gas, VX, and mustard gas;\n       Whereas more than 5,000 men, women, and children were \n     murdered in Halabja by Saddam Hussein's chemical warfare, in \n     gross violation of international law;\n       Whereas the attack on Halabja was part of a systemic, \n     genocidal attack on the Kurds of Iraq known as the ``Anfal \n     Campaign'';\n       Whereas the Anfal Campaign resulted in the death of more \n     than 180,000 Iraqi Kurdish men, women, and children;\n       Whereas, despite the passage of 12 years, there has been no \n     successful attempt by the United States, the United Nations, \n     or other bodies of the international community to bring the \n     perpetrators of the Halabja massacre to justice;\n       Whereas the Senate and the House of Representatives have \n     repeatedly noted the atrocities committed by the Saddam \n     Hussein regime;\n       Whereas the Senate and the House of Representatives have on \n     16 separate occasions called upon successive Administrations \n     to work toward the creation of an International Tribunal to \n     prosecute the war crimes of the Saddam Hussein regime;\n       Whereas in successive fiscal years monies have been \n     authorized to create a record of the human rights violations \n     of the Saddam Hussein regime and to pursue the creation of an \n     international tribunal and the indictment of Saddam Hussein \n     and members of his regime;\n       Whereas the Saddam Hussein regime continues the brutal \n     repression of the people of Iraq, including the denial of \n     basic human, political, and civil rights to Sunni, Shiite, \n     and Kurdish Iraqis, as well as other minority groups;\n       Whereas the Secretary General of the United Nations has \n     documented annually the failure of the Saddam Hussein regime \n     to deliver basic necessities to the Iraqi people despite \n     ample supplies of food in Baghdad warehouses;\n       Whereas the Saddam Hussein regime has at its disposal more \n     than $12,000,000,000 per annum (at current oil prices) to \n     expend on all categories of human needs;\n       Whereas, notwithstanding a complete lack of restriction on \n     the purchase of food by the Government of Iraq, infant \n     mortality rates in areas controlled by Saddam Hussein remain \n     above pre-war levels, in stark contrast to rates in United \n     Nations-controlled Kurdish areas, which are below pre-war \n     levels; and\n       Whereas it is unconscionable that after the passage of 12 \n     years the brutal Saddam Hussein dictatorship has gone \n     unpunished for the murder of hundreds of thousands of \n     innocent Iraqis, the use of banned chemical weapons on the \n     people of Iraqi Kurdistan, and innumerable other human rights \n     violations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) commemorates the suffering of the people of Halabja and \n     all the victims of the Anfal Campaign;\n       (2) condemns the Saddam Hussein regime for its continued \n     brutality towards the Iraqi people;\n       (3) strongly urges the President to act forcefully within \n     the United Nations and the United Nations Security Council to \n     constitute an international tribunal for Iraq;\n       (4) calls upon the President to move rapidly to efficiently \n     use funds appropriated by Congress to create a record of the \n     crimes of the Saddam Hussein regime;\n       (5) recognizes that Saddam Hussein's record of brutality \n     and belligerency threaten both the people of Iraq and the \n     entire Persian Gulf region; and\n       (6) reiterates that it should be the policy of the United \n     States to support efforts to remove the regime headed by \n     Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the \n     emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime, \n     as set forth in Public Law 105-338.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/09/senate-section/article/S1437-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE KOREAN WAR AND THE SERVICE BY \n                      MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. GRAMS.
