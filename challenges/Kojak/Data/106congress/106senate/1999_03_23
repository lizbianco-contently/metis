The time until 12:30 p.m. shall be equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees on the Lott \namendment No. 124.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it appears that we are on the verge of \nsending American warplanes to bomb Serbian installations in and around \nKosovo in an effort to force Yugoslav President Milosevic to accept the \nterms of a peace agreement that he has, so far, rejected. I stand on \nthe floor of the Senate to express my strong opposition to this policy \nand warn the Administration that the United States may be blindly \nheading into a war whose outcome is far from pre-determined.\n  Mr. President, I believe the President has failed to articulate a \nrationale to the American people that can justify an act of war by NATO \nagainst Serbia. Nor do I believe that the Administration has \ndemonstrated what vital interest justifies armed intervention.\n  When the President originally announced his plan to send 4,000 \nAmerican soldiers to Kosovo as part of a larger NATO force, it was \npremised on the idea that the troops would be deployed, as in Bosnia, \nas a peacekeeping force. I had serious concerns about this commitment \nbecause it was not clear to me whether American troops would be \nstationed in Kosovo for a month, for a year, or for a decade. Nor did I \nbelieve that it was in our national interest to participate in this \noperation because I do not believe there is any vital interest of the \nUnited States that is at stake in this civil war. And I emphasize \n``civil war.''\n\n[[Page S3066]]\n\n  Mr. President, the peacekeeping commitment was made several weeks \nago. In the intervening period, one thing has happened. There is no \npeace to keep.\n  Although the rebels in Kosovo have agreed to the terms of a peace \nagreement, the Yugoslavian government has rejected the terms of the \nagreement in part because it rejects the idea of having NATO troops \npolice its sovereign territory in Kosovo.\n  Having failed to negotiate a peace agreement, the Administration has \nnow changed its strategy. We are fueling up our warplanes, targeting \nour cruise missiles, and planning to launch air strikes against the \nSerbs in an effort to force Milosevic to accept the peace agreement. \nNever mind that the peace agreement he is being asked, or forced, to \naccept--could allow for the independent future of a province within his \ncountry.\n\n  Yes, Mr. President, this is an intervention by the United States in a \ncivil war where rebels in one province seek independence. And by \nchoosing to bomb the Serbians, we have directly taken the side of the \nKosovo rebels.\n  Make no mistake, our air strikes against Serbian forces are strongly \nsupported by the Kosovo rebels who have been fighting for independence. \nAnd by backing the rebels, the bombing will encourage the independence \nmovement with the prospect that the borders of Kosovo and Albania \nultimately will be redrawn along ethnic lines. Is that what our goal \nis? To break up a country?\n  Mr. President, American airstrikes are not going to be a cakewalk by \nany means. We have already been advised of this by our military.\n  The terrain in this area is heavily fortified with anti-aircraft \nemplacements. What will happen if American airmen are shot down by \nsurface to air missiles? What happens if our bombing campaign does not \nforce Milosevic to change his posture, just as our near-daily air \nstrikes have done nothing to Saddam Hussein.\n  Are we willing to send in ground combat troops to convince Milosevic \nto accept the terms of the peace agreement? How many? 50,000? 100,000? \n200,000? If we are unwilling to commit ground troops to force the terms \nof this so-called peace agreement, then I believe we should not commit \na single American pilot.\n  Mr. President, I am sympathetic to the people in Kosovo who have been \nbrutalized by Milosovic, just as my sympathy has run deep for the \npeople throughout Yugoslavia who have known nothing but war for over a \ngeneration. But is our opposition to Milosevic reason enough to \nsacrifice American lives to an undefined cause? Milosovic is a \nterrorist; he is a killer. We should bring him to justice for crimes \nagainst humanity; but we should not engage in a war which will cost \nAmerican lives and continue indefinitely.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would simply remind my colleagues that from \nthe outset I have been concerned that American involvement in Kosovo \nwould become another Bosnia. I take it back. Knowing what I know now \nabout the region, about the opposition, I am concerned that it will not \nbe like Bosnia--and that many American lives will be lost in the \nprocess of enforcing an undefined objective.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I am pleased to yield to my \nfriend from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering S. 544, and the Lott \namendment, No. 124, is under consideration at this point in time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Is also the Smith-Craig amendment to the Lott amendment in \norder, or is the appropriate order at this time the Lott-Hutchison \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is under the impression that the \nSenator's language is incorporated into the Lott amendment, and, \ntherefore, it would be prudent to debate that language at this time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I am here to join my colleague from Alaska and others \nwho have spoken with great concern about the situation in Kosovo, and \nas it transpires, some of our feelings and concerns about what this \ncountry might do, and most importantly, what this country should not \ndo.\n  The Presiding Officer and I, on a weekly basis, engage ourselves in a \ntelephone/radio conversation with a news program in Boise, ID. I was \ninvolved in that program yesterday morning, speaking about the \natrocities in Kosovo, when I used the expression ``human hatred.'' This \nis not a difference in policy. This is not even a difference between \nSerbia and Kosovo in territory. This is a difference spelled out by 300 \nyears of hatred, hatred that had boiled up out of differences of \nreligious beliefs, and it is a hatred that has prevailed in the region \nso long and had cost so many lives that it is almost incalculable. \nCertainly in this American's mind it is. I have never known hatred of \nthat kind.\n  After that radio conversation was over, the emcee of that program \nasked if I would stay on the line and we visited privately. He \nreflected to me about how he and his wife had in their home an exchange \nstudent from Serbia. He said, ``You know, Senator Craig, you were \nabsolutely right to use the term `hate.' '' He said, ``When we broached \nthis subject with this young exchange student,'' I believe a junior in \nhigh school, he said, ``we were astounded by the hatred that rolled up \nout of this young man. Because he believed that the only solution to \nthe problem in Kosovo was to kill the Kosovars or to simply run them \nout of the country, and that if his forefathers had done that, they \nwould have a peaceful nation today, and the only solution for peace in \ngreater Serbia was just that.''\n  That is exactly what Milosevic is doing as we speak. The term, for \ndiplomatic reasons, is ``ethnic cleansing.'' It is quite simple, what \nit is. It is: Either get out of my way or I'll kill you; or get out of \nmy country or I'll kill you, even though the country you are being \nasked to leave has been your country for 4, 5, 6, 10--20 generations \nbefore you.\n\n  I think the current Presiding Officer and I would be hard put if \nsomebody said: Idaho is not your home and you have to leave or we will \nkill you. That is what we are caught up in, those kinds of human \ndynamics. I must tell you, as an American I am drawn to the \nhumanitarian arguments. It makes it very simple if you are drawn \ntotally to those arguments to justify putting our men and women in \nuniform at risk.\n  But I am not totally drawn to those arguments because, if I am, then \nwhat the President is proposing to do at this moment might be \njustifiable if he would follow certain procedures. It is those \nprocedures I think we must talk this morning. It is those procedures \nthe Senate will vote on, or about, within a few hours. We are talking \nabout U.S. military activity over and on the soil of Serbia, an \nindependent, autonomous nation. That nation is at war at this moment. \nIt is a civil strife over the province of Kosovo, which would be like \nthe State of Idaho within the United States of America. We would not \ncall that a world interest, if Idahoans were fighting the rest of the \nUnited States for Idaho's independence. I think the country would react \nviolently if Great Britain or NATO or Russia, for that matter, sided \nwith Idahoans against the United States if we were attempting to break \nloose from the United States of America.\n  Is that a reasonable parallel? Yes, I think it is, because that is \nthe character of the political profile and the international structure \nin which we are about to engage ourselves. Kosovo is a place that most \nAmericans could not find on a map, a place in which there is no direct \nAmerican interest. I have defined its structure from a legal point of \nview, international point of view--a state sovereignty point of view. \nPresident Clinton has made it clear for some months that he will \nintervene there with an open-ended occupation force, perhaps preceded \nby airstrikes. That has been the context of the debate for the last \ngood many months. Now we are associating ourselves with NATO as a \npartner of NATO. It appears that airstrikes may be imminent.\n  He has made it clear that he does not think he needs congressional \nauthorization for such a mission. Why? The treaty relationship; our \npresence in NATO. That is the argument that he\n\n[[Page S3067]]\n\nmakes. I will have to tell you, though, I think we should not make the \nmistake of simply arguing that is how you justify a certain approach of \nthe kind that this President is taking. The U.S. airstrikes would be an \nattack on a sovereign nation. The administration has, in fact, admitted \nthat. The State Department Under Secretary Thomas Pickering confirmed \nthat Kosovo is sovereign territory of Serbia, and that attacking the \nSerbs because they will not consent to foreign occupation of a part of \ntheir territory would be an act of war. Again, hearkening back to the \nrelationship: If Idaho were attempting to break away as an independent \nState from the United States, that would be called a civil war within \nthe boundaries of the greater United States and this country would look \nwith great concern if a foreign nation were attempting to involve \nthemselves on the side of Idahoans.\n  I have to think this administration's policy is inconsistent with \nconstitutional government and the rule of law. Let us not forget the \nConstitution of the United States gives the sole power to declare war \nto the Congress, article I, section 8--not to the President, but to the \nCongress. Nothing in the laws or the Constitution of the United States \nsuggests that a determination by the United Nations Security Council or \nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a substitute.\n\n  The proposed mission in Kosovo is contrary to the principle of \nnational sovereignty and is a major step toward global authority. Just \nlast year we debated the expansion of NATO. I opposed that expansion. I \nopposed it for the simple reason it did not begin to disengage the \nUnited States from an ever-increasing, larger presence in the European \nContinent. Quite the opposite, it seemed to be expanding our presence. \nRussia, at that time, was quite concerned that they saw an \ninternational organization growing on their border. Now, they were \nappeased by us saying: Remember, by treaty NATO is a defensive \norganization. Only if the nations of NATO were attacked would NATO \nrespond. Yet, today, NATO is proposing a major offensive effort against \nthe nation of Serbia, a longstanding friend and once a part of the \ngreater Soviet Union. It is not by accident that the armaments that we \nwould go up against are largely Russian armaments.\n  Now what are we to say to the Russians, ``What we said about NATO \nlast year is not true; NATO has become an offensive force, driven by a \ncertain set of politics or international attitudes as to how the rest \nof the world ought to look''?\n  Can we justify an American national interest because this war might \nspread beyond the boundaries of Serbia? I am not sure we yet can do \nthat. I am not sure this President has yet justified that or clearly \nexplained to the American people, as he must, the role that the men and \nwomen of our armed services might play and the role that they would \nplay in risking their lives. That is the issue at hand.\n  So, what kind of a precedent are we going to set with this action? \nAll actions establish precedents, especially if they appear to be \noutside established law or proven law.\n  What country are we going to claim the right to attack next, if we \ndetermine that its behavior within its own boundaries, its own \nterritory, is not up to some kind of international test or \ninternational standard? Should we attack Turkey to protect the Kurds, \nChina to protect Tibet or Taiwan, India to protect the Muslims in \nKashmir? It is reasonable for me to ask those questions on the floor, \nbecause today the President is contemplating participating in an attack \non Serbia in behalf of the Kosovars.\n  Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, and now Kosovo, these missions are profoundly \ndamaging to our legitimate defense needs. This is not just a question \nof money or stretching defense dollars too far, although that factor \nwill be considered as we debate defense budgets in the near future. \nWorse, it is an insult to the personnel in our Armed Forces who \nvolunteer to defend America, not to go off on every globalist, nation-\nbuilding adventure that our President appears to be willing to send \nthem to. No wonder America's best are frustrated by the ever increasing \nchanges in the role of our Armed Forces.\n  Putting American troops in a quagmire is something I know a little \nbit about. The Presiding Officer and I grew up in a period of American \nhistory where Americans were bogged in a quagmire in Southeast Asia, a \nquagmire that we finally simply had to drop our hands and walk away \nfrom, because we could no longer sustain it politically as a nation and \nwe could no longer justify that another 1, 2, or 3 American lives \nshould be lost, added to the list of over 60,000 young men and women of \nour age who lost their lives there.\n  I am not suggesting that Kosovo is that kind of fight, but I am \nsuggesting that any long-term effort in the greater Yugoslavia that \ndramatically increases the role of the American soldier could put us at \nthat risk.\n\n  Mr. President, I have asked some profound questions today and, I \nthink, reasonable questions as to the role of this country in foreign \npolicy and as to the role of the President as the Commander in Chief of \nour country.\n  Today we are debating and today we will vote on the right of the \nCongress to express its will to work with the President in shaping \nforeign policy. I understand how the Constitution works. I understand \nthat our President is the chief foreign policy officer of our country. \nBut when his foreign policy is questioned in the way that it is now \nbeing questioned, I think he has the responsibility not only to argue \nit clearly before the American people but to be willing to argue it \nhere on the floor of the Senate.\n  Some of our leadership are at the White House as I speak, and they \nare listening to a President who is trying to convince them not to have \nthe vote today here in the Senate. Quite the opposite should be \nhappening. The President should be saying, let us debate this issue, \nlet us vote this issue, and, more importantly, I will go to the \nAmerican people and sell to them why America ought to be involved in \nSerbia or in Bosnia, that there are American interests there. He, the \nPresident, should lay them out, define them, clarify them and, \ntherefore, justify the potential taking of American life that military \nadventure can always result in.\n  That is the responsibility of the Presidency, not to simply negotiate \nwith NATO as a treaty organization and then come home to America and \nsay: But we have already debated this, we are already involved in this, \nwe can't back up now or it would implode NATO. Maybe NATO ought to be \nimploded, if it is becoming an offensive organization. Maybe it ought \nto step back and say: Wait a moment, we are by treaty only defensive. \nWe should not become adventurists for the sake of a greater \ninternational philosophy on how greater Europe ought to be operated.\n  Having said all of that, let me close where I began. There are human \natrocities. They are real, and they are horrible. We should engage \nourselves in every way possible to help stop that kind of human \natrocity, but then again, we didn't do that in Africa on many \noccasions, all just within the last 4 or 5 years. I am not sure why \nthis is now so important when others were not. Is it because our allies \nhave convinced us?\n  By the way, if we fly aircraft over Serbia, 58 percent, or a very \nlarge portion, the majority, of those aircraft will be ours. Is it \nbecause we are the ones who have the power and our European allies have \nconvinced us to use that power in their behalf to stabilize their \nbackyard? I am not sure.\n  I, like most Americans, am reasonably confused. I, like most \nAmericans, have had to study to try to understand where Serbia is, \nwhere Kosovo is, what the politics of this region are. Those are the \nissues at hand.\n  This is not a vote that should be taken lightly. This could be the \nbeginning of a very lengthy process, a very costly process, costly in \nhuman lives, American lives, and certainly in tax dollars.\n  Those are the issues at hand, Mr. President. Why should you shy from \nyour responsibility as Commander in Chief of going to the American \npeople to debate this and causing your people to come here to debate \nthis, instead of in a close-door session at the White House, pleading \nwith us not to take a vote on this issue?\n\n  Nobody should be embarrassed by an up-or-down vote. Nobody should be \nembarrassed by this kind of debate. It is\n\n[[Page S3068]]\n\nour responsibility as a country. We cannot walk away from it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that time under the \nquorum call be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume on \nthe pending resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we have been discussing for several days in \nthis Chamber a variety of legislative proposals concerning what we will \nand will not authorize the President of the United States to do with \nrespect to the tragic situation that is unfolding, as we speak and \ngather in this Chamber, in Kosovo.\n  This is a very important debate. It is more important, in my view, \nhowever, to remind ourselves at the outset of any discussion of this \nissue of what has happened to the innocent people of Kosovo over the \nlast year, in the absence of clear and convincing steps to signal the \nend of international inaction in the face of gross and continuing \nviolations of human rights by the Milosevic regime.\n  For just a moment I want to focus, if I may, the hearts and minds of \nthis country and those in this Chamber on the very desperate situation \nof the people who find themselves trapped in the province of Kosovo.\n  Today, ethnic Albanian villages across Kosovo are quite literally in \nflames. Heavy smoke from the homes of innocent civilians fills the \nskies of Srbica, Prekaz, Gornja Klina, and others.\n  As we debate these issues, a massive force of 40,000 Serb soldiers \nand paramilitary police are moving slowly, deliberately, and \nmethodically from village to village to village, taking lives, burning \nhomes, and forcing tens of thousands of innocent civilians to flee \nwithout food or shelter.\n  Can anyone doubt in the face of such continuing atrocities that the \nAmerican people would oppose participation by the United States in NATO \nauthorized air strikes. I hope not, and I don't believe so.\n  Each day we have delayed has meant the difference between life and \ndeath and between shelter and homelessness for tens of thousands of \npeople. In just the last two days, since the ethnic-Albanians signed \nthe peace agreement on Friday, Serb soldiers have forced another twenty \nto twenty-five thousand civilians from their homes, according to United \nNations officials. Over the past week, the Serbs forced a total of \n40,000 to run for their lives. The totals for the past year are almost \nincomprehensible: at the very least 2,000 are dead and 300,000 to \n400,000 have been forced to leave their homes and seek refuge.\n  Mr. President, we were all shocked by the horrific discoveries last \nJanuary, just two weeks apart, in the towns of Racak, where Serbs \nmurdered 45 ethnic Albanians and Rogovo where they slaughtered 23 \nethnic Albanians.\n  The first of these attacks came on Friday January 15th when, \naccording to witnesses, Serbian soldiers and policemen, backed by \narmored personnel carriers, surrounded the village of Racak, rounded up \nthe men and drove them up a hillside. On that hillside, the Serbs \ntortured and murdered 45 people, including a young woman and a 12-year-\nold boy. Many of the victims were older men, including one who was 70. \nAll were dressed in civilian clothes. None were armed.\n  When international observers arrived in Racak the following day, the \nsight that awaited them was beyond comprehension--dozens of bodies lay \nwhere they fell at the bottom of a muddy gulch. Most had been shot at \nclose range. Many bore the signs of unspeakable torture. Although the \nSerbs claimed that the victims were rebels, not one wore a uniform nor \ncarried a weapon. Those who survived the attack on Racak fled into the \nhills where two infants soon died of the cold.\n  While it is sometimes difficult to assign blame for such horrors, \nthis killing field, Mr. President, left no doubt as to the killers' \nidentities. Western military forces intercepted radio transmissions in \nwhich Serbian officials acknowledge their culpability and international \npathologists blamed the Serbs.\n  It was hard to believe at the time that Milosevic's genocide could \nbecome more heinous or more calculated. Yet the past week proved our \nnightmares true.\n  It is at times like these, Mr. President, that we are forced to \nreexamine the founding premises of this great Nation. When faced with \nmassive and wholesale human rights abuses, we must bow to our \nconscience and to our founding fathers' recognition of the right of all \npeople to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and act to \npreserve those rights wherever possible. Kosovo, Mr. President, is just \nsuch a case. We have the power, the responsibility, and the opportunity \nto act.\n  That is not always available to us. We have been told in recent days \nthat we did not take similar actions on the Horn of Africa or in other \nplaces around the world where there were massive human rights abuses. \nThat analysis is correct. The difference here is that we have the \nopportunity, we have the ability, and we have the structure with the \nNATO organization to respond to this situation. That opportunity was \nnot available in every other place that we have seen similar, or even \nmore severe human rights abuses. Here we have the opportunity and the \nchance to do something about it. The issue is whether we in this body \nwill signal to the administration, to Mr. Milosevic, to ethnic \nAlbanians, and to the rest of the world that we understand the \ndifficult choices and we will step up and join with others to try to \nbring an end to the incredible abuse that is occurring at this very \nhour.\n  Thousands of refugees have already fled into Macedonia. As history \nhas shown, instability in the Balkans can destabilize all of Europe, a \nregion highly critical to American interests. I respectfully disagree \nwith our colleague from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, who has offered this \nunderlying resolution, when he states in his amendment that our \nnational security interests in Kosovo do not rise to a level that \nwarrants military operations by the United States and our NATO Allies.\n  The challenge to the United States in Kosovo is not merely \nhumanitarian. It is also a question of regional peace and stability. \nFinally, it is a test of the relevancy of NATO in the post Cold War \nera. All of these bear directly on the national security of the United \nStates.\n  We have yet to hear whether the last effort by Ambassador Holbrooke \nto convince the Serbs to relent will bear fruit. Although, in the next \n5 or 6 minutes, we may have the final word on that. His success would, \nof course, be welcomed. If he doesn't, then the time has come to act in \na manner consistent with that agreed to by NATO members--the United \nStates being a full party to that action.\n  Following military action, I believe that Yugoslav President \nMilosevic may be prepared to reflect more soberly on the proposed peace \nagreement that remains on the table. That agreement, proposed by the \nUnited States and our allies and signed by Kosovo's ethnic-Albanians, \nis fair and even handed. It will rid Kosovo of the fear, death and \ndestruction of Milosevic's forces while maintaining Yugoslav \nsovereignty over the province.\n  As part of the agreement, NATO has pledged to send a sizeable force \nto ensure that its precepts are carried out. Such a force is critically \nimportant as evidenced by the Serbs unwillingness to abide by the \ncease-fire agreement they signed last fall. While Milosevic pledged to \nwithdraw his soldiers from Kosovo's villages and end his campaign of \nethnic cleansing against the ethnic Albanians who live there, he \nclearly\n\n[[Page S3069]]\n\ndid neither. Milosevic's signature lacks credibility when it comes to \nKosovo.\n  Congress must not constrain the President's ability to respond in the \nface of such atrocities, nor can it allow a pariah such as Milosevic to \ndestabilize an entire region. The outrage at Milosevic's ethnic \ncleansing and disregard for international will should be viewed as a \nchallenge to our nation as a whole, not simply to a President of \nanother party.\n  Last year, our former colleague and Majority Leader, Bob Dole, \ntraveled to Kosovo and Belgrade to assess the situation. Upon his \nreturn, he spoke of the atrocities perpetrated against civilians and \nthe ``major, systematic attacks on the people and territory of \nKosovo.'' We know now that the situation has only deteriorated.\n  One year ago, I was proud to join with my colleagues in crafting a \nbipartisan resolution calling on the United States to condemn \nMilosevic's ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. Today, I ask my colleagues, on \nboth sides of the aisle, to join me once again in seeking to put an end \nto the bloodshed in Kosovo which will only happen when Milosevic \nunderstands that we truly mean business.\n  While we may not be entirely satisfied with all the exit strategies, \nwe must send the message that this Nation can speak with one voice when \nwe leave our shores to conduct foreign policy and make a difference in \nthe lives of the people of Kosovo.\n  As I said last October, there is a time for words and a time for \nforce.\n  We tried words in Dayton and we tried words last October. The cease-\nfire monitors tried words for five months and we tried words for weeks \non end in Rambouillet, France. I am a great believer in negotiation and \ndiplomacy, Mr. Milosevic has shown the world that he understands only \none language. It is time we spoke to him in his native tongue.\n  The United States must demonstrate that it will carry forward with \nmilitary action in the face of Serbian defiance. Congress should not \nweaken the projection of American power by suggesting that we do not \nstand behind the President. NATO's plans for air strikes, designed to \nstop the fighting and enforce the proposed peace agreement, have been \ncomplete for months. The United States has assumed leadership in this \nmatter for the sake of the ethnic-Albanians facing Milosevic's \ngenocidal plan and for the sake of regional stability.\n  If we play partisan politics with an issue as significant as this, we \nshould also be prepared to accept that the consequences of our actions \nmay be grave and irreversible.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the President and vote against the \nSmith amendment, an amendment that seeks to tie the President's hands \nand sends the wrong message to war criminals like Slobodan Milosevic.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe time be allocated to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the United States is about to begin what \nvery well might prove to be our most challenging and perilous military \naction since President Clinton took office. Many of our colleagues have \ncome to the floor to express their grave and well-founded concern that \nwe are embarking on a very dangerous mission without a clear sense of \nwhat will be required of us to achieve our objectives of autonomy for \nKosovo and peace and stability in the Balkans.\n  Further, many of us cannot escape the nagging feeling that the United \nStates and NATO credibility has been badly squandered by the \nAdministration's many previous failures to impress upon Milosevic and \nthe war criminals that make up his army that we are prepared to back up \nour rhetoric with action. Our threats of force have apparently lost \ntheir power to restrain the remorseless and blood-thirsty Serbian \nGovernment and military from giving full expression to their limitless \nbrutality. Consequently, the level of force required to coerce Serbia \ninto accepting a peace agreement has become all the greater, so great, \nin fact, that no one is entirely confident that Serbia can be coerced \nby the use of air power alone.\n  As the violence of an air campaign increases, so too does the risk to \nour pilots and to innocent people in Kosovo and Serbia. This will not, \nin all probability, be a casualty-free operation for the United States \nand our allies. And we must prepare ourselves and the American people \nfor the likelihood that we will witness some heartbreaking moments at \nDover Air Force Base. I hope I am wrong, but it would be irresponsible \nto pretend that the danger to our pilots in this operation is no \ngreater than the danger we have encountered during our periodic cruise \nmissile attacks on Iraq.\n  The President himself must deliver this message to the American \npeople. He has not done so, and that, I agree, is a terrible derogation \nof his responsibilities as Commander in Chief. However, Members of \nCongress cannot evade our own responsibilities to speak plainly to our \nconstituents about the great risks involved in this operation, We, too, \nmust shoulder a share of the responsibility for the loss of American \nlives in a conflict that most Americans do not believe is relevant to \nour own security. That is why so many Senators are so reluctant to \nsupport this action and have spoken so passionately against it.\n  However, we also have a responsibility to speak plainly about the \nrisks to America's security interests we incur by continuing to ignore \nSerbia's challenge to the will of NATO and the values of the civilized \nworld. It is those risks that have brought me reluctantly to the floor \nto oppose those of my colleagues who would strip the President of his \nauthority to take military action to defend our interests in Europe.\n  Two American Presidents have warned Serbia that the United States and \nNATO would not tolerate the violent repression of the movement by \nKosovars to reclaim their autonomy. We have, time and again, threatened \nthe direst consequences should Milosevic and his henchmen undertake the \nwanton slaughter of innocent life in Kosovo as they did in Bosnia.\n  President Clinton set two deadlines for Serbia to agree to the fair \nterms of a settlement in Kosovo or else face the direst consequences. I \nhave been involved, one way or another, with U.S. national security \npolicies for over 40 years. I cannot remember a single instance when an \nAmerican President allowed two ultimatums to be ignored by an inferior \npower without responding as we threatened we would respond.\n  The emptiness of our threats is evident in the administration's more \nrecent threshold for military action. In his press conference last \nweek, President Clinton, acknowledging Serbia's scorched earth campaign \nin Kosovo, stated that the threshold for NATO military action had been \ncrossed. Subsequent statements by administration officials, as quoted \nin the Washington Post, conceded that military action was unlikely \n``unless Yugoslav troops committed an atrocity.''\n  Atrocities are the signature of the Serbian Army. There has been an \nuninterrupted pattern of atrocities since 1992, alternating with U.S. \nthreats of force that were either not carried out or carried out so \nineffectually that they encouraged greater bloodshed. The one occasion \nwhen force was applied convincingly, the result was the Dayton Accord.\n  We have dug ourselves a deep hole in which the world's only \nsuperpower can no longer manage a credible threat of force in a \nsituation where our interests and our values are clearly threatened. As \nhas been pointed out by many Senators, there is a realistic danger of \nthis conflict destabilizing southern Europe, and threatening the future \nof NATO. And no one disputes the threat Serbia poses to the most \nfundamental Western motions of human rights. Our interests and values \nconverge clearly here. We must not permit the genocide that Milosevic \nhas in mind for Kosovo to continue. We must take action.\n\n  But I understand, all too well, the reluctance and outright \nopposition shared by many of my colleagues not only to air strikes but \nto the deployment of American troops in Kosovo as part of a peace \nagreement should we ever coerce Serbia into accepting the terms of that \nagreement.\n\n[[Page S3070]]\n\n  Typically, the administration has not convincingly explained to us or \nto the public what is at stake in Kosovo; what we intend to do about \nit; and what we will do if the level of force anticipated fails to \npersuade the Serbs.\n  Should the Serbs acquiesce, and United States troops are deployed in \nKosovo, the administration has not, to the best of my knowledge, \nanswered the most fundamental questions about that deployment. What is \nthe mission?; how will we know when it is accomplished?; what are the \nrules of engagement for our forces should Serbs or any force challenge \ntheir authority?\n  Thus, Congress and the American people have good reason to fear that \nwe are heading toward another permanent garrison of Americans in a \nBalkan country where our mission is confused, and our exit strategy a \ncomplete mystery.\n  It is right and responsible for Congress to demand that the \nadministration answer fully these elemental questions. It is right and \nresponsible for Congress to debate this matter even at this time when \nwe are trying to convince a skeptical adversary that this time we are \nserious about enforcing our will. I believe the administration should \ncome to Congress and ask for an authorization of force. I believe that \nthey would receive one.\n  Surely we are entitled to complete answers to the many questions \nabout our eventual deployment of American peacekeepers to Kosovo in \nadvance of that deployment.\n  But if the President determines that he must use force in the next \nhour, or the next day or within the week, I think it would be \nextraordinarily dangerous for Congress to deny him that authority or to \nconstitutionally challenge his prerogatives as Commander in Chief. It \nseems clear to me that Milosevic knows no limits to his inhumanity and \nwill keep slaughtering until even the most determined opponent of \nAmerican involvement in this conflict is convinced to drop that \nopposition. but if we once again allow Milosevic to escape unharmed yet \nanother American ultimatum, our mission will be made all the more \ndifficult and dangerous.\n  Moreover, our adversaries around the globe will take heart from our \ninability to act in concert to defend our interests and values, and \nthreats to our interests, from North Korea to Iraq, will increase \naccordingly.\n  Even the War Powers Resolution, legislation that I have always \nopposed, would allow the President to undertake military action for \nsome time before he would be forced to secure Congress' agreement. I \nhave long called on leaders from both parties to authorize Members to \nwork together to repeal or rewrite this constitutionally suspect \ninfringement of both the President's and Congress' authority.\n  But that, Mr. President, is a debate for another time. We are at the \ncritical hour. American troops will soon be ordered into harm's way to \ndefend against what I believe is a clear and present danger to our \ninterests. That the President has so frequently and so utterly failed \nto preserve one of our most important strategic assets--our \ncredibility, is not a reason to deny him his authority to lead NATO in \nthis action. On the contrary, it is a reason for Congress to do what it \ncan to restore our credibility. It is a reason for us to help convince \nMr. Milosevic that the United States, the greatest force for good in \nhistory, will no longer stand by while he makes a mockery of the values \nfor which so many Americans have willingly given their lives.\n  No, Mr. President, we must not compound the administration's mistakes \nby committing our own. We must do what we can to repair the damage \nalready done to our interests. We must do what we can to restore our \nallies' confidence in American leadership and our enemies' dread of our \nopposition. We must do what we can to ensure that force is used \nappropriately and successfully. And we must do what we can to define an \nachievable mission for our forces, and to bring them home the moment it \nis achieved.\n  That should be our purpose today, Mr. President. Therefore, with an \nappreciation for the good intentions that support this resolution, I \nmust without hesitation oppose it, and ask my colleagues to do \nlikewise.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the possible deployment of United States \ntroops to Kosovo demands the Senate's full attention and debate. I \napplaud the House of Representatives for addressing this issue in a \ntimely manner, even though I do not support the House resolution \nauthorizing the deployment of United States troops to Kosovo.\n  The pending deployment of United States troops to Kosovo is \nparticularly ill-advised in light of the challenges and difficulties \nassociated with our current mission in Bosnia. Now 2 years past the \noriginal deadline with no end in sight, the Bosnia operation has cost \nthe United States over $8 billion in real dollars since 1992. \nAdministration officials cannot identify an end-date for the Bosnia \nmission and have not been able to transfer the operation to our \nEuropean allies. Progress in Bosnia has been painfully slow. In many \nways the country remains just as divided as it was when the Dayton \nAccords were signed. Although Bosnia should be a poignant reminder of \nthe limits of nation-building, the administration is considering \nanother open-ended commitment of United States ground forces to the \nBalkans.\n  The violence and instability that has plagued the Balkans troubles me \nas it does every other Member of this body. Every Member of the Senate \nwould like to see an end to the violence in Kosovo and a sustainable \npeace in Bosnia. But in addressing these difficult issues, the \nPresident and the Congress owe it to the American people to define a \nconsistent policy for when their sons and daughters will be placed in \nharm's way. We have to define the American interests important enough \nto justify risking American lives. Unfortunately, the President has not \ndone so in this case.\n  United States military deployments in the Balkans are not being \ndriven by vital security interests, but humanitarian concerns that have \nnot been defined clearly. As Henry Kissinger states, ``The proposed \ndeployment in Kosovo does not deal with any threat to United States \nsecurity as this concept has traditionally been conceived.''\n  U.S. humanitarian interests are important elements of America's \nforeign policy, but should not be considered alone as the basis for \nrisking the lives of American soldiers. The violence in Kosovo is \natrocious, but half a dozen other civil conflicts around the world \noffer more compelling humanitarian reasons for United States \nintervention. If United States troops are deployed to Kosovo where \n2,000 people have died, why not to Sudan where a civil war has claimed \n2 million casualties? Why not to Afghanistan or Rwanda or Angola where \nhundreds of thousands of people have died in civil wars that continue \nto this day?\n  Such questions underscore the need for a consistent policy which \nlinks the deployment of American troops to the defense of vital \nnational security interests. The United States can and should provide \nindispensable diplomatic leadership to help resolve foreign crises, but \nwe have to recognize the purposes and limits of American military \npower. The blood and treasure of this country could be spent many times \nover in fruitless efforts to reconstruct shattered nation states.\n\n  From Somalia to Haiti to Bosnia and now to Kosovo, I cannot discern a \nconsistent policy for the deployment of United States troops. In a \nworld full of civil war and humanitarian suffering, will American \nground forces be deployed only to those conflicts that get the most \nmedia attention? The media cycle is no basis for a consistent foreign \npolicy. The American people deserve better leadership from Washington \nfor the prudent and effective use of U.S. military power.\n  The administration has not provided that leadership. The U.S. Armed \nForces have been deployed repeatedly to compensate for a lack of \nforesight and discipline in our foreign policy. United States policy in \nthe Balkans, for example, has dealt with symptoms of instability rather \nthan the root of the problem. The administration has deployed \npeacekeeping forces to suppress ethnic conflict inflamed by President \nMilosevic but has missed opportunities to undermine Milosevic himself. \nA lack of diligence and resolve also can be seen in United States \npolicy toward Iraq. Saddam is stronger today than at the end of the \ngulf war because the administration has not seized opportunities to \nundermine his regime.\n  The ill-defined deployment of United States troops to Kosovo only \nreinforces\n\n[[Page S3071]]\n\nmy concerns about the misuse of American military resources. We have \nbeen asking our military personnel to do more with less, and the strain \nis showing in troubling recruiting, retention, and readiness \nstatistics. The dramatic increase in the pace of military activity has \nbeen accompanied--not with an increase in defense funding--but with a \n27-percent cut in real terms since 1990. In this decade, operational \nmissions increased 300 percent while the force structure for the Army \nand Air Force was reduced by 45 percent each, the Navy by approximately \n40 percent, and the Marines by over 10 percent. Contingency operations \nduring this administration have exacted a heavy cost (in real terms): \n$8.1 billion in Bosnia; $1.1 billion in Haiti; $6.1 billion in Iraq.\n  The Kosovo agreement pursued by the administration is laying the \ngroundwork for another open-ended United States military presence in \nthe Balkans. The administration's strategy for resolving the conflict \nin Kosovo could very well lead to the worst-case scenario of a broader \nregional conflict now being used to justify United States intervention. \nThe Kovoso Albanians see the proposed settlement as a 3-year waiting \nperiod leading to an eventual referendum for independence. The Serbians \nstrongly oppose such a step. That will guarantee United States troops \nwill be in Kosovo for at least 3 years and most likely much longer when \nthe inevitable fighting resumes over the question of Kosovo's status.\n  Mr. President, the credibility of the United States is on the line \nwhen we commit our military personnel overseas. When United States \nsoldiers were killed in Somalia, the President could not justify the \nmission to the American people. The hasty U.S. withdrawal from that \nAfrican nation cost America dearly in terms of international stature. \nAs we consider a possible deployment to Kosovo, the lessons learned 6 \nyears ago in Somalia should not be forgotten. The American people will \nnot support a Kosovo deployment that costs American lives when \nAmerica's vital security interests are not at stake. Yet American \ncasualties are a very real prospect in Kosovo, as potentially both the \nKosovo revels and Serbians will be firing on United States military \npersonnel.\n  Not only is United States credibility at risk in Kosovo, the \ncredibility of the NATO Alliance is in jeopardy as well. NATOs success \nin the past has been based on the clearly defined mission of the NATO \nTreaty: collective defense of a carefully defined territory. Now, the \nadministration is transforming the alliance into a downsized United \nNations with a standing army for peacekeeping operations. NATO's \nmembership has been expanded this year, but the real expansion has \noccurred in the alliance mission to include operations never envisioned \nin the NATO Treaty.\n  Managing Europe's ethnic conflicts was not the reason NATO was \nestablished and not a basis on which it can remain a vital organization \nin the future. The American people have not understood our commitment \nto NATO--a military alliance for fighting wars--to be another arm of \nthe United Nations for peacekeeping operations. Ill-defined missions \nfor NATO will lead to more misguided U.S. military deployments, the \nerosion of U.S. support for NATO, and the speedy demise of the alliance \nitself.\n  The U.S. Armed Forces should be deployed only to defend the vital \nnational security interests of the United States. The American people \nunderstand that we live in a dangerous world where U.S. interests must \nbe defended. But they also have a strong aversion to fruitless nation-\nbuilding exercises to resolve the world's ancient hatreds, and rightly \nso.\n  Our country has learned through painful sacrifice the high cost of \nnation-building. In spite of the difficulties surrounding the Bosnia \nmission, however, we are on the verge of taking on our second nation-\nbuilding exercise in a region of the world that has been wracked by war \nfor centuries.\n  In the post-cold-war world, there will be no lack of civil war and \nethnic conflict with serious humanitarian implications. The United \nStates should continue to work to alleviate suffering and facilitate \npeace in other countries, but deploying American forces to quell \ncenturies-old ethnic conflicts is often the least effective and most \nunsustainable way to address these problems. I am opposed to the \ndeployment of United States forces to Kosovo and urge my colleagues to \nvote for cloture on the Lott second-degree amendment prohibiting the \nuse of funds for a Kosovo operation unless previously authorized by \nCongress.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the situation in Kosovo is cause for \ngrave concern to all of us. One cannot read the press reports flooding \nout of Kosovo for the past many months and not be moved. The suffering \nof the people of Kosovo is tragic, and the potential for this conflict \nto spread and to destabilize the entire region is very real. Something \nmust be done.\n  But before we commit ourselves to military action, we must be sure \nthat any action we undertake has a good chance of achieving our primary \nobjectives. I am concerned about the current course of action as \noutlined by the President and Secretary of Defense Cohen. I agree that \nwe need to be part of a NATO effort to resolve the current impasse and \nput an end to the fighting. But we should not be contributing ground \ntroops to that effort. Our European allies must take the lead on the \nground, and we should support that effort with our superior air power \nand intelligence operations. Just as we take the lead on problems in \nthis hemisphere, it is important that Europe take the lead in Kosovo.\n  The airwaves are now heavy with the talk of impending air strikes \nagainst Serbia following Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic's final \nrejection of the proposed peace plan. Milosevic refuses to allow NATO \ntroops on Yugoslav soil, even though NATO has agreed that Kosovo should \nremain a province of Yugoslav and the Kosovar Albanians have signed on \nto the peace deal. The United States has put a great deal of effort \ninto trying to achieve a political settlement in Kosovo. We have taken \nthe lead in the negotiations, and the personal intervention of \nSecretary Albright, Ambassador Holbrooke and Former Senator Bob Dole \nhas done much to advance the cause. But Milosovic remains intransigent \nand the violence continues to escalate. Both sides are now poised for \nan all-out military offensive. And United States-led air strikes \nagainst targets in Serbia are imminent.\n  I am uncomfortable with the tactic of launching a major military \nbombing campaign in order to force someone to the peace table. For two \nreasons, one, it rarely works; and two, real peace will only come when \nboth sides realize they have more to gain by setting aside the military \noption. If they do not really want peace, there is little we can do to \nforce them into it. Targeted air strikes without a synchronized \ncampaign on the ground are unlikely to make a serious change in the \nstrategic situation in Kosovo. Stopping a large-scale Serbian offensive \nfor anything more than a short period of time is extremely difficult if \none's only tool is a stand-off air campaign.\n  However, we must do something and do it soon. But our action must be \nwith the equal participation of our European allies, with each partner \ncontributing what they do best. In our case, that is aerial control and \nintelligence collection and analysis. I would not oppose that kind of \nAmerican participation in a closely coordinated operation led by our \nEuropean allies where the objectives, duration and methodology were \nclearly explained to Congress and the American people. I believe this \nis the only operation likely to meet with success in the long run. And \nwe have no time to waste!\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, how much time is remaining \non this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes 40 seconds on your side; 37 \nminutes on the other side.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, the legislation before \nus--which Senator Lott has introduced--is an amendment which I drafted \nseveral weeks ago when I saw the administration lurching toward war in \nYugoslavia. I believe that Congress should determine whether or not \nAmerica should commit an act of war against a\n\n[[Page S3072]]\n\nsovereign nation inside its own borders.\n  Regardless of what your view is on the conflict in Kosovo, I sense \nthat most of my colleagues agree that Congress should take a position \non any action in Kosovo. We simply cannot turn this or any other \nadministration loose to commit acts of war around the world without the \ndemonstrated support of the American people. We did that once in \nVietnam. We know the results. Politicians stood here and debated it, \nand men and women died every day.\n  The purpose of my amendment is very simple. It simply requires \nCongress to debate, and then approve or deny, the use of military force \nin the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. That is it, pure and simple. If \nyou want the Congress to have a say in this, you should vote for my \namendment. If you think the President should be able to go to war \nagainst a sovereign nation without the support of Congress, you should \nvote against my amendment.\n  This raises constitutional issues for some of my colleagues. I want \nto dispense with them right away. It is clear that the President has \nthe power to commit U.S. forces to battle--this President or any other \nPresident--and he has the power to command them once they are \ncommitted. I interpret this authority as allowing the President to \nrespond swiftly and unencumbered to an immediate threat to U.S. lives, \nliberty, or property.\n  We have seen in history, some of it recent, that a President can \ninterpret this authority very loosely. But we also have seen that when \nPresidents use force in a way that they do not or cannot explain to the \nAmerican people, and for a cause the American people do not in their \ngut support, that policy collapses. We saw it by the end of the war in \nVietnam. We saw it in Somalia, in 1994. We saw it in Beirut in 1983. \nRepublican and Democrat Presidents alike have learned this lesson.\n  It is entirely constitutional for the Congress to withhold funds from \nany activity of the Federal Government. It is the Constitution itself, \nArticle I, Section 8, which gives us that power. This so-called power \nof the purse is a blunt instrument--there is no question about that--\nand one we should use sparingly, but it is sometimes the only \ninstrument we in Congress have. It is why the administration must seek \nconsensus, or at least some majority, in support of military \nhostilities.\n  So we should undertake an examination of this proposed action and \nthen speak for the American people. We must consider our interests, the \nquestion of sovereignty, the nature of the conflict and the risks, and \nwhat we are trying to accomplish.\n  What are our interests? The administration has a hard time explaining \nwhy U.S. interests are at stake in Kosovo. This is not surprising. \nThere are certainly no American lives at risk--not yet, at least. \nAmerican liberty and American property are not threatened. It is not a \nhumanitarian mission like the assistance we have given to Central \nAmerica in the wake of Hurricane Mitch.\n  Nor is loss of life the administration's standard. Two thousand \npeople have been killed in the fighting in Kosovo in the past year. \nThat is a lot of people. However, in just 6 weeks in 1994, half a \nmillion Rwandans died. We didn't launch any cruise missiles in Rwanda, \nMr. President. There, we did not launch any cruise missiles when half a \nmillion people died.\n  If anything, the administration's statements have added confusion to \na very complex issue. During a recent Armed Services Committee hearing, \nI asked Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering whether or not an \nattack on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would be an act of war. \nHis response goes right to the heart of the problem I have with the \nactions of this administration. Here is what Mr. Pickering said:\n\n       Well, an act of war, as you know, and I have recently found \n     out, is a highly technical term. My lawyers tell me . . . \n     that an act of war, the term is an obsolete term in anything \n     but a broad generic sense. If you would say that Milosevic, \n     in attacking and chasing Albanians, harassing, torturing, \n     killing Albanians and sending them to the hills is anything \n     but an act of war, I would certainly agree with you on that \n     particular judgement. If, in fact, we need to use force to \n     stop that kind of behavior and also to bring about a \n     settlement which recognizes the rights of those people \n     which have been denied, I would tell you that it might \n     well be a war-like act, although the technical term ``act \n     of war'' is something we ought to be careful to avoid in \n     terms of some of its former meanings that have \n     consequences beyond merely the use of the term.\n\n  That sounds like a pretty bureaucratic explanation to me, Mr. \nPresident, but I will tell you one thing: To the young men and women \nwho are going to be asked to put their lives on the line in Kosovo, \nthere can be no bureaucratic explanation about what a declaration of \nwar is or is not. It is not the lawyers Mr. Pickering is referring to \nwho are going to fight. It is not the lawyers who are going to be \nmanning the aircraft. It is not the lawyers who are going to be \ncaptured as POWs. It is not the lawyers who have to go in and get those \nPOWs if they are shot down. It is the young men and women of our Armed \nForces. I was then, and I continue to be, absolutely astounded by Mr. \nPickering's response.\n  The administration tells us that we must become involved in the \ninternal affairs of Yugoslavia to prevent the spread of this conflict \ninto neighboring nations, including perhaps NATO members. This is a \nbogeyman argument, and it is meant to scare us into resolving this \nconflict by using American military forces. It obscures the real issue: \nshould American troops be placed at risk in an area of the world where \nwe have no real interests which justify direct intervention? Risking \nU.S. troops in a war in Kosovo is far more dangerous to American \ninterests than the small risk that the conflict would spread.\n  The argument is also made that the conflict in Kosovo threatens NATO \nand threatens American leadership of NATO. There is nothing in the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty that authorizes NATO to commit the kinds of \nactions we are talking about here. NATO is not an offensive alliance, \nit is a defensive alliance. As a matter of fact, it was created to \nprevent aggression against the sovereign nations of Europe. By using \nNATO to attack a sovereign nation, we are about to turn the alliance on \nits head.\n  We are only weakening the alliance by using its forces offensively in \nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The core of the alliance has always \nbeen to protect members from attack, not to be peace enforcers, not to \nmeddle in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation--no matter how \ndespicable the acts that are being committed are--and certainly not to \ndictate a peace agreement under the threat of violence. By intervening \nin this civil war, I fear the alliance is not showing strength to the \nworld, but weakness and confusion.\n  Mr. President, NATO expansion has already diluted NATO's strength. By \nbecoming enmeshed in the internal affairs of the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia, the alliance is distancing itself further from its core \nmission, which is to ensure the protection of its members. Although I \nopposed and continue to oppose expansion of NATO, I am a supporter of \nNATO and its core mission. But if this is what NATO has become--a means \nof dragging the United States into every minor conflict around Europe's \nedges--then maybe we should get out of NATO.\n  We are about to begin a high-risk military operation--a war--against \na sovereign nation. Not because Americans have been attacked, not \nbecause our allies have been attacked, but because we disapprove of the \ninternal policy of the Federal Republic Yugoslavia. That policy is easy \nto disapprove, but that is a very low standard to apply the use of \nforce. If we applied that standard around the world, we would be \nlaunching cruise missiles around the world.\n  The fundamental question is whether the lives of American soldiers \nare worth interfering in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation \nwhere there are no vital U.S. interests at risk. This is not Iraq in \n1990, where a ruthless tyrant invaded a peaceful neighboring country. \nThis is a case of a disaffected population revolting against its \ngovernment. Is Milosevic a tyrant? Yes, absolutely. But his tyranny is \nhappening inside his own nation.\n\n  We are dictating, under the threat of military action, the internal \npolicy of Yugoslavia. We may not like that policy, but is that reason \nto go to war? Moreover, is it reason to let the President of the United \nStates go to war without an act of Congress? That is the question \nbefore us today. It is a very\n\n[[Page S3073]]\n\nserious question, and our actions in this body will have ramifications \nfor many years to come. This very well may be one of the most important \nvotes we make on the Senate floor this year.\n  The conflict in Kosovo is a civil war. Neither side wants to be \ninvolved in the peace agreement that we are trying to impose. It took \nweeks of arm twisting and coercion just to get the Kosovo Liberation \nArmy to agree to the deal. The administration had to send our \ndistinguished former leader, Bob Dole, to persuade them to accept the \nagreement.\n  Both the KLA and the Serbs still want to fight, and they will fight \nuntil they do not want to fight anymore. We will be using U.S. troops, \nnot as peacekeepers, but as peace enforcers. There is a difference. \nPeacekeepers are there to assist the transition to stability. Peace \nenforcers are there as policemen to separate two parties who want to do \nnothing but fight. They are not interested in an agreement. They still \nwant to fight. By jamming the agreement down their throats, the \nadministration is not solving the problem. At best, it is delaying it.\n  Many proponents of military intervention in Kosovo cite World War I \nas a lesson as to the ultimate danger of a crisis in the Balkans. They \nhave it exactly backwards. A Balkan war became a world war in 1914 not \nbecause there was strife, but because the great powers of that day \nallowed themselves to become entangled in that strife. We need to heed \nthis lesson. We did not fight and win the Cold War just to be dragged \ninto marginal conflicts like this one.\n  Why are the Balkans so prone to conflict? The main reason is that \nthis is where Christianity and Islam collide. Strife along these lines \nhas gone on virtually uninterrupted for a millennium. This is no place \nfor America to get bogged down. I believe in America and American \npower, but these are conflicts that America cannot solve.\n  The administration is prepared to send our pilots into combat against \na combat-hardened nation that is well equipped to defend itself from \nattack. Let there be no doubt--I will say it here now in this Chamber--\nlet there be no doubt, American lives will be in danger. This act will \nresult in the deaths of American servicemen. The Joint Chiefs testified \nbefore the Armed Services Committee last week. They tried to tell us, \nas carefully as they could.\n  General Ryan, Air Force Chief of Staff, said:\n\n       There is a distinct possibility we will lose aircraft in \n     trying to penetrate those defenses.\n\n  General Krulak, Commandant of the Marine Corps, said:\n\n       It is going to be tremendously dangerous.\n\n  He went on to ask the same questions I have: What is the end game? \nHow long will the strikes go on? Will our allies stay with us?\n  In the coming days, if air strikes do go forward, we need to be ready \nto answer the questions of the families of those young men and women \nwho will not be returning from Yugoslavia. We have to be prepared to \nanswer those questions. We can begin to answer them today: Are we \nprepared to fight in Yugoslavia month after month, slugging it out with \nthe Serb forces in those mountains, losing Americans day after day? Are \nwe prepared for that?\n  I want to say one thing about the troops. If we go in tonight or \ntomorrow, they will have my support. That is the way it should be. But \nI have an obligation to the Constitution, and under the Constitution, \nthe U.S. Congress must decide whether or not we go to war. That is the \npurpose of my resolution.\n  Mr. President, I abhor the bloodshed in Kosovo. But as much sympathy \nas I have for those victims, we must remember that the Federal Republic \nof Yugoslavia is a sovereign nation. We can provide safe haven for \nthose refugees as they exit Kosovo. We don't need to go to war.\n  Throughout the cold war, we fought to protect the rights of sovereign \nnations, and in 1991 we sent American soldiers to war to turn back the \nunlawful and immoral invasion of the sovereign nation of Kuwait. George \nBush sought to defend a sovereign nation after it had been attacked, \nand he came before Congress to seek that authorization. He came before \nthe Congress. And he barely got our approval.\n  George Bush risked losing a vote in Congress because he believed that \nthe American people should comment on whether or not we would go to \nwar. In that case, the nation of Iraq had attacked and conquered the \nsovereign nation of Kuwait. What a change in just eight years; here we \nare today, preparing ourselves to attack a sovereign nation, and the \nadministration at this very minute is trying to avoid this vote.\n  This is a terribly difficult time for all of us. Having been in the \nVietnam war, watching politicians who could not decide whether they \nwanted to support the troops or not, day after day, month after month, \nyear after year, I don't want to see us get embroiled in another \nconflict the American people are going to lose their taste for after we \nstart losing young men and women.\n  I just came back from a 4-day trip around the country--Louisiana, \nAlabama, and Colorado--talking to the troops. They are the best. They \ncan handle anything we ask them to do. But they should not be asked to \ndie in a conflict where the national security of this country is not at \nrisk. This is exactly what they will be asked to do it if we go into \nKosovo.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to carefully think about the \nimplications of what we are about to do at 2 o'clock or so this \nafternoon. I urge my colleagues to support the Smith amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 5 \nminutes from the time of the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to address my thoughts on the \nsituation in Kosovo. This is a very complicated and dangerous issue. \nThere are no good alternatives, there are no good options, there are no \ngood solutions. I have listened with great interest and great respect \nto my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the \nissue. Their perspectives have been important, they have been \nenlightening. The threads of who we are as human beings--in America's \ncase, as leaders of the world, as leaders of NATO--are intertwined in \nthis very complicated morass that we call the Kosovo issue.\n  With that said, I don't believe America can stand by and not be part \nof a unified NATO response to the continued slaughter in the Balkans. I \nsay that mainly for three reasons.\n  First, the very real potential for this crisis widening and deepening \nis immediate and there will be consequences. If this goes unchecked and \nunstopped there is the real risk of pulling in other nations into an \nalready very dangerous and complicated situation. I believe if this \ngoes unchecked and unstopped we run the very real risk of the southern \nflank of NATO coming unhinged. We are on the border now of Macedonia, \nMacedonia being on the border of Greece.\n  Second, the humanitarian disaster that would result if NATO stood by \nand did nothing would be immense. The consequences of that humanitarian \ndisaster would move up into Western Europe; nations will take issue and \nsides against one another in Europe. This would have consequences in \nthe Muslim world. The humanitarian element of this, as much as the \ngeopolitical strategic elements involved in this equation, are real. \nThere would be tens of thousands of refugees pouring into nations all \nover Western Europe. This would further exaggerate the ethnic and the \nreligious tensions that exist today.\n  The third reason I believe that the United States cannot stand aside \nand not be part of any NATO activity to stop the butchery in Kosovo is \nbecause if the United States is the only NATO member who refuses to \ndeal with this problem--all other NATO members are committed to deal \nwith this problem--\n\n[[Page S3074]]\n\nif we are the only NATO member not part of this effort, it surely will \nbe the beginning of the unraveling of NATO. If NATO does not deal with \nthis crisis in the middle of Europe, then what is the purpose of NATO? \nWhat is the relevancy of NATO?\n  I have heard the questions, arguments, the debate, the issues raised \nabout NATO being a defensive organization, the very legitimate \nquestions regarding acts of war, invading sovereign nations. These are \nall important and relevant questions. However, I think there is a more \nrelevant question: What do we use the forces of good for, the forces \nthat represent the best of mankind, if we are going to be held captive \nto a definition that was written 50 years ago?\n  Every individual, every organization, every effort in life must be \nrelevant to the challenge at hand. The consequences of the United \nStates not being part of NATO in this particular effort would be \ndisastrous. America and NATO's credibility are on the line here. I \nsuggest to some of my colleagues who are engaged in this debate, where \nwere they last fall? Where were they when Ambassador Holbrooke reached \nan agreement with President Milosevic in October? At that time, the \nUnited States and all nations in NATO gave their commitment that there \nwould be a NATO military response if Milosevic did not comply with the \nagreement that he made on behalf of NATO with Ambassador Holbrooke.\n\n  Part of the debate we are having now--if not all of it--should have \nbeen done last fall. To come in now after the administration and our \nNATO partners are trying to bring together some peaceful resolution \nusing the leverage of NATO firepower and the leverage of military \nintervention, for the Congress now to come in and undermine that is not \nthe right way to have the Congress participate in its constitutional \nresponsibility to help form foreign policy.\n  However, the President of the United States must take the lead here. \nI, too, have been disappointed in the President not coming forward to \nexplain, to educate, on this issue. If the President feels this is \nrelevant and important to America's interests, the President must come \nforward and explain that to the American people. He has thus far not \ndone that. I understand that may be done today or tomorrow. I talked to \nSecretary Albright Sunday night and encouraged Secretary Albright, as I \nhave others, to encourage the President to do that. Only the President \ncan lead. Only the President can make the case as to why this is \nimportant for our country and explain the consequences of the United \nStates doing nothing. The President must come before the Nation and \nexplain why this military intervention in Kosovo is relevant and \nimportant, and why the very significant risk of life is worth it, why \nthe significant risk of life is worth it.\n  I also want to point out that I have heard an awful lot of debate and \nconversation that we, the United States, would take on Milosevic. It is \nnot just the United States. It is our 15--actually 18--other partners \nin NATO. I might add, too, that the Europeans have stepped into this \nwith rather direct action and a call for arms in using and committing \ntheir ground troops and other military assets. So it is not the United \nStates against Milosevic. It is NATO; it is the forces of good. We must \nnot be confused by that difference.\n  The President has to explain all of this to the American public. Yes, \nthere are great uncertainties and great risks at stake. But to do \nnothing would create a far worse risk for Europe, the United States, \nNATO, and I believe all over the world, because the United States' \ncommitment and work and credibility is being watched very carefully by \nSaddam Hussein, the North Koreans, and others who would wish the United \nStates and our allies ill. Actions have consequences. Nonactions have \nconsequences.\n  Mr. President, history will judge us harshly if we do not take action \nto stop this rolling genocide. As complicated as this is, I hope that \nas we debate this through today, my colleagues will support the \nPresident on his course of action.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before my colleague departs the floor, I \nwish to commend him for his final set of remarks. I listened very \ncarefully. Those precise steps of reasoning were discussed in great \ndetail beginning at 9:30 this morning up through 11:30 with the \nPresident and the Senate and House leadership. The very points that our \ncolleague makes were reviewed and responded to by the President.\n  Time and time again--and I am sure you share this with me --I want to \naccord the highest credit to our colleague from Texas, Senator \nHutchison, and our colleague from New Hampshire, Bob Smith, and others, \nwho have repeatedly over the past week or 10 days, through filing \namendments and otherwise, brought to the attention of the Senate the \nurgency of this situation and the need to address it.\n  Today's meeting with the President was the second one, the previous \none being last Friday of similar duration. Senator Lott has tried his \nbest to reconcile a rather complicated procedural situation together \nwith Senator Daschle, and they are still conferring. We are going to \naddress that in our respective caucuses here starting momentarily. I \nsee--and I am speaking for myself now--a clear movement within the \nSenate to address this within the framework of a resolution. There are \nseveral working now whereby the American public can follow with much \ngreater clarity exactly what is the issue before the Congress and how \nthis body will respond to the challenge. It is an extraordinary one. \nThe case--as you laid out--of inaction is just unacceptable to the \nworld. We are about to witness a continuation, taking place at the \nmoment, of ethnic cleansing of a proportion reaching those that we \nexperienced in Bosnia.\n  A very courageous diplomat, Mr. Holbrooke, has made several \nexcursions--I think the most recent completed within the hour --and all \nindications are that the situation, diplomatically, as much as it was, \nsay, 72 hours ago, despite the best efforts of the United States, Mr. \nHolbrooke representing this country, but indeed he spoke for 18 other \nnations--the important consideration here is that there are 19 \nnations--16 in NATO and several others--who are locked with the \ndetermination not to let this tragedy continue. As the Senator said, \nthe consequences of no action are far more understandable than the \nconsequences of action. Now, the military action proposed is largely, I \nsay largely, but almost exclusively, an air type of operation. Those \npilots are taking tremendous risks.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee, last Thursday, had all the \nChiefs present. As the first indications of the concern in the Senate \nwere beginning to grow through questioning by myself and other members \nof the committee, we had each Chief give their appraisal of the risk, \nand General Ryan, speaking for the air arms of our country, was \nunequivocal in saying this is dangerous, that these air defenses are \nfar superior to what we encountered in Bosnia and what we are today \nencountering in Iraq, and this country runs the risk of casualties. \nWhat more could he say? He was joined by General Krulak, Chief of \nStaff of the Army, and the Chief of Naval Operations. All of them very \nclearly outlined the risks that their respective personnel would take--\nthat, together with our allies.\n\n  Numerically speaking, about 58 percent of the aircraft involved will \nbe U.S. Why? It is very simple. Fortunately, through the support of the \nCongress and the American people, we have put in place a military that \ncan handle a complication such as this. I say ``complication'' because \ngoing in at high altitudes and trying to suppress ground-to-air \nmunitions is difficult. It requires precision-bombing types of \ninstruments, precision missiles, and many of the other nations simply \ndo not have that equipment. But it is interesting, if we get a peace \naccord--and I have long supported the United States being an element of \na ground force under the prior scenario where we had reason to believe \nthat there would be a peace accord--and maybe there is a flicker of \nhope that it can be reached before force is used in this instance--but \nthere the European allies would have about 80 percent of the \nresponsibility, and the United States, I think by necessity, as leader \nof NATO, should have an element.\n\n[[Page S3075]]\n\n  So another message that we have to tell the people is that the \ncountries of the world--indeed NATO--are united. It is just not to be \nperceived as a U.S. operation. It is a consolidated operation by 19 \nnations. Milosevic should be getting the message now, if he hasn't \nalready, that this is not just a U.S. operation. It is a combined \noperation of 19 nations.\n  Now, the proposed air operation is the best that our Joint Chiefs, in \nconsultation with the North Atlantic Council and the respective chiefs \nof the NATO, can devise given that air assets are to be used. It is \nspelled out, I think, in a convincing way.\n  The President, again, went over this very carefully with the \nSecretaries of State and Defense, the National Security Adviser, and \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs present this morning. This operation, \nin stages, unequivocally I think, will bring severe damage to, first, \nthe ground-to-air capabilities; and then if Milosevic doesn't recognize \nthe sincerity of these 19 nations, then there will be successive air \noperations on other targets designed to degrade substantially his \nmilitary capability to wage the war of genocide and ethnic cleansing \ntaking place at this very minute throughout Kosovo.\n  In addition, as I am sure the Senator is aware, there are many \ncollateral ramifications to this situation, which leads this Senator to \nthink it is in our national security interest to propose action. I \nshall be supporting as a cosponsor the joint resolution as it comes to \nthe floor this afternoon.\n  Right on the line I will sign and take that responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be extended for \nabout 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is very important that this air \noperation degrade his capability to do further damage in Kosovo. But \nthe instability in the region, as stated by the President this morning, \nin many ways parallels Bosnia, but could be considered more serious \nbecause of Greece, Turkey, and the spillover of the refugees into \nMacedonia and Montenegro. It is just not an isolated situation of \nrepression and oppression by Milosevic against Kosovo civilians. They \nare now flowing in and causing great problems in these nations who are \ntrying to do the best they can from a humanitarian standpoint to accept \nthem.\n  So I always come back to the fact that this Congress went along with \nthe President as it related to Bosnia. History will show that we were \nmisled in certain instances by the President hoping we could be out by \nyearend. It had not been the case. But we are there, and the killing \nhas stopped. How soon the economic stability of that country can create \nthe jobs to give it some permanence we know not. But we could lose an \ninvestment of up to $8 billion or $9 billion that this Congress has \nauthorized and appropriated through the years to bring about the degree \nof achievement of the cessation of hostilities in Bosnia if Kosovo \nerupts and spills over the borders in such a way as to undo what has \nbeen done over these years since basically 1991.\n  So there are many ramifications. It is difficult for the American \npeople to understand all the complexities about the credibility of NATO \nand the credibility of the United States as a working partner, not in \njust this opposition, but future operations with our European nations. \nBut they do understand quite clearly that genocide and ethnic \ncleansing, murdering, rape, and pillaging cannot go on. And we have in \nplace uniquely in this geographic area the political organization in \nNATO, together with such military assets as are necessary to address \nthis situation.\n  So it is my hope that the leaders will be able to resolve a very \ncomplex situation as it relates to the procedural matter before the \ndesk and that we can have before the Senate this afternoon a resolution \nwith clarity of purpose and clarity of how each Senator decides for \nthemselves and speaking for the constituents about what the country \nshould do.\n  I am convinced that the President has to go forward within 24 or 48 \nhours with the other NATO nations.\n  So I sort of put myself in the cockpit with those brave aviators, \nwhere you have been in a combat situation, Senator, many times, and you \nknow that situation better than most of us. And you know how it is \nimportant to that soldier, sailor, or airman that has the feeling--or \nshe in some cases--that this country is behind them and stands with \nthem as they and their families take these risks.\n  I thank the Senator for the opportunity to have a colloquy with him \non this important question. I commend him for his leadership on this \nand many other issues.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Helms pertaining to the introduction of S. 682 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will take just about 3 minutes now and I \nwill speak longer than this later in the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it seems we are moving irrevocably towards \nwar in the Balkans. It appears that the U.S. forces along with NATO \nforces will soon be engaged in open warlike activity against Serbian \nforces. This Senator took the floor in January of 1991, prior to the \nengagement of our forces in the Persian Gulf, to state my feelings that \nbefore any President commits our troops to a military action of this \nnature, that President should seek the advice, consent, and approval of \nCongress.\n  Only Congress has the power to declare war; it is quite clear in the \nConstitution. It is this Senator's strong feeling that this President \nwould be remiss, and we would be shirking our duties, if in fact we did \nnot, today, set aside whatever other business this Senate has, to \ndebate fully a resolution supporting or not supporting the use of our \nmilitary force in Kosovo. That debate should be held today and the vote \nshould be held today, or tomorrow, but as soon as possible, so we \nfulfill our constitutional obligations.\n  I said, in 1991, if the President were to engage in war in the \nPersian Gulf without Congress first acting, not only would it be a \nviolation of the War Powers Act but I think it would be a violation of \nthe Constitution of the United States. I still feel that way, \nregardless of whether it is President George Bush or President Bill \nClinton.\n  So the sounds of war are about us. I am hearing the rumblings that \nour planes and our pilots might start flying soon, that bombs might \nstart dropping soon. Our military people will be engaged in military \nactivities of a warlike nature. Now is the time and here is the place \nto debate that. We cannot shirk our constitutional responsibilities. \nThe debate should be held this afternoon. The vote should be held, no \nlater than tonight or early tomorrow, on whether or not this Congress \nwill support that kind of activity in Kosovo.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would ask if you will notify me when I \nhave talked 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator requesting unanimous consent to \nextend the time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/23/senate-section/article/S3075-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3075-S3076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HCFA'S A NO-SHOW\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday the Special Committee on \nAging, which I chair, held a hearing on the government's oversight role \nin ensuring quality care in our Nation's nursing homes. The committee \nhas been investigating systemic flaws in nursing home care for two \nyears. A series of reports by the General Accounting Office and the HHS \ninspector general have now shown this to be a national problem.\n  The Aging Committee investigates in a bi-partisan manner. The rules \nof the committee require it. The committee's\n\n[[Page S3076]]\n\nranking member, Senator Breaux, has very ably assisted the committee's \nwork. His insightfulness and interest in issues affecting the elderly \npopulation has brought greater credibility to our work.\n  At yesterday's hearing, we learned much about the breakdown in the \ncomplaints process. In other words, when someone makes a formal \ncomplaint about the treatment of a loved-one in a nursing home. The \nvarious states operate the process. But the federal government has the \nultimate responsibility to oversee it to make sure complaints are being \naddressed.\n  Yesterday we heard from two citizen witnesses who experienced \nfirsthand a broken-down complaints process. Their stories were tragic, \nyet real. The committee, the government, and the public learned much \nfrom their testimony.\n  We also heard from the GAO and from the HHS IG.\n  The committee did not hear from the Health Care Financing \nAdministration, or HCFA. HCFA is the federal agency charged by law to \nprotect nursing home residents. HCFA must ensure that the enforcement \nof federal care requirements for nursing homes protects the health, \nsafety, welfare, and rights of nursing home residents. Yet, HCFA was a \nno-show.\n  There is a very specific reason for yesterday's hearing, and this \nseries of hearings. It's because the health, safety, welfare, and \nrights of nursing home residents are at great risk. Yet, the agency \nresponsible was not here.\n  The committee invited the two private citizens in the public \ninterest. Through their eyes, we saw a complaint process turned upside-\ndown. It's a process that has put some nursing home residents at risk. \nTheir testimony could help correct the process so others don't have to \nsuffer the same wrongful treatment.\n  The reason HCFA wasn't here is puzzling, given the committee's focus \non listening to citizen complaints. HCFA is an agency within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services--HHS. HHS determined that HCFA \nshould not show up because HHS witnesses do not follow citizen \nwitnesses. That's their so-called policy.\n  In other words, HCFA--the organization that is supposed to serve our \nelderly citizens by protecting the health, safety, welfare, and rights \nof nursing home residents--was not here because its protocol prevents \nthem from testifying after citizen witnesses.\n  Last Friday, when discussing this matter with HHS officials, my staff \nwas told the following: ``Our policy is that we testify before citizen \nwitnesses.''\n  Now, I have four comments on this. First, how serious is the \nDepartment about the problems we're uncovering in nursing homes when a \nprotocol issue is more important than listening to how their complaints \nprocess might be flawed?\n  Second, I have conducted hearings, in which citizen witnesses go \nfirst, since 1983. Other committees have done the same. I don't recall \nany department at any hearing I conducted since 1983 that became a no-\nshow, even when private citizens testified first. Especially for an \nissue as important as this.\n  Third, the Department may be trying to convince the public it cares. \nBut this no-show doesn't help that cause. The public might confuse this \nwith arrogance.\n  Finally, this situation yesterday could not possibly have illustrated \nbetter the main point of the hearing; namely, that citizens' complaints \nare falling on deaf ears. These witnesses traveled many miles \nyesterday. They were hoping that government officials--the very \nofficials responsible--would hear their plea. Instead, what did they \nget? A bureaucratic response. Their agency-protectors were no-shows \nbecause of a protocol. Because of arrogance, perhaps.\n  So, we'll move forward with yesterday's testimony, learning how the \nnursing home complaint system is in shambles. And the agency \nresponsible for fixing it wasn't here to listen. Of course, they can \nread about it once it's in writing--a process they are comfortable \nwith.\n  Since I have been in the Congress, I have never taken partisan shots \nat an administration. I believe only in accountability. My heaviest \nshots were against administrations of my own party. The record reflects \nthat very clearly.\n  The easy thing to do would be to take partisan pot shots over this. \nIt's much harder to redouble our efforts, in a bipartisan way on the \ncommittee--which I intend to do--until HHS and HCFA get the message. \nWhen will HHS and HCFA hear what's going on out there in our nation's \nnursing homes? Perhaps when they learn to listen to the citizens we--\nall of us in government--serve. Until they get the message, these \nproblems will get worse before they get better.\n  One key reason why HCFA's presence was important, yesterday, was to \nnail down just who is in charge. At our hearing last July, Mr. Mike \nHash, HCFA's deputy administrator, told the committee that HCFA is \nresponsible for enforcement for nursing homes. Yet in yesterday's \nwritten testimony submitted for the record, Mr. Hash says the states \nhave the responsibility.\n  This needs to be clarified. Who's in charge, here? Is this why we're \nseeing all these problems in nursing homes? Because no one's in charge?\n  In my opinion, this matter has to get cleared up at once. Every day \nthat passes means more and more nursing home residents may be at risk. \nThe Department of HHS has to restore public confidence that it truly \ncares, that it's doing something about it, and that improving nursing \nhome care is a higher priority than protocols for witnesses at a \nhearing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/23/senate-section/article/S3076-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are obviously dealing with very serious \nmatters for the future of our country and our military men and women \ntoday. We want to make sure we proceed properly. We are looking at how \nto proceed on the Kosovo issue and the supplemental appropriations and \nbe prepared for consideration of the budget resolution beginning \ntomorrow.\n  We have looked at a lot of options. Obviously, we have been talking \namong ourselves and the administration, and Senator Daschle and I have \ngone through a couple proposals.\n  Our conclusion is, at this time we should go forward with the cloture \nvote as scheduled. The cloture vote is on the Smith amendment, which is \nan amendment to the Hutchison amendment to the supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  When that vote is concluded, depending on how that vote turns out, \nthen we will either proceed on the Smith amendment or we will set it \naside, if cloture is defeated, and work on the supplemental \nappropriations bill while we see if we can work out an agreement on \nlanguage or how we proceed further on the Kosovo issue.\n  We thought the better part of valor at this time is to have the vote \non cloture. Is that Senator Daschle's understanding, too? We will \ncontinue to work with the interested parties. A bipartisan group will \nsit down together and look at language to see if we can come up with an \nagreement on that language. We may be able to, maybe not. But we should \nmake that effort. Then we also will press on the supplemental \nappropriations bill while we do that.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask for the regular order.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

and\n       (B) such intermediaries adhere to Health Care Financing \n     Administration instructions that limit the number of claims \n     for reimbursement held for such review for any particular \n     home health agency to no more than 10 percent of the total \n     number of claims submitted by the agency; and\n       (3) ensure that such intermediaries are considering and \n     implementing constructive alternatives, such as expedited \n     reviews of claims for reimbursement, for home health agencies \n     with no history of billing problems who have cash flow \n     problems due to random medical reviews and sequential \n     billing.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 126\n\n (Purpose: To appropriate an additional amount to promote the recovery \n         of the apple industry in New England, with an offset)\n\n       On page 2, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n\n\n                     Agricultural Marketing Service\n\n       For an additional amount to carry out the agricultural \n     marketing assistance program under the Agricultural Marketing \n     Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 1621 et seq.), $200,000, and the rural \n     business enterprise grant program under section 310B(c) of \n     the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. \n     1932(c)), $500,000: Provided, That the entire amount shall be \n     available only to the extent an official budget request for \n     $700,000, that includes designation of the entire amount of \n     the request as an emergency requirement as defined in the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as \n     amended, is transmitted by the President to Congress: \n     Provided further, That the entire amount is designated by \n     Congress as an emergency requirement under section \n     251(b)(2)(A) of such Act.\n       On page 37, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n                          Farm Service Agency\n\n\n                      emergency conservation fund\n\n       Of the amount made available under the heading ``emergency \n     conservation program'' in chapter 1 of title II of the 1998 \n     Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act (Public Law \n     105-174;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n       Sec.  . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     none of the amounts provided by this Act are designated by \n     Congress as an emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, a continuing problem with the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations is that it is not paid for.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues--and I will try to be brief--\nthat last year the President in the State of the Union Address took the \nhard and fast position that we should save Social Security first. The \nidea was that the whole surplus of the Federal budget should go to \nSocial Security and should be used to reduce the outstanding debt of \nthe Government.\n  As everyone remembers, in the waning hours of the session last year \nwe passed an emergency appropriations bill that contained numerous \nnonemergency items. And the net result was to spend $21 billion--\nroughly one-third of the surplus--every penny of which was Social \nSecurity surplus. Therefore, in the words of the President, we had \nplundered the Social Security trust fund to fund all of these other \nprograms of Government.\n  As I am sure everyone is aware, along with the budget that will come \nto the floor of the Senate immediately following disposition of the \nissue on Kosovo, we will consider a lockbox provision that requires a \nreduction in the debt held by the public by the amount of Social \nSecurity surplus. That will automatically lower the debt limit we will \nset by law each time we have a Social Security surplus. So the net \nresult will be that each and every penny of the Social Security surplus \nwill, in fact, be locked away, going to debt reduction in the name of \nSocial Security. While none of that saves Social Security, it does mean \nthat none of it is spent on general government and that we actually \nreduce the indebtedness of the Federal Government in the process.\n  Right in the face of this effort to lock away the Social Security \nsurplus for Social Security, we found ourselves with an emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill which is not paid for. And, in fact, \nin its current form, the bill increases spending and therefore takes \n$441 million right out of the Social Security surplus in fiscal year \n1999. And then, adding this year and the next 4 years, it would take \nalmost $1 billion out of the surplus; $956 million would, in fact, be \ntaken out of that surplus.\n  It seems to me we can't be credible talking about a lockbox to lock \nthis\n\n[[Page S3079]]\n\nmoney away for Social Security at the very same moment that we are \nspending the money.\n  So I have sent two amendments to the desk. One makes across-the-board \nreductions in the previous emergency bill we passed in areas other than \nagriculture and defense to such a degree that we pay for the $441 \nmillion. So the emergency supplemental at that point will be deficit \nneutral in fiscal year 1999.\n  The second-degree amendment, which I have submitted on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Nickles, because in fact it was his amendment that \nhe reserved the right to offer--the second-degree amendment is an \namendment which waives the emergency designation, which will mean that \nthis $515 million of spending in the years 2000 through 2005, will \ncount toward the spending caps in those years. So by spending the money \nnow, we will lose the ability to spend that amount of money in future \nyears.\n  These are two straightforward amendments which have one overriding \nvirtue, and that is, they pay for the supplemental.\n  Let me say of my colleague, the Senator from Alaska, that I am very \ngrateful he has decided to accept these amendments. I know this only \nmeans postponing the battle until conference.\n  There was a clever little poem I learned as a boy. And I am sort of \nashamed to say that I forget exactly what the rhyme was. But it was, \n``He that is convinced against his will is unconvinced still.'' And I \nknow that in this case, wanting to get on with this bill, our dear \ncolleague, our loving colleague from Alaska, is convinced against his \nwill to take these amendments, and I know he is unconvinced still.\n  But the point is, we would have the ability to go to conference with \nour bill fully paid for and with no emergency designation. That would \nput those of us who believe that this should be the way we do business \nin this country in a position in conference to try to sway others. On \nthat basis, I will be willing, with the adoption of these amendments, \nto let the bill go to conference where, obviously, at that point this \nwill be fought out again.\n\n  Let me conclude, before the Senator from Alaska changes his mind, by \nsimply saying we are going to have to come to a moment of truth here. \nWe cannot write budgets that say we are going to control spending and \nthen continue to spend. We cannot lock away money for Social Security \nand then spend the money for Social Security. I know it is hard--when \nthe President says one thing and does another--for Congress to say \nsomething and then actually do it because, obviously, it is easier to \nsay it and not do it than it is to say it and then do it. But I do \nbelieve the American people have a higher standard that they apply to \nus, and I think the adoption of this amendment, especially if it can be \nheld in conference, is a major step forward in getting credibility back \ninto the budget.\n  On that basis I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, my friend brought a smile to my face \nbecause I remembered Miniver Cheevy:\n\n       Miniver Cheevy, child of scorn,\n       Cursed the day that he was born.\n\n  He was born too late. Just think, I might have been chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee back in the days before the Budget Act, before \nscoring fights, when we just talked about what the country needed. \nRight? But it is one of those things.\n  Mr. GRAMM. But then you would be dead, Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. STEVENS. No, Cheevy just hoped he had lived sooner. You \nunderstand? By definition, he is dead.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Oh, OK.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I cannot match the memory of my friend from West \nVirginia as far as poetry is concerned. I was trying to think of \nanother poem I remembered that would have been appropriate, but right \nnow I will say this:\n  Mr. President, here is the problem. We had a massive bill last fall. \nIt had emergency monies appropriated that were outside the budget. Now \nwe are reprogramming much of that money to new emergencies or to new \nprograms which take the money away from the programs we appropriated \nfor last fall. But now we are going to spend it somewhere else. OMB did \nnot score that money last fall because it was outside the budget. Now \nthe Senator from Texas has gone to the CBO and the CBO has scored that \nas money that is just being appropriated. We are really reprogramming \nappropriated money to new uses.\n  When they score it, they do not come up with budget authority, which \nis the problem of the legislative committees. They come up with \noutlays, which is our problem. We do not have the outlays. By \ndefinition, the money, if we leave it where it is, it is going to be \nspent. It is going to be spent unscored.\n  As a consequence, I have told the Senator from Texas, and I hope my \nfriends from the other side of the aisle would agree, we will take this \nto conference. I made a commitment. I will sit down with the CBO and \nsee if I can understand their point of view of why they should do this \nto us. Most people do not agree. It is only the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee that is subject to this control. The House just waived the \npoints of order. Over here, our bills are subject to points of order.\n  The amendment of the Senator would lead to dramatic cuts in several \npriorities that were funded in the omnibus bill as emergency issues and \nnot scored on outlays. And we have a provision in this bill that says \nthose monies will continue to not be scored as outlays if they are \nspent for the purposes we redesignated them for: Diplomatic security, \nto rebuild our embassies destroyed in Kenya and Tanzania, the funding \nthat we put up for the U.S. Government's response to the Y2K computer \nproblem. At my request last year, we went forward very early and the \nSenate started that process, $3.25 billion to deal with Y2K. It was not \nscored, and we are reallocating some of that. The agriculture relief \nfrom last year--again, it was an emergency. We are reprogramming some \nof that.\n\n  Above all, the FEMA disaster relief monies, all of those were not \nscored for outlays, Mr. President. But I understand what my friend is \ndoing. He is trying to do the same thing we are trying to do, and that \nis preserve Social Security. I will be willing to do anything I can to \npreserve the position we have taken that Social Security funds not be \ntouched. They were touched last fall. We are not touching them, we are \nreusing them. That is something the CBO cannot quite grasp right now, \nand I have said I will go sit down and talk to them. As a matter of \nfact, I will invite the Senator from Texas to come along so he will \nhave a worthy advocate as we try to understand the new concepts of \nscoring outlays on monies that were already appropriated on an \nemergency basis.\n  I think the Senator from Texas raises some interesting points. I do \nhope we will be able to accept this. I have to tell the Senator from \nTexas that my decision to recommend these be taken to conference is \nstill subject to being reviewed on the other side of the aisle, and I \nwill have to defer the final approval of the amendment of the Senator \nuntil that time. But I will call him if there is any discussion to be \nhad on his amendment.\n  I hope he agrees we set it aside temporarily while awaiting that \nresponse to my request. But I do intend to recommend the amendments of \nthe Senator be taken to conference where we will explore them and try \nto see if we can accommodate what the Senator is trying to do without \ndisturbing the process that we feel is our duty--to meet the \nemergencies as they are presented to us this year, not last year.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President and Senator Stevens, before he leaves the \nfloor, I am going to ask a question of the Senator from Texas on the \nspeech that he just made, although it is not directly on point. I thank \nSenator Gramm for the comments he made about Social Security and \nprotecting it and the lockbox. He has explained the lockbox as \nlegislation he has reviewed in my behalf, and described it as making it \nvery difficult, if not impossible, to spend the Social Security \nsurplus, because to do so one would have to increase the debt beyond \nthat which is agreed upon, the debt held by the public, and in so doing \nthey would need a supermajority.\n  Since the administration says they want to save the Social Security \ntrust\n\n[[Page S3080]]\n\nfund, do you have any idea--can my colleague imagine why the Secretary \nof the Treasury would be against it?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes, I can tell you I not only have an idea, I think it is \nclear there is only one reason anybody would be against it, and that is \nthey want to say they are saving Social Security, but they do not want \nto do it. They want to have it both ways. They want to give great and \nflowery speeches about ``Save Social Security first, save Social \nSecurity now,'' but when it gets right down to it, what the provision \nof my colleague in the budget does by changing the debt ceiling is it \nactually makes it impossible for them not to do it unless they can get \n60 votes in the Senate to raise the debt ceiling. So the only reason \nthey would oppose it is they do not intend to do it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That would require statute law to do what I have \nrecommended and what my staff and I have worked out? We would have to \nbring that to the floor, and that will be another test after the budget \nresolution about how serious people are about not touching the Social \nSecurity trust fund; is that correct?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Anybody who is opposed to your bill is refusing to write \ninto law in a binding manner what everybody pledges verbally to do. The \nprovision of the Senator from New Mexico is an enforcement mechanism. \nAnd the only reason anybody would be against enforcing an \nantiplundering provision on Social Security is if they intend to \nplunder. I think that is what the whole issue is about.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask one thing further. My colleague has been here \nworking with me for most of my time on the Budget Committee, although I \nwas there for a while when he was in the House working on budgets \nthere. I have talked, heretofore, about whether or not we can lock up \nthe Social Security trust fund. But it is my recollection that no \nlegislation of the type that I propose has ever been suggested to the \nCongress as a means of not spending that money. Is that your \nrecollection also?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Well, first of all, I don't know of any effort in the \npast, prior to 1979, when I came to the Congress. There had been no \nlegislative action since 1979 that would have locked in a process to \nenforce debt reduction. This is the first in my experience of service \nin the Congress. My guess is there has never been a similar proposal \nbefore, but we do have an extraordinary circumstance. We have a \nPresident who is committed to saving Social Security money and using it \nfor debt reduction. We have 100 Members of the Senate who say they are \nfor it. Your amendment gives us a happy opportunity to marry all this \nup with a binding constraint. The question is, who is for real and who \nis not for real on this issue. That is what will be determined.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to put in the Record the scoring \nthat we got on the supplemental bill as it came out of committee. It \nshows the problem. CBO showed we had $319 million in savings on \noutlays, and OMB said we had $567 million savings in outlays. OMB now \nhas gone back and has changed the minuses to plus, and they say that we \nare over $441 million. It is because of a revision, I guess, of the way \nthey have approached the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the scoring that we received \non S. 544, as reported to the Senate, be printed in the Record and that \nit be followed by the Senator's chart, as of March 22, of scoring from \nCBO of the bill as it stands before the Senate today.\n  There being no objection, the tables were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                FY 1999 SUPPLEMENTAL S. 544, AS REPORTED\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     Senate bill\n                                           -----------------------------\n                                                         CBO       OMB\n                                               BA      Outlays   Outlays\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                  OFFSETS\n \nAgriculture:\n  Food stamp program......................      -285  ........  ........\n                                           -----------------------------\n      Net.................................      -285  ........  ........\n                                           =============================\nCommerce-Justice:\n  DoJ OIG.................................        -5        -5        -5\n  INS enforcement & border affairs........       -40       -32       -32\n  INS citizenship & benefits, immigr.            -25       -20       -20\n   support................................\n  NOAA operations, research & facilities..        -2        -1        -1\n  NOAA procurement, acquisition & constr..        -2        -1        -1\n  Contributions to Int'l organizations....       -22       -22       -22\n  Contributions to Int'l peacekeeping.....       -21       -21       -21\n  Int'l broadcasting operations...........        -1        -1        -1\n                                           -----------------------------\n      Net.................................      -118      -103      -102\n                                           =============================\nDefense:\n  Operations & maintenance, defense-wide..      -210       -78      -155\n                                           -----------------------------\n      Net.................................      -210       -78      -155\n                                           =============================\nForeign Operations:\n  Global environmental facility (GEF).....       -60        -5        -5\n  Economic support fund...................       -10        -1        -1\n  Assistance for E.

I think it demonstrates that there is a legitimate \nbattle here over people who make estimates. We have one group of \nestimators downtown, another group of estimators over in CBO. We have \nour own on the committee. We make estimates of what we are doing, and \nit is like three groups of lawyers. Fifty percent of them are wrong all \nthe time. I say this as a lawyer.\n  As a practical matter, there is no answer to the Senator from Texas' \napproach, unless we just set them all down in the same room and say \nfind a way to come to an agreement. In the final analysis, there are \nthree computers working on this bill and, as they say, if you put stuff \nin, stuff is going to come out; right? That is the trouble. I am not \nsure what color the stuff is that the Senator from Texas is using, but \nit is coming out. It disagrees with our conclusions of what this bill \nmeans.\n  I am told that the other managers of the bill agree with my concept \nthat this is something we should explore in conference, and we will \ngive it our best review in conference. We are willing to accept the \nSenator's amendments now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Without objection, the second-degree amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 129) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the first-degree amendment, \nas amended, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 128), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the votes by which the \namendments were agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 130\n\n    (Purpose: To maintain existing marine activities in Glacier Bay \n                             National Park)\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment, and I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n\n[[Page S3081]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 130,\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       ``Sec.   . Glacier Bay.--No funds may be expended by the \n     Secretary of the Interior to implement closures or other \n     restrictions of subsistence or commercial fishing or \n     subsistence gathering in Glacier Bay National Park, except \n     the closure of Dungeness crab fisheries under Section 123(b) \n     of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 1999, (section 101(e) of division A of \n     Public Law 105-277), until such time as the State of Alaska's \n     legal claim to ownership and jurisdiction over submerged \n     lands and tidelands in the affected area has been resolved \n     either by a final determination by the judiciary or by a \n     settlement between the parties to the lawsuit.''\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if I may have the attention of my \ncolleagues, let me identify specifically what is intended by this \namendment.\n  First of all, I should identify the specific area about which we are \nconcerned. This is my State of Alaska. Over here on the right is \nCanada. We have our State Capitol here in Juneau. Just north of Juneau \nis an extraordinary jewel of our National Park Service called Glacier \nBay. Glacier Bay is a pretty substantial area in size. It consists of \nabout 3.3 million acres. That is about the size of 3 Grand Canyons or 4 \nYosemites or 17 Shenandoah National Parks or 825 Gettysburgs. It is \npart of the State of Alaska which has about 33,000 miles of coastline.\n  Let me further identify specifically what Glacier Bay consists of \nrelative to the map of Alaska which is before you.\n  We have in southern Alaska in the northern tip, before you cross the \nGulf of Alaska to go up to the Anchorage area, the area specifically \nknown as Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. Over in this corner we \nhave Gustavus, which is a small community, Bartlett Cove, where the \nPark Service has its concessions, and down here we have Chichagof \nIsland, and over here, Juneau. The purpose of this map is to give the \nvisitor some idea of the extraordinary size and attractiveness of \nGlacier Bay and the realization that there are absolutely no roads in \nthis area, with the exception of this very short road from Gustavus, \nwhere there is an airfield, to Bartlett Cove. This is very rugged, \nglacier-bound terrain. The only entry is by vessel or aircraft flying \nover the area. There are kayaks, small boats, and so forth. The \nactivity is monitored by the Park Service quite effectively.\n  If you look at the map of Alaska, you also find that this entire area \nof Canada has no outlet to the Pacific Ocean. That is from roughly \nCordova down through Ketchikan, all this area of northern British \nColumbia, Whitehorse, the Yukon Territory. There is no access. But \nthere is in Glacier Bay a very tiny area, at the Tarr Inlet, where a \nglacier occasionally recedes and provides a bit of real estate in \nCanada at the head of Glacier Bay. Of course, the difficulty is you \ncannot go through a glacier for access. I just point this out to you so \nyou will have a little better view of the real estate, the topography, \nand so forth.\n  What we have before us in this issue is the traditional right of \nfishermen and subsistence gatherers who live in the area, either in \nGustavus or Hoonah, which is a Native village. These are gatherers. \nWhat does that mean? To these people it is part of their heritage, part \nof their lifestyle.\n  Mr. President, we do not have any chickens in this particular area. \nIt is pretty wet, pretty cold. So the Natives occasionally go in and \ngather sea gull eggs. Now, there is not much demand for sea gull eggs. \nThe question of their continued right to go in and gather those eggs as \nwell as fish is what this issue is all about, because the action by the \nPark Service would preclude traditional fishing and gathering, which \nhas been going on here for hundreds of years.\n  The fishermen and subsistence gatherers really can't go someplace \nelse. It is my opinion and that of my senior colleague, Senator \nStevens, that their rights should be respected.\n  What have we got that is different about this issue? The difference \nis the State of Alaska has indicated its intent to file suit and our \nGovernor, Governor Knowles, has asserted claim to the submerged lands \nwithin the park. Granted, the Park Service has control of Glacier Bay \nNational Park and Preserve. The State, under the Statehood Act, was \ngiven control of the inland waters. The question is, Who has \njurisdiction over waters within the park? That is the issue.\n\n  The conflict today is that the Park Service is enforcing today an \nelimination of fishing and an elimination of subsistence gathering, but \nthe State has indicated it intends to bring suit.\n  I have a press release by the Governor of the State of Alaska dated \nMarch 4 indicating the State's intent of bringing suit against the \nInterior Department over Glacier Bay fishing. It is titled, ``Governor \nasserts claim to submerged lands within park.'' This matter is being \nbrought before us today, because the existence of the suit suggests \nthat until it is decided, the residents of the area should not be \ndisallowed their conventional access for fishing and gathering.\n  In real terms, the delay does not jeopardize any park value. \nGathering and fishing is fully regulated by the State of Alaska, the \nDepartment of Fish and Game, very effectively and very efficiently. All \nimportant fisheries are under the system that would prevent any \nincrease--any undue effort on the resource. In the thousands of years \nthat the Natives have been in the area, there has been no evidence of \nany resource problem.\n  Let me also identify a couple of other specifics here. This is a \ntraditional Hoonah Tlingit village that existed at the turn of the \ncentury. You can see the fish drying on the racks and the homes, the \nsummer camps, where the Native people resided. This picture was \nactually taken in Bartlett Cove in Glacier Bay.\n  The unfortunate part of this is, this village no longer exists. The \nPark Service eliminated it. The Park Service burned several Indian \nhouses and smokehouses like this in the seventies. Again, this was a \nsummer camp, a summer village.\n  The history of subsistence in Glacier Bay spans, as near as we can \ntell, Mr. President, about 9,000 years. The Tlingit name of the bay \nmeans ``main place of the Huna people'' or was referred to as the \n``Huna breadbasket,'' because they depended, if you will, for their \nlivelihood on some of the renewable resources there.\n  As many as five Native strongholds once existed inside the park \nboundary, but, as I have indicated, the Natives were gradually forced \nout of their traditional places, and in the seventies the National Park \nService burned down the Tlingit fishing camps like this in the park.\n  Limited fishing began back in 1885, long before Glacier Bay was named \nas a national park. Again, it is interesting to reflect on the claim of \njurisdiction of the Park Service. Not only did they claim the inland \nwaters, but they claimed 3 miles out along the Gulf of Alaska, from \nroughly Dry Bay, which is near Yakutat, 3 miles out into these rich \nfishing grounds, which have always been open for commercial fishing \nunder the State department of fish and game. They have the enforcement \ncapability, and that is the point of mentioning this, for 3 miles out, \nto close that as well.\n  Again, my appeal is, let the court determine who has control over the \ninland waters of the park, and let's get on with allowing the \ntraditional gathering and limited commercial fishing activity that \ntakes place there.\n  As we look at a couple of things that are dos and don'ts, this is no \nlonger allowed under the Park Service proposal. One- or two-person \nfamily-operated boats are not welcome. They are not welcome in the park \nanymore. There is no good reason for it. They say they do not want a \ncommercial activity. But this is what they do allow in the park: A \n2,000-passenger cruise ship as big as three football fields. That is \nallowed. If that is not a commercial activity, I don't know what is. I \nhappen to support it. You can look at the topography, the glaciers. \nThere is no better way to see Glacier Bay National Park than from the \ndeck of a cruise ship. But to suggest there is something wrong with the \nsubsistence dependence of the Native people and something wrong with \nlimited commercial fishing because it is commercial, and then to \nsupport what is truly commercial--the cruise ships--why, I think that \nis a grave inconsistency.\n\n[[Page S3082]]\n\n  I think it is important to go back to what the local residents were \nassured they would have--the local residents of southeastern Alaska. \nThey were assured, as local residents, that the Government would not \neliminate traditional uses, including fishing and subsistence \ngathering. That certainly is not the case anymore, is it?\n\n  I think it is also important to recognize that while nationwide park \nregulations adopted in 1966 prohibited fishing in freshwater parks, \nthese did not prohibit fishing in the marine or salt waters of Glacier \nBay.\n  I wish I had this in chart. The Park Service proposes closing \nfisheries in Glacier Bay, as we have already ascertained. But what is \ntheir overall policy nationally? In Assateague Island National Seashore \nin Maryland and Virginia, the Park Service authorizes commercial \nfishing. Biscayne National Park in Florida, the Park Service authorizes \ncommercial fishing. Buck Island Reef National Monument, U.S. Virgin \nIslands, commercial fishing is OK there. Canaveral National Seashore in \nFlorida, fishing is OK there. Cape Hatteras National Seashore, North \nCarolina, commercial fishing is OK. Cape Kruzenstern National Monument \nin Alaska--way, way, way up here by Kotzebue--commercial fishing is OK \nthere. Channel Islands, California, commercial fishing is OK. Fire \nIsland National Seashore in New York, commercial fishing is all right. \nGulf Island National Seashore, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, \ncommercial fishing is OK. Isle Royale National Park in Michigan, \ncommercial fishing is fine. Jean Lafitte National Historic Park, \nLouisiana, commercial fishing is OK. Lake Mead National Area, Nevada, \nfishing OK. Redwood National Park, California, commercial fishing is \nOK. Virgin Islands National Park, fishing is OK.\n  Why kick out just Alaska, a few residents who rely on their \ntraditional gathering? That is the question. And another question is, \nWhat is the justification?\n  The fisheries consist of small numbers of small vessels, as I \nindicated. These are a type of traditional vessels, trollers, mom-and-\npop--many are a lot smaller than that--fishing for salmon. But Glacier \nBay is not a significant salmon spawning ground, because there are no \nmajor rivers. The water is very glacially silty and, as a consequence, \nanadromous fish do not use habitat in the upper parts of the bay. They \nmove in here a little bit to feed, that's all. Mostly, we have some \ncrab fishing, we have some halibut fishing that is seasonal, and some \nbottom fish. These fish, as I have indicated, are not under any threat. \nThere is no danger to the resource. All are carefully managed for \nsubsistence harvest by the State of Alaska, and most of them are under \nlimited entry.\n  There is an argument out there that fishing is incompatible with such \nuses as sports fishing or kayaking, but these have been rejected by the \nvarious groups, the sport fishing groups, the kayak concessions, who \nfavor continuation of limited commercial fishing and subsistence \ngathering.\n  What are we really talking about in numbers? Because the big \nDepartment of Interior comes down and says they are opposed to this. \nThey want to eliminate this activity. But for the people, this is their \nlivelihood. They have no place else to go. They appeal to the Senate. \nI, as one of the two Senators from Alaska, proudly represent them in \ntheir voice crying out for fairness, crying out for justice.\n  The Gustavus community has 436 residents; 55 are actually engaged in \nfishing. Gustavus is right here. Elfin Cove across the way, directly \nacross, has 54 people. Out of those 54 people, 47 are engaged in \nfishing. Hoonah, a Tlingit Indian village, has 900 people, 228 involved \nin fishing. Pelican City, 187 residents, and 86 in fishing. That might \nnot sound like much, but these are real people. This is their real \nlifestyle, and they are pleading for fairness and justice. I think we \nhave an obligation to them.\n  Mr. President, let me just read a note from Wanda Culp, a Tlingit \nhistorian. This was written February 13, 1998. I quote:\n\n       The 1980 ANILCA law has done more damage to the Tlingit use \n     of Glacier Bay through National Park Service management. \n     Since the 1925 establishment of Glacier Bay National Park, \n     the National Park Service has been systematically eliminating \n     the native people, the Tlingit people, out of Glacier Bay \n     through their management practices.\n       In the 1970s, the National Park Service destroyed the Huna \n     fish camps, burned down the smoke houses when tourism began \n     its importance in Glacier Bay.\n\n  That is a little bit of the history. I could comment on the fisheries \nat greater length. I could comment on the research that suggests that \nthe French explorer, LaPerouse, in 1746, saw the local Tlingit fishing \nhere. The park was established in 1916. But the Tlingit people have \nused it as a fishing camp as long as recorded or verbal traditional \nhistory of that proud people exists.\n  I know we are going to have objections relative to prior arrangements \nconcerning Glacier Bay, and I hope my colleagues will note that in the \namendment we address the issue of the crab fishing, and I should like \nto refer to that.\n  In the amendment, we specifically say ``with the exception of the \nclosure of the Dungeness crab fisheries under section 123(b) of the \nDepartment of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.'' This \nis a certain type of fishery, a crab fishery, and we concede that a \nprevious agreement to close it is binding. So that crab fishery is \nclosed. There is no question about that. Compensation for that closure \nwas provided for, but has not yet been to fishermen.\n  The appeal to each and every Member is that while the State contests \nthe question of who has jurisdiction in Glacier Bay, the Native people \ncontinue to be allowed to subsist and gather, and that the limited \ncommercial fishery that is under the authority and management of the \nState of Alaska be allowed to continue.\n  Why deprive these people simply because this matter is going to be \nresolved in the courts of the United States, particularly--again, I \nwould emphasize--when we have acknowledged the number of national \nparks, marine refuges, and so forth that commercial fishing is allowed \nto take place in. So if we get into a debate, as we may, about any \nreference to the Dungeness crab and the compensation issue, I want to \nmake sure the Record reflects the reality that no binding agreement has \nbeen made on other fisheries in the bay. There was reference to \nallowing them to continue to fish without compensation for one \ngeneration. So we are accepting the agreement on the Dungeness crab, \nbut we are asking respectfully that we be allowed to continue the other \npresent practices within Glacier Bay until the court suit is settled.\n  You may wonder how this sits in the scheme of things, as we have \nexpended a good deal of time and effort debating Kosovo and whether we \nshould initiate an action there.\n  Well, here we are talking about a few real people in my State of \nAlaska, people who are out there whose lives and livelihoods, as they \nview it, are at risk. They are looking to us for relief. So by this \namendment, I implore my colleagues to recognize equity and fairness; \nhow these people have been, if you will, removed from their heritage by \nthe Park Service, and now that heritage is about to be terminated \ninasmuch as it would remove subsistence activities.\n\n  I remind my colleagues that while there has been proposed \nremuneration for fishermen, there has never been any proposed \nremuneration for the subsistence-dependent Native people. So I \nencourage consideration be given to the merits of what we are asking. I \nthink it is right. I think it is just. I think it is fair. If you \nconsider the overall scheme of things, the Park Service, while managing \nGlacier Bay, for reasons unknown to me, has had a difficult time trying \nto determine what is, indeed, a commercial activity that is OK; namely, \nthese large cruise ships, and what is no longer OK, which is a small \nfishing activity or the traditional rights of the Native people to \ngather in that area. There would be absolutely no harm done by allowing \nthis moratorium to stand, if, indeed, it prevails, until such time as \nthe courts resolve this issue once and for all as a consequence of the \nfact the State has seen fit to bring suit on who has jurisdiction over \nthe inland marine waters.\n  I see some of my colleagues may wish to discuss this amendment. I am \nhappy to respond to any questions.\n  I gather we are under no time agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n[[Page S3083]]\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. So if my colleagues want to talk about the amendment, \nI shall be pleased to respond to questions or comment a little later.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes. I intend to speak on this later though.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my good friend \nfrom Alaska. After all, he is one of the two Senators who represent the \nState of Alaska, and he believes strongly in this matter.\n  Mr. President, this is the very same matter we discussed 6 months \nago, exactly the same. This is one of those environmental riders which \nhas popped up again. It is the Glacier Bay environmental rider. That is \nthe environmental rider on the Interior appropriations bill of last \nyear, a bill that never came before the Senate, I think, with all due \nrespect to my good friend from Alaska, because a lot of Senators did \nnot want to have those votes on those environmental riders. There were \nseveral of them. And so the whole Interior appropriations bill was then \nsubmerged into the omnibus appropriations bill, that giant and super \ngranddaddy bill that came up before the House and Senate last year, and \nin that omnibus bill there was an agreement--this was a provision which \nwas an agreement essentially between the White House and the Senator \nfrom Alaska, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Stevens, \non this matter. We have already dealt with this. There is an agreement. \nIt was written into the law, and let me read you the agreement. This is \nthe law. The agreement says very simply:\n\n       The Secretary of Interior and the State of Alaska shall \n     cooperate in the development and the management and planning \n     for the regulation of commercial fisheries in Glacier Bay \n     National Park.\n\n  On and on. Then it goes on to say:\n\n       Such management plan shall provide for commercial fishing \n     in the marine waters within Glacier Bay National Park outside \n     of Glacier Bay proper and within marine waters within Glacier \n     Bay as specified in paragraph . . .\n\n  Anybody who wants to can read all of the relevant provisions. \nBasically, the agreement is this: That fishing, commercial fishing, \noutside of Glacier Bay is fine.\n  It is fine. Even fishing next to the boundaries of Glacier Bay is \nfine. A commercial fishery within Glacier Bay was to have certain \nrestrictions because there was a conflict between the national park \nvalues within Glacier Bay--for example, wilderness areas within Glacier \nBay--and commercial fishing interests within Glacier Bay.\n  So we worked out an agreement--the White House and Senator Stevens, \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee--worked out an agreement, \nof which I read part. Other parts of the agreement are not quite as \nrelevant as the parts I read. That is the essential nature of the \nagreement.\n  We have debated this before. This is not new. I stood on this floor \nseveral hours, with other Senators, debating other environmental \nriders. Izembek was an environmental rider; now we have Glacier Bay, \nanother environmental rider. After several hours of debate on the \nSenate floor, we concluded debate because the Interior appropriations \nbill never came up. It was withdrawn. It was then subsumed into the \nlarge omnibus appropriations bill with the agreement that I just \noutlined between the White House and the senior Senator from Alaska.\n  Now, here we are all over again; same issue, same subject; nothing \nnew.\n  I say to my colleagues, we have discussed this. We have debated it. \nWe have reached an agreement on this issue. We are here now on the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. We want to get this bill passed today \nso we can send it over to the other body and have a conference, come \nback, and be through with the supplemental appropriations this week.\n  Why prolong the Senate on an amendment which has already been \ndebated, an amendment which has already been agreed to, in the sense \nthat a compromise was worked out that recognized both the National Park \ninterests and the wilderness interests--which, after all, are American \ninterests--in Glacier Bay on the one hand, with the fishing interests \nand particularly the indigenous interests on the other hand?\n  I say to my colleagues, we are hearing this argument all over again. \nWe have an agreement. Essentially, what the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Alaska provides is to rescind that agreement. That is what the \namendment does, rescind it. It is couched a little bit by saying \nrescind it and tell the State that it will be rescinded until the State \nof Alaska has resolved its lawsuit with the Federal Government--but we \ndon't know when that will be; some lawsuits go on forever with appeals \nand so forth. It is essentially a recision of the agreement that we \nalready agreed to.\n  The State of Alaska and the Department of Interior are now engaging \nin discussions as to what the management plan at Glacier Bay should be. \nThose are ongoing discussions. To override the agreement we have \nreached just because a couple weeks ago we heard that the State of \nAlaska intends to file a lawsuit--a suit which may or may not occur, a \nsuit which may last for years; who knows if it will ever be finally \nterminated--and for us to then stop an agreement on that basis, I \nthink, does not make a lot of sense, frankly.\n  I think it makes much more sense--and this is a bit presumptuous on \nmy part--for the State of Alaska to, in good faith, sit down with the \nDepartment of Interior and see if they can work out any remaining \nissues. Certainly filing a lawsuit raises questions as to how feasible \nan agreement is, whether one can be reached. I say don't file the suit. \nSit down with the Department of Interior and try to work it out. If in \ngood faith the State of Alaska believes the Department of Interior is \nnot acting in good faith, then we will see what we can work out at that \npoint. We are not at that point. We are certainly not at that point \nwhen a lawsuit has been filed by the State of Alaska which only muddies \nthe waters--no pun intended--on this whole issue.\n  I am not going to go into all the details of this because we have \ngone over it so many times and in so many hours, except to say this has \nbeen debated, this very subject. This is one of those environmental \nriders which, incredibly, has popped up again. We have reached an \nagreement; the White House and the senior Senator from Alaska reached \nan agreement. I say abide by the agreement, try to make that work. If \nit doesn't work, then we will see if we can resolve it later.\n\n  We all understand the Senator from Alaska is here standing up for the \npeople at Glacier Bay, and I understand that. However, there is an \nagreement worked out in the omnibus appropriations bill. I say let's \nstand by that agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I reiterate some of the points that the \nSenator from Montana just made. I don't think anybody will dispute \nthis. The facts are as follows: In last year's Interior appropriations \nbill, there was a provision prohibiting the Secretary of Interior from \npromulgating regulations affecting commercial or subsistence fishing in \nGlacier Bay. As the Senator from Montana said, first of all, the \nDepartment of Interior found that provision objectionable in the \nappropriations bill, so they worked out with the senior Senator from \nAlaska a compromise that was included in the omnibus appropriations \nbill.\n  In other words, this is ``deja vu all over again.'' We have been down \nthis road. We reached a compromise, a compromise between Alaska and the \nDepartment of Interior. I really have great difficulty understanding \nwhy we are revisiting this 6 months later. I guess it isn't quite 6 \nmonths.\n  What did the compromise do? It required the Secretary of the Interior \nand the State of Alaska to develop a management plan, and the Senator \nfrom Montana has just referred to that. The management plan would allow \ncommercial fishing in the waters outside Glacier Bay and it would \nregulate a closed fishery within the bay. The compromise consists of \nthis management plan. They are going to work on it together.\n  In addition, shortly after that, in the supplemental appropriations \nbill, there\n\n[[Page S3084]]\n\nis an increase in compensation to the fishermen as a result of the \ncompromise. In other words, the fishermen are receiving more money as a \nresult of the compromise--the Federal Government is paying out money. \nWe are doing our part of the bargain.\n  I hope that the Senator from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, will not \npress this amendment. There is, as I say, the groundwork for a \nmanagement plan and the State of Alaska has filed notice of an intent \nto sue within the past 2 weeks. They are in that suit; they are going \nto claim ownership over the submerged lands.\n  If they don't like the management plan that they work out, then they \ncan go back to their suit. But I don't think we ought to be here \ndebating this all over again just after we reopen everything. Can't we \narrive at any conclusions around this place?\n  As I say, less than 6 months ago a deal was reached with the senior \nSenator from Alaska. My question to the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee is, Why don't we stick with that agreement? Indeed, as I \nmentioned before, the Alaska fishermen have benefited from it because \nthere have been payments to them pursuant to the compromise that was \nworked out.\n  Let me say I can totally understand the enthusiasm of the Senator \nfrom Alaska to get more. We all like more. It seems to me at some point \nwe have to reach closure on these things. Indeed, as both of us have \nmentioned and referred to the compromise that seemed to settle this, \nthe issues were exactly the same.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond to my friend from Rhode Island, I \nthink he is confusing or misinterpreting the intent of our amendment.\n  If one examines the amendment closely, there is a recognition of the \ndeal that was made last year. That recognition is in line 5 where it \nsays,\n\n       . . . except the closure of Dungeness crab fisheries under \n     Section 123(b) of the Department of Interior and Related \n     Agencies.\n\n  We are abiding by that arrangement that was made and we are not \nchanging that.\n  The crab fishermen, I might add, would much rather fish than be paid \nby the Federal Government not to fish. They are, in fact, being \neliminated from their fishery in that particular part of Glacier Bay.\n  To suggest that we are changing the deal is, in fact, totally \ninaccurate and, again, is a misinterpretation.\n  I hope that my distinguished colleague will recognize that, indeed, \nthere is a difference. First of all, the crab fishermen have not been \npaid one red cent by the Federal Government. They will, hopefully, be \npaid, but that has not occurred yet. We are talking about the balance \nof the fishery, which amounts to some bottom fish and some halibut.\n  We are also talking about something that is more important, which \nreally, I say to the Senator from Rhode Island, is overlooked: What is \nthe value of the subsistence to the dependent Native people who are \nbeing kicked out and eliminated? They are not receiving any \nremuneration or being taken care of in any deal. Would that be just, I \nask my friend from Rhode Island, if it were his State? Would it be \nright if the indigenous people could no longer gather sea gull eggs \nwhen they don't have chickens? I mean that in a literal sense because, \nas the Senator is well aware, we don't have any chickens up there; it \nis too wet, too cold. They rely on a few sea gull eggs, and they have \nalways been allowed to do that, for generation after generation. Is \nthat justice?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, in last year's appropriations bill, there \nwas language that went beyond the crabbers. It included a provision \nprohibiting the Secretary of the Interior from promulgating regulations \naffecting commercial or subsistence fishing. So that was the provision \nin last year's bill. The Department of the Interior found those, as I \nmentioned, provisions objectionable, so they worked out a compromise. \nThe compromise was meant to cover the entire rider that was involved. \nIt wasn't meant to settle the deal.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That isn't what the amendment says.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Which amendment?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It eliminates the crab fishery. That was the \narrangement made last year. Those fishermen are to be given \nremuneration for not fishing by the Federal Government. They would much \nrather fish.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. In other words, you exclude them?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. They are excluded, yes. That is the only agreement \nthat has been made and binding for remuneration.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. There may not be provisions for remuneration, but the \nprovisions that you originally had last year in your rider were \nencompassed within the deal with Senator Stevens, and so the matter was \nsettled as far as everybody goes, plus the admonition--I guess you can \ncall it that--that they would reach this management plan--I don't know \nwhat has become of that--but also the State of Alaska proceeded to file \nsuit in this thing anyway.\n  So it seems to me that what you are proposing here is to undo \nsomething that was agreed to last year--not just in connection with the \ncrabbers, which you mentioned, but with the total package that you had \nin your rider last year. And so it was settled, it seemed to me. That \nis all I have to say.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Well, Mr. President, perhaps I can enlighten my \ncolleagues a little bit. I would be prepared to respond to questions. \nHe refers to waiting for a management plan from the Park Service. We \nhave that management plan, Mr. President. That management plan is quite \nexplicit. It is to close the commercial activities associated with \nfishing. I encourage my colleague to recognize it for what it is. If \nyou look at this picture, this is commercial fishing activity. They \ndon't want commercialization of the park. I don't see my friends from \nMontana or Rhode Island commenting about this commercial activity, \nwhere 2,000 people are aboard this ship. That is a commercial activity. \nThey are paying to come into Glacier Bay.\n  The management plan is a management dictate by the Department of the \nInterior to kick out the fishermen and to eliminate the Native people \nfrom Hoonah, Elfin Cove, and so on. There is not an awful lot of \naffection for the Park Service, which I think my friend from Montana, \nwho knows something about rural America, understands when the Federal \nGovernment just comes in through a process of osmosis and dictates more \nand more attention.\n  Now, we have not changed this deal. Last year's deal eliminates the \nDungeness crab for compensation. It is in the amendment. The other \nfisheries inside the bay were proposed to be closed--and this is what I \nthink he is referring to--after one generation without compensation. \nThey don't have any compensation. So basically, when you suggest that \nthe State and Federal Government can work together on some kind of a \nmanagement resolve, the Federal Government has spoken. It is kicking \nthem out.\n\n  The Federal Government maintains that it has jurisdiction over the \ninland waters. The State has seen fit to indicate that it is going to \nfile suit to determine who has jurisdiction. Make no mistake about it, \nMr. President, the Federal Government and Department of the Interior \nhas a philosophy of creeping bureaucracy where they extend their \njurisdiction; and they can do it if the State is not successful in \nresolving its suit. They have jurisdiction 3 miles out from Federal \nland. Believe me, it is just a matter of time before they come around \nfor Bartlett Cove and go out to Cape Spencer and north from Cape \nSpencer up toward Yakutat.\n  So we are accepting the Dungeness crab deal. But there is no \njustification for more--and I implore my colleagues to recognize this. \nLet the courts decide it, but for goodness sake, in the meantime, allow \nthe Native people to continue what they have been doing for thousands \nof years; allow the limited commercial fishery to continue until such \ntime as the court gets it resolved.\n  I would love to compromise on this, but there is no compromise with \nthe Park Service. They want to eliminate the fisheries. The State has \nbrought suit. That is what is new and different about this. My \ncolleagues fail to recognize that the State is saying, OK, it is time \nto settle the jurisdiction issue. We have tried to negotiate and work \nout with the Park Service a management plan that would allow the State \nto continue to manage it. What does the Park Service know about \nmanaging fisheries? They have no biologists. The State of Alaska spends \nmore than any other State on fishery biology; we are\n\n[[Page S3085]]\n\ngood at it. That is why we have fish. To suggest that the Park Service \nshould enter into an process to generate expertise in this area is \nunreasonable, impractical and, finally, unnecessary.\n  We have nothing but creeping advancement by the Department of the \nInterior within our State because we are a public land State. But it is \ntime that the people of Alaska express their views, and they have \nexpressed their views through the Governor's announcement of the suit.\n  Again, it is not the same as 6 months ago. The lawsuit changes that. \nThe omnibus bill, in spite of what my colleagues from Montana and Rhode \nIsland have said, was not ever considered satisfactory; it was only \nconsidered to delay more sweeping closures. To suggest that this matter \nhas been debated on this floor is totally inaccurate. It has not been \ndebated before. This is to allow the judicial process to be completed, \nand that is what the suit is all about.\n  Again, in the interest of fairness, Mr. President, why does the Park \nService say it is OK to commercially fish in Maryland, in Assateague; \nin Florida, Biscayne; in the Virgin Islands, Buck Island; in Canaveral, \nFlorida; in Cape Hatteras, North Carolina; in Channel Islands, \nCalifornia; in Fire Island, New York; in Gulf Island, Alabama and \nFlorida, on and on and on. But it is not OK anymore here. Here you have \nan added dimension. You have the people--the few hundred people who are \ndependent on Glacier Bay for a subsistence lifestyle and a small amount \nof commercial fishing.\n\n  We are not reneging on any deal, we are merely keeping people \nworking--keeping people working, keeping people employed, keeping \npeople productive while the jurisdictional issue is decided. What in \nthe world is wrong with that? The courts are going to make this \ndecision. But, for goodness' sake, let the people who are dependent on \nit for their lifestyle and their traditions continue.\n  Mr. President, I have gone on long enough. If there are some \nquestions of my friend from Montana, I would be happy to answer.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have a few brief questions, if I might. \nThe question is, Has the State of Alaska filed a lawsuit?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. No. As I indicated, the State indicated its intent to \nfile a lawsuit and will be filing it late this summer or early this \nfall.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Assuming they will file late this summer, or early this \nfall, on this issue, how long might that lawsuit be pending?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am sure the Senator from Montana would agree that \nneither he nor I has any idea. The point is, these people have had \naccess to the park for thousands of years. And what difference does 6 \nmonths or a year make?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Might that lawsuit conceivably take a couple, or 5, or 10 \nyears before it is resolved? Is that possible?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I hope it will not. I hope it will be very short.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. But it is possible.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I don't know. We have had access since we became a \nState in 1959 and the Federal Government always recognized the state's \nmanagement. They have technically allowed this to go on since 1959. \nSuddenly, under this administration, they are kicking us out.\n  So I don't know what a year, or 2, or 3, necessarily has to do with \nit. The point is, it is going to be resolved. If the State loses, it is \nall over.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by explaining why it is important for \nthe Senate to address this issue. Again, we should not put people on \npublic assistance without a cause. That is what we are doing here with \nthese subsistence dependents. We shouldn't second-guess the court. Let \nthe court decide, and recognize that there are real people out there--\nreal constituents of mine and yours--whose lives and livelihoods are \nreally at risk, and they are looking to you and me for relief. This is \nall they have.\n  So I implore my colleagues to recognize the legitimacy of this.\n  It will be my intention, Mr. President, at the appropriate time, to \nask for the yeas and nays, subject to whatever the joint leadership \ndecides to do about future votes. But I will ask for a vote on the \namendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I don't know why \nthis issue needs to go on forever. It is deja vu all over again.\n  The Senator from Alaska has admitted that his amendment has the \neffect of preventing the management plan from going into effect for \nyears--5, 10, who knows how many years--because his amendment \nessentially says no funds may be expended by the Secretary of Interior \nto implement the plan until such time as the State of Alaska's legal \nclaim over ownership and jurisdiction, et cetera, is resolved. Who \nknows how long that is going to take? That could take a long, long \ntime. That would mean for up to many, many years that this issue \nremains unresolved.\n  We resolved this issue in the omnibus appropriations bill. It was \nresolved. The senior Senator from Alaska agreed with the White House on \nthe compromise, recognizing, on the one hand, the interests of the \nnational park and the wilderness area and, on the other hand, the \nfishing interests of the people who live in and about Glacier Bay. It \nhas already been agreed to. There is a compromise agreed to by both \nsides--the Senator from Alaska, the senior Senator, Senator Stevens, \nand the White House--in the omnibus appropriations bill. It has been \nagreed to.\n\n  So here we are now faced with an amendment which undoes that \nagreement. It very simply undoes that agreement by saying no funds may \nbe expended with respect to any management plan in Glacier Bay until a \nlawsuit, not yet filed, is resolved. I say that we should go ahead with \nthe plan. We should go ahead with working out the provisions of the \nplan. The State of Alaska can still file its lawsuit if it wants to. \nAnd that lawsuit may or may not change the result.\n  In addition, I might add, this is a national park. This is a \nwilderness area. This has very pristine values which all Americans want \nto protect. We do at the same time want to recognize--and do \nrecognize--the interests of the fishermen in Glacier Bay; thus, the \ncompromise. The compromise, the agreement, is already reached. It has \nbeen debated ad nauseam. So I am going to stop right here.\n  I urge the Senate to uphold the original agreement, which most \nSenators already agreed to when they voted for the omnibus \nappropriations bill last year.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to read my \namendment and recognize the consideration that has been made to live by \nthe agreement by recognizing that the closure of a Dungeness fishery \nunder this section will occur as agreed to, and the balance of the \nfisheries have never been addressed on this floor or debated.\n  I conclude by referring to one remark, which my friend made \nconcerning this beautiful wilderness and the opposition of commercial \nactivity. Just look at this cruise ship with nearly 3,000 people on it, \nif you want to see the commercial activity and compare that to the \nsensitivity of my subsistence-dependent Native people whose lives are \nat risk as a consequence of not having an opportunity to pursue their \ntraditional resources and their appeal to you and me for relief.\n  I have no further statements. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily laid aside so that I may take up an amendment \nwhich I believe has been or will be cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 131\n\n  (Purpose: To authorize payments in settlement of claims for deaths \n arising from the accident involving a United States Marine Corps A-6 \n          aircraft on February 3, 1998, near Cavalese, Italy)\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S3086]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia (Mr. Robb), for himself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. \n     Kerrey proposes an amendment numbered 131.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 27, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec. 203. (a) Authority To Make Payments.--Subject to the \n     provisions of this section, the Secretary of Defense is \n     authorized to make payments for the settlement of the claims \n     arising from the deaths caused by the accident involving a \n     United States Marine Corps EA-6B aircraft on February 3, \n     1998, near Cavalese, Italy.\n       (b) Deadline for Exercise of Authority.--The Secretary \n     shall make the decision to exercise the authority in \n     subsection (a) not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Source of Payments.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, of the amounts appropriated or otherwise \n     made available for the Department of Navy for operation and \n     maintenance for fiscal year 1999 or other unexpended balances \n     from prior years, the Secretary shall make available $40 \n     million only for emergency and extraordinary expenses \n     associated with the settlement of the claims arising from the \n     accident described in subsection (a).\n       (d) Amount of Payment.--The amount of the payment under \n     this section in settlement of the claims arising from the \n     death of any person associated with the accident described in \n     subsection (a) may not exceed $2,000,000.\n       (e) Treatment of Payments.--Any amount paid to a person \n     under this section is intended to supplement any amount \n     subsequently determined to be payable to the person under \n     section 127 or chapter 163 of title 10, United States Code, \n     or any other provision of law for administrative settlement \n     of claims against the United States with respect to damages \n     arising from the accident described in subsection (a).\n       (f) Construction.--The payment of an amount under this \n     section may not be considered to constitute a statement of \n     legal liability on the part of the United States or otherwise \n     as evidence of any material fact in any judicial proceeding \n     or investigation arising from the accident described in \n     subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today not only in my capacity as a \nU.S. Senator but also as a former U.S. Marine and as a father.\n  Along with Senators Snowe, Leahy, Feinstein, Kerrey, Bingaman, and \nothers, I am offering an amendment that will permit the United States \nto shoulder unambiguously its responsibility, uphold the honor of the \nU.S. military, both at home and abroad, and begin to ease the grieving \nof 20 families who lost their loved ones in a tragic accident near \nCavalese, Italy, last year.\n  On February 3, 1998, a U.S. Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler was flying low \nand fast through the Italian Alps on a training mission. Just minutes \nfrom its scheduled return to base, the pilot suddenly caught a glimpse \nof a yellow gondola off to his right at eye level.\n  A split second later, he spotted the two cables that carried the \ngondola, and, fearing for his life, he put the plane into a dive. His \naction probably saved the lives of the four-member crew, but it was not \nenough to prevent the wingtip from clipping the cables.\n  Unaware of the devastation left in his wake, he completed his mission \nand returned the damaged plane to Aviano Air Base.\n  The plane's wing had stretched and then snapped the cables supporting \nthe gondola, which was then 307 feet above the valley floor. Inside \nwere 20 people; among them, a Polish mother and her 14-year-old boy, \nseven German friends, and five Belgian friends, including an engaged \ncouple.\n  I am told that those 20 people had just 8 seconds to live from the \ntime the cable was struck. Eight seconds doesn't seem like a long time, \nunless you know you are going to die.\n  [Pause.]\n  That was eight seconds. The next day in Cavalese, Italy, a lone bell \ntolled. Shops ``closed for mourning,'' a memorial mass was planned and \nskiing was halted out of respect for the dead. And the families of \nthose dead spent their first day of grief.\n  One year later, Cavalese is once again teeming with tourists. The \ncable car has been rebuilt, and a memorial stone erected.\n  One year later, however, the United States has not yet acted to \naccept full responsibility for those twenty deaths. Following a lengthy \ncourt martial, the pilot of the jet was acquitted of any criminal \nwrongdoing. President Clinton reacted by stating that the United States \nwould ``unambiguously shoulder the responsibility for what happened.'' \nWe need to follow those words with deeds. We need to accept our \nresponsibility by compensating the families of the victims, quickly and \nfairly. While many factors contributed to this accident, and we may \nnever know exactly which one was the proximate cause, we do know that \nit was our fault. They were our air crew. It was our plane.\n  Because there is no question whether the United States is responsible \nfor the accident, the only question is whether we have the will to act \nhonorably and settle the issue of compensating the families quickly--\ndoing everything we can to not prolong their agony--for they have \nalready suffered unspeakable grief.\n  Since last summer, I have repeatedly urged the Department of Defense \nto develop a mechanism that acknowledges our responsibility and allows \nthe families to begin putting their lives back together. And I believe \nevery official in the Department associated with this matter shares \nthis desire to put the tragedy behind us. Unfortunately, the Department \nof Defense does not believe it has the authority to resolve these \nclaims on its own.\n  This belief stems from the Department's conclusion that this case is \ngoverned solely by the Status of Forces Agreement, or SOFA, which \nregulates the relationship among the military forces of NATO allies. \nFollowing an accident in a host country involving a NATO ally, the SOFA \nrequires injured third parties to file claims in the host country and \npursue them as if the host country itself had caused the injury. Then, \nthe claims are litigated or settled as the host country determines. \nOnce a level of compensation is decided, the host country pays the \nclaim and seeks reimbursement of 75% of that claim from the country at \nfault.\n  The Department of Defense has informed me of its belief that the SOFA \nprovides the sole remedy in this case and that therefore the DoD does \nnot have the authority to settle the claims of the families arising \nfrom this accident.\n  While I disagree with that conclusion, this amendment resolves the \nquestion. My amendment specifically grants the Department the authority \nthey believe they presently lack, rather than forcing the families to \nwait to resolve this question in a judicial process that could take \nmany years. The amendment allows the Secretary to settle the claims and \nsets aside $40 million for that sole purpose. It leaves to the \nSecretary the discretion to determine an amount of compensation, but \nlimits the Secretary to offering no more than $2 million for any single \nclaim. Further, it requires the Secretary to move quickly and resolve \nthe claims within 90 days after enactment of this legislation. Finally, \nmy amendment explicitly avoids interfering with the ongoing SOFA \nprocess.\n\n  This is an important point. The SOFA allows civil claims to be \ndecided in the host country but criminal allegations to be decided in \nthe country at fault. This structure protects local citizens in the \nhost country from having civil claims decided on the ``home turf'' of \nthe wrong-doer, while also protecting our troops from criminal \nprosecutions in another nation. Some have suggested that if we adopt \nthis amendment, we put at risk this entire structure of the SOFA. I \nfail to see the logic of this assertion. I doubt any country would move \nto scrap the SOFA and begin trying members of our military in their \ncourts simply because we offered a supplemental payment to own up to \nour responsibility for a tragic accident. In fact, I believe such an \nact of acknowledgment would have just the opposite effect, and reduce \nthe tensions that the acquittal in this case have created. My belief is \nbased in part on the fact that three of our NATO allies who lost \ncitizens in this accident support this amendment. In fact, the \nambassador from Belgium wrote to me that his country ``would welcome \neach initiative that might contribute to a quick settlement of the \nclaims of the victims' families. In that spirit, we fully support your \nproposed amendment to S. 544, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations \nAct, and hope that your proposal will gain the necessary support in the \nU.S. Senate.'' He goes on to state his belief that this\n\n[[Page S3087]]\n\n``legislative initiative is not incompatible with the SOFA-procedure.'' \nThe German and Polish governments share this view.\n  I've been sensitive to the concerns of the Department of Defense \nregarding the importance of the SOFA, which is why the amendment speaks \nin terms of supplementing the SOFA, not displacing it. The SOFA has \nworked well for over forty years and I have no intention of disrupting \nthat process with this amendment.\n  But we also need to consider the purpose of that process. In 1953, \nwhen the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations was considering the \nSOFA, they wrote that the structure of the claims process was \n``calculated to reduce to a minimum the friction that almost inevitably \narises from [injuries caused by members of a foreign military] against \nmembers of the local population.'' In this case, however, I believe \nblind adherence to the perceived requirements of the SOFA is causing \nfriction with our NATO allies, not reducing it.\n  The procedures established in the SOFA are designed to do justice. In \nthis case, under these circumstances, justice is best served by having \nthe United States take responsibility for the harm we've caused.\n  Last July, the Senate adopted unanimously a Sense of the Senate I \noffered stating that ``the United States, in order to maintain its \ncredibility and honor amongst its allies and all nations of the world, \nshould make prompt reparations for an accident clearly caused by United \nStates military aircraft'' and that ``without our prompt action, these \nfamilies will continue to suffer financial agonies, our credibility in \nthe European community continues to suffer, and our own citizens remain \npuzzled and angered by our lack of accountability.''\n  Since last July, each of our predictions have sadly been realized. \nOur allies, especially Italy where we have strategically important \nbasing agreements, are outraged by our lack of accountability. They \nfeel angry and betrayed. Americans everywhere cannot understand why we \ndon't act to accept responsibility for the deaths of these 20 people. \nEditorial writers from the New York Times to the San Francisco \nChronicle, the Cleveland Plain Dealer to the Atlanta Constitution have \ncalled for prompt and adequate compensation to the families of those \nwho were killed.\n  Finally, I have met with many of the family members. Some have been \npushed nearly into poverty, having lost their primary means of \nfinancial support. Last September, I met with three of the Belgian \nfamilies, as well as the Polish doctor who would have been in the \ngondola with his wife and son if he had not strained a leg muscle and \ndecided not to take the final run of the day. Last Thursday, I met with \nfamilies of the German victims.\n  Having met personally with the families, I can tell you they are not \nangry with the United States, but they don't understand. They are \ngrieving, but they are not greedy. They want accountability, but they \nare not vindictive. They simply want someone to be held responsible for \nthe deaths of their children, their husbands, their wives.\n  That is what my amendment is about--responsibility. It is not about \nmoney. Compensation is no substitute for the companionship of a lost \nloved one. By resolving these cases now, however, the United States can \nclearly and unambiguously acknowledge its undeniable culpability in the \ndeaths of these twenty people, something the families have so far \nsought without success.\n  In speaking with the families following the first court-martial, I \nhave been struck by a single seemingly incomprehensible fact regarding \nits outcome. They were not so much determined that the pilot spend his \nlife in jail. They simply sought closure on the question of who was \nresponsible for the deaths of their loved ones so they could begin to \ncope with the loss. They also wanted the chance, at sentencing if it \nhad come to that, to talk about those who had died. I invited them to \ndo that when I met with them. As they described their children, I \nthought of my own. Last week, I asked the mother of one of the victims \nif she had a picture. She removed the locket from around her neck, with \nthe photos of her dead son and his wife she keeps near her heart.\n  The Belgian families also shared pictures with me last September. I \nwanted to show those to you. Stefan, aged 28, shown here with his \nmother; and Hadewich, aged 24; and Rose-Marie, also aged 24. In an \ninterview late last year, Rose-Marie's father said he drove by the \ngraveyard every day, and said hello to his daughter. He explained why \nhe did this: ``It's easy. We have lost our daughter, but she is still a \nlittle bit alive there. To say hello to her is a way for me to ease the \nstress a little bit. And it is also a tribute to her. I say: Rose-\nMarie, you gave us so much love and joy, I am trying to give it back to \nyou as much as possible.''\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and set \naside $40 million for these families. To put that into some \nperspective, the plane involved in this accident cost some $60 million, \nand fortunately for us neither the plane nor the crew were lost.\n  In the Defense Appropriations bill last year, the Congress set aside \n$20 million to enable the town to rebuild its gondola, a project which \nhas cost nearly $18 million to date. In fact, my amendment is modeled \nafter Section 8114 of the bill we adopted last year, which set aside \nthe $20 million from the Department of the Navy's Operation and \nMaintenance account to pay for ``property damages resulting from the \naccident.'' The President has acknowledged that our willingness to set \naside these funds has helped ``speed the economic recovery process'' of \nthe town.\n  Here is a picture of that new gondola. Last year, the Congress passed \nan amendment to help rebuild the gondola our aircraft destroyed. This \nyear, the Congress should pass an amendment to help rebuild the lives \nof the loved ones our aircraft destroyed. Let us show the world we care \nas much about loss of life as we do about loss of property.\n  I urge adoption of my amendment. The honor of the United States is at \nstake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise as an enthusiastic co-sponsor of the \nRobb amendment to the fiscal year 1999 emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  By giving the Secretary of Defense the discretionary authority to \ncompensate the families of the 20 victims of the tragic Marine Corps \naircraft accident near Cavalese, Italy last Winter, Congress would \nclose a moral gap between the United States and millions of grieving \ncitizens in our allied countries.\n  The victims of the Cavalese accident came from six European \ncountries, and the depth of this tragedy has led Secretary Cohen to \nappoint a panel under the leadership of retired Adm. Joseph Prueher to \ndetermine whether faulty training, mapping, or equipment malfunctions \ncontributed to the plane's severing of a ski resort cable that led to \nthe 20 innocent deaths.\n  Depending on the findings of the Prueher Commission, the judgment of \nSecretary Cohen, and the outcome of ongoing U.S. military litigation \nregarding the Cavalese incident, our amendment gives the Pentagon the \nflexibility to provide direct cash payments of up to $2 million per \nvictim to the families of the deceased.\n  Under the Status of Forces Agreement, or SOFA, between the United \nStates and each of its NATO Allies, we have already repaid the $60,000-\nper-victim amount given to the families by the Italian Government. In \naddition, the administration has agreed to furnish up to 75 percent of \nany wrongful death civil suit damages awarded to the families by the \nItalian courts.\n  But SOFA culpability applies only to the negligent acts of U.S. \nmilitary personnel operating on the territory of an allied nation. The \nagreement does not apply to reckless activities that occur on U.S. \nterritory but contribute to the causes of an accident overseas.\n  These possible activities in the Cavalese case, such as reliance on \nan insufficiently detailed map, a potentially malfunctioning aircraft \naltimeter, or inadequate pilot training, remain unresolved. But if \nconclusive findings show that developments on American soil had a \nrelationship with the tragedy of Cavalese, SOFA would prohibit the \nUnited States from offering any further compensation to the families of \nthe victims. In the meantime, the Italian litigation could end\n\n[[Page S3088]]\n\ninconclusively and continue for several years.\n  Beyond our moral obligation on this matter, Mr. President, we have \nstrong legislative precedents for the Robb amendment. The fiscal year \n1999 Defense appropriations bill set aside $20 million for the property \ndamage that the military plane caused at the resort.\n  In addition, the Senate unanimously adopted a resolution last summer \ncalling for the United States to resolve the claims of the Cavalese \nvictims ``as quickly and fairly as possible.''\n  Finally, this new funding would require no offsets, and the \nCongressional Budget Office has certified the Robb amendment as \nrevenue-neutral.\n  Congress, Mr. President, acted wisely last year in compensating the \nItalians for the physical damage done at the ski resort. It should take \nsimilar action today to provide the Defense Department with legal \nauthority for the compensation of the families who lost their loved \nones in this tragedy.\n  I therefore urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment on a \nstrong bipartisan basis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for his \ncourtesy in working with us to try to assure that the provisions \nregarding the timeframe for decision by the Secretary were not a \nmandate but, rather, a period of time within which the discretion \nconferred on the Secretary must be made. Under the circumstances of the \nchanged form of this amendment that the Senator has now presented, one \nwhich I find we are all very sympathetic to, I am prepared now to \naccept this amendment and ask that the Senate allow this amendment to \ngo forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for his \neffort to resolve this so that we can go forward. I very much \nappreciate that. We have been working with the Department of Defense \nand many others, but I particularly appreciate his willingness to \naccept the amendment at this point.\n  I have no additional debate, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I know this part of Italy. I know what \nthe Senator is trying to do. I think there is a national obligation on \nour part to try to reach out as much as we possibly can under the \ncircumstances. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider is laid upon the table.\n  The amendment (No. 131) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 130\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if I may, in connection with the debate \nthat just took place involving my colleague, Senator Murkowski, I would \nlike to point out the statement that I made on October 21 of last year \nin connection with the proposal that was in the conference report \nregarding Glacier Bay commercial fishing. I made this statement about \nmatters the way that we finally arranged them in that bill and the \nprovision that was passed at my suggestion. I said:\n\n       I view this compromise as an insurance policy, a safety net \n     that offers better protection to Glacier Bay's fishermen than \n     was offered by the draft Park Service regulations, but I do \n     not view it as the end of the story. There are provisions \n     that I do not like.\n\n  For that reason, I have cosponsored Senator Murkowski's amendment \nthis year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about the \namendment that Senator Stevens just referred to. Senator Murkowski's \namendment related to Glacier Bay. Senator Murkowski's amendment would \nprohibit the Secretary of Interior from expending any funds to \nimplement closures or other restrictions of subsistence or commercial \nfishing or subsistence gathering within Glacier Bay National Park. This \nprohibition would continue under the language of the amendment. The \nprohibition would continue until the State of Alaska's claim to \njurisdiction over ownership of the submerged lands in Glacier Bay were \nresolved, either by a final determination by the judiciary or by a \nsettlement between the parties.\n  The amendment, as I understand it, would undo a compromise that \nSenator Stevens entered into last year with Secretary Babbitt. \nCertainly it was understood by the Secretary of Interior as a \ncompromise on last year's appropriation bill. In addition, Senator \nStevens has already included an amendment earlier this week in the \nsupplemental appropriation bill which provides additional money to buy \nout commercial crabbing operations in Glacier Bay.\n  The issue of regulating commercial fishing in Glacier Bay is an \nextremely contentious issue. There were attempts in the last Congress \nto include an appropriations amendment that would have prohibited the \nPark Service from enforcing restrictions on commercial fishing in \nGlacier Bay National Park. The amendment was strongly opposed by the \nadministration. The Secretary of Interior indicated that he would \nrecommend the President veto the bill if the amendment was included. I \nhave been informed that the Secretary of Interior will, if this \namendment is included in the final version of this bill going to him, \nagain recommend a veto.\n  The provision that was finally agreed upon last year between \nSecretary Babbitt and the Senator from Alaska, I understood, resolved \nthe issue and provided the Park Service and commercial fishing \noperators with certainty as to future fishing operations in the park. \nIf this current amendment is adopted, that certainty, of course, will \nbe disrupted.\n  The amendment that is being offered this year would make major policy \nchanges in the management of Glacier Bay. These changes should not be \nconsidered as part of this emergency spending bill.\n  As I am sure we all know, Senator Murkowski is chairman of the \nappropriate committee to consider this legislation. I serve as the \nranking member of that committee. What we should do is consider this \nmatter in a hearing before that committee before bringing it to the \nSenate floor.\n  The amendment states that no funds may be expended by the Secretary \nto implement closures or other restrictions of subsistence or \ncommercial fishing or subsistence gathering in Glacier Bay National \nPark. This would mean that the Park Service would be completely unable \nto regulate commercial fishing operations within the park.\n  The amendment would appear to override wildlife and resource \nprotections required by other laws, including the Endangered Species \nAct. For example, fishing is currently prohibited for four fish species \nwhich provide critical food resources for the endangered humpback \nwhale. No other park in the country is prohibited from protecting its \nresources as this amendment would prohibit this park from protecting \nits resources.\n  The amendment states that the funding and enforcement prohibition is \nto remain in effect until the claim of jurisdiction of the State of \nAlaska claim ``has been resolved either by a final determination of the \njudiciary or by settlement.''\n  Last week, the State of Alaska filed a notice of intent to file a \nlawsuit, but it should be clear to all here, everyone should understand \nthat there has not been a suit filed yet.\n  The amendment that has been offered would prohibit the Park Service \nfrom taking any actions to protect any of its resources from commercial \nor subsistence fishing or from subsistence gathering for the entire \ntime period that this future lawsuit might be litigated.\n  Senator Murkowski is claiming that the amendment simply allows local \nNative communities to gather seagull eggs from the park. However, \nunlike some other parks in Alaska, subsistence is not an authorized use \nin this park. If these types of fundamental changes to the Alaska \nNational Interest Lands Conservation Act are required, then it should \nbe considered in the normal legislative process. This is not simply a \nNative issue. The amendment would allow all Alaskans to collect plant \nand wildlife resources in the park and with the Park Service unable to \nregulate any of these activities.\n  In short, Mr. President, this amendment makes far-reaching policy \nchanges in the law that applies to this particular national park. It is \ncontrary to the policy that applies in all other national parks. It is \ncontrary to the action we took last year, and it is one which I am \nconstrained to oppose.\n\n[[Page S3089]]\n\n  I hope the Senate will not adopt this amendment as part of the bill. \nIf it is adopted, I am advised that the Secretary of the Interior will \nurge the President to veto the bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Alaska on the \nfloor. I am about to move to table the Murkowski amendment and to give \nthe Senator notice as to when he may or may not want to vote on this.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold that? I \nunderstand my colleague would like to respond briefly before that \nmotion is made. If the Senator will accord him that courtesy, I will \nappreciate it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Fine.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, in 1995, the Department of Defense agreed \nto evaluate a British missile, the Starstreak, for use as a helicopter \nborne air-to-air missile as an inducement to the British Ministry of \nDefence to choose the U.S. Army Apache Longbow helicopter as its own \nattack helicopter over a competing European candidate. The British did \nindeed agree to buy the Apache.\n  Increasingly, military helicopters are being outfitted with air-to-\nair missiles that increase their lethality, a development that began \nwith the Russian HIND helicopter. According to the Army Air to Air \nMission Need Statement, the proliferation of technology available on \nthe open market will make it likely that U.S. forces will encounter \nthreat helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, lethal unmanned aerial \nvehicles and cruise missiles. The Army believes the probability is \nincreasing that Army helicopters will encounter an airborne threat and \nrecognizes that Army helicopters need an improved air-to-air capability \nto counter that threat.\n  This is why the Congress has been directing the Army to fulfill its \ncommitment to the British Ministry of Defence and its own air-to-air \nneeds by conducting an operational test and evaluation of the \nStarstreak through a live fire side-by-side shoot-off of the Starsteak \nand the Army's preferred alternative, the air-to-air Stinger.\n  Mr. President, at this time I would like to engage the chairman and \nranking member of the Appropriations Committee in a colloquy along with \nmy colleague from Oklahoma and the distinguished senior Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank my colleague from Oklahoma. He and I have worked \ntogether on this issue over the past several years. We proposed that \nthe Appropriations Committee address the issue of an operational test \nand evaluation in its bill and they did so after the Army failed to \ncomply with report language that was included in the FY 1998 Defense \nAppropriations Conference Report. To me, it is clear that the Congress \ndirected the Army, in bill language in Title IV of the FY 1999 Defense \nAppropriations Act, to begin the development of a test and evaluation \nplan during this fiscal year using the $15 million provided in Title IV \nas well as to commence work integrating the two candidate missiles on \nan AH-64D helicopter; and that the money could be used for no other \npurpose. Does the distinguished Chairman agree with me?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do.\n  Mr. LEAHY. As a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I \nam familiar with the Congress' involvement in this program and the \nspecific provisions under discussion. The law requires that the \nSecretary of the Army make certain certifications concerning the \nmissiles and the program prior to the conduct of the actual test. The \nrequired certifications must be made at the appropriate time, which is \njust prior to the actual live-firings. I understand that the \nrequirement for these certifications has caused some confusion about \nwhat efforts the Army can take during Fiscal Year 1999. I believe the \nlaw is clear with respect to what the Army should be doing. The Army \nwas directed to commence its efforts in Fiscal Year 1999. We believe \nthat such efforts should include, at a minimum, development of a test \nplan and the letting of contracts, using the $15 million provided by \nthe Appropriations Committee, to begin the systems integration work. Is \nthis the Chairman's understanding also?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes it is.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am very familiar with this issue and have discussed it \nat length with the Army. We expect that the Secretary of the Army will \nprovide the requisite certifications at the appropriate time, which is \njust prior to the actual conduct of the live-fire tests. I know that in \nthe case of Starstreak, the missile contractor must make certain \nmodifications at its own expense in order to make the missile \ncompatible for use at air speeds consistent with the normal operating \nlimits of the Apache helicopter and consistent with the survivability \nof the aircraft. The missile contractor has briefed these fixes to the \nArmy and informed the Army in writing that the fixes will be made at no \nexpense to the United States. By the time the Army is ready to conduct \nactual live firings the Secretary will be able to make all the \ncertifications required by law.\n  Mr. LEAHY. So, I ask the Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nAppropriations Committee, is there anything in the law to prevent the \nArmy from releasing the FY 1999 funds and beginning the necessary \nefforts to conduct an operational test and evaluation?\n  Mr. STEVENS. No there is not.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have been listening to this colloquy. I agree with the \nChairman, the Senator from Vermont as well as the distinguished Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member.\n\n\n          Transfer of Supplemental CDBG Money From HUD to FEMA\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to engage the Senator from Missouri, \nMr. Bond, the Chairman of the VA/HUD Subcommittee, in a colloquy.\n  Senator Bond and I have been working, for over a year now, to see \nthat Maine and the Northeast have their needs from the January 1998 Ice \nStorm which devastated much of New England and upstate New York \naddressed.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator is correct, and I know that neither of us \nthought we would be here, almost a year later, still trying to ensure \nthat adequate funding was provided to the Northeast, as we felt we had \nprovided for that in the FY98 Supplemental.\n  Ms. SNOWE. The Senator from Missouri has been a real champion for my \nstate of Maine in our efforts to ensure that the money this Senate \nappropriated went to alleviate some of the costs from the Ice Storm \nwhich could not be covered by FEMA.\n  Mr. BOND. I appreciate the Senator's kind words. I did a colloquy on \nthe Senate floor last March on this issue with the then junior Senator \nfrom New York, Mr. D'Amato, outlining the funding needs of the \nNortheast. In that colloquy we discussed the fact that of the $250 \nmillion the Senate was appropriating for HUD's Community Development \nBlock Grant Program (CDBG) , that $60 million was meant for Maine and \nthe rest of the Northeast.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Of course in the conference the final funding figure was \n$130 million as the House had only appropriated $20 million.\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, the figure was smaller, but the fact remained that the \nIce Storm, as the first big storm of the year, was the impetus for us \nto provide supplemental funding to the CDBG program to help Maine and \nother states cover the costs of the disaster where FEMA wasn't able to \nassist.\n  Ms. SNOWE. The FY98 Supplemental was signed into law on May 1. On \nNovember 6, the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced \nthat it was giving Maine $2.1 million to address $80 million in unmet \nneeds as reported by FEMA to HUD. Needless to say, this amount was \nwholly unacceptable, and I have been working with HUD to try and \naddress this very serious situation, which has left Maine unable to \nfully address the costs of the disaster.\n  Mr. BOND. As the Senator and I have discussed, I also was dismayed at \nthe treatment Maine and the other Northeast states received--the fact \nthat the money was not provided until six months after the bill was \nenacted, and the fact that I have yet to receive an acceptable \nexplanation from HUD as to\n\n[[Page S3090]]\n\nthe funding formula used to allocate the money. The Northeast's \nexperience is one of several reasons why the bill before us today \ntransfers the money to FEMA.\n  Ms. SNOWE. At one point in Maine more than 80 percent of the people \nin the State were without power. In fact, as Vice President Gore \nexplained it, during a visit to Maine on January 15, 1998 `` We've \nnever seen anything like this. This is like a neutron bomb aimed at the \npower system.'' We asked for your assistance in obtaining money for the \nCDBG program because it would allow States to use the money for utility \ninfrastructure costs, Maine's largest unmet need according to both \nFEMA, who listed it as first in their February 1998, ``Blueprint for \nAction\" and the Governor. With the transfer of the funding, will FEMA \nbe able to provide funding for a State, like Maine, which wants to use \nthe money to address the damage to the utility infrastructure in order \nto keep the utility rates--which are already the fourth highest in the \ncountry--from increasing to cover the storm costs?\n  Mr. BOND. The language will allow FEMA to assess and fund the States \nunmet needs, as determined by FEMA and the State.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Again, I wish to thank the Senator for his concern and \nhard work to help close this chapter in Maine's Ice Storm Disaster. I \nlook forward to continuing to work with you, Mr. Chairman, HUD, and \nFEMA to ensure that Maine's disaster needs are finally addressed.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of this bill \nfor their hard work in putting forth this legislation. This measure \nprovides much-needed federal funding for foreign assistance, and \nrecovery from the recent plague of natural disasters that have hammered \nmany parts of the United States and its neighboring countries in recent \nmonths.\n   Mr. President, I am glad that the Appropriations Committee decided \nto reject the President's designation of this entire disaster \nsupplemental appropriations bill as ``emergency'' spending. While the \nneed for relief is clear, I believe it is important to provide offsets \nfor any additional spending so that we avoid dipping into the surplus \nthat is desperately needed to shore up the Social Security system and \nprovide meaningful tax relief to American families.\n  Unfortunately, although well-intentioned, the Committee did not \nsucceed in fully offsetting the costs of this bill. In future years, \nhundreds of millions of dollars in spending resulting from this bill \nwill eat into future surpluses, whether we want to account for it or \nnot. The better course would have been to fully offset all of the new \nspending in this bill, rather than continue the dangerous practice of \nprofligate ``emergency'' spending.\n  Speaking of profligate spending, I regret that I must again come \nforward this year to object to the millions of unrequested, low-\npriority, wasteful spending in this bill and its accompanying report. \nThis year's bill originally contained $72.25 million in pork-barrel \nspending. But, as usual, we added pork on top of pork through a litany \nof amendments. To make matters worse, many of these amendments were \nadopted without ever being seen by most Senators. This time around, we \nadded an additional $13 million of pork-barrel spending to this already \npork-laden spending bill.\n  Projections of surpluses into the foreseeable future should not lead \nto an abandonment of fiscal discipline. CBO now projects a non-social \nsecurity budget surplus of over $800 billion over the next 10 years, \nbut projections do not equate to ``real'' dollars until they actually \nmaterialize.\n  While each individual earmark in this bill may not seem extravagant, \ntaken together, they represent a serious diversion of taxpayers' hard-\nearned dollars to low-priority programs.\n  I have compiled a list of the numerous add-ons, earmarks, and special \nexemptions provided to individual projects in this bill, such as:\n  Earmark of $50,000 for a feasibility study and initial planning and \ndesign of an effective CD ROM product to the Center for Educational \nTechnologies in Wheeling West Virginia. The CD ROM product would \ncomplement the book We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution.\n  $1,136,000 earmarked for suppression of western spruce budworm on the \nYakama Indian Reservation, and\n  $1,000,000 for construction of the Pike's Peak Summit House in \nColorado.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of objectionable provisions be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n Objectionable Provisions Contained in S. 544--Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations and Rescissions for Recovery From Natural Disasters and \n      Foreign Assistance for Fiscal Year Ending September 30, 1999\n\n\n                             Bill Language\n\n       A $3,880,000 earmark for additional research, management, \n     and enforcement activities in the Northeast Multispecies \n     fishery, and for acquisition of shoreline data for nautical \n     charts.\n       An earmark of $4,000,000 for Forest Service construction of \n     a new forestry research facility at Auburn University, \n     Auburn, Alabama.\n       A $2,200,000 earmark to meet sewer infrastructure needs \n     associated with the 2002 Winter Olympic Games to Wasatch \n     County, UT, for both water and sewer.\n       Earmark of $50,000 for a feasibility study and initial \n     planning and design of an effective CD ROM product to the \n     Center for Educational Technologies in Wheeling, West \n     Virginia.

Mr. President, I also wish to state my objections to a \nprovision that creates a $1 billion loan guarantee program to support \nthe domestic steel industry.\n  Specifically, this provision provides a loan guarantee of up to $250 \nmillion for any domestic steel company that ``has experienced layoffs, \nproduction losses, or financial losses since the beginning of 1998.'' \nThe purported reason for this program is to help steel companies \nsuffering because of a flood of foreign steel. The measure, however, \ndoes not require that the losses relate to the so-called ``steel \ncrisis.'' The measure also fails to set terms, conditions or interest \nrates for the guarantees. Instead, it leaves these critical decisions \nto the discretion of the board making the loans. The only guidance \ngiven to the board is that the terms should be reasonable. These \nprovisions are problematic and will eventually result in the taxpayer \nguaranteeing bad loans.\n  In the mid-sixties, the Economic Development Administration operated \na similar program. The result of that program was disastrous for the \ntaxpayer. Steel companies defaulted on 77% of the dollar value of their \nguarantees. An analysis of the loan program by the Congressional \nResearch Service concluded that steel loans represent a high level of \nrisk. Nevertheless, we are poised today to provide an additional $1 \nbillion in guarantees.\n  I also have to question the need for such legislation. In a recent \neditorial, the Wall Street Journal declared ``there really is no U.S. \nsteel `crisis'.'' They went on to note that several U.S. companies are \nposting significant profits. For example, last year, Nucor earned $263 \nmillion, USX earned $364 million and Bethlehem Steel earned $120 \nmillion.\n  Finally, Mr. President I have problems with how this provision came \nbefore the Senate. The creation of a program like this on an \nappropriations bill is just wrong. The provision places at risk \nhundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars. The Senate should have the \nopportunity to fully consider and debate this provision.\n  Mr. President, again, the amount of wasteful spending in this bill is \nless onerous than many other bills I have seen. However, I still must \nobject strenuously to the inclusion of $85.5 million in pork-barrel \nspending. We cannot afford pork-barrel spending, even in the amount \ncontained in this bill, because the cumulative effect of each million \nwasted is a million dollars robbed from the surplus or an additional \nmillion dollars in debt on which we must pay interest.\n  In the upcoming FY 2000 appropriations season, I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to ensure \nthat we do not waste taxpayers dollars on projects that are low-\npriority, wasteful, or unnecessary, and that have not been evaluated in \nthe appropriate merit-based review process.\n\n\n            oil royalty rider on the emergency supplemental\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I had planned to offer an amendment to \nrepeal a special interest rider attached to the Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations bill.\n  This rider prevents the Interior Department from acting to ensure \nthat oil companies pay a fair royalty for oil drilled on public lands. \nMy amendment would have stripped that rider--allowing the Interior \nDepartment to finalize their rule so that the taxpayers will receive \nthe millions of dollars they are owed in royalty payments.\n  I have decided that while I still firmly believe that this rider \nshould be stripped, because of recent action taken by the Interior \nDepartment, this amendment would not be timely. However, I would like \nto assure you that if I will block any future attempts to further delay \nthis necessary and important rulemaking process.\n  Mr. President, this is a very simple issue.\n  For years, oil companies have been cheating the American taxpayers \nout of millions--if not billions--of dollars.\n  The Department of Interior took action to stop the cheating.\n  Now, Congress is preventing the Interior Department from stopping the \ncheating.\n  Just as the Interior Department was about to finalize a new rule to \nresolve arguments over royalties, here comes yet another rider on an \nunrelated must-pass bill to stop the new rule from going into effect.\n  So who benefits from this rider? Big Oil. And who loses? The American \ntaxpayer.\n  We had this same debate last Congress. Some of my colleagues will say \nthat this delay is necessary to force the Interior Department to listen \nto the oil companies.\n  Mr. President, the Interior Department has listened. In fact, in \nresponse to pressure from the Big Oil, the Interior Department has re-\nopened the comment period on the proposal to--once again--see if there \nis anything new.\n  Because of the Interior Department's action, it is unlikely that the \nDepartment will be able to finalize the rule before October 1, 1999 \ndespite this rider. The rider is unnecessary and is just another \nattempt by Congress to bully the Interior Department.\n  The Interior Department has gone through a thoughtful and detailed \nprocess to get this rule done. The Interior Department has acted in \ngood faith to respond to concerns of the oil industry and members of \nthe Senate--meeting with Members of Congress on several occasions and \nreopening the comment period on the rule.\n  It is now time for the Congress to act in good faith and let the \nInterior Department proceed.\n  Mr. President, let me explain how royalty payments work. When oil \ncompanies drill on public lands, they pay a royalty to the federal \ngovernment. This royalty is like paying rent. The oil companies want to \nuse federal land or offshore tracts, so they pay rent--a percentage of \nthe value of the oil--to the federal government to use this land. A \nshare of this royalty is given to the state, and the remaining money is \nused by the federal government for the Land and Water Conservation Fund \nand the Historic Preservation Fund.\n  The oil companies sign an agreement to pay a fixed percentage of the \nvalue of the oil they produce on federal lands--12.5%. The question is \n12.5% of what? It's that number that the big oil companies understate.\n  According to the signed agreement, that number for the value of the \noil, ``shall never be less than the fair market value of the \nproduction.'' But the oil companies are currently understating the \nvalue, and as a result, they underpay their royalties.\n  The debate is over how to determine the true value of oil. Is the \ntrue value of the oil the value that the oil companies themselves \ndecide? Or is the true value of the oil the market price that one would \npay if they actually purchased a barrel of oil? I agree with the \nInterior Department that the oil companies must base their royalty \npayments on the market price.\n  Currently, oil companies themselves determine the value of the oil \nand pay a royalty based on that value. The value determined by the \ncompanies is called the posted price and merely reflects offers by \npurchasers to buy oil from a specific area. It is just an offer to buy \nand does not represent any actual sale of oil.\n  Now you may be hearing from the oil companies that this proposed \nsystem is unfair and that it harms the small independent producers. The \nDepartment of Interior has informed me that the new regulations will \nonly increase royalty payments for 5% of all the companies. This 5% is \nnot your mom and pop operations--this is Shell, Chevron, Exxon, Texaco, \nMobil, Marathon and Conoco. This is the large integrated companies that \ntrade with their affiliates and have no actual sale of oil.\n  You may also hear from my colleagues that the oil companies are \nhurting. With oil prices the lowest they've been in decades, how can we \nincrease their royalties? This isn't about increasing the royalties, \nthis is about the American public getting their fair share--whatever \nthe value. And with the Interior Department's proposed regulations, as \noil prices fall, so does the royalty. It's all based on the market.\n  So in summation, to guarantee taxpayers a fair royalty payment in the \nfuture, the Interior Department proposed a simple and common sense \nsolution: pay royalties based on actual market prices, not estimates \nthe oil companies themselves make up. The\n\n[[Page S3092]]\n\nnew rule was proposed over 3 years ago. Since that time, the Department \nhas held 14 public workshops and published 7 separate requests for \nindustry comments on this rule--and three more public workshops are \nscheduled in the next month. High level Interior officials have met \nwith Members of Congress and industry on several occasions and have \nmade several changes to the regulations to address industry's concerns.\n  At some point the negotiating must stop and the Interior Department \nmust be allowed to move forward with this fair rule.\n  This rider is outrageous. It saves the wealthiest oil companies in \nthe world millions of dollars while shortchanging taxpayers and, in the \ncase of California, our schoolchildren which is where my state's oil \nroyalty payments go. What does this say about our nation's priorities?\n  The Interior Department's proposed regulations are fair and they are \naccurate. They are not based on the subjectivity of the big oil \ncompanies, but are based on actual market prices.\n  It is time that we end this flawed system of calculating royalties \nand move to an objective, market driven system. The Department of \nInterior has spent much time developing an equitable system and we \nshould allow it to move forward.\n  While I am not offering my amendment this time, I am here to say that \nthis cheating must stop and these riders must stop. Let the Interior \nDepartment do its job and move forward with these regulations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nSecretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbit, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                The Secretary of the Interior,\n\n                                       Washington, March 18, 1999.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I am writing to call on you and your \n     colleagues to delete from the Fiscal Year 1999 Emergency \n     Supplemental appropriations legislation the Senate provision \n     extending the moratorium prohibiting the Department of the \n     Interior from issuing a final rulemaking on the royalty \n     valuation of crude oil until October 1, 1999.\n       Prior to a series of congressionally imposed moratoria, the \n     Department was prepared to publish a final rule on oil \n     valuation on June 1, 1998. On March 4, 1999, I announced that \n     the Department would reopen the comment period for the \n     federal oil valuation rule. On March 12, 1999, we formally \n     reopened the comment period and announced a series of public \n     workshops to discuss the rule in Houston, Texas, Albuquerque, \n     New Mexico, and Washington, D.C.\n       We are committed to a constructive dialogue over the next \n     few weeks as we seek new ideas that can help move the \n     rulemaking process forward while ensuring that the public \n     receives fair value for the production of its resources. \n     Extension of the current moratorium, which ends on June 1, \n     1999, will not be conducive to constructive discussions.\n       Any action that further delays implementation of a final \n     rule on oil valuation causes losses to the Federal Treasury \n     of about $5.3 million per month. States, which use this money \n     for education and infrastructure development, lose about \n     $200,000 per month. In addition, potential delay of the \n     proposed Indian oil valuation rule could cost Indian tribes \n     and individual Indian mineral owners about $300,000 per \n     month.\n       We urge you to delete the moratorium proposal and allow the \n     rulemaking process to proceed. The process we have set in \n     motion will ensure full and open consideration of all new \n     ideas for resolving the concerns that have been raised and \n     will lead to a solution that best meets the interests of the \n     American public.\n       As you are aware, the Statement of Administration Policy on \n     the Emergency Supplemental states that the President's senior \n     advisers would recommend that he veto the legislation if it \n     is presented with currently included offsets and \n     objectionable riders.\n       Thank you for your continued involvement in this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bruce Babbitt.\n\n\n          transfer of supplemental cdbg money from hud to fema\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to engage the Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Bond, the Chairman of the VA/HUD Subcommittee, in a \ncolloquy.\n  Senator Bond, you and I and the other members of the Northeast \ndelegation have been working, for over a year now, to ensure that Maine \nand the Northeast have their needs from the January 1998 Ice Storm \nwhich devastated much of New England and upstate New York addressed.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator is correct. It has been almost a year and I \nknow that we are both extremely frustrated that we are still wrestling \nwith using emergency CDBG funds for appropriations needs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. You have been a real champion for our state of Maine and \nof our efforts to ensure that the money this Senate appropriated went \nto alleviate some of the costs from the Ice Storm which could not be \ncovered by FEMA.\n  Mr. BOND. I appreciate the Senator's kind words. I did a colloquy on \nthe Senate floor last March on this issue with the then junior Senator \nfrom New York, Mr. D'Amato outlining the funding needs of the \nNortheast. In this colloquy we outlined the history of the funding \nincluding the significant needs of Maine and New England.\n  In fact, as we both discussed at that time, the Ice Storm, as the \nfirst big storm of the year, was the impetus for us to provide \nsupplemental funding to the CDBG program to help Maine and other states \ncover the costs of the disaster where FEMA wasn't able to assist.\n  Ms. COLLINS. For those that did not experience it, the devastation \nthis storm caused in Maine is hard to imagine. Thick ice, in some cases \nup to ten inches thick, encased virtually every inch of the state and \ndecimated our electric infrastructure. As a result of the Herculean \nefforts of hundreds of utility crews, power was restored to Maine after \n17 long days. Like other Americans who have suffered natural disasters, \nMainers need this assistance to recover from the costs incurred from \nthe devastating blow nature dealt us.\n  Mr. BOND. As the Senator and I have discussed, I remain very \nconcerned by HUD's treatment of Maine and the other Northeast states, \nespecially the fact that initial funding was not provided until six \nmonths after last year's supplemental bill was enacted, and the fact \nthat I have yet to receive an acceptable explanation from HUD as to the \nfunding formula used to allocate the money. The Northeast's experience \nis one of several reasons why the bill before us today transfers the \nmoney to FEMA.\n  Ms. COLLINS. It is my sincere hope that FEMA will expedite this \nprocess and provide to Maine the assistance it has been promised by the \ncurrent Administration and has been in need of for over one year. I \nwish to thank the Senator from Missouri for his continuing efforts on \nbehalf of the people of Maine. He has truly been a champion in this \nlong process, and his cooperation is greatly appreciated by the people \nof Maine.\n\n\n      ENVIRONMENTAL RIDERS IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns \nregarding two troubling sections of S. 544, the Supplemental \nAppropriations bill. Section 2002 further delays the promulgation of \nnew regulations governing the management of hardrock mineral mining \noperations on federal public lands. Section 2005 extends the moratorium \non the issuance of new regulations by the Minerals Management Service \nregarding oil valuation. I hope that all provisions which adversely \naffect the implementation of environmental law, or change federal \nenvironmental policy, will be removed from this legislation when it \nreturns to the floor.\n  I want to note, before I describe my concerns in detail, that this is \nnot the first time that I have expressed concerns regarding legislative \nriders in appropriations legislation that would have a negative impact \non our nation's environment.\n  Mr. President, for more than two decades, we have seen a remarkable \nbipartisan consensus on protecting the environment through effective \nenvironmental legislation and regulation. I believe we have a \nresponsibility to the American people to protect the quality of our \npublic lands and resources. That responsibility requires that I express \nmy strong distaste for legislative efforts to include proposals in \nspending bills that weaken environmental laws or prevent potentially \nbeneficial environmental regulations from being promulgated by the \nfederal agencies that carry out federal law.\n  Mr. President, the people of Wisconsin continue to express their \ngrave concern that, when riders are placed in spending bills, major \ndecisions regarding environmental protection are being\n\n[[Page S3093]]\n\nmade without the benefit of an up or down vote.\n  Wisconsinites have a very strong belief that Congress has a \nresponsibility to discuss and publicly debate matters affecting the \nenvironment. We should be on record with regard to our position on this \nmatter of open government and environmental stewardship.\n  Mr. President, I have particular concerns regarding Section 2002. I \nthink this rider is another attempt to move us away from implementing \nnew mining regulations. This is the third time, in as many years, that \na rider has been put forward on this matter. The rider, as drafted, \nwould delay the regulatory process for at least an additional 120 days \nbeyond the final rider compromise language in the Omnibus bill which \npassed in October 1999. The Omnibus language says that the regulations \ncan not be issued before September 30, 1999. There is no basis for \narguing that the Interior Department would not have time to review the \non-going National Academy of Sciences study on this topic, which the \nOmnibus language required to be completed by July 31, 1999.\n  The ``3809'' mining regulations, as they are called, are the \nenvironmental rules that govern hardrock mining on publicly owned \nlands.\n  The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 directs the \nSecretary of the Interior to ``take any action necessary, by regulation \nor otherwise, to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation on the \nfederal lands.'' The regulations in question are the Bureau of Land \nManagement's promulgated in response to the requirements of this \nfederal law.\n  The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill mining rider blocks \nthe issuance of the final 3809 regulations certainly through the end of \nthe fiscal year. The language further blocks the Administration from \nspending funds to seek public input on its new draft regulations until \nafter the National Academy of Sciences issues its on-going study \nexamining the adequacy of the existing patchwork of fedeal and state \nmining rules, as I mentioned earlier.\n  The rules are important, Mr. President, and so is the need to update \nthem. Mining technologies, according to the Interior Department, have \noutgrown existing safeguards. The original regulations, released in \n1981, have never been revised. Since that time, the mining industry has \nwidely adopted new extraction technologies which raise environmental \nquestions and concerns. One such technique, which caused grave concern \ntwo years ago in my state when it was proposed for use on private lands \nin the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, was the use of sulfuric acid \nmining.\n  In addition, Mr. President, existing regulations also need to allow \nthe BLM to balance the fact that multiple activities take place on \nlands before permitting new mines. In determining whether a proposed \nmine is appropriate, BLM is not permitted to take into account other \nland uses that would be displaced by mining.\n  Finally, I believe that existing regulations don't do enough to \nrequire meaningful cleanup. Currently there is no requirement to \nrestore mined lands to pre-mining conditions and they leave taxpayers \npaying for the mining industry's mistakes. To address this issue, I \nrecently introduced legislation to repeal the percentage depletion \nallowance for mining on public lands and I set aside a portion of the \nincreased revenue to be used to create an Abandoned Mine Reclamation \nfund. Any clean-up fund, however, needs good clean-up standards to put \nit to use.\n  In conclusion, I think that continued delay of these regulations is \nindefensible, and certainly inappropriate as part of a supplemental \nbill.\n\n\n                      crop insurance requirements\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. I wish to thank Senator Cochran and Senator Kohl \nfor agreeing to my amendment to provide fairness to the administration \nof the crop disaster program enacted by Congress last Fall. I also wish \nto thank Senator Harkin for his interest in this issue.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator for his remarks and would like to \nengage him and other Senators in a discussion regarding the purpose of \nthe Senator's amendment and the overall policy considerations attached \nto it. When Congress enacted farm disaster legislation last Fall, we \nrecognized the dire circumstances of farmers from both natural and \neconomic conditions. Not only did that legislation recognize the \nproblems farmers faced in 1998, but it also dealt with problems farmers \nhave had over the past several years. From a policy perspective, it is \nwell recognized that a sound, reliable risk management program, which \nincludes crop insurance, needs to be established to avoid the \ninherently unfair and unpredictable ad hoc disaster programs of years \npast.\n  The amendment by the Senator from Alabama recognizes that crop \ninsurance is available to farmers through both federally reinsured \npolicies and policies based solely by private companies. His amendment \nmodifies language included in last year's omnibus appropriations bill \nregarding the requirement that the Secretary not discriminate or \npenalize producers who have taken out crop insurance by stating the \nrequirement applies to both federally reinsured policies and those \noffered solely by private companies. We all recognize the difficult \ntimes facing farmers and we want to see all farmers treated fairly and \nequally.\n  It is equally important that we do not take steps that inadvertently \nundermine our overall objectives for both long-term farm policy and \nimmediate administration of the pending disaster payments. In accepting \nthe amendment by the Senator from Alabama, we hope to continue a \ndialogue with him and other Senators as we approach conference to \nensure the amendment is in the best interest of farmers.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I also want to thank the Senator from Alabama for his \nremarks and I want to associate myself with the remarks by my friend \nfrom Wisconsin. It is clearly our objective to make the administration \nof farm program as fair as possible, recognizing the geographical \ndifferences of agriculture in America.\n  Senator Kohl is correct in his observation that farmers need and \ndeserve a reliable risk management program that will not be tied to the \npolitical winds of any given year. For that reason, we must do all we \ncan to improve and promote the availability of crop insurance products \nto farmers across the country. I point out to my colleagues that \nfarmers could have purchased federal catastrophic coverage for a cost \nof fifty dollars to cover an entire crop. That is a bargain and I am \nstill troubled by the reluctance of some farmers to invest in that \nminimal amount. Had a farmer made that simple investment in recent \nyears, the amendment by the Senator from Alabama would not be \nnecessary.\n  I am also concerned, as is Senator Kohl, about the effect this \namendment may have on administration of the pending farm disaster \nprogram. Secretary Glickman came under criticism lately when he \nannounced that payments to farmers would not begin until this summer. I \nadmonish my colleagues that we must take no action that would \nexacerbate that problem. Farmers in Iowa, in Wisconsin, and in Alabama \nall need assistance sooner rather than later.\n  Mr. KOHL. I agree with the remarks by my friend from Iowa and I would \nlike to further note that farmers in Wisconsin are equally in need of \nassistance immediately. As we approach conference, I hope to stay in \nclose contact with all interested Senators to ensure that nothing is \ndone to overwhelm the Department's administration of the disaster \nprogram by imposing a new series of control and verification \nrequirements. We want to be responsive to all Senators' interests, but \nwe know farmers are looking for a responsive, and timely disaster \nprogram. As some have noted, many farmers believe we are past the \nperiod of a proper and timely response.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I join my colleagues in approving the amendment by the \nSenator from Alabama and agree that we must proceed in a fair manner \nthat will not disrupt the delivery of disaster payments to farmers. \nThere is need for immediate and necessary relief from natural and \neconomic losses. I will continue to work with the Senator from Alabama \nand my colleagues from Wisconsin and Iowa in order to address the \nconcerns they have raised.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Again, I thank the Senators.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3094]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/23/senate-section/article/S3094-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3094-S3103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE KOSOVO QUAGMIRE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it seems we are about to go to war with \nYugoslavia. Our stated purpose is to stop the humanitarian disaster \nthere caused by a civil war. If we do not act, we are told, innocent \npeople will be killed, will be wounded, will be displaced from their \nhomes. Indeed, over 2,000 have already been killed in the Kosovo civil \nwar in just the last year. Many more have been uprooted. There are \nserious problems there. No one disputes that.\n  My question is, Where is the vital U.S. national interest?\n  The National Defense Council Foundation recently reported that there \nare at least 60 conflicts going on in the world involving humanitarian \nsuffering of one kind or another. There are 30 wars being waged--civil \nwars, guerrilla wars, major terrorist campaigns. Many are driven by \nethnic quarrels and religious disputes which have raged for decades, if \nnot for centuries.\n  Just consider a partial list from recent years: 800,000 to 1 million \npeople have been brutally murdered in Rwanda alone; tens of thousands \nkilled in civil wars in Sudan, Algeria and Angola; thousands killed in \ncivil war in Ethiopia; in January, 140 civilians killed by paramilitary \nsquads in Colombia; including 27 worshipers slain during a village \nchurch service.\n  Why is there no outcry for these millions of people who are being \nbrutally murdered in other places in the world, but we are all \nconcerned about the humanitarian problems in Kosovo?\n  I have to say this, and I know it is very unpopular to say it, but I \nam going to quote a guy whose name is Roger Wilkins. He is a professor \nof history and American culture at George Mason University:\n\n       I think it is pretty clear. U.S. foreign policy is geared \n     to the European-American sensibility which takes the lives of \n     white people much more seriously than the lives of people who \n     aren't white.\n\n  Let me read a couple paragraphs from an article in the Minneapolis-\nSt. Paul Star Tribune on January 31, 1999:\n\n       But no one mobilized on behalf of perhaps 500 people who \n     were shot, hacked and burned to death in a village in eastern \n     Congo, in central Africa, around the same time. No outrage \n     was expressed on behalf of many other innocents who had \n     the misfortune to be slain just off the world's stage over \n     the past few weeks.\n       Why do 45 white Europeans rate an all-out response while \n     several hundred black Africans are barely worth notice?\n\n  And this is all in that same timeframe.\n  Further quoting the Minneapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune:\n\n       While U.S. officials struggled to provide an answer, \n     analysts said the uneven U.S. responses to a spurt of \n     violence in the past month illuminates not just an immoral or \n     perhaps racist foreign policy, but one that fails on \n     pragmatic and strategic grounds as well.\n\n  So now the President wants us to send the U.S. military into Kosovo, \nnot to enforce a peace agreement--we do not have a peace agreement, as \nwe were told 2 weeks ago--but to inject ourselves into the middle of an \nongoing civil war, with no clearly defined military objective, no \nassurance of success, no exit strategy and great, great risk to our \npilots and men and women in uniform.\n  We know that the Yugoslav leader, Mr. Milosevic, is a bad guy. No one \ndisputes that. But are we absolutely sure that there are some good \nguys, too? Are there any good guys in the fight that stretches back \nover 500 years?\n  When I was in Kosovo recently, I was horrified as I was going through \nthe main road--Kosovo is only 75 miles wide and 75 miles long, and \nthere is one road going all the way through it. I was only able to see \ntwo dead people at the time. They turned them over and both of them \nwere Serbs. They had been executed at pointblank range. And they were \nSerbs, not Kosovars, not Albanians. So the national interest here is \nnot at all clear.\n  Let me quote Dr. Henry Kissinger, the former Secretary of State and \nNational Security Adviser. In an op-ed piece in the Washington Post on \nFebruary 24, Kissinger said he was opposed to U.S. military involvement \nin Kosovo. He is not unaware of the humanitarian concerns that the \nPresident and others talk about. Here are just a few of the highlights \nof what he said:\n\n       The proposed deployment in Kosovo does not deal with any \n     threat to American security as traditionally conceived.\n       Kosovo is no more a threat to America than Haiti was to \n     Europe.\n       If Kosovo, why not East Africa or Central Asia?\n       We must take care not to stretch ourselves too thin in the \n     face of far less ambiguous threats in the Middle East and \n     Northeast Asia.\n       Each incremental deployment into the Balkans is bound to \n     weaken our ability to deal with Saddam Hussein and North \n     Korea.\n\n  I think this is very, very significant, the last two points.\n  First of all, I have asked the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nI have asked the Chiefs, I have asked the CINCs, the commanders in \nchief, this question: If we have to send troops into Kosovo--keep in \nmind that people may lie to you and say this is going to be an \nairstrike. Anybody who knows anything about military strategy and \nwarfare knows you can't do it all from the air. You have to ultimately \nsend in ground troops. So we are talking about sending in ground \ntroops. That is in a theater where the logistics support for ground \ntroops is handled out of the 21st TACOM in Germany. I was over in the \n21st TACOM. Right now, they are at 110 percent capacity just supporting \nBosnia. They don't have any more capacity. The commander in chief there \nsaid, if we send ground troops into Iraq or Kosovo, we are going to be \n100 percent dependent upon Guard and Reserve to support those troops. \nAnd look what has happened to the Guard and Reserve now because of the \ndecimation of our military through its budget, finding ourselves only \nhalf the size we were in 1991.\n\n  Right now, we don't have the capacity. We have to depend on Guard and \nReserves, and in doing this we don't have the critical MOSs. You can't \nexpect doctors in the Guard to be deployed for 270 days and maintain \ntheir practice, so we now have ourselves faced with a problem, a \nserious problem, and that is we cannot carry out the national military \nstrategy, which is to be able to defend America on two regional fronts. \nWe don't have the capacity to do it. If we could do it on nearly \nsimultaneous fronts within 45 days between each conflict, then we go up \nfrom low-medium risk to a medium-high risk, which is translated in \nlives of Americans.\n  Going into Kosovo for an unlimited duration at who knows what cost, \nwho knows the amount of risk, the risk will be higher.\n  I chair the readiness subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, Mr. President, and I can tell you right now that we are in \nthe same situation we were in in the late 1970s with the hollow force. \nWe can't afford to dilute our military strength anymore. And that is \nnot even mentioning the immediate risk to our forces that they will \nface in Yugoslavia where the Serbs have sophisticated Russian-made air \ndefense and thousands of well-trained and equipped troops motivated to \nfight and die for their country.\n  In recent testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, some \nof our top military leaders were very frank about what they expected \nfor any U.S. military operation in Kosovo.\n  Air Force Chief of Staff General Ryan said, ``There stands a very \ngood chance that we will lose aircraft against Yugoslavian air \ndefense.''\n  Navy Chief of Staff, Admiral Johnson, said, ``We must be prepared to \ntake losses.''\n  Marine Commandant, General Krulak, said it will be ``tremendously \ndangerous.''\n  And then George Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence, said \nthis is not Bosnia we are talking about, this is Kosovo where they are \nnot tired, they are not worn out, and they are ready to fight and kill \nAmericans.\n  So we are faced with that serious problem, Mr. President. We should \nnot under any circumstances go into Kosovo. Our vital security \ninterests are not at stake, where we don't have a clear military \nobjective or an exit\n\n[[Page S3095]]\n\nstrategy, or where our policy doesn't fit into any coherent broader \nforeign policy vision.\n  So let me go back to my opening statement. Since we have no national \nsecurity risks at stake, there must be another reason for our \ninvolvement. It is not humanitarian because of the following:\n  800,000 to 1 million killed in ethnic strife in Rwanda;\n  tens of thousands killed in civil wars in Sudan, Algeria, and Angola;\n  thousands killed in civil war in Ethiopia;\n  in January, 140 civilians killed by paramilitary squads in Colombia, \nincluding 27 worshipers slain during a village church service.\n  Why is there no outcry for U.S. involvement in these obvious \nhumanitarian situations?\n  ``I think it's pretty clear,'' said Roger Wilkins, professor of \nhistory and American culture at George Mason University. ``U.S. foreign \npolicy is geared to the European-American sensibility which takes the \nlives of white people much more seriously than the lives of people who \naren't white.''\n  Anyone who supports our sending American troops into Kosovo must be \naware this will come back and haunt them. Mr. President, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, \nthe majority leader will soon be coming over to make a unanimous \nconsent request concerning the vote on a resolution dealing with \nKosovo. I have been involved in the negotiations of the resolution. I \nmight read it for my colleagues, for the information of my colleagues, \nand then I am going to state my opposition to it. But for the \ninformation of all of our colleagues, it is our hope and our \nexpectation we would have a vote on this resolution in the not too \ndistant future, possibly as early as 6 or 6:30 or 7 o'clock. So I \nwanted my colleagues to be aware of that.\n  Mr. President, this resolution authorizes the President of the United \nStates to conduct military air operations and missile strikes against \nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia, and Montenegro.\n  The resolution reads,\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America and Congress assembled, That the \n     President of the United States is authorized to conduct \n     military air operations and missile strikes in cooperation \n     with our NATO allies against the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro.\n\n  It is very simple. It is very short. There are not a long list of \n``whereases,'' not a lot of confusion. It says we authorize the \nPresident of the United States to conduct airstrikes against Serbia.\n  I oppose this resolution. I will take a couple of minutes to explain \nmy opposition. I understand and I have great respect for many of our \ncolleagues who are supportive. I have joined with colleagues who went \nto the White House on Friday and also earlier today to talk to the \nPresident and hear his side of the issue. He tried to make a very \nstrong case for airstrikes and for military intervention. He didn't \nconvince me. I respect his opinion. I just happen to disagree with him.\n  Time and time again I ask, If we are going to war, why are we going \nto war? Make no mistake, if we conduct airstrikes against Serbia, we \nare going to war. I don't think we should do that lightly.\n  I tell my colleagues, the resolution that we are voting on, in my \nopinion, is a very important resolution. It is probably one of the most \nimportant votes we will conduct, certainly this session of Congress. \nMaybe Members will look back over their Senate career and it may be one \nof the most important votes Members will cast in their Senate career.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this resolution. That means I \nthink that we are making a mistake by conducting a bombing campaign in \nSerbia. A bombing campaign will also lead to ground campaigns. A lot of \npeople have the false assumption that if we have airstrikes, that is \nit. Many times there has been a tendency by this administration--and \nmaybe previous administrations as well--that we can do things by air \nand that will do it.\n\n  We had an air campaign, we had military strikes in the air against \nIraq in December--I believe December 18, 19, and 20. It was a \nsignificant military operation. Why? Because we wanted to get the arms \ncontrol inspectors back into Iraq. We bombed them like crazy. Guess \nwhat. We don't have any arms control inspectors in Iraq today, so air \ndidn't do it. Saddam Hussein is now able to build weapons of mass \ndestruction. The air campaign didn't change his policies one iota.\n  What about in Serbia? The whole purpose of this--I will read from \nyesterday's New York Times, an interview with Madeleine Albright, \nSecretary of State,\n\n       Two days after President Clinton warned that the Serbs had \n     gone beyond ``the threshold'' of violence in their southern \n     province, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said she \n     was sending Mr. Holbrooke to present Mr. Milosevic with a \n     ``stark choice.''\n       That choice, she said, was for him to agree to the \n     settlement signed in Paris last week by the ethnic Albanians \n     . . . or face NATO air strikes.\n\n  In other words, if the Serbs don't sign on to the agreement that was \nnegotiated in France, they are going to face airstrikes. In other \nwords, we are going to be attacking a foreign country because they \nrefused to allow an international force to be stationed in their \ncountry. That is what the Paris agreement is.\n  Some of our colleagues say they will vote for airstrikes but they \nwon't vote for ground forces. The Secretary of State says we are going \nto bomb them until they agree to sign up to a peace agreement, a peace \nagreement that calls for stationing 28,000 international troops into \nKosovo.\n  I just disagree. I don't think you can bomb a country into submitting \nto a peace agreement. That is more than coercion, and I don't think you \nget real peace by coercing somebody. Maybe cajoling people, maybe a \nlittle leverage here and there, but to say we will bomb your country \nuntil you sign a peace agreement is probably very shortsighted and not \nreal peace, and to station the 28,000 troops into hostile territory I \nthink would be a very serious mistake.\n  I have heard the President's arguments. I haven't made the argument \nthis is not in our national interest, but I will say there is--I \nstarted to say a civil war is going on in Kosovo, but it is not even to \nthe point of a civil war. There is certainly an armed conflict. There \nis guerrilla warfare going on. There has been sniping going on. There \nhave been people killed on both sides. I think that is unfortunate, but \nit has been happening. But this is not the only civil conflict that is \ngoing on around the world. Yet in this conflict, we will take sides. \nMaybe if you declare it is a civil war going on, a total civil war \ngoing on in Kosovo--why should we be taking sides? Should we be the air \nforce for the KLA, the Kosovo Liberation Army? Should we be trying to \nhelp them fulfill their goals?\n  Their goal is not autonomy; their goal is independence. They were \nsomewhat reluctant to sign on to the France so-called peace agreement \nbecause they didn't want autonomy; they wanted independence. They will \nnever be satisfied until they have independence. The French peace \naccords say we will insert this peacekeeping force of 28,000 troops for \n3 years, we will have autonomy at that time, and then we are somewhat \nsilent on what happens at the end of 3 years. If anyone has talked to \nthe KLA, they know that the KLA wants independence. Should we be \nintervening to the extent of taking that side?\n\n  Some of my colleagues say if Serbia is really massing and having \nmilitary actions against the KLA, instead of us just bombing, why don't \nwe just give them some support? Why don't we give them some munitions \nand help them defend themselves? It is similar to the argument many of \nus made in Bosnia: Instead of sending troops, we wanted to take the \narms embargo off and allow them to defend themselves. Senator Dole \nstood on the floor many times and said let's allow them to defend \nthemselves.\n  Some people made that same argument today, dealing with the Kosovars. \nThe problem is, the peace agreement\n\n[[Page S3096]]\n\nthat has been negotiated says we will disarm the KLA. I think the \nchances of that happening are slim, if nonexistent. They will hide the \narms. We will not be successful in disarming, nor do I really think \nthat we should. We will be very much involved in a civil war. We are \ntaking the side of the Kosovars. Many of the Kosovars are great people \nand I love them and some are very peace loving, but there are some \npeople on the other side, on the KLA side, who have assassinated and \nmurdered as well.\n  I have serious, serious reservations about getting involved in a \ncivil war. I have very strong reservations about the ability to be able \nto bomb somebody to the peace table and making them agree to a peace \nagreement that they were not a signatory to.\n  I am reminded by some of our friends and colleagues that this is a \ncontinuation of President Bush's policy. As a matter of fact, in \nDecember of 1992 President Bush--and he was a lame duck President at \nthe time--issued a very stern warning to Mr. Milosevic: If he made a \nmilitary move in Kosovo, there would be significant and serious \nconsequences. Mr. Milosevic rightfully respected President Bush, and he \ndidn't make that move. I supported President Bush in making that \nstatement. I think he was right in doing so.\n  However, there is a big difference between that statement and saying \nwe will move militarily if he moves aggressively against the Kosovars. \nThere is a big difference between that and saying we will bomb you \nuntil you agree to a peace agreement, and part of that peace agreement \nis stationing 28,000 troops in Kosovo. There is a big difference. I \nhope our colleagues will understand that difference. That is one of the \nreasons I am vigorously opposed to this resolution. I don't think you \ncan bomb a sovereign nation into submission of a peace agreement.\n  Let me mention a couple of other reservations that I have. Somebody \nsaid, What about the credibility of NATO? NATO, for 50 years, has \nhelped sustain peace and stability throughout Europe. It has been a \ngreat alliance. That is true. NATO has been a great alliance. It has \nbeen a defensive alliance. NATO has never taken military action against \na non-NATO member when other NATO countries weren't threatened. Now we \nare breaking new ground and we are moving into areas which I believe \ngreatly expand NATO's mission far beyond the defensive alliance that it \nwas created under.\n  Another reservation I have: The Constitution says that Congress shall \ndeclare war; it doesn't say the President can initiate war. The \nPresident started at least consulting Congress on Friday. He also \nconsulted with Congress today, Tuesday. We understand that war is \nimminent. I don't consider that consultation. I remember about 4 weeks \nago when Secretary of State Albright and Secretary of Defense Cohen \nbriefed a few of us on the Paris negotiations, or the negotiations in \nFrance. They basically said: We are trying to get both sides to sign; \nwe think maybe the Kosovars will sign, but the Serbs and Mr. Milosevic \nare not inclined to. But if we can get the Kosovars to sign, we will \nbomb the Serbs until they do sign.\n  I left there thinking, you have to be kidding. That is their policy? \nI want peace. I want peace as much as President Clinton. I want peace \nas much as Secretary Albright, throughout Yugoslavia, but I don't think \nby initiating bombing we will bring about peace. I am afraid, instead \nof increasing stability, it might increase violence.\n  There might be adverse reactions that this administration hasn't \nthought about. Instead of bringing about stability, it may well be that \nthe Serbian forces are going to move more aggressively. In the last 24 \nhours, it looks like that may be the case. So instead of convincing Mr. \nMilosevic to take the Serbs out of Kosovo, they may be moving in more \naggressively. It looks as if that is happening now. Instead of \ndissuading him from oppression on the Kosovars, he may be more \noppressive, more aggressive, and he may run more people away from their \nhomes and burn more villages. Instead of bringing stability, it may be \nbringing instability, and it may be forcing, as a result of this \nbombing, Mr. Milosevic--instead of his response being to move back into \ngreater Serbia and away from Kosovo, he may be more assertive and \naggressive and he may want to strike out against the United States. If \nairplanes are flying, he might find that is unsuccessful. I hope he has \nno success against our pilots and our planes, but if he is not \nsuccessful against our planes, what can he be successful against? Maybe \nthe KLA, or maybe he would be more aggressive in striking out where he \ncan have results on the ground.\n  So by initiating the bombing, instead of bringing stability, we may \nbe bringing instability. We may be igniting a tinderbox that has been \nvery, very explosive for a long time. I hope that doesn't happen, but I \ncan easily see how it could happen. I have heard my colleague, Senator \nInhofe, allude to the fact that former Secretary of State Henry \nKissinger alluded to that.\n  I will read this one sentence: `` The threatening escalation sketched \nby the President to Macedonia, Greece and Turkey are, in the long run, \nmore likely to result from the emergence of a Kosovo State.'' Well, the \nPresident, in this so-called peace accord, is supporting autonomy for \nKosovo. I have already stated that the Kosovo Liberation Army doesn't \nwant autonomy, they want independence. If they are an independent \nstate, many people see that usually aligned with Albania and may be \nincluding the Albanians in Macedonia. So you have a greater Albania \nwhich would be very destabilizing, certainly, toward the Greeks and \nmaybe other European allies. So the peace accord says we don't want \nindependence for Kosovo, we just want autonomy.\n\n  Former Secretary of State Kissinger says maybe that makes it more \ndangerous and maybe violence would be escalated in that process. \nInstead of being a stabilizing factor, it may be an escalating factor. \nThat is not just me saying that. That is Henry Kissinger and other \npeople I respect a great deal saying that, also.\n  I am glad we are going to be voting on this resolution. We are going \nto have this vote--at least that is our expectation. I know the leader \nis going to propound a request before too long. It is important that we \nvote on this. It would be easy for this Senator, or any other Senator, \nto say we are never going to vote on this; we can stop this, and \nfrankly, if you stop it long enough, maybe the President will be \nbombing and then you can say, hey, it doesn't make any difference, he \nalready started bombing. I think that would be a mistake. We ought to \nhave an up-or-down vote. Is this the right thing to do or not?\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the leader in his efforts to come \nto an agreement on a vote on this resolution. I, for one --I say ``for \none'' because even though I am assistant majority leader, I have not \nasked one colleague to vote one way or another on this resolution. Some \nissues are too important to play partisan politics on. I am not playing \npartisan politics. I refuse to do so. These are tough votes.\n  I remember the vote we had on the Persian Gulf war in 1991, \nauthorizing the use of force. We already had 550,000 troops stationed \nin the Persian Gulf ready to fulfill our obligations as outlined by \nPresident Bush to remove Saddam Hussein and the Iraqis from Kuwait. We \nhad a good debate on the floor. It wasn't easy. It was a close debate \nand a close vote--52-47. I thought it was a good vote the way it turned \nout.\n  I am going to vote against this resolution because I think it is a \nmistake. Maybe I am wrong, and if bombing commences, I hope and pray \nthat every single pilot will be returned safely, and that there will be \npeace and harmony and stability throughout Kosovo. But I am concerned \nthat we are making a mistake. I don't believe you can bomb a country \ninto submission and force them into a peace agreement that they \ndetermine is against their interest. I don't think you can bomb a \ncountry and say we are going to bomb you until you agree to have \nstationed 28,000 troops in your homeland. And this is Serbian homeland, \nand if you go back centuries, fighting has been going on in this \ncountry for centuries.\n  One other comment. Somebody said, ``What about the atrocities?'' I am \nconcerned about the atrocities, but we have to look at what is in our \nnational interest. There were 96 people killed in Borneo last weekend. \nIn Turkey, something like 37,000 Kurds have lost their lives. They want \nindependence. The\n\n[[Page S3097]]\n\nKurds in Iraq want independence; they want their own homeland. What \nabout in Sudan where there have been over a million lives lost? What \nabout Burundi, where 200,000 lives have been lost. Or Rwanda, where \n700,000 lives have been lost?\n\n  We have to be very careful. We had a Civil War in this country 130-\nsome years ago, and 600,000 Americans lost their lives. I am glad we \ndidn't have foreign powers intervene in our Civil War. I think that \nwould have been a mistake. I am afraid that we are making a mistake by \nintervening in the war now going on in Kosovo. I hope this resolution \nthat we are getting ready to vote on is not agreed to. I urge \ncolleagues to vote no on the resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senate is about to be presented with a \nresolution authorizing the President of the United States to intervene \nin a civil war in the Republic of Yugoslavia--one of many civil wars \ntaking place around the world, in which one dominant group is \nrepressing, killing, and displacing a minority group within their \nborders.\n  Mr. President, the cause of this civil war is Mr. Milosevic, the \ndictator of Serbia and of the Yugoslav Republic. But nowhere in any of \nthe administration's stated goals justifying this intervention is \nincluded the removal of Mr. Milosevic from his position of power. The \ngoal is neither a stated nor an unstated goal. Therefore, we are about \nto engage in a civil war in which we do not go after the cause of the \nwar.\n  Just a few years ago, the last occasion on which we debated \nauthorizing the President of the United States to engage the Armed \nForces of our country far from the borders of the United States, in \nIraq, after its invasion of Kuwait, we made the determination, and \nafter successfully removing the symptom, the invasion and occupation of \nKuwait, that we would not remove the cause--Saddam Hussein. As a \nconsequence of not going after the cause, we have been involved in \neither a cold or a hot war with Iraq ever since, at great cost in money \nto the United States, and at a considerable cost to our support for \nthat cause around the world.\n  Mr. President, once burned, twice shot. Why, having learned during \nthe war and its aftermath with Iraq that if you are going to use your \nArmed Forces, you ought to go after the cause, are we failing to do \nthat in this case? Here, as far as I can determine from what I hear \nfrom the administration, our goals are as follows:\n  We hope by the use of our Armed Forces to be permitted to send ground \ntroops to Kosovo for a period of a minimum of 3 years to enforce a \npeace that neither side in this civil war wishes. We will be there to \nenforce an autonomy for the Kosovars. That is not their ultimate goal, \nthat ultimate goal being independence.\n  Is there the slightest chance that this will be a peaceable, \ncasualty-free, 3-year occupation, at the end of which, having settled \nall of the problems of the Kosovars, we will come home? That certainly \nhas not happened in Bosnia, even after all sides were totally exhausted \nby a civil war.\n  Those goals of being allowed to occupy Kosovo and enforce an autonomy \nthat neither side wants are not goals justifying or warranting our \nAmerican military involvement. They are not goals involving the vital \nsecurity interests of the United States. In fact, if simply stopping a \nslaughter is a primary goal--and I believe that it is--there are far \ngreater slaughters taking place in Sudan, in several countries in \nAfrica, and in a number of other places around the world in which there \nhas been no request on the part of the administration to intervene. No, \nMr. President. This is an intervention that is highly unwise, highly \nunlikely to be successful, and not worth the investment of our money \nand lives, if it is successful, with the intermediate goals that the \nadministration uses to justify it.\n  Mr. President, this Senate Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, this Senate \nfirst step into getting into a situation, the consequences of which we \nsimply cannot envisage, and getting into it perhaps with less \njustification than there was in Vietnam in the midst of a cold war, \ngetting into it to involve ourselves in a civil war that for all \npractical purposes has already gone on for 600 years, is not--I repeat, \nnot--going to be settled by the United States of America in its \nintervention in a period of 2 or 3 years antiseptically cost free and \ncasualty free.\n  With my colleague from Oklahoma, I believe it more than appropriate \nthat we should be debating this resolution here tonight. I believe it \nmore than appropriate that we should vote yes or no on whether or not \nwe agree with the President. That President has finally grudgingly sent \nus a letter not asking for our authorization but for our support. This \nis an authorization. It is an authorization that the Senate of the \nUnited States, in its wisdom, should reject out of hand. This is not a \nmatter for the use of the Armed Forces of the United States. This is \nnot a matter demanded by our national security. This is not a way that \nwe would even settle the civil war taking place in Kosovo today.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote with me and will reject this \nresolution of authorization.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I get confused by this because I think the \nanalyses, although clearly heartfelt and searching, are totally out of \nproportion. This is Europe, not Asia. This is a place where we fought \ntwo world wars, where we got involved in the circumstances based upon \nthe legitimate concern of the spread of communism. This is part of an \nindustrialized world, not where we were in Vietnam. This is not a \nTonkin Gulf Resolution, which was clearly open ended. This is closed \nended. This is the circumstance. I find it fascinating--all these bad \nlessons we learned. What is the bad lesson we learned in Bosnia? We \nstopped bloodshed. We have 7,300 troops there. We have had as many as \n365,000 troops in Europe to preserve stability and democracy in Europe \nfor the past 54 years. We have 100,000 troops in Europe right now. We \nhave 100,000 troops who sit there.\n\n  If, in fact, it is a bad idea, and it is an open-ended commitment to \nkeep troops in Bosnia, to keep the peace with not a single American \nlife having been lost, without the destabilization of the region, \nwithout Croatia and Serbia being at war, without a flood of refugees \ninto Germany and into the rest of the area--if that is a bad idea--then \nwe shouldn't even have anybody in all of Europe. This is about \nstability in Europe.\n  The idea of comparing this to Somalia--a life in Somalia is equally \nas valuable as a life in Kosovo. But the loss of a life in Somalia and \nthe loss of a life in Kosovo have totally different consequences, in a \nMachiavellian sense, for the United States interests. If there is chaos \nin Europe, we have a problem. We are a European power. If, as a \nconsequence of this, there is a flood of refugees into any of the \nsurrounding--let's take Albania. Albania has a Greek population that is \na minority population, where there is already a problem. If radicalized \nAlbanian Kosovars are thrown out of Kosovo into Albania radicalizing \nthat society--because, by the way, when they burn down your home, when \nthey kill your mother, when they kneel your child on the ground and put \na gun to the back of his head and blow it off, it tends to radicalize \nyou. It tends to have that impact. We are talking about 400,000 to \n800,000 refugees. What happens if, in fact, the flood of refugees goes \nrolling into Macedonia, where you have two-thirds of the population \nthat is Slav, one-third Albanian? Just play out that little scenario \nfor me. What happens in that region?\n  I will not take the time of the Senate to go through the litany of \nwhy this clearly is in our interest. But at least let's agree that this \nisn't anything like Vietnam in terms of our interests--like Africa, or \nlike a whole lot of other places. We have an alliance called NATO. All \n19 members of NATO are in agreement that this is necessary. All of \nEurope is united. All of Europe is united in that we have no choice but \nto deal with this genocidal maniac.\n  With regard to this notion of a peace agreement that this is \ndesigned--my friend from the State of Washington, I\n\n[[Page S3098]]\n\nrespectfully suggest, misstated the objectives of the administration. \nThe objectives of the administration are the objectives of the rest of \nEurope--all 19 other nations as well as the contact group, I might \nadd--and the objectives are these: To stop the genocide, stop the \nethnic cleansing, stop the routing, stop the elimination of entire \nvillages in Kosovo, to have some guarantee that the civil rights, civil \nliberties, life and liberty of the people living in that region, 2 \nmillion people, are somewhat secure.\n  Why do we do that? Beyond the humanitarian reasons, why we do that \nis, we know what happens if it spins out of kilter. We know what the \ndownside is if the entire area is engulfed in this chaos. We also know \nfrom experience what happened in Bosnia. When we acted, when we put \nourselves on the line, when we demonstrated that we would not allow it \nto ``happen'' again, it worked.\n\n  My friends say it isn't working in Bosnia, because, if we move \nthrough, all of a sudden everything will fly apart.\n  That was the case in most of Europe for 30 years. If we removed the \ntroops in Europe in 1954, or 1958, the concern was all of Germany would \ngo. The concern was all of Europe would go. So we held out. We decided \nthat democracy tends to bring stability. I, for the life of me, do not \nunderstand why you can just cut out an entire--I wish I had a map \nhere--segment of Europe and say it can be in flames and chaos, and it \nhas no impact on us; it will have no impact on the alliance; it will \nhave no impact on our national security. That I do not understand.\n  I do agree that this is not an easy choice. I do agree that to know \nexactly what to do is debatable, legitimately debatable. But I do not \nagree that the purpose of the administration is, as was stated, to hope \nto be permitted to send ground troops.\n  The only reason why the proposal that was put forward by 19 NATO \nnations in Europe was put forward was not because we want to put in \nground troops. It was because we wanted a commitment that the genocide \nand ethnic cleansing in Kosovo would stop. I remind everybody, by the \nway, in 1989 and 1990 their rights were taken away. Their autonomy was \nstripped. During that first 7-year period, there was a policy of \nnonviolence on the part of the Kosovars led by a doctor named Rugova. \nAnd what happened was what some of us predicted: By failing to stop any \nof the actions of Milosevic and the ultranationalists in Serbia, one \nthing was bound to happen. Maybe it is because I am Irish I understand \nit. I watched it. We watched it historically for 80 years in Ireland. \nThat is, when peaceful means fail and people continue to be cleansed, \ndenied their civil rights and their civil liberties, denied the ability \nto work, denied the ability to worship, denied the ability to speak \ntheir language, they become radicalized. So all of a sudden Rugova \nfound himself odd man out, as the KLA gained credibility and momentum, \nbasically saying: You are not getting it done for us so we are going to \nuse the violent means.\n\n  What do we think is going to happen if we walk away? The objective is \nto stop the oppression of men, women and children who are a minority in \nSerbia, but make up the majority in Kosovo; to say it will stop. The \nonly way it will stop is one of two: Either Mr. Milosevic is denied the \nmeans to continue his oppression, or he comes to the table, agrees to \nstop it, and allows international forces in there to guarantee that he \nwill stop it.\n  That is what this is about. You may not think that is a worthwhile \ngoal. I understand that. I understand that. But this is not about the \ndesire to send troops. It is about the desire to keep that part of the \nworld from spinning out of control. I see two of my colleagues wish to \nspeak so I will cease with the following comment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield to me for just a question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I sure will.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am constrained to go back to the time when we had the \nPersian Gulf crisis and we had Iraq in Kuwait, threatening to go into \nSaudi Arabia. What is the difference between that situation, where it \nactually had taken place, and this threat the Senator is describing in \nSerbia and in Kosovo now?\n  Mr. BIDEN. There is a big difference. The difference is it is in the \ncenter of Europe, No. 1. No. 2, if Europe in fact becomes destabilized, \nwe are deeply involved in matters far beyond what is existing now.\n  I acknowledge to my friend, though, what was at stake in the Middle \nEast was oil, was economic security, and was a lot of other things at \nthe time. So it is, in fact, a legitimate point to make that that was a \ncritical vote. I voted against that involvement--I am sure the next \npoint my friend was going to make. I voted against that involvement. I \ninsisted, along with others, there be a resolution to authorize the use \nof force.\n  But the argument I would make is, although you can argue it made \nsense to do what we did, it is a different reason why we moved; a \ndifferent reason why it occurred; a different reason why it was \nnecessary. It seems to me, comparing what we did in the gulf, comparing \nthat to what we do here either for purposes of justifying action here \nor not justifying action here, is an inappropriate analogy. It stands \non its own. It either made sense or it didn't make sense. It turns out \nit made sense to move in the gulf and I argue it makes sense for us to \ntake this action now in the Balkans.\n  So, if I can conclude so my friend from Kentucky, who has been \nseeking the floor, can get the floor, Senator Nickles started off a few \nmoments ago pointing out that seven of us, assigned by the leadership, \nmet to see whether we could work out a compromise resolution. Senator \nNickles pointed out that the resolution that we agreed to move with, \nassuming the procedural circumstances allowed it to be done, was one \nthat was a straight-up authorization for the use of airpower in \nconjunction with NATO against Serbia and Mr. Milosevic. That was the \nlanguage as to how to proceed that was agreed to.\n\n  Senator Nickles indicated he would vote against that, notwithstanding \nthe fact that he helped craft what the language would be. And that \nmakes sense, by the way. He was trying to figure out what is the best, \nsimplest, most straightforward way to get an up-or-down vote on what \nthe President wants to do.\n  In the meantime, the President has sent us a letter asking for \nlegislation to be able to do this. He has asked us whether or not we \nwould support the use of airpower in conjunction with NATO. I think we \nshould get, at the appropriate point, an up-or-down vote on that. I \nunderstand my friend from Alaska may have an amendment to that \nresolution, if it ever comes up freestanding, dealing with a \nprohibition of ground troops, but we should get to the business of \ndealing with that which we are getting at now. I hope through the \nleadership of the majority leader we can somehow clear the decks and \nget to a vote on the resolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be happy to yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I worked with the Senator from Delaware \nand others you mentioned. You used the phrase, ``we agreed to it.'' \nYes, the group of six or seven did, but it was a recommendation to our \nrespective leadership.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have, since that time, worked with Senator Lott and we \npretty well, I think, have this thing ready to be presented to the \nSenate. As you mentioned, our distinguished colleague from Alaska has \npossibly some thoughts on it that have not been completed yet--that are \nto be incorporated--but I want to be sure nothing has been agreed to. \nIt is just a recommendation to the leadership. Our group did, I think, \na very fine job in consolidating the thoughts of a number of us who \nhave been working on this for several days. I am hopeful we can bring \nit up very shortly.\n  I know the Senator is looking for one Senator who was a part of that \ngroup to give his blessing to certain phraseology.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I appreciate the intervention by the \nSenator from Virginia. He is absolutely correct. Let me be even more \nprecise. Seven of us agreed on the vehicle that we recommend to the \nleadership that we should be voting on. We agreed to that language. I \ncame back with one of my\n\n[[Page S3099]]\n\nDemocratic colleagues, Senator Levin, spoke with the minority leader, \nand indicated that this is what we had agreed to. He indicated he \nthought that was an appropriate vehicle, appropriate way to proceed and \nI might add, some of the Senators in the room, although they agreed to \nthe language, I want to make clear, were not agreeing to the substance \nof the language. They agreed that this is an appropriate test vote. \nThis is an appropriate vote to determine whether or not the Senate \nagrees or disagrees with the President. Several of them--one of them at \nleast--said, ``I will not vote for it''; two of them said, ``I will not \nvote for it but I agree this is how we should decide the issue.''\n  I understand that the majority leader has to make a judgment as to \nwhat vehicle we use, when we use it, how we will use it, but I hope we \ncan get an up-or-down vote on some direct vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. I think very \nshortly we will have a document to present to the Senate.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BUNNING addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BUNNING. I am more than happy to yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to have some parameter on \nthese discussions so that we might get back to the bill and finish it \nthis evening. Could I inquire of the Senator from Kentucky how long he \nintends to speak?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Not very long, Mr. President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. More than 10 minutes?\n  Mr. BUNNING. No.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I see Senator Brownback. Does he wish to speak on this \nsubject?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to speak on Kosovo about 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I see that Senator Warner's hand is up.\n  Does the Senator intend to speak also?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I intend to address the remarks of my two \ncolleagues. I am a cosponsor, with Senator Biden, and I have some very \ndefinite statements to make.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, with due deference to my friend from \nVirginia, that matter is not pending before the Senate and the \nsupplemental is. I wonder if the Senators would agree to some time \nlimit so we can tell Members when we will get back to the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we want to accommodate the distinguished \nchairman. It is important that this colloquy ensues. The distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky is in opposition to me. I presume my colleague \nlikewise is in opposition to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these \nSenators have 30 minutes to continue this discussion and at that time \nwe return to the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, could we \nestablish a discussion order?\n  Mr. STEVENS. He has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to have the opportunity to, \non occasion, interject, have a colloquy with both of you, not to exceed \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I agree to 10 minutes, as will the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, this resolution which is about to come \nbefore the Senate will be something we should have voted on maybe 2 \nweeks ago. Unfortunately, we are voting on it under an extreme \ntimeframe, and I think that is unfortunate for all of us.\n  If there are negotiations that have really gone on, it has been one-\nsided. The Serbs have never sat down and really negotiated in good \nfaith with anyone. Only because they were asked to show up at the \ntable, they showed up for a short time and left immediately. Now the \ndebate has shifted and is not about peacekeeping, not about deploying \npeacekeepers anymore; it is about going to war with a foreign \ngovernment. NATO, the United Nations, have never gone to war in a civil \nwar situation. That is what we are about to do, and we have been \nconsulted to the point of being told exactly what the President intends \nto do, whether or not--whether or not--we agree or disagree.\n  In 1991, President Bush came to the House and to the Senate and asked \nfor specific resolutions to go to war to defend Kuwait against Iraqi \ninvasion. It was a major vote to go to war in the House. It was a very \nnarrow vote in the Senate. I think by five votes they voted to support \nPresident Bush.\n  I read on the Internet today what was supposed to be a private \nbriefing that we all had at lunch by the Secretary of Defense and by \nthe head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That private personal briefing \nwas totally on the Internet this afternoon.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what it said so everybody in the United \nStates can understand exactly what is going to happen. There will be \ntwo different types of airstrikes. There will be a preliminary \nairstrike--and this is on the Internet; all you have to do is look it \nup--two kinds of airstrikes to force Belgrade into accepting NATO \nground troops.\n  The first strike would be a demonstration strike by air- and sea-\nlaunched cruise missiles to soften up Milosevic to know that we are \nreally serious about this. Then there would be a pause to give the \nSerbian leadership a chance to realize that we are serious. If the \nSerbs do not comply, there would be a second wave of strikes that would \nbe targeted to air defense and missile installations by the same type \nof military hardware. In fact, 55 percent, or a little less, of all of \nthe airstrikes done will be 70 percent by U.S. hardware and, if we use \naircraft, 54 percent of it exactly will be by U.S. aircraft.\n  This is in the middle of Europe. This is not at our borders in Mexico \nor Canada.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May we have order, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. BUNNING. The second wave would be to take down the missile \ndefenses.\n  Let me give you a little background. In 1991, we had a briefing in \nthe House of Representatives by Dick Cheney, who was Secretary of \nDefense, and by Colin Powell, who was the head of the Joint Chiefs. \nThey both said the same thing: The worst thing we can do is to send \nground troops into Bosnia and Kosovo or any of that area, because of \nthe logistics, because of the terrain, because of the weather. One of \nthe things that they also said was that airstrikes would be very \nquestionable. The reason they were going to be questionable was that \nthe sophistication of the missile defenses and of the air defenses of \nthe Serbs was much better than many other places. The terrain is much \nmore difficult.\n  What we are doing is wrong. What the President asked us to do at the \n11th hour is wrong. We should not be going into an independent nation's \ncivil war and imposing our will, no matter what the situation is.\n  Now, the Senator from Oklahoma brought up many other places we could \nbe intervening that we could save more lives--many places in Africa. If \nwe expend the same amount of dollars like we are going to expend in \nKosovo, we could save many more lives. This attack is premeditated and \nthe Congress is an afterthought. They want us to agree to it after they \nhave already decided to go.\n  This is a great institution, the Senate. I have come to love it in a \nvery short time. These debates should be before the fact, not after the \nadministration has already made up their mind to bomb. The same is true \nabout sending ground troops.\n  I want to ask President Clinton these questions: What vital American \nsecurity interests are at stake? What is the long-term strategy for the \nregion? Not only do we bomb one wave and a second wave, and a third \nrequest is to send in 4,000 additional men and women from the United \nStates in ground troops. What is the long-term strategy for the region? \nHow do we get in and how do we get out? How long will the troops be \ndeployed? What is their mission?\n  What is the mission they are supposed to accomplish?\n  Will we be forced to deploy more ground troops if the 4,000 are not \nsufficient?\n\n[[Page S3100]]\n\n  Will foreign commanders be commanding our troops under NATO?\n  What are the rules of engagement?\n  How will the mission be paid for?\n  What valuable dollars will be taken away from military readiness \naccounts to pay for this?\n  What is our exit strategy?\n  President Clinton, you have not answered these questions. You have \nnot come before the Congress of the United States and asked for our \nhelp. I think it is essential that you do so before you send one \nAmerican into harm's way when you have not proven the need to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if I might use my 5 minutes and \nengage the Senator in a colloquy and then yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have to preside at 6.\n  Mr. WARNER. At some point, we have to have some rebuttal to the \nstrong arguments on this side. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia very \nmuch. I am sorry to assert myself at this point, but I have to preside \nshortly.\n  Mr. President, I think the Senate and the American people, hopefully, \nheard a number of strong arguments questioning whether or not we should \nstart this bombing campaign at this point in time.\n\n  Let me say categorically, I am concerned about the carnage that is \ntaking place in Kosovo and in Europe and the number of people who are \ndisplaced that the newspapers put at 45,000, the number of people who \nhave been killed, and the possibility of refugees in the surrounding \narea.\n  Let me also say that if our troops are engaged and are starting to \nbomb or are put there, I will support the troops. If they go to battle, \nI will support them. But this action at this point in time seems to me \nto be ill-advised. If the Senate has not been properly consulted, the \nAmerican people have not been properly consulted and brought along, and \nwe should back up and rethink what we are about to do in this area. We \nare making an act of war against a sovereign nation, with likely loss \nof U.S. life, and neither the Senate nor this Nation has been \nadequately consulted.\n  The Senator from Delaware previously spoke and talked about the \nobjective is to stop oppression that is occurring. I am supportive of \nstopping oppression, but if we are looking at oppression, that occurs a \nnumber of places around the world.\n  If we want to stop oppression, I have a better suggestion. Let's \nengage in the Sudan, not with troops, not with bombing, but let's \nsupport the southern Sudanese. They have 4 million people displaced at \nthe present time. Two million have had a loss of life, and there you \nhave a government in Khartoum that is supporting terrorism in the \nsurrounding region in Uganda, Eritrea, and Congo, that is expanding, \nthat is a militant fundamentalist regime that seeks to do us harm. \nThere you have a vital strategic United States interest.\n  If we want to stop oppression, let's supply and support the southern \nSudanese. If that is what the objective is, then let's do something \nthere where we can help save more lives, help more people, and also a \nvital and strategic U.S. interest.\n  I do not see us doing that. The situation taking place in Europe is a \nsad situation, but one where I really question whether we should put \nforth the loss of U.S. lives which is contemplated at this point in \ntime.\n  Perhaps this can be explained over some period of time. Perhaps the \nadministration can engage the American public and the Congress to get \nthat kind of support. But I cannot give that at this point in time on \nthe basis of the information I have to date.\n  Plus, what is the plan? The Senator from Kentucky just asked a number \nof very simple and very basic questions. Here is a Member of the Senate \nasking these sorts of simple and basic questions, saying, ``I don't \nknow the answers to these things.'' Nor do I.\n  Have we been sufficiently brought along and engaged and had \ndiscussions on these items that we can have such basic questions and \nnot even know the answers to them? We have been told there is going to \nbe a bombing campaign, maybe several ways of bombing. What if Mr. \nMilosevic does not blink at that point in time and says, ``OK, we are \ngoing to support some kind of autonomy in Kosovo\"? What then? What is \nthe plan at that point in time? Are we engaging ground troops not in a \npeacekeeping but aggressive fashion? I do not think people will support \nthat.\n  After Kosovo, is it Montenegro next where we will be going in and \nsupporting, supplying people who want a separatist movement, if that \nwere to happen in that region of the former Yugoslavia? What next? And \nwhat is the full plan?\n\n  We just do not have the answers to these questions, and we are about \nto take an act against a sovereign nation that is likely to result in \nthe loss of U.S. lives.\n  Now is the time to debate and discuss and to back up and slow down on \nthis, have the administration engage the American public, engage the \nCongress in answering the simple questions that my colleagues have put \nforward. Now is the time to do that.\n  I ask the President, please, let's have that sort of discussion on \nthose sorts of specifics with the American public before we move in to \nwhat I think could be a very ill-fated, ill-timed, and inappropriate \naction at this point in time by the United States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  It is my hope to engage, through some questioning, my colleagues. The \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky left. I did not want an impression \nleft with the Senate that nothing has been done on the complicated \nissues of Kosovo as related to Bosnia, as related to the region.\n  The Armed Services Committee has had a series of hearings, a series \nof briefings. The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee knows of an amendment that the bill contained last year by \nSenator Roberts which outlined considerable work in this area. So I \nbelieve the Senate has addressed this issue off and on for some time.\n  The Armed Services Committee last week, when we had all four of the \nService Chiefs up, we asked each one specifically, regarding the risk \nof this operation, what opposition they were going to meet in terms of \nair defense alone, and they replied it was significant, it was \nmultiples of two or three of what had been experienced in Bosnia, which \nis being experienced almost every day in Iraq. We have had a \nconsiderable deliberation, I think, in various areas of the Senate. \nThis is, of course, the first action.\n  It is my hope that very shortly, with the concurrence of the two \nleaders, Mr. Lott and Mr. Daschle, we can send to the desk a relatively \nshort resolution which will provide Senators with a clear up-or-down \nvote. I will just read a draft. It as yet has not been finally \napproved. It is submitted by Mr. Biden, myself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Levin, \nMr. Byrd, and Mr. McConnell. Those are the sponsors to date.\n  It reads:\n\n       Concurrent resolution--Authorizing the President of the \n     United States to conduct military air operations and missile \n     strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia \n     and Montenegro).\n       Resolved by the Senate . . .\n       That the President of the United States is authorized to \n     conduct military air operations and missile strikes in \n     cooperation with our NATO allies against the Federal Republic \n     of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).\n\n  That clarity was achieved by a group of six of us. The distinguished \nmajority whip, Mr. Nickles, sort of had the unofficial job of presiding \nover the group. He made it clear from the beginning his opposition to \nthis, but, nevertheless, I think we succeeded in devising what the \nSenate desired, and hope will be concurred in, in terms of bringing it \nup for further debate of this resolution.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, are we under some time agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The time agreements have \nexpired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thirty minutes has expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 30 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May I have 3 minutes? I ask unanimous consent that I \nhave 3 minutes.\n\n[[Page S3101]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limit now. The Senator can \nspeak as he wishes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Then I will speak to my heart's content.\n  Mr. STEVENS. No. No. No.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, you don't think that should be \nthe case? Who knows. My heart's content may be only 3 or 4 minutes on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. President, I believe under the guise of the Constitution, which \ngives the President, as Commander in Chief, some very, very strong \npowers over what he does, where he places, and what he asks our \nmilitary to do, that we are beginning now, in this President's \nadministration, to go down the slippery path that the President can \nengage our military almost anywhere, any time, so long as it pleases \nhim and he decides it is in our national interest.\n  I say, shame on the President. If this is such an important matter, \nwhy could he not trust the Senate and the House to ask us whether we \nconcur?\n  Let me say, Mr. President--not the President who occupies the Chair, \nbut our President down on Pennsylvania Avenue--with your last budget, \nwe will have spent $12.3 billion in Bosnia--$12.3 billion. There was \nnot even enough money in the defense budget. At one point we had to \ndeclare it an emergency, after 3 years of being involved, to pay for \nit, because to pay for it would have stripped our military of other \nthings that they desperately need to be our strong military force.\n  What are we up to? We are going to take up the budget on the floor, \nand I predict that if we authorize, or do not authorize the President, \nhe is going to do it anyway. And there will be Senators from the other \nside of the aisle who will stand up and want to take money out of the \nDefense Department to spend on domestic programs. But they will vote \nhere tonight to send our men and women off to this war and claim they \nwill never go in there.\n  But let me tell you, this is a very, very unintelligible plan. You \ncannot rationally accept the President's reasoning unless you conclude \nthat they do not want to tell you where it is going to end up. It does \nnot take a lot of sense to say airstrike No. 1 may not work, airstrike \nNo. 2 may not work. We have been told by military experts years ago \nthat airstrikes would not work in this area of the world.\n  So what then happens? That is the extent of our plan? Who believes \nthat? I ask those who believe in the great United States of America, \nwith its President leading the way, who sent the bombers in, sent in \nthe stealth fighters, sent in the Tomahawk missiles--and the big leader \nwho has caused all the trouble is not dead yet and will not quit, what \nare we going to do?\n  I asked the question already of the leaders representing the \nPresident, and they say there is no plan. Wait a minute. No plan? Well, \nNATO may have a plan, but America does not have a plan for the third \nphase, which is probably putting military men and women in harm's way.\n  What is NATO without America? They have just described, NATO without \nAmerica in these airstrikes probably could not get the job done. The \nwhole of NATO without us probably would not undertake it. So do you \nbelieve the third phase, which we do not want to talk about, is going \nto get done without America, if there is a third phase?\n  And will there be a third phase? I do not know. I have a hunch that \nphase 1, of airstrikes from a distance through Tomahawk missiles, and \nphase 2, with actual airplanes of one sort or another, may not work. I \nwould think it would be fair for the President of the United States, \nsince we have been at this issue for months--as it got worse they \nthreatened and then pulled the threat--to ask the Senate, as George \nBush did, and get concurrence. And if we did not concur, wouldn't it be \na pretty good signal that we do not think it is right? What is wrong \nwith that?\n\n  As I understand it, there will be an amendment, there will be a \nproposal, freestanding perhaps, asking that we concur with the \nPresident of the United States in airstrikes. I am not going to vote \nfor it, because I do not think that is the end of it.\n  I ask one simple question: Is this not a declaration of war without \nasking us, who, under the Constitution, were given authority to declare \nwar? Isn't it an invasion of a sovereign country by a military that is \nmore than half American? I believe it is. You can make all kinds of \nrationalizations that it is not an invasion, but it is. Is it not a \ncivil war? Yes, it is. Is it not a civil war of long lasting? It did \nnot start last week.\n  These people have been at civil war for God knows how long. And they \nare going to be there after the airstrikes unless there is a large \ncontingent of soldiers to keep the peace. Is that what we are going to \ndo? Are we going to have soldiers in there under the third phase or the \nfourth phase? What if they just do not agree to a peace treaty after \nall these bombs? Do we walk away? I do not believe we will. From my \nstandpoint, we never should have gone in.\n  So, Mr. President, I believe the President of the United States, once \nagain, has waited so long that he has us right in a spot. He does it \nall the time. He has us in the spot that a terrible tragedy is going to \noccur unless we agree with him in the next 24 hours, or perhaps he even \nthinks unless you have already agreed with me today. But who knows, the \nTomahawks may be flying tonight. At this point it is dark over there. \nAnd that is when they will start. Everybody knows that.\n  So I say to the President of the United States, since you like us to \nconsider your prerogatives under the U.S. Constitution--and we do it \nall the time--why don't you consider ours? Why don't you ask us? And \nwhy don't you wait until we give you an answer? That seems fair to me. \nWhat we are doing is not fair to the Congress. And if it isn't fair to \nus, it is not fair to our people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator yield for a moment of colloquy here?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. WARNER. A group of us met this morning with the President. We had \na very thorough exchange of views. Senator Byrd raised the issue of the \nPresident asking the Senate. I followed Senator Byrd and repeated the \nquestion. And he said orally: ``Yes, I do want the support of the \nSenate, indeed, the Congress.'' And he has now sent a letter to the \nleadership of the Congress.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What does it say?\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to the Senator, I will be happy to read it.\n\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I appreciate the opportunity to consult \n     closely with the Congress regarding events in Kosovo.\n       The United States' national interests are clear and \n     significant. The ongoing effort by President Milosevic to \n     attack and repress the people of Kosovo could ignite a wider \n     European war with dangerous consequences to the United \n     States. This is a conflict with no natural boundaries. If it \n     continues it will push refugees across borders and draw in \n     neighboring countries.\n       NATO has authorized air strikes against the Former \n     Yugoslavia to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and to \n     address the threat to peace and security in the Balkan region \n     and Europe. Mr. Milosevic should not doubt our resolve. \n     Therefore, without regard to our differing views on the \n     Constitution about the use of force, I ask for your \n     legislative support as we address the crisis in Kosovo.\n       We all can be proud of our armed forces as they stand ready \n     to answer the call of duty in the Balkans.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  I say to my colleague, what is the consequence if we do nothing, if \nwe do nothing, if we stand there? Here we are, the leader of NATO. Here \nwe are, the leader of so many agreements throughout Europe that have \nprovided for the greater security of Europe in the past, throughout the \nhistory of NATO.\n  What do we say to the men and women of the Armed Forces who will be \nin the airplanes, perhaps as early as tomorrow some time? I am not \npredicting the hour, but it could be. What do we say to them? That the \npeople of the United States, through their elected Representatives, are \nnot supportive?\n  I know the strong arguments against going in. And I respect my \ncolleague. But I say to my colleague, it has not been spoken, with \nclarity, as to what the consequences are if we do nothing. I predict it \nwould be an absolutely disastrous situation in that region, that it \ncould grow in proportion far beyond the crisis of the moment, and that \nat that juncture, if military action were required, it would require \ngreater military force than envisioned by the limited airstrike, \nlimited in the sense that that component of our arsenal and that\n\n[[Page S3102]]\n\nof 18 other nations--this is a 19-nation operation--be required to \nstamp out a literal implosion of that whole Balkan region. I say to my \ngood friend, I respect his views, but I think we also have to address \nwhat happens if we do nothing.\n  I recognize we are intruding on the time of the distinguished \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee and others. I know of no more \nsignificant issue than to send our people into harm's way, which \nrequires the debate of the Senate. I shall stand here at every \nopportunity I can to give my views on why I think it is essential that \nwe approve the actions as recommended.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't believe Senator Warner, with all \nthe respect that we hold for him, should stand on the floor of the \nSenate and say that anyone who votes that we should not go in there \nwill not be in support of the military people who happen to go in there \nbecause the President prevailed.\n  As a matter of fact, most of the Senators who have supported the \nmilitary of the United States to the highest extent over the years will \nprobably be voting against sending them in, but will be right there \nsupporting them, and the Senator knows that and they should know that.\n  I do my share in my little role as a budgeteer to see that the \nmilitary gets sufficient money, and I will do that again this year. I \nhope you all come down here when people want to take the money away \nfrom them. Just because I don't like what they are doing doesn't mean I \ndon't love the military and the men and women out there doing it. We \nwill support them, but we have a right to warn the American people and \ntell them what this is all about.\n  If you say, What is going to happen if we don't? I ask you, what \nhappened in the other countries of the world that had revolutions where \nhundreds of thousands of people were killed and we didn't go in because \nit wasn't in our national interest?\n  I happen to think that is the case here. It is not in our national \ninterest.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I could reply, nothing in the remarks by the Senator \nfrom Virginia in this moment or earlier today from this period infer \nthat a Senator voting against this proposed resolution in its draft \nform in any way does not support the men and women of the Armed Forces.\n  I simply say at this hour when we are trying to debate this, it would \nseem to me that those who can come and support this resolution--it is \nclearly in support of what they are about to do; they are likely to go.\n  I am convinced that the President has a resolve with the other \nleaders of NATO to go forth with this military mission. It is important \nthat debate here in the Senate take place. Every Senator will vote his \nor her conscience, and I know that there will be 100 votes in support \nof the troops if they are called upon to take on this high risk \ntogether with their families.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have been waiting here for an hour. I \nwas supposed to get the floor at 6:10.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, that is why I asked permission to get the \nfloor. I am happy to yield to the Appropriations chairman. In fact, I \nwill direct the question to the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n\n  I wanted to make an inquiry through the Chair to the manager of this \nbill and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee as to how we are \ncoming on the supplemental emergency appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I think the Senator from New Mexico still has the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will use only 1 minute.\n  Let me say, I had no reluctance to ask the distinguished chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee to read the President's letter. Without \nhaving seen it, I know it would not contain words saying ``and if you \ndo not vote in support I will not send them in.'' It merely said, ``I \nsure would like to have you joining me.''\n  President Bush didn't do that. He said, ``Concur or we don't have a \nwar.'' There is a big difference.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield to my friend for a comment or \nquestion or whatever he wants, but I want to get back to this bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, directing a question through the Chair to \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee, could the Senator bring \nus up to date as to how we are doing on the underlying legislation; \nnamely, the supplemental appropriations bill?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am delighted to do that. I hope to get \ninvolved in this statement about Kosovo sometime tonight, and I think \nit will be a late night. Everybody ought to be on notice. I am going to \ntry to finish the supplemental bill tonight.\n  We have the managers' package coming and it is being brought to me. I \nhope the people are listening right now. I am prepared to outline that. \nWe do have an amendment that is pending, the Murkowski amendment. I \nunderstand the Senator from Montana will make a motion to table that \nand that will require a vote. We also have an amendment that I have \nbeen requested by the leader to offer concerning the question of rule \nXVI. I understand that may be objected to. We will have to see how to \nhandle that when it occurs. I do believe we will have to handle it \ntonight. I have the managers' package of about 10 amendments that have \nbeen cleared on both sides and are being analyzed from the point of \nview of the budget. It would be my hope we could proceed with that \nmatter now.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator allow me to make a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes. I am not saying I might not object to it, though.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am trying to put a record together for the benefit of \nall Senators. I simply ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the letter that President Bush sent the Senate in 1991, so each \nSenator can compare them.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, so long as the Senator \nalso has printed at the same time for the Record the joint resolution \nthat was adopted by a vote of 52-47, following President Bush's letter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. I shall not object because I drew up the resolution, if \nthe Senator will look at the first name on it.\n  There being no objection, the letter and joint resolution were \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n       [Letter dated January 8, 1991 from President George Bush to \n     Hon. Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, requesting that the House of Representatives \n     and the Senate adopt a resolution stating that Congress \n     supports the use of all necessary means to implement U.N. \n     Security Council Resolution 678]\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                      Washington, January 8, 1991.\n     Hon. Thomas S. Foley,\n     Speaker of the House,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: The current situation in the Persian \n     Gulf, brought about by Iraq's unprovoked invasion and \n     subsequent brutal occupation of Kuwait, threatens vital U.S. \n     interests. The situation also threatens the peace. It would, \n     however, greatly enhance the chances for peace if Congress \n     were now to go on record supporting the position adopted by \n     the UN Security Council on twelve separate occasions. Such an \n     action would underline that the United States stands with the \n     international community and on the side of law and decency; \n     it also would help dispel any belief that may exist in the \n     minds of Iraq's leaders that the United States lacks the \n     necessary unity to act decisively in response to Iraq's \n     continued aggression against Kuwait.\n       Secretary of State Baker is meeting with Iraq's Foreign \n     Minister on January 9. It would have been most constructive \n     if he could have presented the Iraqi government a Resolution \n     passed by both houses of Congress supporting the UN position \n     and in particular Security Council Resolution 678. As you \n     know, I have frequently stated my desire for such a \n     Resolution. Nevertheless, there is still opportunity for \n     Congress to act to strengthen the prospects for peace and \n     safeguard this country's vital interests.\n       I therefore request that the House of Representatives and \n     the Senate adopt a Resolution stating that Congress supports \n     the use of all necessary means to implement UN Security \n     Council Resolution 678. Such action would send the clearest \n     possible message to Saddam Hussein that he must withdraw \n     without condition or delay from Kuwait. Anything less would \n     only encourage Iraqi intransigence; anything less would risk \n     detracting from the international coalition arrayed against \n     Iraq's aggression.\n       Mr. Speaker, I am determined to do whatever is necessary to \n     protect America's security. I ask Congress to join me in this \n     task. I can think of no better way than for Congress to \n     express its support for the President\n\n[[Page S3103]]\n\n     at this critical time. This truly is the last best chance for \n     peace.\n           Sincerely,\n     George Bush.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas the Government of Iraq without provocation invaded \n     and occupied the territory of Kuwait on August 2, 1990;\n       Whereas both the House of Representatives (in H.J. Res. 658 \n     of the 101st Congress) and the Senate (in S. Con. Res. 147 of \n     the 101st Congress) have condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait \n     and declared their support for international action to \n     reverse Iraq's aggression;\n       Whereas, Iraq's conventional, chemical, biological, and \n     nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs and its \n     demonstrated willingness to use weapons of mass destruction \n     pose a grave threat to world peace;\n       Whereas the international community has demanded that Iraq \n     withdraw unconditionally and immediately from Kuwait and that \n     Kuwait's independence and legitimate government be restored;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council repeatedly \n     affirmed the inherent right of individual or collective self-\n     defense in response to the armed attack by Iraq against \n     Kuwait in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations \n     Charter;\n       Whereas, in the absence of full compliance by Iraq with its \n     resolutions, the United Nations Security Council in \n     Resolution 678 has authorized member states of the United \n     Nations to use all necessary means, after January 15, 1991, \n     to uphold and implement all relevant Security Council \n     resolutions and to restore international peace and security \n     in the area; and\n       Whereas Iraq has persisted in its illegal occupation of, \n     and brutal aggression against Kuwait: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Will the chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I wonder if the chairman could attempt to get clearance \nfrom the two leaders--maybe one way to move this along is to vote on \nthe underlying motion to table that will be made shortly.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am pleased to do that, but we have to check with both \nsides to see about the timing. I hope the Senator will help me on that. \nI will check, also, to see if we can get an agreement as to when that \nshould be.\n  At the present time, am I correct, Mr. President, the pending \nbusiness is the Murkowski amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for a \nparliamentary inquiry.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Where in the line is the Hutchison amendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Hutchison amendment was put aside. It is my \nunderstanding, I say to the Senator from Texas, it was put aside so we \ncould proceed with the balance of the supplemental. It will be the last \namendment to be considered. It could be called up by requesting the \nregular order by either the majority leader or myself.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. At some point following the Murkowski amendment, I \nwould like the opportunity to address my amendment and set it aside.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is my understanding correct that the amendment of the \nSenator from Texas is set aside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is set aside, subject to being called back \nby the Senator from Texas or the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Very well. Then the Senator has that right. It was not \nmy understanding at the time, but I am prepared--I am not prepared to \nyield this floor until I can find out how we can get back to getting \nsome votes and get these matters resolved and finish this bill tonight.\n  I know my colleague is seeking to be recognized. There was a Senator \nwho was supposed to come over and make a motion to table the amendment \nof my colleague. As my colleague knows, I don't do that.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Will the floor manager yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Alaska yield to the \nSenator from Alaska?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it would be my pleasure at this time to \nyield briefly to my colleague for a question.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. What I am attempting to do is accommodate the floor \nmanager by advising him that we are certainly ready for a vote on a \ntabling motion, so that you can advise Members of the scheduled for the \nbalance of the evening. Maybe we can get a time certain.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I say to my friend and colleague that we are checking \nout the time of 6:45. I hope that clears. It is my understanding that \nSenator Reid will make the motion to table the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Alaska. I could at this time start with the process of reviewing \nsome of these amendments in my manager's package.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if I could pretty much count on that. I would \nlike to leave for about 20 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. My friend can be assured that it won't happen before \n6:45. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Nevada for the purpose \nof making a motion to table.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Montana, \nSenator Baucus, I move to table the Murkowski amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur \nat 6:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 113 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate Senate \naction on amendment No. 113 and ask that the amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have the manager's package that I \nmentioned, which includes 10 amendments. As I have said, we tried our \nbest to clear these amendments throughout the Senate. I hope the Senate \nwill agree to this package. It has been cleared on both sides.\n  First is an amendment by Senator Helms to appropriate, with a \ncorresponding rescission, funds for the U.S. Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom. Second is an amendment by Senator \nGrassley to appropriate, with a corresponding rescission, funds for \nregional applications programs, consistent with the direction and the \nreport to accompany Public Law 105-277. Third is an amendment by myself \nto allow military technicians, while deployed, to receive per diem \nexpenses. Fourth is an amendment by myself clarifying the intent of the \nfiscal year 1998 and 1999 Interior and related agency appropriations \nbills in relation to Pike's Peak Summit House. Fifth is an amendment by \nSenator Gregg in relation to an issue for renewal of fishing permits \nand fishing\n\n[[Page S3104]]\n\nvessel operations.

and\n       (10) a national security policy should be developed that \n     ensures that adequate supplies of oil are available at all \n     times free of the threat of embargo or other foreign hostile \n     acts.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Board.--The term ``Board'' means the Loan Guarantee \n     Board established by subsection (e).\n       (2) Program.--The term ``Program'' means the Emergency Oil \n     and Gas Guaranteed Loan Program established by subsection \n     (d).\n       (3) Qualified oil and gas company.--The term ``qualified \n     oil and gas company'' means a company that--\n       (A) is incorporated under the laws of any State;\n       (B) is--\n       (i) an independent oil and gas company (within the meaning \n     of section 57(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986);

and\n       (4) the company has agreed to an audit by the General \n     Accounting Office, before issuance of the loan guarantee and \n     annually while the guaranteed loan is outstanding.\n       (g) Terms and Conditions of Loan Guarantees.--\n       (1) Loan duration.--All loans guaranteed under this section \n     shall be repayable in full not later than December 31, 2010, \n     and the terms and conditions of each such loan shall provide \n     that the loan agreement may not be amended, or any provision \n     of the loan agreement waived, without the consent of the \n     Board.\n       (2) Loan security.--A commitment to issue a loan guarantee \n     under this section shall contain such affirmative and \n     negative covenants and other protective provisions as the \n     Board determines are appropriate. The Board shall require \n     security for the loans to be guaranteed under this section at \n     the time at which the commitment is made.\n       (3) Fees.--A qualified oil and gas company receiving a loan \n     guarantee under this section shall pay a fee in an amount \n     equal to 0.5 percent of the outstanding principal balance of \n     the guaranteed loan to the Department of the Treasury.\n       (h) Reports.--During fiscal year 1999 and each fiscal year \n     thereafter until each guaranteed loan has been repaid in \n     full, the Secretary of Commerce shall submit to Congress a \n     report on the activities of the Board.\n       (i) Salaries and Administrative Expenses.--For necessary \n     expenses to administer the Program, $2,500,000 is \n     appropriated to the Department of Commerce, to remain\n\n[[Page S3106]]\n\n     available until expended, which may be transferred to the \n     Office of the Assistant Secretary for Trade Development of \n     the International Trade Administration.\n       (j) Termination of Guarantee Authority.--The authority of \n     the Board to make commitments to guarantee any loan under \n     this section shall terminate on December 31, 2001.\n       (k) Regulatory Action.--Not later than 60 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Board shall issue such \n     final procedures, rules, and regulations as are necessary to \n     carry out this section.\n       (l) Emergency Designation.--The entire amount made \n     available to carry out this section--\n       (1) is designated by Congress as an emergency requirement \n     pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. \n     901(b)(2)(A)); and\n       (2) shall be available only to the extent that the \n     President submits to Congress a budget request that includes \n     designation of the entire amount of the request as an \n     emergency requirement.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, again, I say to the Senate that I \nappreciate the consideration of all concerned for having not objected \nin areas where they might have objected. The bulk of these amendments \nare amendments we will consider at length with the House. I hope we \nwill be able to convince the House of their merit. We will also \nconsider some of the objections that may be raised from Members of the \nSenate individually, from the administration, or from the Congressional \nBudget Office. We will do our best to have a bill that warrants the \napproval of the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Will the manager yield for an inquiry?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that, other than the Kosovo \namendment, there are no other amendments in order; is that true?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is not quite true. We still have many amendments on \nthe list. We are led to believe that no other amendments will be raised \nfrom that list based on the negotiations we have had so far, with one \nexception, and I have it in my hand. It is the majority leader's \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 142\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Lott, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 142.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       ``that the presiding officer of the Senate should apply all \n     precedents of the Senate under Rule 16, in effect at the \n     conclusion of the 103rd Congress.''\n\n  Mr. LOTT. This amendment is a very simple one. In March 1995, the \nbeginning of the 104th Congress, the Senate overturned a ruling of the \nChair with respect to legislation on an appropriations bill. Ever since \nthat March day, Senators have not been able to raise a point of order \nagainst certain amendments offered to appropriations bills. Any \namendment dealing with matters not addressed in the specific \nappropriations bill would no longer be subject to a point of order and \ntherefore are always in order, regardless of the subject matter.\n  In this Senator's opinion, once that prohibition was lifted, the \nappropriations process was weakened by Senators on both sides of the \naisle offering nonrelated amendments to very vital and time-sensitive \nappropriations bills. Having said that, I, along with the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, the ranking minority member and the \nDemocratic leader have been attempting to resolve this and other issues \nwe believe weaken the appropriations process. There are several \nresolutions pending in the Rules Committee that address some of these \nissues. However, final committee disposition has not been reached with \nrespect to those resolutions.\n  Therefore, I think it is time for the Senate to take this first step \ntoward strengthening the appropriations process and reinstating what \nhad been a part of the Senate Rules for well over 100 years. The time \nis now and I hope all Senators will be able to support this initial but \nimportant step to a more responsible legislative process.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I might say to the Senate that I made the \nstatement that the managers would object to any amendments that were \nnot agreed to on both sides. We made an exception in that case for the \nleaders' amendments. We have taken the amendments from the \ndistinguished minority leader. This is the last one of the majority \nleader. I understand there will be objection on the other side. \nTherefore, I will ask that it be set aside temporarily awaiting the \nmajority leader's return, so he can decide what he wants to do with his \namendment. He asked me to offer it.\n  I also state for the Record that although I did agree to make a \nmotion to table on any amendments that were not agreed to on both \nsides, I made an exception in that situation for my colleague from \nAlaska, which I had cosponsored. That has been taken care of. My friend \nfrom Nevada made a motion to table that. We will let the Senate decide \nthat issue. Other than that, as I understand it, we are in the \nsituation that the last remaining matter is the amendment of the \nSenator from Texas.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment of the majority leader be \ntemporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I give notice to the Senate that \nfollowing the vote on the tabling motion offered by the Senator from \nNevada, I shall ask unanimous consent to vitiate the remainder of the \namendments on the list, and the only remaining amendments will be \nSenator Lott's amendment and the amendment of the Senator from Texas, \nthe Kosovo amendment, which has to be disposed of one way or another \nfor us to finish this evening. So at this time, does any Member have an \namendment they wish to offer?\n  Mr. President, if not, let me take a couple minutes for myself on the \nKosovo question. I am glad the Senator from Virginia has given me this. \nI was one of those that was invited to the White House this morning. As \nI approached the problem of listening again to the question of what we \nshould do in Kosovo, I listened to a President that I think has made up \nhis mind to initiate the air war.\n  I am a very pragmatic Senator. My feeling was that if that was going \nto go forward, the people who were going to carry out that order \ndeserve the support of this Congress. But I also had the feeling that \nwe should assure ourselves that none of the funds that we have made \navailable to the Department of Defense in the past, or through this \nbill we are considering now, could be used for initiating a ground war \nin this area. I so stated to the President that while I had severe \nreservations about the air war, he is the Commander in Chief, and if he \nhas made the decision that it is going to take place, we have no way to \nstop that. But we do have a way to signal to the men and women of the \nArmed Forces that we do understand they are subject to the commands of \ntheir Commander in Chief, and when they undertake fulfilling those \ncommands by going outside the United States in particular to carry out \nthe policies of this country, I think they deserve to know that the \nCongress supports them.\n\n  I therefore came back thinking we would have a joint resolution that \nthe President would be asked to sign setting forth those two conditions \nwhich were ably set forth by Senator Byrd. Senator Byrd spoke ahead of \nme at that meeting, and he, strangely enough, made the statement that I \nhad determined I was going to make at the meeting. The situation was \nthat I returned thinking we would have a joint resolution.\n  We now will have before us a Senate concurrent resolution, which is a \nform that we all know does not require the signature of the President. \nI understand that is being done for reasons beyond our control. But we \nno longer have the resolution Senator Byrd originally discussed, and it \nis my understanding from talking to Senator Byrd that he has consented \nto consolidating that into a direct statement of one sentence. I expect \nthat to be offered soon.\n  The second version I had intended to propose and Senator Byrd did \npropose\n\n[[Page S3107]]\n\nwas about the introduction of the Armed Forces of the United States \ninto this area that I understand was to be deleted.\n  I am now informed by Senators Biden and Warner that there is an \nagreement that that section will be put back into this concurrent \nresolution, which will once again contain the prohibition against funds \nto introduce ground forces of the United States into this area in a \nnonpermissive environment, meaning in terms of combat or in terms of \nimminent combat. They could go into a nonpermissive environment to \ncarry out the procedure we thought we might be involved in, in terms of \nintroducing 4,000 troops along with NATO in a peacekeeping effort. \nSection 2 of this resolution does not address that from the point of \nview of the intent of this Senator.\n  But I do want to make it clear that I believe this is probably the \nmost dangerous area of the world for our Armed Forces to be involved. I \nknow really of no place in the world I would fear more, as a pilot \nflying over those mountains with the ground-to-air defenses that I know \nexist there, as much as this area of the former Yugoslavia. It is, \nbeyond question, the most complicated area for military activity, far \nbeyond Bosnia and far beyond what we might have contemplated in World \nWar II in Europe in terms of where we operated with American Armed \nForces.\n  This area consumed several Nazi divisions--21. Is that correct, Mr. \nPresident? It consumed them, destroyed them, in terms of the action of \nthe partisans in that area.\n  If this bombing does not bring about a cessation of the genocide we \nbelieve is going to take place or is taking place, then it is going to \nbe a very, very difficult problem to decide what to do. And I think the \nCongress has to be involved before that plan is agreed to by the U.S. \nrepresentatives and NATO.\n  Above all, I hope the message will go out to the people who represent \nthis country in connection to NATO, they are not to make agreements \nabout injection of Armed Forces of this country in a ground war before \napproval of the Congress. That, to me, would be unconscionable. And I \nam delighted my friends have agreed to put this section 2 in.\n  Mr. President, I just want to close with this. There is no other \nword. I used it with the President. I have a ``gut feeling,'' a ``deep \ngut feeling,'' that we have initiated something which will be very hard \nto control from now on. This will require the consideration and really \nthe absolute concentration of every American to try to get out of this \nplace without severe loss of life.\n\n  I urge the Members of Congress to understand that the President has \nmade this decision. And it is not ``if.'' It is ``when.'' And when it \nhappens, we have to be united behind our Armed Forces. That is all \nthere is to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to thank our colleague from Alaska.\n  There is an important provision we have incorporated in the draft \nresolution which Senator Biden and I have circulated among our \ncolleagues. I think it is important, since it is not at the desk, that \nI just read it so that it can be reviewed by Senators.\n  Section 1 remains as I read it.\n  Section 2, which is a derivative of, again, work by the Senator from \nAlaska and, indeed, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia--the \noriginal concept of this was in drafts prepared by Senator Byrd earlier \ntoday. And I shall read it.\n\n       None of the funds available to the Department of Defense \n     (including funds appropriated for fiscal year 1999 or prior \n     years) may be used for the introduction of ground forces of \n     the Armed Forces of the United States into the Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) in a non-\n     permissive environment, with the exception of (1) any \n     intelligence or intelligence-related activities or \n     surveillance or the provision of logistical support or (2) \n     any measures necessary to defend the Armed Forces of the \n     United States or NATO allies against an immediate threat or \n     to defend United States citizens in the area described in \n     this resolution.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield right there?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I believe Senator Byrd is correct that \nthere should be a reporting requirement added to this. But I leave that \nfor us to determine at a later time.\n  I thank the Senators involved, and, with the reinsertion of section \n2, I ask that I be made a cosponsor of the resolution.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a brief comment? \nBecause I know the Senator from West Virginia wishes to speak on this.\n  I want to be clear. I think the recommendation and the suggestion of \nthe Senator from Alaska, which is consistent with what the Senator from \nWest Virginia and he both said today to the President, is a good idea. \nI personally am prepared to accept that.\n  I just add one caveat. I need another 3 or 4 minutes to run the \ntraps. I want to make it clear, I accept this. I accept this \npersonally. I think it makes sense. But I have calls in to several of \nour colleagues as to whether or not, since they were part of this on \nour side, they will go with this. I am confident. I believe they will. \nBut I just want to be absolutely clear, and I think we should proceed. \nBut I see the Senator from West Virginia who wishes to speak. I think \nit is a great and significant commitment that he has made with regard \nto the nonpermissive piece of this. I think it makes sense.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I withhold my request to cosponsor until \nI know the section 2 is in the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia holds the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Senator how long he \nthinks it might be before we may be voting?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator has inquired of me, and I am \npleased to say by previous order we shall vote at 6:45 on a motion to \ntable the Murkowski amendment. Following that, we hope to get back to \nthe two other amendments. One is the amendment of the Senator from \nTexas on Kosovo, and the other one is the distinguished majority \nleader's amendment. I think we will dispose of them rather quickly and \nvote on the bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak as if in morning business until the time of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/23/senate-section/article/S3107-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. KERRY.

Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes today \nabout a very special young man who has been working in my office as an \nintern over the last months and someone who has shared endless \nenthusiasm with me personally and with my staff, and who has taught a \ngreat many of us in my office in the extended Kerry political family a \nvery important lesson about the ability of individuals to overcome \nlearning disabilities and about the power of the human spirit.\n  Brendan O'Donnell has a terrific story to tell. He comes from a \nwonderful and loving family that has always encouraged him to set his \ngoals high, to pursue his aspirations to the very best of his ability, \nand to refuse to allow any label or characterization of his potential \nto stop him. He is a young man who literally does not give up. \nBrendan's character, his determination, his terrific attitude and \npositive energy that drive his efforts are really something to behold, \nMr. President. They are, in so many ways, the lasting imprint of his \nfather, my friend and the friend of many of us on this side of the \naisle, the late Kirk O'Donnell, and of his mother, Kathy Holland \nO'Donnell.\n\n  Kirk O'Donnell, many people may recall, was taken from us far too \nyoung, last year. I think all of us would agree that he left a lasting \nlegacy, an imprint on all of our lives. Brendan, of course, will also \ntell you that one of the people who encourages him and\n\n[[Page S3108]]\n\ngives him such a huge amount of confidence is his sister, Holly \nO'Donnell.\n  We have been very lucky to have Brendan on our team these past \nmonths, and I look forward to continuing for a long time to get to know \nthis young man even better.\n  Brendan has written a speech for me about a subject that he believes \nis very important, and I agree with him it is. He thinks it is \nimportant that here in the Senate, and all across the country, in our \nhomes, in our schools, that we start talking about the efforts we can \nmake together, in partnership with one another, to help those with \nlearning disabilities make the most of their own lives.\n  Brendan's remarkable achievements are testimony enough to what \nindividuals with learning disabilities can achieve. His words on this \nsubject, though, are really something special. I would like to share \nwith you what Brendan wrote. He said:\n\n       This is an important topic for kids today, kids like me. We \n     should try to talk about learning disabilities and really get \n     the point across--we can all be teachers about this subject. \n     And we should all try to make a difference.\n       I think that there should be a different name for learning \n     disabilities. My Mom and I have thought a lot about this, and \n     to me it's not a disability--it's just that I have something \n     which causes a storm in my mind. When I look at something--I \n     have to take my time and take it all in. People need to be \n     understanding and make things clear to me. To do that, \n     though, people need to know more about learning disabilities, \n     whether they're kids or adults.\n       People need to know that they should not look down at us. \n     They should try extra hard to be nice to us and not make fun \n     of us. We are the same as everyone else--and if someone takes \n     the time to teach us, to work with us to help us understand, \n     we can do whatever we want.\n       Right now I don't think we do enough to help kids with \n     learning disabilities. You don't see enough people with \n     learning disabilities in the best jobs--even though they are \n     bright enough, even though they are talented enough. This \n     needs to change.\n       It can happen, I think, if we have really good schools. I \n     went to a high school called RiverView School. When you had a \n     problem, when you needed special attention, they were willing \n     to help.\n       Our school did not believe in the kind of tests you put on \n     paper--they thought it was best for us to push and test \n     ourselves, That's what I do every day. I test myself.\n       That's why I love to play sports. At our school anyone \n     could play a sport. We had a cross country team, and a \n     basketball team and swimming team and tennis team. And I \n     learned a lot about swimming and trying my best when I played \n     basketball and football.\n       And now I want to push myself again. I want to go to \n     cooking school, and learn to be a chef so that some day I can \n     have a restaurant of my own in Massachusetts, in Scituate. \n     It'll be hard to do--but I'll do it.\n       I think there needs to be a program where kids with \n     learning disabilities can learn how to do jobs in the real \n     world, like cooking programs and art programs--progams so \n     more kids can be like me. We can all try our best--and we can \n     all do our best--if we help each other and if we care about \n     each other. That's something I think we also need to take \n     about in this country.\n\n  Those are Brendan's words, but I think he speaks for a lot of \nAmericans, Americans who don't let anyone put limits on their \npotential, Americans who have dreams and do not give up. I agree with \nBrendan--each of us, in our own personal way, should do all we can to \nhelp those Americans who get up every day and do their best to overcome \nlearning disabilities. And I thank Brendan for making that case better \nthan any scientific study ever could.\n  I have been lucky to know Brendan O'Donnell, to be inspired by his \nstrong will, his good nature, and his work ethic. I am proud of the \nwork he has done in my office. I want to offer him my warmest wishes as \nhe leaves us to pursue his ambitions. I am looking forward to the day \nwhen I can go to a restaurant in Scituate and know that Brendan \nO'Donnell is at once the owner and the chef, cooking up lobster and \noyster for everyone. And I know that day will come because Brendan \nO'Donnell never gives up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask consent for 30 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend my friend and colleague for \nsharing with all of the Senate the really enormously sensitive, \ninformed, and wonderful comments of Brendan. I, too, have known this \nyoung, extraordinary man, and know what a difference he has made in so \nmany different lives. He really ought to be commended.\n  Brendan shared with the Senate, with all of us, these very eloquent \nwords. I thank my friend and colleague, and join with him in commending \nBrendan and for all he has done, not only for my friend and colleague, \nbut for all of those who are facing challenges in the area of learning \ndisabilities.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Kennedy. I \nparticularly want to point out Brendan has just enjoyed his first floor \nprivileges and has been able to listen to his own words on the floor of \nthe Senate. I think that is a great accomplishment and great thrill for \nhim.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/23/senate-section/article/S3108-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3108-S3109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 130\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment that is the regular \norder is my amendment on Kosovo. A lot has happened since I offered \nthis amendment early last week, because my amendment actually asks the \nPresident to come forward and tell us what he was going to do in \nKosovo. This assumed a peace agreement. It assumes that we would have a \nplan put in place before we would take action in Kosovo.\n  Unfortunately, time has bypassed this amendment. Unfortunately, the \nPresident made up his mind, I think, before he ever talked to Members \nof Congress that we would bomb Kosovo. I think we are taking a very \nimportant step and one that I hope everyone will take seriously.\n  Bombing a sovereign country that has not threatened the United States \nof America is a very serious step. I think we also need to look at the \nNATO mission. We are changing the mission of NATO without debate, \nwithout a vote of Congress. We are turning NATO from a defense alliance \nto an alliance that has now decided it is going to take an offensive \naction against a country that is not in NATO. This is unprecedented.\n\n  So I do think the President needs to come to Congress with a plan. If \nwe are going to take step 1, we need to know what step 2, 3, and 4 are. \nWe need to know what could happen and what circumstances would cause us \nto have more commitments in the Balkans.\n  Mr. President, I think it is premature for us to be doing what we \napparently are going to be doing. But I think my amendment has been \nbypassed by time. So I am going to withdraw my amendment and let the \nsupplemental appropriations bill go forward on the promise from our \nleadership that we will take up a bill on Kosovo that will have teeth, \nthat will have an up-or-down vote, as Congress is required to do when \nwe have this kind of action by our military forces.\n  So, Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment. I look forward to the \ndebate. I look forward to Congress exercising its responsibility under \nthe Constitution that if there is going to be a war declared, that it \nwill be Congress that will declare it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 81) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 142 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent to withdraw \namendment No. 142 that I submitted on behalf of the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. That \namendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 142) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, third reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this is a very straightforward concurrent \nresolution, but I think it bears reading again.\n  It says,\n\n       Authorizing the President of the United States to conduct \n     military air operations and missile strikes against the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the President of the United States is \n     authorized to conduct military air operations and missile \n     strikes in cooperation with our NATO allies against the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).\n\n  It is straightforward and simple. It is a clear up-or-down vote on \nwhether or not we support the action that is contemplated by the \nPresident, that NATO, through its action order--so-called action \norder--has authorized Solana to call for at his discretion and \nconcurrence with the leaders of the 19 NATO countries.\n\n  I think we have debated this a lot. There are very strong views on \nthis. I happen to think this is an authority that Congress should be \ngiving the President, but at a minimum I think most of us agree that \nthe President needs to hear from the Congress as to what our position \nis.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. May I ask the Senator a question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am happy to respond to a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  Could my colleague, for the purposes of the legislative record, spell \nout the objective? The President is authorized to ``conduct military \noperations.'' Could my colleague spell out what his understanding is?\n  Mr. BIDEN. My understanding of the objective stated by the President \nis that his objective is to end the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and the \npersecution of the Albanian minority population in Kosovo and to \nmaintain security and stability in the Balkans as a consequence of \nslowing up, stopping, or curtailing the ability of Milosevic and the \nSerbian VJ and the MUP to be able to go in and cause circumstances \nwhich provide for the likelihood of a half-million refugees to \ndestabilize the region.\n  The objective at the end of the day: Hopefully, this will bring \nMilosevic back to the table. Hopefully, he will agree to what all of \nNATO said they wanted him to agree to, and hopefully that will occur. \nIn the event that it does not occur, the objective will be to degrade \nhis military capability so significantly that he will not be able to \nimpose his will upon Kosovo, as he is doing now.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his response \nand would like to make it clear that I believe my support would be \nbased upon these kinds of objectives.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator.\n  Does the opposition wish more time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I stand in opposition to the Senate \nconcurrent resolution and yield 2 minutes to Senator Brownback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate our colleague \nfrom Idaho recognizing me to speak briefly on this amendment.\n  I rise in opposition to this amendment to this resolution. I think \nthis is an ill-advised, ill-timed, inappropriate action to take, given \nthe situation that we have, given the potential and the actual probable \nloss of U.S. lives, the lack of involving the entire United States in \nthis and saying to the American people: Why are we doing this? We don't \nknow where it is going on step 2, step 3, and step 4.\n  This is step 1. We go in and we bomb a sovereign nation involved in a \ncivil war. What if he doesn't fall back? What if Milosevic doesn't say: \nOK, I give up, and you can have autonomy in Kosovo? What if we go ahead \ninto Montenegro and say we want to split off. Will the United States \nbomb and support Montenegro in that process?\n  This is a very, very serious step we are taking of such foreign \npolicy, and we have not had sufficient debate about what the U.S. \nposition is. This is not in our strategic and vital interest of what is \ntaking place. Yet we are going to go forward and start a bombing \ncampaign. We need to have a thorough, extensive debate here, involving \nthe American people, as to whether or not this is in our vital and \nstrategic interests. I submit that has not taken place to date. The \nadministration has not brought the Congress along, and this is an \ninappropriate, ill-timed event and action for us to take and is not \nbeing supported by the American people.\n\n  For those reasons, I will be opposing this resolution.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I believe that the way we have arrived here \nis less than ideal. However, the choices we have are also not ideal. \nThe choice of doing nothing is absolutely unacceptable.\n  While I will have more to say about the process by which we got here, \nthere are powerful strategic, humanitarian, and historical reasons that \nthe United States, in a broad-based, NATO-based effort, ought to be \ndoing what it is engaged in.\n  I think it is important for all of our colleagues to reflect on the \nfact, this is not the United States acting unilaterally; this is all of \nthe allies, all together, all of them coming together, with a \npreponderance ultimately of European involvement if there ever is a \npeace process to enforce.\n  I want to emphasize one thing with respect to the goals and \nobjectives. I view these as very limited in their current structure. I \nview it as essentially an effort to try to minimize Milosevic's \ncapacity militarily to ethnically cleanse. It is hoped that you might \nalso secure the peace. It is hoped that you might also be able to move \nto a more broad-based enforcement process. But I don't view that as the \nessential objective. The essential objective is to minimize his \ncapacity to work his will without any contravening forces that would \nequalize the battlefield, if you will, and minimize the capacity for \nethnic cleansing. That is the overpowering strategic and, I think also, \nhumanitarian interest here, and I think it is important for the Senate \nto stay focused on the limitations.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are in this situation because sometime \nlast year the administration authorized our representatives of NATO to \nenter into an agreement that would allow NATO forces to conduct strike \noperations against the Serbs if they did not sign an agreement that was \nsought--the ``peace agreement'' so-called. That did not occur. \nSuddenly, we find that now here we are with one sentence, one sentence \napproving the concept of sending in airstrikes against that nation. We \ndo not have a prohibition against the use of ground forces, and I told \nthe President this morning I would support this resolution if it did.\n  But beyond that, I am constrained to say that I remember standing \nhere on the floor in 1991 when Iraq invaded Kuwait, when racial \ncleansing was not\n\n[[Page S3111]]\n\nonly taking place, they were murdering people in public. They had taken \nover a nation and they were obviously going to go into Saudi Arabia. We \nwere in the minority and we sought to support our President, and we got \nvery little support. I put in the Record already the letter that \nPresident Bush sent. He said if the Congress did not agree, he would \nnot dispatch forces. Today, I looked in the eye of a President that had \nalready made up his mind on the air war. I seriously regret that we \nhave not put a parameter around this war so it will prevent the use of \nour forces on the ground. I believe we are coming close to starting \nWorld War III. At least I know we are starting a process that is almost \ngoing to be never-ending, unless it never starts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cosponsor this resolution because, year \nafter year, we have asked Europe to take the lead before we are leading \nin their own back yard, to become united, to take care of troubles \nbefore they spread. They have done so. They are now waiting for us. It \nhas been asked, will our European allies stay with us? That is not the \nquestion. The question is whether we will now join our European allies \nwho are waiting for us to sound a clear call that we will not permit \nethnic cleansing to spread to destabilize a region and to destabilize \nEurope.\n  The stakes here are huge. The objective here, we should be very \nclear, is to reduce the military capability of Milosevic to \n``ethnically cleanse'' Kosovo and thereby touch off a broader war and \nmassive instability in Europe. That is our military objective--to \nreduce that military capability to ethnically cleanse Kosovo.\n  If we had acted earlier in Bosnia, we could have avoided that \ngenocide. We did not act. NATO has now decided to act, and it is the \nfuture stability of Europe which we are going to help determine here \ntonight, as well as the support for our troops. It was asked of the \nPresident, ``Request our support, Mr. President.'' We heard that at the \nWhite House over and over again. The President has now requested our \nsupport. Our military leaders have set forth a clear military \nobjective. They have done so before the Armed Services Committee. They \nhave done so before other committees and each of us. So now it is up to \nus to decide whether or not we will support our troops, and whether we \nwill support NATO. The risks of not acting are greater than the risks \nof acting.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is important for the United States to \nparticipate in NATO air and missile strikes. NATO is ready to act \nbecause of the threat that the conflict in Kosovo could spread to the \nneighboring countries of Macedonia, Albania, and Bosnia and could \ninvolve nations such as Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary, \nand to prevent a humanitarian disaster.\n  I believe the military mission for our forces should be clearly and \ncarefully stated as to reduce the military capability of the Serbian \nspecial police and Yugoslav Army to ethnically cleanse Kosovo and touch \noff a broader war and major instability in Europe.\n  It is tempting and would be easy to justify NATO action against the \nSerbian police and Yugoslav Army forces as a way to punish Milosevic. \nHe has destroyed the economy of former Yugoslavia; shut down its \nindependent media; ousted all democracy-learning professors from its \nuniversities and substituted his cronies; has threatened President \nDjukanovic of the Yugoslav Republic of Montenegro, who favors democracy \nand a free market economy; has seized privately-owned property, \nincluding property owned by an American citizen; and has violated every \nagreement he has ever made, including, in particular, the Dayton Peace \nAccords and the October 12, 1998 agreement with Richard Holbrooke.\n  But it is the threat to regional peace and security that justifies \nNATO air strikes.\n  The United States is the leader of NATO and the credibility of NATO \nis on the line; the future stability of Europe is on the line; and the \nethnic cleansing of the population of Kosovo is on the line. With all \nof these important interests on the line, I believe the United States \nmust do its part, in cooperation with our NATO allies, to carry out air \noperations and missile strikes to reduce the military capability of the \nSerbian special police and Yugoslav Army to ethnically cleanse Kosovo \nand touch off a broader war and create major instability in Europe.\n  I have been a strong supporter of the development of the European \nSecurity and Defense Identity within NATO and I want to take particular \nnote of the role that our NATO allies have been and are playing with \nrespect to Kosovo. First of all, the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe or OSCE--a European dominated Organization of 55 \nnations--stepped up to the plate and established the Kosovo \nVerification Mission or KVM. The KVM has as its mission the monitoring \nof compliance with the October 1998 agreement negotiated between \nAmbassador Holbrooke and President Milosevic.\n  Because the OSCEs KVM is unarmed, NATO established an Extraction \nForce, which, as the name implies, is designed to come to the aid of \nKVM personnel and to remove them from situations in which their safety \nmight be imperiled. The Extraction Force is led by a French general and \nis made up entirely of forces provided by our NATO allies. The United \nStates has provided 2 military personnel to serve in the Extraction \nForce headquarters, but no combat forces. Once again, our NATO allies \ndelivered.\n  When NATO was planning for a ground force to implement an interim \npeace agreement in Kosovo with the consent of the parties, it was \ndecided that approximately 28,000 troops would be needed. Our NATO \nallies agreed to provide more than 24,000 troops. The United States \nwould contribute less than 4,000 troops to that force. The on-scene \ncommander for the force would have been a British general. The force \ncontribution of our NATO allies would dominate the force. Once again, \nour NATO allies delivered. And the foreign ministers of Great Britian \nand France co-chaired the negotiations that provided the opportunity \nfor a peaceful settlement of this crisis.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to describe my visit to Kosovo in \nNovember. In the course of that visit, I accompanied a U.S. Kosovo \nDiplomatic Observer Mission team on its daily tour that stopped in the \nvillage of Malisevo. Malisevo was a ghost town. The Kosovar Albanians \nwho had previously lived there were afraid to return because of the \ndamage that had been caused by the Serbian special police and Yugoslav \nArmy and the continuing presence of Serbian police forces in the \nvillage. In order to conceal the extent of the destruction they had \nwrought, the Serbian forces had bulldozed a large square block of the \nvillage and carted off the debris. The bullet and shell holes in the \nremaining structures bore silent witness to the cruel way in which \nPresident Slobodan Milosevic's forces punished the civilian population \nin response to the resistance of the Kosovo Liberation Army or KLA.\n\n  Kosovo is the scene of a horrendous humanitarian disaster. The United \nNations High Commissioner for Refugees estimated last week that at \nleast 230,000 persons were displaced within Kosovo as a result of the \nconflict and a further 170,000 have fled from Kosovo in the past year. \nThat adds up to a total of about 400,000 people who had fled their \nhomes. That number increases on a daily basis as Milosevic's forces \ncontinue their rampage.\n  During my visit to Kosovo, I met with the political representative of \nthe KLA, Adem Demaci, with the elected President of the Kosovo shadow \ngovernment, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, and with the editor of the Albanian \nlanguage newspaper Koha Ditore, Veton Surroi.\n  My meeting with Adem Demaci, the then political representative of the \nKLA, who was first arrested in 1958 and, by his own admission has been \nfighting for Kosovo independence, ever since, had spent 28 years in \nYugoslav jails for his campaign for independence for Kosovo, involved a \nfriendly and occasionally heated discussion. He stated that he could \nnot endorse any agreement that did not have a guarantee that the ethnic \nAlbanians could decide their own future after three years. Mr. Demaci \nresigned his position in protest when Kosovar Albanian negotiators' \nagreed in principle to the agreement at Rambouillet.\n\n[[Page S3112]]\n\n  Dr. Rugova, who has consistently espoused a policy of peaceful \nresistance, stated his preference for the agreement to provide a \nmechanism for the people to express their will at the end of three \nyears but was flexible on that point since he was committed to reaching \nan agreement that would stablize the situation. Dr. Rugova and a number \nof his lieutenants participated as part of the ethnic Albanian \nnegotiating team that went to Rambouillet.\n  Veton Surroi, who has courageously published an independent newspaper \nin Pristina, the capitol of Kosovo, expressed his concern about \nachieving an agreement in view of the difficulty he anticipated in \nreconciling the positions of the KLA and the Rugova camp. He was not \noptimistic. He also participated in the Rambouillet negotiations as a \nmember of the ethnic Albanian team.\n  Mr. President, despite the Kosovar Albanians strong desire for \nindependence, a goal which is supported by the international community \nand is not provided for by the Interim Peace Agreement, they signed \nthat Agreement. The Yugoslav delegation, by contrast, has stonewalled \nand, as characterized by Mr. Verdine and Mr. Cook as co-chairmen of the \nnegotiations, ``has tried to unravel the Rambouillet Accords.'' And \nSlobodan Milosevic, when given a final chance to avoid NATO air and \nmissile attacks, stubbornly continued his ethnic cleaning of Kosovo.\n  I will support the resolution, of which I am an original cosponsor, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it as well.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMontana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we have heard the debate on this floor. Now \nwhat is at hand? How many questions have we asked ourselves? Are we \ncrossing international boundaries to inflict heavy damage or to destroy \nthe ability to make war in a sovereign nation? Are we not making war? \nAre we not using a treaty organization to participate in a civil war? \nIs there a possibility that we are being used to deal with a very acute \nand serious problem in the stability of a region?\n  No one should question the motive of any vote on this issue. Every \nMember of this body is capable of casting the hard vote. One cannot \nclear his or her conscience of the atrocities that have been committed, \nand one can see the desperation on the faces of those who are being \ndisplaced. But I say to you, the nations that are most affected must \nnow assume the responsibility that confronts them. To ask us to \nparticipate in a civil war, which is not our character, is a lot to \nask. Can we help? Yes, we can. We can do it in different ways. But to \nask us to place our men and women in harm's way, to force submission of \na people with deep resolve in an area where not very many folks have \never been beaten into submission, that is asking of us a great deal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Delaware. Mr. President, on \nChristmas Eve, 1992, President George Bush issued what is known as his \n``Christmas warning'' to President Milosevic that if he attacked \nKosovo, NATO would have to respond. We had President Clinton reinforce \nthat threat as recently as last October. Milosevic signed a cease-fire \nagreement in which we again said to him, if you attack Kosovo, we will \nhave to respond with force. What has happened? He is attacking Kosovo. \nThe International Finnish Pathological Team said a massacre occurred \nthere in January. Kosovar women and children were put on their knees \nand shot in the back of their heads.\n  Mr. President, if NATO does not act, and if the United States does \nnot act to be consistent not just with the threats we have made to him, \nthe warnings he has ignored, but the principles that underlie those \nwarnings, it will be more than the Kosovars who will suffer irreparable \ndamage at the hands of the Serbians; NATO will be irreparably damaged \nand so, too, will the credibility of the United States.\n  Mr. President, some of my colleagues say, ``What's the plan?'' There \nis a plan here and we have heard it. There is a response and we have \noptions as we go along. But I ask, what will happen if we don't act? If \nwe don't act, a massacre will occur. There is great danger of a wider \nwar in Kosovo, wider even than the one that would have occurred if we \nleft the conflict in Bosnia unattended. With all due respect to my \nfriend and dear colleague from Alaska who suggested we may be beginning \nworld war III--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator for 30 seconds more.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I don't have it. I am sorry.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will finish by saying I think what we are doing in \nauthorizing this action is making sure that world war III does not \nbegin in the Balkans.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I rise in \nopposition to the resolution. I have all the confidence in the world in \nthe capability of our military. But I think this is an ill-advised \nmission. I heard my good friend from Delaware, and I also heard the \nSenator from Massachusetts use the word ``hopefully.'' In fact, that \nword was used repeatedly. ``Hopefully,'' the airstrikes will work. \n``Hopefully,'' the airstrikes will bring Milosevic to the bargaining \ntable. ``Hopefully,'' there will be a peace agreement.\n  The question I ask is, What if our best hopes are not realized? What \nif it doesn't work? What happens then? I raised that question to \nSecretary of Defense Cohen. I don't believe the answers were sufficient \nor satisfactory. There were far more questions than answers. The \nPresident has not made the case to the American people or to the \nCongress. We all know the great limits there are on airstrikes, the \ncapability of airstrikes in changing behavior. There will be limits on \nthese airstrikes and how successful they can be. Our hearts go out to \nthose who are suffering, and they should. But I remind my colleagues \nthat there are massacres taking place in many places in this world, \nincluding Sudan, where the level of carnage is far greater than what we \nhave seen in Kosovo.\n  I asked the Secretary this afternoon what will be the cost in \nfinancial terms? To my dismay, there is no estimate of what kind of \ndollars or costs, budgetary costs there will be. But the far greater \ncost will be in potential American casualties. We all know that the \nprobability is high that there will be the loss of American lives. So \nthis afternoon I did a lot of soul searching. I thought about my 20-\nyear-old son, Joshua.\n  If it were him going in, could I in my mind justify sending him in, \nand the tens of thousands of Joshes who are 20 years old?\n  I believe stability in the Balkans is not a satisfactory answer.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I support the resolution. I believe the \ndanger of inaction--of doing nothing--greatly exceeds the dangers of \naction. What are the dangers of inaction? There are three, in my \njudgment.\n  First, disintegration of instability in a key part of Europe.\n  Second, the acceleration of existing humanitarian catastrophes, which \nwe have all seen.\n  Third, the unloosening of bombs that tie us to NATO, bombs that \ncannot easily be renewed in the days ahead when the need for NATO \ncooperation will be ever greater than it now is.\n  So, for these three reasons, the dangers of inaction, I hope the \nresolution will be supported.\n  I thank the leader.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, first of all, let me declare that this is not a vote \nto support or not to support the troops. This is an authorization to \nthe President to use military force against Serbia.\n  If this were an appropriations bill to support a mission already \nunderway, a mission which the President had ordered American troops to \nengage in, there is no question that I assume all of us would have to \nsupport that and\n\n[[Page S3113]]\n\nwould not vote against an appropriation of funds--at least I would not \nvote against an appropriation of funds--to support the troops. That is \nnot what is involved here. This is an authorization for the President.\n  Second, this is a vote to tell the President two things, I believe: \nNo. 1, before you send American troops in harm's way, you need to have \na dialog with the Congress and with the American people to explain two \nthings.\n  No. 1, you need to explain why there is a direct threat to the \nnational security of the United States. And there isn't in this case. \nAnd, No. 2, you need to explain how your plan is going to achieve the \ngoals.\n  There are two goals there: to repeal an attack by Serbia against \nKosovo and to force the Serbs to enter into a peace agreement.\n  The particular kind of military campaign planned here cannot achieve \neither goal, in my opinion. The quasi-police forces going into Kosovo \nare not easily stopped or impeded in their progress by cruise missiles. \nAnd, second, I suggest that the kind of plan here of a 48-hour, or \nsimilar hour, campaign with cruise missiles against Milosevic is not \ngoing to force him to his knees to invite peacekeepers into Kosovo. My \nguess is that he will, in fact, rebel against it rather than succumb to \nit.\n  For both of those reasons, I will vote ``no'' on the resolution.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. How much time \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Minnesota, and then 2 \nminutes to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, I have for months been closely monitoring the \nsituation in Kosovo, hoping and praying for a peaceful resolution to \nthe crisis. I traveled there about 5 years ago, and have seen for \nmyself the conditions under which millions of ethnic Albanians have \nstruggled under increasing Serb repression. I have seen and visited \nwith U.S. military personnel posted along the Macedonian border--\nincluding some very young men from my home State--and I am well aware \nof the stakes involved in this debate.\n\n  I and some of my colleagues have been briefed by Secretary Cohen, \nNational Security Advisor Berger, Secretary Albright, Joint Chiefs of \nStaff Chairman Shelton and others recently about the very fluid and \nviolent situation there.\n  Now that the Albanian Kosovars have signed the Rambouillet agreement, \nand the Serbs have forcefully rejected it, it is clear that the crisis \nhas moved into a new phase. And now that the Serbs have in the last few \ndays begun--slowly, brutally, methodically--to expand their grip on \nKosovo with a massive force of an estimated over 40,000 Serb police and \narmy regulars, the situation becomes more urgent with every passing \nhour. Those Serb forces have been burning homes, taking the lives of \ninnocent civilians along with KLA insurgents, and forcing tens of \nthousands of innocent civilians to flee their homes without food and \nshelter. Just in the last few days, tens of thousands more civilians \nhave been forced from their homes, with Serbian forces leaving their \nvillages smoldering and in ruins behind them in what appears to be \ntheir brutal final offensive. While reports have been barred from many \nareas by Serb forces, it is clear what is going on there. Atrocities of \nvarious kinds have become the signature of Serb military forces in \nKosovo, just as it was for years in parts of Bosnia.\n  In recent days, including in his press conference last Friday, the \nPresident has begun to articulate more clearly to Americans what he \nbelieves to be at stake there. The humanitarian disaster that's been \nunfolding of months, and has now been accelerated by the recent Serb \nonslaught, coupled with the serious concern that increased violence in \nKosovo could spread throughout the region, must be addressed \nforcefully. While I know some of my colleagues believe strongly that \nthe administration has not articulated forcefully, consistently and \nclearly the mission and goals of this use of force, and I still have \nsome unanswered questions about the administration's military plans--\nincluding the precise timing and strategy for withdrawing U.S. and NATO \nforces from the region once their mission is accomplished, provisions \nmade to protect United States forces against sophisticated Serb air \ndefense systems, and likely casualties expected from any military \naction--I believe there is little alternative for us but to intervene \nwith airstrikes as part of a NATO force.\n\n  I come to this conclusion, as I think many Americans have in recent \ndays, reluctantly, and recognizing that all of the possible courses of \naction open to the United States in Kosovo present very serious risks.\n  But I am pleased that we are finally having a real debate on this \nquestion on the Senate floor. As Senators, I believe we should make it \nclear on the record what we believe our policy should be in Kosovo.\n  I have agonized over this decision, and consulted widely with those \nin Minnesota whom I represent, with regional political and military \nexperts, and with others, and have tried to place in historical \nperspective what is at stake here for our Nation. I have tried, as I \nknow my colleagues have, to weigh carefully the costs of military \naction in Kosovo against the dangers of inaction.\n  Mr. President, one thing that is clear is that the situation on the \nground in Kosovo today is unacceptable and likely to worsen \nconsiderably in the coming weeks. The ongoing exodus as refugees flee \nthis latest major military operation mounted by the Yugoslav Army over \nthe last 3 weeks must be contained.\n  This conflict has created, by some estimates, more than 400,000 \nrefugees. A spokesman for the United Nations High Commission for \nRefugees estimated that 20,000 have been displaced just in the last \nweek by military operations, most of them in the mountain range just \nnorthwest of Pristina. As we all know, Milosevic has already carried \nout numerous massacres and other atrocities in Kosovo, including the \nkilling of more than 40 ethnic Albanian civilians in the village of \nRacak in January.\n  Right now, there are tens of thousands of refugees on the move in \nKosovo. These refugees are facing very basic problems of survival. They \nlack shelter. They need blankets and stoves. The fighting has knocked \nout the electricity and water supplies. There are people right now \nhuddling in cellars, and in unfinished houses, with their families. \nAccording to an account in the New York Times, people who are refugees \nthemselves are giving shelter to refugees. One family is giving shelter \nto 80 people.\n  Serbian forces that have been massed on the border of Kosovo are on \nthe march, and it is widely believed that they are planning to \naccelerate their advance west into the heartland of the rebel \nresistance and the base of its command headquarters. The people of \nKosovo are terrified of such a massive offensive. It is almost certain \nthat we will soon be hearing more stories of massacres and \ndisplacements, of women and children and elderly men being summarily \nexecuted, and of further atrocities.\n  I have called for months for tougher action by NATO to avert the \nhumanitarian catastrophe that has now been re-ignited by  the latest \nSerb attacks. I find it hard to stand by and let Milosevic continue \nwith his relentless campaign of destruction. But I also recognize the \ngrave consequences which may follow if the U.S. leads a military \nintervention into this complicated situation.\n\n  The airstrikes proposed by NATO, if Milosevic does not relent and \nsign on to the peace agreement, will represent a very serious \ncommitment. If NATO carries out these airstrikes, U.S. pilots will \nconfront a well-trained and motivated air defense force that is capable \nof shooting down NATO aircraft. Serbian air defense troops are \nknowledgeable about U.S. tactics from their experience in Bosnia, are \nprotected by mountainous terrain and difficult weather conditions, and \nare well-prepared and equipped to endure a sustained bombardment.\n  Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael Ryan told the Senate Armed \nServices Committee last week that casualties are a ``distinct \npossibility,'' and Marine\n\n[[Page S3114]]\n\nCommandant Gen. Charles Krulak said. ``It is going to be tremendously \ndangerous.''\n  We not only risk losing our own pilots, but, even if our attacks are \ncarefully circumscribed, we run the risk of killing innocent Serb \ncivilians.\n  Before we decide to send our pilots into harm's way we must be \ncertain that we have exhausted all diplomatic options and that we \nessentially have no other choice.\n  As I have grappled with this decision, I have tried to reduce it to \nits simplest form: Will action now save more lives and prevent more \nsuffering than no action.\n  Despite the dangers, I have concluded that the NATO airstrikes which \nmay soon be underway will save more lives in the long run than they \nwill cost. I hope and pray that we do not suffer any American \ncasualties in these air operations, and that innocent civilian \ncasualties on both sides are kept to a minimum, but I fear that if we \ndo not act now thousands will lose their lives in the coming months and \nyears.\n  A decision to use force is also justified by reasons that go beyond \nhumanitarian concerns. It has been argued by the Administration that an \nintense and sustained conflict in Kosovo could sent tens of thousands \nof refugees across borders and, potentially, draw Albania, Macedonia, \nGreece, and Turkey into the war. We will not be able to contain such a \nwider Balkan war without far greater risk and cost. And we could well \nface a greater humanitarian catastrophe than we face now. I am not just \ntalking about a geopolitical abstraction, the stability of the region. \nI am talking about the human cost of a wider Balkan conflict.\n  So as I see it, the immediate goal of NATO airstrikes would be to \ndegrade Serbian military forces so that they could not seriously \nthreaten the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and also to force Milosevic \ninto signing a peace agreement that could end the fighting in Kosovo \nand bring stability to the region.\n  I am not a Senator who supports military action lightly. I still hope \nthis conflict can be settled without an actual military engagement. But \nI feel that we simply must act now to forestall a larger humanitarian \ncrisis.\n  Mr. President, in the end my support for airstrikes in this situation \narises from my deep conviction that we cannot let these kinds of \natrocities and humanitarian disasters continue if we have ti in our \npower to stop them. I believe that it is our duty to act. In this case \nwe cannot shirk our responsibility to act. We cannot stand idly by. \nThat's why I intend to support the President's decision.\n  Mr. President, I have agonized over this vote. But I very honestly \nand truthfully believe that if we do not take this action as a part of \nthe NATO force that we will see a massacre of innocent people--men, \nwomen, and children. I do not believe that we or the international \ncommunity can turn our gaze away from that.\n  Therefore, I rise tonight with concern, but, nevertheless, I want to \nsay it as honestly and as truthfully as I can as a Senator from \nMinnesota. I do support this resolution. I hope and pray that our \nforces will be safe. I hope and pray that there will be minimum loss of \ncivilian life. And I hope and pray that by our actions we can prevent \nwhat I think otherwise will be an absolute catastrophe.\n  I yield the floor. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would suggest we alternate back and \nforth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from South \nCarolina, Mr. Thurmond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \npending resolution.\n  NATO was formed to defend Europe against Soviet aggression, not to \nsettle domestic problems. The NATO treaty was ratified with the advice \nand consent of the Senate. NATO's mission has clearly changed without \ncongressional consultation. Whether for good or bad reasons, NATO \ncombat power is being used to intimidate a sovereign country--Serbia--\ninto signing a peace agreement on domestic problems.\n  What NATO has done in Bosnia should not be used as reasoning for U.S. \naction in Kosovo. President Clinton wrongly claims that NATO succeeded \nin Bosnia because of its air strikes and economic sanctions against \nYugoslavia. In fact, it was the successful Croat ground offensive \nagainst Bosnian Serbs just before the 1995 Dayton agreement that forced \nSerbia's compliance with the peace agreement. Likewise, to resolve the \nproblem NATO faces today, ground force will probably be required in \nKosovo.\n  Today, the most important issue to the U.S. is our credibility in \nNATO. For NATO, it was credibility that pushed the majority of NATO \nmembers down the dangerous path toward military intervention. At home \nand abroad the President's problem is credibility. Likewise, it may be \nAmerica's problem abroad. NATO has issued a clear ultimatum to a \nvicious aggressor. If Congress does not back U.S. efforts in NATO, will \nthe credibility problem reflect on the United States? It may. However, \nthese issues and questions come to us from the Administration's faulty \npolicies. Such policies have resulted from timid piecemeal reasoning \nand lack tough-minded decision-making worthy of the problem at hand.\n  Bad national defense policy is about to get us into serious trouble--\nagain. The list of the administration's failed peace missions is long \nand growing. I am unconvinced that trying to resuscitate these failed \nnation-states is in the U.S. vital interest. The costs of U.S. \ninvolvement in nation-building are not in our national interests and \nshould be reduced. The price tag of the Bosnia mission, for example, \nhas already hit $12 billion, with no end in sight. The question is \nsimple: Is it in the United States' best interest to have our troops in \nimminent danger, preoccupied with defending themselves against people \nwhom they have come to help, who have shown little inclination for \nreform at a great cost to America? This is the path down which the \nadministration has taken the United States. We are now involved in a \nsteady run of civil wars without clear solutions which involve failed \nnation-states. We will soon drown in this kind of foolishness. Stemming \ncivil wars should not be the main strategic challenge for the United \nStates. These kinds of misadventures do not really engage the strategic \ninterest of the United States. Certainly, such ill-conceived adventures \ndo arrogantly endanger our troops. I cannot support endangering our \ntroops without good reason.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, our worst fears have been realized. Months \nof patient negotiations, bolstered by repeated threats of air strikes, \nhave failed. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has defied the will \nand the prayers of the world and has turned his back on the prospect of \npeace in Kosovo. Indeed, he is intensifying his relentless assault on \nthe ethnic Albanian population of the Serbian province of Kosovo. It \nwas made clear to me and to many of us at the White House this morning \nthat the question is no longer ``whether'' NATO will launch air strikes \nagainst Yugoslavia but ``when''. It is entirely possible that by the \ntime these words are uttered, the machinery to launch an air offensive \nagainst Yugoslavia will have been put into motion.\n  This is a matter of immense importance and far-reaching consequence \nfor the United States. Senior defense officials have warned that an air \noperation against Yugoslavia will be extremely dangerous for U.S. and \nallied forces. This is not Iraq. This is a rugged, mountainous region \nfrequently shrouded in fog and protected by a sophisticated air defense \nsystem. If the United States sends aircraft into Yugoslav air space as \npart of a NATO strike force, we must understand--and accept--the risk \nof that operation. That risk includes the possibility of downed \naircraft, American hostages, and American casualties.\n  An operation of this magnitude and risk should not be undertaken \nwithout the express support of Congress and the backing of the American \npeople. We saw in Vietnam what happens when the will of the people is \nnot taken into consideration.\n  Only the President can lead the way in this crisis. Only the \nPresident can rally the American people. Only the President can \nmobilize the troops. Only\n\n[[Page S3115]]\n\nthe President can unite our NATO allies. Only the President can explain \nto the American people the reasoning for his intended action and the \nrisks attendant to it. I urged him last week to make his case to the \npeople as well as to the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I again urged the President at the White House this \nmorning to seek the support of the Congress for air strikes against \nYugoslavia. I asked him to make that request in writing to the Majority \nand Minority Leaders of the Senate. I am pleased that he has done so. I \ncommend him for recognizing the need to seek the support of Congress \nwhen the use of force is contemplated.\n  We do not know where this conflict will lead. The winds of war are \nblowing over Kosovo today. Who knows what fires those winds might fan. \nBosnia. Montenegro. Macedonia. Albania. All are in danger of being \ndrawn into a conflagration in the Balkans. With enough sparks, Greece \nand Turkey could be drawn into the inferno. Although the conflict in \nKosovo is far from our doorstep today, it could spread quickly, as \nwildfires are wont to do. Today our credibility as a world leader is \nthreatened. If the conflict in Kosovo spreads, much more than our \ncredibility will be at stake. If we are to act at all, the time to act \nis now.\n  All we know for certain is that Slobodan Milosevic is a ruthless and \ndesperate leader. If anything, his defiance of NATO and his repression \nof the Kosovo Albanians are increasing as his options dwindle. Violence \nis mounting in Kosovo, and thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees have \nalready fled their homes and villages. The bloodshed has begun. Let us \npray to God that it will not turn into a bloodbath.\n  The United States cannot stand idly by and watch the catastrophe \nunfolding in the Balkans. It is in our national interest to support \nstability in this volatile region, to prevent the downward spiral into \nviolence and chaos, and to stem the humanitarian disaster spreading out \nof Kosovo like a contagion. Having raised the stakes so high, a failure \nto act decisively could have untold consequences.\n  The President may have the primary responsibility in the formulation \nand execution of foreign policy, but the Congress has an equally \nweighty responsibility, which is to authorize or refuse to authorize \nmilitary action.\n  The resolution that we are currently considering, which was drafted \nby a bipartisan group of Senators, endorses air strikes, and only air \nstrikes, against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The goal of this \nresolution is twofold: to stop the violence in Kosovo before it \nescalates into all-out carnage, and to convince President Milosevic in \nthe only terms he understands--brute force--to abandon his campaign of \nterror against the Kosovars.\n  Mr. President, my thoughts and prayers today are with the brave men \nand women of the United States military who are willing to put their \nlives on the line in order to save the lives of countless strangers in \na strange land. And my thoughts and prayers are with their families, \nthe parents, spouses, and children who will wait at home, fearing the \noutcome of every air strike, until this madman Milosevic can be brought \nto his senses. These are the people to whom we have a duty to show \ncourage in the execution of our responsibility. My prayers are also \nwith the President. His is a heavy burden of responsibility. The \ndecisions he makes in the coming days will affect the lives of many \nAmericans. He is embarked on a somber, sober, and serious undertaking, \nand I pray that he will find the strength and guidance to bear the \nburdens of office that will weigh heavily on his shoulders as he faces \nthis crisis.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for President Clinton's decision to use United States Armed \nForces, together with our NATO allies, to stop the killing in Kosovo \nand help bring peace and stability to a troubled region of Europe.\n  International intervention to stop the killing and atrocities in \nKosovo is long overdue. The United States, as the world's sole \nremaining superpower, must lead that international effort.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe NATO must follow through on threats \nof air strikes unless Milosevic immediately ends his assault on the \npeople of Kosovo and accepts the Contact Group's interim agreement. If \nwe do not, Milosevic will pursue his kind of peace in Kosovo--through \n``ethnic cleansing.''\n  Air strikes are a means to an end. I hope Belgrade will agree to sign \nthe Contact Group's interim peace agreement, as the Albanian side has \ndone, without further revisions.\n  President Clinton has decided and the Pentagon has planned to deploy \nabout four thousand U.S. troops to participate in a NATO-led \npeacekeeping force to help implement the interim agreement, once it has \nbeen signed by both sides. I support this plan because I stand behind \nits goals. United States armed forces should participate in a \npeacekeeping force in Kosovo.\n  I support the President's determination that this must be a NATO-led \nforce, with sufficient forces and appropriate rules of engagement to \nminimize the risk of casualties and maximize prospects for success.\n  U.S. participation is essential to the credibility of NATO's presence \nin Kosovo.\n  NATO's peacekeeping role is essential to the implementation of a \npeace agreement for Kosovo. And implementation of a peace agreement is \nessential to stop the killing--and end the atrocities in Kosovo--and \nallow people to return to their homes and rebuild their shattered \nlives.\n  But today we face a more immediate question: whether NATO should \nlaunch air strikes to stop the killing and end the atrocities in \nKosovo.\n  In my view we must end Milosevic's reign of terror.\n  Some in this body have argued that these atrocities are an internal \nmatter, that we should not get involved.\n  Others have said U.S. national security interests in Kosovo do not \nrise to a level that warrants military intervention.\n  I strongly disagree with those assertions.\n  Allow me, therefore, to remind my colleagues of the fundamental \nUnited States interests which are at stake here:\n  The first is U.S. credibility, going all the way back to the \nChristmas warning issued by President Bush and reaffirmed by President \nClinton.\n  If we fail to act, our threats in other parts of the world will not \nbe taken seriously, and we may find ourselves having to actually use \nforce more often.\n  The second is the credibility, cohesion, and future of NATO. As the \n50th anniversary Summit approaches, I believe we need to strengthen the \nEuro-Atlantic partnership.\n  Particularly when a crisis arises in Europe, we need to be able to \nact in concert with allies who generally share our interests and values \nand who have the capability to undertake fully integrated military \noperations alongside U.S. armed forces.\n  Third, we need to prevent this conflict from spreading. How can we \nexpect Albania to stay out of the conflict as their kin are being \nslaughtered? What is to prevent citizens of Macedonia from joining up \nwith different sides along ethnic lines? Would Bulgaria, and NATO \nallies Greece and Turkey, be drawn into a widening conflagration?\n  I don't claim to be able to fully predict what will happen if we do \nnot act, but it seems to me we're better off stopping the conflict now \nthan risking another world war sparked in the Balkans.\n  Finally, I would remind my colleagues that Milosevic and his police \nand military forces are killing people and driving them from their \nhomes on the basis of their ethnicity--they are committing genocide. We \nhave an obligation and a responsibility to act to stop genocide.\n  How can we stand by and allow these massacres to continue and claim \nto stand for what is right in this world?\n  The time has come to stop threatening and start making good on our \nthreats. There is too much at stake.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the crisis in Kosovo. \nPresident Clinton and our NATO allies are at the point of having no \nother option except to conduct air attacks against Yugoslav forces \noperating in and near the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. I regret we are \nat this point, but that doesn't change the facts. At this crucial \nmoment, Congress should not tie the President's hands or give Mr. \nMilosevic the slightest reason to believe the\n\n[[Page S3116]]\n\nUnited States will not join with its allies in airstrikes against the \nYugoslav units that are burning and shooting their way through Kosovo \nas I speak. For this reason I will vote for the resolution.\n  A requirement to use military force often follows a failure of \ndiplomacy. That is not the case in Kosovo; this Administration and our \nmajor European allies have worked hard to bring about a just and \npeaceful outcome in this Albanian-majority province which also has such \npowerful historic and emotional significance for Serbs. A just and \npeaceful outcome would have been possible, but for the unwillingness of \nthe Milosevic regime to govern Kosovo on any basis other than force and \nfear. Common sense and appeals to higher motives did no good, and now \nforce will meet overwhelming force in what can only be a tragic outcome \nfor many Yugoslav soldiers.\n  The President is out of options, and we must support him and the \naircrews who will carry out his orders. But I am under no illusions \nthat airstrikes will fix the Kosovo problem. The best I hope for is \nthat the airstrikes will bring Milosevic back to the table to accept a \nNATO-brokered agreement for a peaceful transition in Kosovo. Such an \noutcome would at least stop the killing and would accustom all in the \nregion to the idea of an autonomous Kosovo. Even if we succeed to this \nextent--and it is by no means certain we will--the underlying \ninstability in the region will persist.\n  The Kosovo problem is really the problem of a minority ethnic group, \nthe Albanians of Serbia, who have not been fully accommodated. The \nAlbanian minority in Macedonia has the same problem. Within Albania \nproper there is an ethnic Greek minority, and concern for that minority \nhas created tension in the past between Greece and Albania. My point is \nnot to induce despair about the complexities and complexes of this one \nsmall corner of the Balkans, but rather to encourage Congress and the \nAdministration to see the region as a unity and work simultaneously in \nall the affected countries to promote solutions. Just fixing Kosovo \nwon't do it, and I'm not confident we can do even that.\n  If airstrikes can begin a transition to a Kosovo settlement, the next \nstep will be the insertion of a ground force to keep the transition \npeaceful. The Administration has proposed this force include about \n4,000 American soldiers or Marines, and has promised to deploy this \nforce only in a ``permissive'' environment--meaning a Kosovo in which \nat least the leaders of the various factions agree to the presence of \nour troops. Mr. President, the resolution before us does not deal with \nthe question of ground troops. When that question does arise, I will \noppose any deployment of U.S. personnel on the ground in Kosovo. The \nstability of the entire planet depends on the readiness and \navailability of the U.S. Armed Forces. We should not fritter them away \nin peacekeeping missions in countries which do not rise to the level of \nvital American interests. We should keep them ready for the \ncontingencies that are truly in our league: Iraq and the Persian Gulf, \nthe Koreas, Russian nuclear forces. Europe contains wealthy countries \nwith the militaries that could take on local European missions like \nKosovo. It is their problem, and they should step up to it.\n  Mr. President, several other reasons are raised to justify U.S. \ndeployments to Kosovo. Some assert a ``domino effect'' from Kosovo will \nplunge Europe into war. After all, they say, World War I started in the \nBalkans. But the alliance systems, rival empires, and hair trigger \nmobilization plans of 1914 are nowhere apparent in today's Europe, so \nthere is no need to fear a return of World War I. We are then told the \ninstability could eventually cause war between Greece and Turkey. But \nGreece and Turkey could have fought over many things over the last \nforty years, most recently the Ocalan affair, and they did not. There \nare rational leaders in Athens and Ankara who know their own interests. \nKosovo will not set them off.\n  As I said, the Administration should be praised for working for years \non the thankless task of trying to bring peace to Kosovo. At this \npoint, airstrikes are the last option available. The people of Kosovo, \nas well the Serbian people and all the people of the region, deserve a \ndignified, secure peace. Diplomacy, supported by U.S. and other NATO \nairpower and, when appropriate, European ground troops, should aim to \nbring this peace about. The United States should concentrate on the \nbigger problems which truly threaten us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering the \ngravest decision we are ever called upon to make. Do we send our troops \ninto harm's way to defend America's values and interests? Do we use our \nmilitary to seek to end the brutal repression in a faraway country?\n  After careful thought and serious discussions with our Secretary of \nState, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Secretary of \nDefense, I will support U.S. participation in strategic NATO air \nstrikes against Serbian military targets. Our objective is to stop the \nkilling and to weaken Yugoslav President Milosevic's ability to further \nhurt the people of Kosovo. These objectives are crucial to achieving \ndurable peace and security in Europe.\n  There are two primary reasons that I support the limited use of \nforce. First of all, we must prevent further Serbian acts of genocide \nand ethnic cleansing. Serbian actions have resulted in terrible human \nsuffering. The Serbs abolished the Parliament and government of Kosovo \nin 1990. In response, the Kosovar Albanians maintained a policy of \nnonviolent resistance for seven years. During this time, Milosevic \nethnically cleansed Kosovo--driving over 400,000 people out of their \nhomes and destroying hundreds of villages. For those who wouldn't flee, \nMilosevic sought to starve them out--destroying farm land and \nblockading the shipment of food.\n  Reports from last night indicate that further humanitarian \ncatastrophes are imminent. Serbia is moving aggressively to overrun and \ndrive thousands more ethnic Albanians from their homes. The Serbs have \ndeployed 40,000 army and police units in Kosovo. Over the past weekend, \nover 10,000 Kosovars were forced to flee their homes fearing for their \nlives. And for good reason: a brutal Serbian attack on the village of \nRacak in January resulted in the death of 45 civilians.\n\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that we should consider military \naction only if further humanitarian atrocities occur. We cannot wait \nfor genocide to occur before we act.\n  Our second goal must be to stop this war from spreading and from \nthreatening stability and our national interests throughout central \nEurope. The ethnic tensions in Kosovo could spread to Albania, \nMacedonia and even to our NATO allies, Greece and Turkey. Serb actions \nthreaten the stability of the entire region.\n  I would not support the use of military force unless we had first \nexhausted all other options. There are three ways that America can best \nexert our leadership. First, through diplomacy. There is no question \nthat we have done everything possible to resolve the Kosovo crisis \npeacefully through diplomacy. Second, we can apply sanctions or \nrewards. We have applied sanctions to Serbia for many years with little \ntangible result. And third, we can use our military to fight for our \ninterests and our values. That is the decision we face today. After \nexhausting diplomatic and economic options, do we now use our military \nto force the Serbs to end their intransigence and repression?\n  The military action proposed by President Clinton meets three \nprinciples I consider before supporting military action.\n  First of all, whenever possible, military action should be \nmultilateral. In Kosovo, we will be acting as part of NATO--with the \nnineteen allies sharing the burden.\n  Second, the military actions should be strategic and proportional. We \nare authorizing air strikes against military targets--like bases, \nmilitary storage depots, and command and control centers--and against \nkey infrastructure--like roads and bridges that Serbs use to reinforce \nKosovo.\n  And third, military actions must be intended to achieve a specific \ngoal. In this case, we are seeking to prevent further atrocities and to \nweaken Milosevic's ability to hurt the people of Kosovo.\n  Mr. President, I am disturbed by the process that was initially \nestablished\n\n[[Page S3117]]\n\nfor this vote. The Senate should vote on whether or not to authorize \nthe use of force. Plain and simple. Instead, we are asked to cast a \ncloture vote on a second degree amendment to an appropriations bill. \nThat is not the way to conduct foreign policy in the Senate.\n  That is why I voted against cloture on this matter--and I will vote \nfor a bipartisan resolution to authorize U.S. participation in NATO air \nstrikes against Serbia.\n  Mr. President, I still hope that the Serbs will back down. But if \nthey don't, the Senate must show that we back our troops one hundred \npercent. Our airmen have excellent training and the best equipment in \nthe world. They will have the participation of our NATO allies. And \nthey will have the prayers and support of the American people--who \nrecognize their heroism.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute. Of the 3 minutes \nremaining, I yield myself 1 minute, and I ask my friend from Virginia \nto close on behalf of the proponents.\n  There are a number of Senators who wished to speak today--Senator \nSpecter, Senator Hagel, Senator Smith. There are a number of people who \nwanted to speak. In the interest of a limited time, we have been unable \nto do that. And I apologize for that.\n  But the reason why I think it is appropriate that the Senator from \nVirginia close the case for us is that no one has been more \ninstrumental in bringing about the ability to vote up or down on this \nproposal as well as the outline of the proposal.\n  I thank him for his leadership.\n  I yield the remainder of the time under the control of the Senator \nfrom Delaware to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague from Delaware. We have joined \ntogether many times in our two decades-plus here to work on what we \nfelt was absolutely essential in the best interests of the country. I \nrespect every colleague and their votes, whichever way it goes. There \nhas been, I think, a substantial debate--perhaps not as long as I \nhoped. But, nevertheless, we had the debate. And this is essential now. \nWe could not have done it had it not been for the Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Smith, the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, and the \nSenator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, and others who joined in to make \nthis possible--and my good friend from Michigan, Mr. Levin. We made it \nhappen.\n  But this started with this Senator last September when I made my \nsecond visit to Kosovo. Having come out of Bosnia and seeing that \nsituation at that time, I have tirelessly worked on this issue ever \nsince that period. And now I join my colleague from Delaware to make it \nhappen.\n  But, Mr. President, my main concern has always been the investment of \nthe American people through this Congress in Bosnia--8-plus years, $9-\nplus billion, which could be severely at risk if this area of the \nBalkans known as Kosovo and the environs thereto were to erupt and \nbegin to take down what little progress we have achieved in Bosnia, and \ndisplay before the world a magnitude of human suffering and ethnic \ncleansing and crimes of horrific nature.\n  So I know it has been a painful subject for many. But I honestly \nbelieve that by supporting this vote we are doing what is in the best \ninterests of mankind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the senior Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I spoke at length today, so I will try \nvery hard to not even use the 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, this President has decided that he doesn't need our \napproval. This vote tonight has nothing to do with whether we agree or \ndisagree, and we are sending that message to him, because he has \nalready told us he is going to do it. So it is a different request. It \nis a request saying, ``I am going to do this. Would you tonight concur \nthat it is OK?''\n\n  What a difference a President makes. George Bush didn't do that when \nthe United States had a far more serious problem dependent upon oil--\noil in jeopardy in the Middle East, Iraq invades a sovereign country. \nAnd what does he do? He sends us a letter and says, ``Would you concur, \nand if you do not I will not do it.'' Now that is the kind of true, \ndedicated President that gives credit to the elected representatives of \nthe American people.\n  We talk about this great Senate. Well, there is a great House, also. \nAnd they deserve the right to pass judgment on this. And for us to sit \naround here tonight saying we finally made the point, and we are going \nto get to decide whether he is or isn't, that is just a hoax. I do not \nbelieve we ought to meddle in civil wars that have been going on for \n800 years. We are not going to solve it unless we commit to have a \nmilitary force on the ground for perhaps 100 years, because we are \ngoing to get involved through NATO. In fact, I think we ought to begin \nto ask our NATO general, we ought to begin to wonder how in the world \ndoes he get in the middle of these negotiations and then he makes \ncommitments through NATO and we say we have to live up to what has been \ncommitted through NATO? I think we ought to be able to commit that, \ntoo. It is our law. It is not the other countries. They are putting in \nvery little.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as my good colleague from Virginia, I \nappreciate the conscientious nature of every vote that will be cast \ntonight. I was among those who visited with the President this morning \nand have struggled with this. I have concluded that I cannot vote for \nthis resolution. It is a declaration of war. There are going to be \ncasualties. This resolution will not bring about the adjusted behavior \nof Mr. Milosevic that is sought.\n  The lingering question throughout the day and throughout all the \ndeliberations is: What is next? That question has not been answered and \nit will surely come upon us as a result of this vote tonight. This is a \nvery grave decision we are making for which the prospects of a \nsolution, as proposed in this resolution, are nil.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be able to \nproceed for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent the letter from President Clinton \nto the leaders be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is already in the Record.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I understand it is, but I want to point out again where he \nsays, ``I ask for your legislative support as we address the crisis in \nKosovo.''\n  I point out I was here, too, during the gulf crisis. I recall we were \nnot even going to hold hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee. I \nrecall the President said he would not send up a request for authority \nuntil it was clear that the Congress was going to revolt. Every \nPresident, of the six while I have been here, has been reluctant to do \nso.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I had the letter read to us this \nafternoon. There is nothing in that letter that says he will not do it \nif we do not agree. That is the difference. It says: I ask, but I am \ngoing to do it anyway.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, neither did President Bush; he \ndidn't say I will not do it if you do not do this. Let's get that \nstraight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I reclaim my time and yield the remainder of it to the \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, how much time is \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, that is not very much \ntime, but this is a very serious matter. It is\n\n[[Page S3118]]\n\na vote that I wanted. I have been asking for it for a number of days \nand weeks. Now we are here, and the President has already made up his \nmind. He didn't really care particularly one way or the other how the \nCongress felt, which is pretty much the way the foreign policy has been \nconducted. Thousands of people, hundreds of thousands have died in \nRwanda. We are not firing missiles there. This is a mistake. This is a \ncivil war. We are attacking a sovereign nation without a declaration of \nwar and we are going to regret it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the concurrent resolution.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n    Unanimous Consent Agreement--First Concurrent Budget Resolution\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the first concurrent budget resolution at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday and \nthere be 35 hours remaining for debate as provided under the Budget \nAct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. In light of that agreement, the vote on the Kosovo \nresolution will be the last vote tonight. The Senate will start the \nbudget resolution tomorrow. Obviously, hard work will be in order for \nthe Senate to complete action on the budget resolution prior to the \nrecess, but we must do that. Hopefully we could get it completed by \nFriday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the concurrent \nresolution.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 21\n\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the President of the United States is \n     authorized to conduct military air operations and missile \n     strikes in cooperation with our NATO allies against the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).\n\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I referenced earlier the significant help \nand leadership of the Senator from Virginia, but what I did not mention \nwas the person who carried the ball on this side of the aisle, the \nSenator from Michigan, Senator Levin.\n  You know that old expression, success has a thousand fathers and \nmothers and failure is an orphan. Hopefully, I am not going to be \npraising him and others and it turns out that what we have done tonight \nis a mistake. I think it is not a mistake. I think it is necessary. I \nthink it is going to make for the possibility of some peace in the \nregion.\n  I want to tell the Senator from Michigan how much a pleasure it is to \nwork with him. I mean with him. As my grandfather used to say, he is \nthe horse that carried the sleigh. He is the guy who maneuvered us \nthrough all this to get to the resolution. I personally thank him and \ntell him how much I enjoyed working with him.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Delaware. His \nleadership is what carried this resolution to a bipartisan conclusion, \nalong with the Senator from Virginia. I pay particular, really, homage \nto both of them. This is a very difficult vote for all of us, whichever \nside of this resolution we voted on. It is very important it be a \nbipartisan vote. It is important to our troops, first and foremost. It \nis important we send a bipartisan message to Milosevic so there not be \nany misunderstanding or miscalculation. The leaders in the effort to do \nthat were the first two names on that resolution, and they are Senators \nBiden and Warner.\n  I commend them for their leadership.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, while I opposed the concurrent resolution \nwhich was adopted this evening, I think it is very important that it be \nsaid, once again, that this resolution does in no way authorize the \ncommitment of ground troops and that the President certainly--I think \nthis Senator believes as many others do--needs to seek the counsel of \nthe Congress if that day should become necessary, in at least the eyes \nof our Commander in Chief, that he consult fully with us on that issue.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I concur with the Senator from Idaho on \nthat score. I want to say just one more thing. This was a very \ndifficult vote, and I echo the words that were stated by several people \nhere. On these matters--and I give credit to Senator Nickles, who is \nthe No. 2 man on the Republican side--when we were negotiating, I asked \nhim how many votes are for this. He said, ``I did not whip this.'' In \nour jargon, we know that to mean: ``I did not go out and count votes. \nThis is not a partisan matter. This is something that should be left to \nthe conscience of each Senator.''\n  The fact of the matter is, when my colleagues came up to me before \nthe vote started and said, ``How many votes do you have?'' I said to \nthem, ``I did not do it.''\n  I did not know how many votes were here for this resolution, but I \nthought it was important that the Senate go on record exercising its \nresponsibility in this area. I do not think the President has the \nauthority to use force in this nature without our approval, a \nconcurrent resolution, or any statement by us, assuming the House makes \na similar statement, and meets the constitutional criteria that he has \nthe authority.\n  But again I want to make it clear that I respect those who voted \nagainst it. There are very strong reasons to vote no. I think the \nreasons to vote yes are stronger. And no one, particularly the Senator \nfrom Delaware, can tell this Senate where this action is going to lead. \nIt is a very tough call.\n  I am confident, in my view, that there is more of a danger in not \nacting than in acting, both constitutionally and practically. But I \njust want the record to reflect that everyone in this debate, including \nthe discussion at the White House--the Presiding Officer is younger \nthan the Senator from Delaware, as is the Senator from Louisiana, who \nis on the floor, is younger than the Senator from Delaware. I came here \nin 1973 as a Senator. I was 29 years old.\n  I remember one of the things that I resented the most keenly was that \nat the time, for those of us who opposed the Vietnam war, at least in \nsome quarters on this floor, and at times with the then-sitting \nPresident, we were told we were giving, by our opposition, this great \ndeal of help to the\n\n[[Page S3119]]\n\nNorth Vietnamese; we were hurting our troops who were overseas; we were \nbasically un-American for objecting to the war.\n  One of the generational changes that has taken place--I want the \nrecord to show this--sitting with a number of Senators and \nCongresspersons--I am guessing the number at 20--in the private \nresidence this morning, the President of the United States said to us \nassembled he wanted to make one thing clear, that he respected the \nCongress voting. He knew some who opposed were going to be told that \nMilosevic is listening and he is going to take some confidence from \nthis; he is going to somehow be emboldened by the opposition.\n  He said, ``I want you to know I think you have an absolute right and \nobligation, if you believe that way, to object. I will never be one who \nwill tell you that, notwithstanding he is watching this on CNN in \nBelgrade, that somehow you're undermining our effort. Were we to apply \nthat standard,'' he said, ``we would never be able to debate in this \nsociety the important issues.''\n  So the reason I mention that is not to give particular credit to the \nPresident, although in this case he deserves it, but he came from that \nsame generation. I think we have moved to a position here where we have \ndebated, in the last several years, the major contentious issues \nrelating to our peace and security, and that when the debate has been \nfinished, when it has gone on, it has been cordial and it has not been \npartisan.\n  When it has been finished, there has been unanimity and support of \nAmerican forces. The same occurred in the gulf. After the gulf, many of \nus voted no. I was one who voted no. And at the end of the day, we all \nsaid, once the Senate spoke, once the President spoke, once the \nCongress spoke, we would stay the course.\n  So I thank my friend from Idaho who was in opposition, my friend, the \nPresiding Officer, who had a different view on this to tell you. And I \nam not being solicitous. It is important for the American people to \nknow we do not always disagree based on our partisan instincts here.\n\n  The judgments made by every Senator on this floor today were made \nwith their intellect and their heart, on the direction that they \nthought was in the best interest of the country. I think the right \noutcome occurred, but I do not in any way--in any way--question the \nmotivation, or am I so certain of my own position that I would be \nwilling to guarantee either of my colleagues that they are wrong. I \nthink they were wrong. I think I am right. But we are approaching this \nin the way we should, openly and in a nonpartisan way. I want to thank \nthe Republican leadership for proceeding this way and thank my \ncolleagues for the way in which we conducted this debate earlier.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Delaware for \nthose remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/23/senate-section/article/S3119-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

In accepting the award, Senator Mitchell \ndemonstrated again why he has been so vital to the peace process. He \nspoke directly and movingly to the political leaders on both sides of \nNorthern Ireland, many of whom were in the White House audience. He \nreminded them of how far they had come in their search for peace. He \nurged them to resolve the current difficulties and enable the peace \nagreement to continue to be implemented.\n  As he said so eloquently, ``History might have forgiven failure to \nreach an agreement, since no one thought it possible. But once the \nagreement was reached, history will never forgive the failure to carry \nit forward.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/23/senate-section/article/S3119-4", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SIXTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF BOONVILLE, MO, LIONS CLUB\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

On March 15, 1989, the new \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs was established, headed by a Secretary \nof Veterans Affairs.\n  Over the past ten years, VA has worked hard to fulfill its \ncommitments to our nation's veterans by providing benefits and health \ncare to millions of Americans who have given so much to protect and \ndefend our country and its liberties. Among VA's many contributions: VA \nresearch scientists and practitioners have led in the advancement of \nmedical research and health care delivery; VA benefits such as home \nloans, life insurance and educational support have been immensely \nhelpful in transitioning active duty military members back into \ncivilian life; and VA disability payments aid veterans injured in the \nline of duty as partial compensation by a grateful nation for their \nmany sacrifices.\n  As Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I will help ensure \nthat VA sustains these many programs to meet the myriad needs of an \naging veteran population. I am certain my colleagues share that \ncommitment as well.\n  The mission of the VA, as enunciated by President Abraham Lincoln, is \n``To care for him who shall have borne the\n\n[[Page S3120]]\n\nbattle, and for his widow, and his orphan.'' Congratulations to the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, and may it continue to serve our nation \nwell for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/23/senate-section/article/S3120-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATIONS TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL ALLEN ESTES, P.E.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

A bill to establish certain safeguards for the protection of \npurchasers in the sale of motor vehicles that are salvage or have been \ndamaged, to require certain safeguards concerning the handling of \nsalvage and nonrebuildable vehicles, to support the flow of important \nvehicle information to the National Motor Vehicle Title Information \nSystem, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n\n\n     salvaged and damaged motor vehicle information disclosure act\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation on behalf of myself and Senators Levin and Bryan that will \noffer consumers protection against unknowingly purchasing a vehicle \nthat has been rebuilt after sustaining substantial damage in an \naccident.\n\n  The sale of rebuilt vehicles that have been wrecked in accidents has \nbecome a major national problem. According to the National Association \nof Independent Insurers, about 2.5 million vehicles are involved in \naccidents so severe that they are declared a total loss. Yet, more than \na million of these vehicles are rebuilt and put back on the road.\n  In a report to the state Legislature, the California Department of \nConsumer Affairs found, with respect to California alone ``More than \n700,000 structurally damaged and 150,000 salvaged vehicles are returned \nto streets and highways every year without a safety inspection, and \nthey pose a potential hazard to all of California's twenty million \nunsuspecting motorists.''\n  In many cases, ``totaled'' cars are sold at auction, refurbished to \nconceal prior damage, then resold to consumers without disclosure of \nthe previous condition of the car. The structural integrity of these \nvehicles has been so severely weakened that the potential for serious \ninjury in an accident is greatly increased.\n  In one case, a teenage who purchased a rebuilt wreck was rendered \nquadriplegic after an accident in which her vehicle rolled 360 degrees \nat about five miles an hour. The vehicle had been in a previous \naccident. It had been badly repaired and then resold without disclosure \nof its previous condition. The vehicle's roof was replaced after the \nfirst accident, but in the subsequent accident, the roof collapsed when \nthe substandard welds failed.\n  In another incident, a mother purchased a Honda Prelude for her \ndaughter's high school graduation. Although only hail damage was \nreported at the time of sale, the car had actually been totaled in \nTexas and rebuilt in Arkansas. The repair shop acknowledged that they \nhad spent only about $3,000 on repairs, despite an insurance company's \nestimate of over $10,000 worth of damage. The inadequate repair \nresulted in the collapse of the right front suspension inflicting a \ndebilitating head injury on the driver.\n  In yet another case of fraud, Jimmy Dolan bought a used Toyota from a \ndealership in Clovis, California. The odometer had only 19,000 miles on \nit and he was told the car was like new and in original condition. In \nfact, that was untrue. The previous owner had been involved in a \nserious accident that required $8,700 in repairs. After a series of \nproblems with the car, the original owner took it back to the \ndealership and traded it in. The dealership then resold the car to \nJimmy Dolan for almost $14,000.\n  After only a minor accident, Mr. Dolan found out the truth about his \ncar. He managed to trace the car back to the original owner who \ndescribed the extent of the damage. Despite having full knowledge of \nthe vehicle's history, the dealership refused to give Dolan a refund. \nEventually, he had to file a civil lawsuit to recoup his losses.\n  These are just three cases in which serious physical and financial \nlosses were inflicted on innocent victims who unknowingly purchased a \nvehicles that had sustained major damage.\n  The bill that I am introducing will address the problem of rebuilt \nwrecks by: providing nationwide written disclosure for every vehicle \nsale of previous salvage and major damage; providing widespread \ncoverage for all vehicles including vehicles of any age or value, motor \nhomes, pickups, and motorcycles; allowing states to maintain existing \nsalvage laws; strengthening the Federal rebuilt vehicle database to \npromote instant access to vehicle accident histories for consumers, \ndealers, and law enforcement; requiring certification by a qualified \nrepair facility of the proper repair of any salvage vehicle before it \nis returned to the road.\n  This bill has been endorsed by the Attorneys General of California, \nConnecticut, Iowa, and Michigan. In a letter of support, Attorneys \nGeneral Blumenthal, Lockyer, and Miller state that this bill ``has \nstrong disclosure requirements that will put consumers on notice before \nthey agree to buy a car concerning any prior collision or flood \ndamage.''\n  They also state ``We especially appreciate that this bill tracks the \nResolution adopted in 1994 by the National Association of Attorneys \nGeneral. That Resolution calls for the strong national standards and \nremedies that are provided for in this bill.''\n  Mr. President, I submit this letter for the record.\n  This bill also has the support of a number of consumer advocates \nincluding: Center for Auto Safety, Consumer\n\n[[Page S3124]]\n\nFederation of America, Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, \nConsumers Union, National Association of Consumer Advocates, Public \nInterest, and U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n  In a letter of support from the National Association of Consumer \nAdvocates, Pat Sturdevant writes ``This bill is entirely consistent \nwith views of the major national consumer groups in that it would \nrequire disclosure of major damage to vehicles. Provide broad coverage \nof most used vehicles, prevent laundering or washing of titles to \nconceal prior damage, provide for effective criminal and civil \nenforcement, and provide a minimum standard of consumer protection \nwhile allowing states to offer stronger protection to their citizens.''\n  I submit this letter for the Record.\n  The bill is also strongly supported by the Automotive Recyclers \nAssociation and the Auto Dismantlers Association.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that the sale of rebuilt vehicles \nis a major national problem. We need to insure that we provide the \nproper solution. I believe that this bill is that solution and I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  I want to thank the Senators from Michigan and Nevada for their \nassistance with this legislation. Their input and support has been \ninvaluable to the development of this bill. I ask that letters in \nsupport of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n                                   Office of The Attorney General,\n\n\n                                         State of Connecticut,\n\n                                                   March 18, 1999.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.\n     Re: The Salvaged and Damaged Motor vehicle Information \n         Disclosure Act\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: We are writing in order to express \n     our support for the Salvaged and Damaged Motor Vehicle \n     Information Disclosure Act, a bill which we understand you \n     and Senators Levin and Bryan intend to offer.\n       We are very aware of the harm caused to consumers who \n     unwittingly purchase used cars that had sustained major \n     damage. They not only pay far more than the vehicle's market \n     value, they may be placing themselves and their families in \n     danger.\n       Despite state efforts to vigorously enforce state laws \n     requiring car sellers to make salvage and damage disclosures, \n     the problem continues to be our nation's top consumer \n     compliant regarding used car sales. It is right for Congress \n     to act. However, in acting, Congress must protect consumers, \n     while permitting the states flexibility to deal with this \n     growing problem.\n        Your draft bill achieves those two major goals. It has \n     strong disclosure requirements that will put consumers on \n     notice before they agree to buy a car concerning any prior \n     collision or flood damage. It uses definitions that provide \n     strong baselines of protection, while permitting individual \n     states to impose tougher standards, if that is their choice. \n     It effectively deals with the problem of ``title-washing'' by \n     ensuring that information about prior collision or flood \n     damage remains on vehicle titles, regardless of the state of \n     titling. Finally, it provides strong remedies, by subjecting \n     violations to criminal penalties, civil law enforcement \n     actions by state attorneys general, and substantial private \n     civil remedies.\n       We especially appreciate that this bill tracks the \n     Resolution adopted in 1994 by the National Association of \n     Attorneys General. That Resolution calls for the strong \n     national standards and remedies that are provided for in this \n     bill.\n       Another reason we support this bill is that it follows the \n     successful mode of the federal odometer law, originally \n     enacted in the 1970's. That law provided for the same types \n     of strong national standards and remedies found in your bill. \n     States have relied on the federal odometer law to file many \n     civil and criminal law enforcement actions against odometer \n     spinners and have recovered millions of dollars in \n     restitution for consumers. Strong federal and state \n     enforcement, plus the private actions brought under the \n     odometer law, have put a real dent in odometer fraud. We look \n     forward to similar results as we join forces to tackle auto \n     salvage fraud.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this issue. We look \n     forward to working with you in the fight to protect used car \n     buyers.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Richard Blumenthal,\n                                  Attorney General of Connecticut.\n     Bill Lockyer,\n                                   Attorney General of California.\n     Tom Miller,\n     Attorney General of Iowa.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                           Consumer Advocates,\n\n                                                   March 19, 1999.\n       Dear Senators Feinstein, Levin and Bryan: We are a consumer \n     protection organization very concerned about the safety \n     hazard posed by the resale of rebuilt wrecked cars. We \n     strongly support the national salvage and damaged motor \n     vehicle disclosure bill which you intend to offer because it \n     will protect consumers against the unsuspecting purchase of a \n     rebuilt wrecked car. This would require disclosure of major \n     damage to vehicles, provide broad coverage of most used \n     vehicles, prevent laundering or washing of titles to conceal \n     prior damage, provide for effective criminal and civil \n     enforcement, and establish a federal minimum standard of \n     consumer protection while allowing states to offer stronger \n     protection to their citizens. The bill is consistent with the \n     recommendations embodied in the 1994 Resolution of the \n     National Association of Attorneys General and adopted by the \n     Attorneys General of all 50 states, so we anticipate that it \n     will receive broad support from law enforcement.\n       We remain strongly opposed to competing legislation, which \n     the Washington Post termed ``controversial'' and featured as \n     a example of ``special interest'' legislation. That bill was \n     opposed by the Attorneys General of 39 states, encountered \n     major opposition in the House, and was removed from the \n     Omnibus Appropriations package after objection by the White \n     House. The current measure remains flawed, failing to cover \n     more than half the used cars on the road, and eliminating \n     many of the state law protections that consumers now have \n     against unscrupulous sellers of rebuilt wrecks. Its \n     definitions of ``flood'' and ``nonrepairable'' vehicles are \n     extremely loose, and its standard of proof and weak and \n     inadequate enforcement mechanism would do nothing to deter \n     the fraudulent sale of dangerous rebuilt wrecks.\n       It can hardly be disputed that automobile salvage fraud is \n     a serious problem which requires federal action. Each year, \n     more than one million ``totalled'' cars are rebuilt and sold \n     to unsuspecting consumers. These consumers need protection \n     from salvage fraud. I am looking forward to continuing to \n     work closely with leading state Attorneys General on this \n     important public safety issue, and would welcome the \n     opportunity to wok with you and your staffs in obtaining the \n     genuine reform which your pro-consumer bill will provide.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                      Patricia Sturdevant.\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nalong with my colleagues, Senators Feinstein and Bryan, that will \nprotect consumers from the unscrupulous practice known as ``title \nwashing'' the current practice of selling rebuilt wrecks to \nunsuspecting buyers. The objective of this legislation is to make it \nmore difficult for unscrupulous auto sellers to conceal the fact that a \nvehicle has been in an accident by transferring the vehicle's title in \na state with lower standards than where the vehicle is ultimately sold.\n  In developing this bill, Senators Feinstein and Bryan and I worked \nclosely with national consumer protection groups and a number of state \nAttorneys General. We have crafted a bill that is truly consumer \nprotective and sets high national standards that did not previously \nexist. We took great care to ensure that our bill would not preempt the \nrights of states to retain or enact laws that exceed the minimum \nfederal standards in this bill.\n  National automobile salvage title legislation is needed because there \nis no uniform standard for when a vehicle must be declared salvage or \nnonrepairable. About 2.5 million cars are severely damaged in auto \naccidents each year. More than half of them are returned to the road. \nMany of these rebuilt cars are sold to unsuspecting consumers without \ndisclosure of the car's prior history, increasing the chance of serious \ninjury to the drivers and passengers of these rebuilt cars. The \nNational Association of Attorneys General estimates that the sale of \nrebuilt or salvaged motor vehicles as undamaged, costs the motor \nvehicle industry and consumers up to $4 billion annually.\n  Currently, some states, like Michigan and California and others, have \ntough consumer protection laws dictating when a vehicle's title must be \nbranded as salvage or nonrepairable, but other states do not. \nUnfortunately, unscrupulous people now take advantage of this lack of \nuniformity and take wrecked vehicles to states with low or no standards \nto retitle them and thus wipe out the vehicle's prior damage history.\n  Our bill would provide for uniform standards of nationwide seller \ndisclosure for every vehicle sale of previous salvage and major damage \nvehicles, and ensure these title brands are carried forward with all \ntitles each time\n\n[[Page S3125]]\n\nthe vehicle is sold. This proposal is consistent with the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General auto salvage resolution adopted in \n1994.\n  This bill also has the support of Michigan's Attorney General, who \nwrote in a letter endorsing the bill,\n\n       This bill will further empower consumers to have more \n     information available in making an informed decision about \n     what is generally their second most costly purchase, motor \n     vehicles used for personal transportation. I urge Congress to \n     enact this bill.\n\n  The salvage title requirements in our bill are modeled after the \nsuccessful 25 year old federal odometer law which requires the milage \nof a vehicle to be disclosed before a vehicle can be transferred. This \nlaw requires each seller to fill out a statement on the odometer \nreading that verifies its accuracy and a vehicle buyer cannot get a \nstate title without this disclosure on the title. Our bill would work \nin a similar manner.\n  Our bill is basically a disclosure bill. It requires that whenever a \nvehicle's title is transferred, the seller must disclose in writing to \nthe buyer any accident history of the vehicle which includes: salvage, \nflood, nonrepairable or major damage. Our bill defines ``salvage'', \n``flood'', ``nonrepairable'' and ``major damage'' to provide broad \ndisclosure and to protect consumer safety. These definitions are \nconsistent with recommendations from the state Attorneys General.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, the sale of rebuilt wrecks to \nunsuspecting buyers is a serous problem and should be stopped as soon \nas possible. The Feinstein, Levin, Bryan bill will do just that by \nestablishing uniform disclosure standards for all vehicle sales and \nrequiring all states to carry forward this disclosure on the vehicle's \ntitle. Simply put, our bill will put an end to title-washing.\n  I ask that additional materials be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\nResolution Adopted by National Association of Attorneys General, March \n                              20-22, 1994\n\n\n   mandatory disclosure of salvage history and major damage to motor \n                                vehicles\n\n       Whereas, motor vehicles which are severely damaged or \n     declared a ``total'' loss are often subsequently rebuilt or \n     salvaged and then resold; and\n       Whereas, the fact that a vehicle is rebuilt or salvaged is \n     material to any subsequent sale of the vehicle; and\n       Whereas, not all states require that a vehicle's salvage \n     history be marked on the vehicle's title or that such a title \n     brand be carried forward on new titles issued or that a \n     vehicle's salvage history be disclosed to subsequent \n     purchasers; and\n       Whereas, branding the title is an effective means of \n     allowing dealers, subsequent purchasers and law enforcement \n     authorities to track a vehicle's true history and has been \n     supported by NAAG for tracking vehicles returned under state \n     lemon laws; and\n       Whereas, it is estimated that the sale of rebuilt or \n     salvaged motor vehicles as undamaged, costs the motor vehicle \n     industry and consumers up to $4 billion annually;\n       Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the National Association of Attorneys \n     General:\n       1. Supports federal legislation that:\n       a. creates a uniform definition of a ``salvage vehicle'' as \n     a vehicle declared a total loss by an insurance company or \n     where the retail cost to repair the vehicle exceeds 65 \n     percent of its fair market value immediately prior to being \n     damaged; and\n       b. requires that each transferor of a motor vehicle \n     disclose to the transferee orally and in writing at or before \n     the time of sale, whether the vehicle is a salvage vehicle \n     and whether the vehicle has suffered major damage; and\n       c. requires that each applicant for a motor vehicle title \n     disclose, on the application, whether the motor vehicle is a \n     salvage vehicle and whether the vehicle has suffered major \n     damage; and\n       d. requires that each motor vehicle title issued, \n     conspicuously show whether the motor vehicle is a salvage \n     vehicle and whether the vehicle has suffered major damage, if \n     that information is disclosed on the title application or on \n     any title previously issued by that state or another state; \n     and\n       e. provides for recovery of actual damages, minimum \n     statutory damages of $5,000 and attorneys fees, where \n     appropriate, by consumers injured by violation of the \n     statute, and\n       f. provides the civil enforcement by state Attorneys \n     General which includes injunctive relief, civil penalties and \n     restitution; and\n       h. provides for criminal penalties of up to $50,000 and \n     imprisonment for up to three years for each willful \n     violation; and\n       i. does not preempt state laws which provide greater \n     protection for consumers as long as state provisions are not \n     inconsistent with the federal law; and\n       2. Authorizes its Executive Director and General Counsel to \n     make these views known to all interested parties.\n                                  ____\n\n         State of Michigan, Department of Attorney General,\n                                      Lansing, MI, March 19, 1999.\n     Re Salvaged and Damaged Motor Vehicle Information Disclosure \n         Act\n\n     Hon. Carl Levin, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I am writing regarding your efforts to \n     provide greater protection for American consumers who \n     purchase used motor vehicles that have previously suffered \n     major damage or been salvaged prior to being repaired, \n     rebuilt and put back on the roadways. I believe that it is \n     essential for consumers to be informed of the prior condition \n     of their vehicle so that they may have all available material \n     facts at their disposal in making an informed decision \n     whether to purchase a motor vehicle.\n       Not only will your bill mandate disclosure of major damage \n     or salvage conditions, but the bill will also provide an \n     enforcement mechanism including damages and award of \n     attorneys fees to victims, civil penalties and criminal \n     sanctions. I also endorse the section of the bill that \n     empowers state attorneys general to enforce this law through \n     injunction relief or actions for damages.\n       This bill will further empower consumers to have more \n     information available in making an informed decision about \n     what is generally their second most costly purchase, motor \n     vehicles used for personal transportation. I urge Congress to \n     enact this bill.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                             Jennifer M. Granholm,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMS:\n  S. 679. A bill to authorize appropriations to the Department of State \nfor construction and security of United States diplomatic facilities, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n      SECURE EMBASSY CONSTRUCTION AND COUNTERTERRORISM ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise this morning to introduce a bill \ndealing with the security of our embassies around the world.\n  Mr. President, we all remember the horrible day of August 17, 1998, \nwhen U.S. embassies in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya were \ndestroyed by car bombs. We all mourn the passing of the 220 people who \nlost their lives to these heinous terrorist acts. But it is not enough \nto mourn. We in Congress have a separate responsibility--to conduct \nproper oversight to expose weaknesses in our embassy security \nrequirements and to ensure the resources given to this Administration \nare being allocated in ways to maximize their effectiveness.\n  In reviewing the conclusions of the State Department Accountability \nReview Boards chaired by Admiral William J. Crowe, I was disturbed to \nfind that they are strikingly similar to those reached by the Inman \nCommission which issued an extensive embassy security report 14 years \nago. Clearly, the United States has devoted inadequate resources and \nplaced too low a priority on security concerns.\n  And I regret to say, the President's response to the Crowe Report \nsimply is not adequate. The Administration has asked the Congress to \nprovide for an advance appropriation of $3 billion with no strings \nattached. That funding does not start next year, it starts in 2001. And \nthe bulk of the money is proposed in the out years. Those kind of \nbudget games shouldn't be played when the lives of U.S. government \nworkers are at stake. It's wrong to state that embassy construction is \na priority, while refusing to make funds available for that purpose.\n  As Chairman of the International Operations Subcommittee, which has \noversight responsibilities for embassy security issues, I have looked \ninto the mistakes that we made in the past, and I am committed to \nmaking sure they do not happen in the future. Our embassies are not \nvulnerable because we lack security requirements. They are vulnerable \nbecause over three-quarters of our embassies have those requirements \nwaived. Now, I understand that when the Inman security standards were \nput forward in the 1980's, a number of existing embassies did not meet \nthe criteria. But I was surprised to find many of the embassies built \nand purchased since that time do not meet the Inman standards either. \nWhile I do not want to micromanage the State Department's construction \nprogram, given State's record in this area, certain external \nconstraints are warranted.\n\n[[Page S3126]]\n\n  Unfortunately, under the Administration's plan, we are doomed to \nrepeat some of the same mistakes that were made following the Inman \nrecommendations. The funding structure makes it impossible to achieve \nefficiencies in embassy construction. There is just not enough funding \nin the next three years to permit a single contract to design and build \nan embassy or a single contract to build multiple embassies in a \nregion. Furthermore, the back loading of the funding means it could be \na decade before secure embassies are up and running. Clearly, that is \nnot acceptable.\n  Mr. President, I am introducing a 5-year authorization bill that \nmakes sure the money set aside for embassy construction and security is \nnot used for other purposes. It provides $600 million a year, starting \nin fiscal year 2000. And the Secretary of State is going to have to \ncertify these funds are being used to bring these embassies into \ncompliance with specific security standards, because 14 years from now, \nI don't want any finger pointing. I don't want the Congress to revisit \nthis matter and find that funds were diverted and U.S. personnel put at \nrisk.\n  The security requirements in my bill reflect some of the lessons that \nwe learned from Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam. While these requirements may \nnot have prevented lives being lost in the bombings, they could prevent \nthe loss of life in the future. For example, under my bill, the \nEmergency Action Plan for each mission will address threats from large \nvehicular bombs and transnational terrorism. And the ``Composite Threat \nList'' will have a section which emphasizes transnational terrorism and \nconsiders criteria such as the physical security environment, host \ngovernment support, and cultural realities.\n\n  Furthermore, in selecting sites for new U.S. diplomatic facilities \nabroad, there will be a set back requirement of 100 feet and all U.S. \ngovernment agencies will have be located on the same compound. State \nDepartment guidelines currently state that ``[a]ll U.S. Government \noffices and activities, subject to the authority of the chief of \nmission, are required to be collocated in chancery office buildings or \non a chancery/consulate compound.'' Unfortunately, these guidelines are \noften ignored. Indeed, after the August terrorist bombings, in \nviolation of State Department guidelines, A.I.D. headquarters decided \nnot to move its missions in Kenya and Tanzania into the more secure \nembassy compounds that are going to be built. A.I.D. only reversed \nitself after hearing from the Congress and U.S. officials in Kenya and \nTanzania.\n  Working abroad will never be risk free. But we can take a number of \nmeasures, like these, to make sure that safety is increased for U.S. \ngovernment workers overseas. We can also put forward requirements to \nensure we have an effective emergency response network in place to \nrespond to a crisis should one arise. My bill requires crisis \nmanagement training for State Department personnel; support for the \nForeign Emergency Support Team; rapid response procedure for assistance \nfrom the Department of Defense; and off-site storage of \nemergency equipment and records. These are prudent steps which should \nbe taken to ensure we have an effective crisis management system in \nplace if our embassies are attacked in the future.\n\n  My bill also calls for the Secretary of State to submit three reports \nto Congress. The first report would be a classified report rating our \ndiplomatic facilities in terms of their vulnerablity to terrorist \nattack. The second report would be a classified review of the findings \nof the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel which would recommend whether \nany U.S. missions should be closed due to high vulnerability to \nterrorist attacks and ways to maintain a U.S. presence if warranted. \nThe third report would be submitted in classified and unclassified form \non the projected role and function of each U.S. diplomatic facility \nthrough 2010. It would explore the potential of technology to decrease \nthe number of U.S. personnel abroad; the balance between the cost of \nproviding secure buildings and the benefit of a U.S. presence; the \npotential of regional facilities; and the upgrades necessary.\n  Finally, my bill enables the President to award the Overseas Service \nStar to any member of the Foreign Service or any civilian employee of \nthegovernment of the United States who--after August 1, 1998--was \nkilled or wounded while performing official duties, while on the \npremises of a U.S. mission abroad, or as a result of such employee's \nstatus as a U.S. government employee. These sacrifices for our nation \nby U.S. government workers abroad no longer should go unrecognized.\n  Mr. President, I believe with the approach outlined in my bill we can \nbetter ensure that we are providing a safe environment for U.S. \ngovernment workers abroad. We can also be confident that should another \nterrorist attack occur, we will be ready for the aftermath. I \nunderstand that there is a trade-off between security and \naccessibility. But there are obvious steps that we should be taking to \nprovide a higher level of security in this age of transnational \nterrorist threats. I hope this bill will not just provide a blueprint \nfor the steps we must take now, but guidance on how we should proceed \nin the future. We must acknowledge the world is changing and doing \nbusiness as usual is not going to work. We need to think outside the \nbox and explore new ways to confront new challenges. I hope the State \nDepartment sees my bill as an opportunity rather than a burden. I am \ncommitted to making sure that embassy security is treated as a \npriority, and this bill is a good first step.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Robb, Mr. \n        Abraham, Mr. Ashcroft, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \n        Conrad, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Grassley, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \n        Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Levin, \n        Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Mack, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \n        Smith of Oregon, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Warner, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. \n        Gramm):\n  S. 680. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend the research credit, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n        extension of the research and experimentation tax credit\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my friend \nSenator Baucus and many more of my esteemed colleagues in the Senate in \nintroducing legislation that would permanently extend the research and \nexperimentation tax credit.\n\n  As we enter the 21st century, we need to ensure that the United \nStates remains the world's undisputed leader in technological and \nscientific innovation. The global economy is becoming increasingly \ncompetitive. We must move to ensure that our economy does not fall \nbehind.\n  The research and experimentation tax credit is crucial to stimulating \neconomic growth. The President emphasized the value of this credit by \nasking that it be extended in his budget. Additionally, Congress has \nrecognized the importance of this tax credit by extending it nine times \nsince 1981.\n  Now is the time to end the uncertainty surrounding whether or not the \ncredit will continue to be extended or be allowed to lapse. We must \nguarantee to American business, our scientists, our engineers, and our \ncitizens who depend on technological innovations every day, that we \nwill make this tax credit permanent.\n  Mr. President, permanence is essential to the effectiveness of this \ncredit. Research and development projects typically take a number of \nyears and may even last longer than a decade. As our business leaders \nplan these projects, they need to know whether or not they can count on \nthis tax credit. The current uncertainty surrounding the credit has \ninduced businesses to allocate significantly less to research than they \notherwise would if they knew the tax credit would be available. This \nuncertainty undermines the entire purpose of the credit. For the \ngovernment and the American people to maximize the return on their \ninvestment in U.S. based research and development, this credit must be \nmade permanent.\n  Studies have shown that the R tax credit significantly increases \nresearch\n\n[[Page S3127]]\n\nand development expenditures. The marginal effect of one dollar of the \nR credit stimulates approximately one dollar of additional private \nresearch and development spending over the short-run and as much as two \ndollars of extra investment over the long-run.\n  In the business community, the development of new products, \ntechnologies, medicines, and ideas can result in either success or \nfailure. Investments carry a risk. The R tax credit helps ease the \ncost of incurring these risks. Whereas foreign nations heavily \nsubsidize research with public dollars, the United States has typically \nrelied less on direct public funds and more on private sector \nincentives. The R tax credit has potential to be an even more \neffective incentive if it were made permanent.\n\n  I am aware that not every company that incurs research and \ndevelopment expenditures in the U.S. can take advantage of the R tax \ncredit. As the credit matures and business cycles change, the current \ncredit may be out of reach for some companies. To help solve this \nproblem Congress enacted the Alternative Incremental Research Credit to \nhelp businesses that do not qualify for the R tax credit. To improve \nthe effectiveness of this alternative credit, we have included a \nproposal to increase it by 1 percent.\n  Mr. President, I am aware that a permanent extension of this credit \nwill be costly. However, when you consider the value that this \ninvestment will create for our economy, it is a bargain. Making this \ncredit permanent will encourage more companies to locate their research \nactivities within the United States. This will lead to more jobs and \nhigher wages for U.S. workers. We must recognize that international \ncompetition is fierce. Many other countries offer significant \nenticements to prompt companies to move research activities within \ntheir borders. If we fail to ensure at least a level playing field, \nmany companies will move their research activities abroad and we will \nlose many precious high-paying jobs.\n  Findings from a study conducted by Coopers & Lybrand show that \nworkers in every state will benefit from higher wages if the R & E tax \ncredit is made permanent. Payroll increases as a result of gains in \nproductivity stemming from the credit have been estimated to exceed $60 \nbillion over the next 12 years. Furthermore, greater productivity from \nadditional R will increase overall economic growth in every state in \nthe Union.\n  Mr. President, my home state of Utah is a good example of how state \neconomies will benefit from the R tax credit. Utah is home to a large \nnumber of firms who invest a high percentage of their revenue on \nresearch and development. For example, between Salt Lake City and Provo \nlies the world's biggest stretch of software and computer engineering \nfirms. This area, which was named ``Software Valley'' by Business Week, \nis second only to California's Silicon Valley as a thriving high tech \ncommercial area.\n  In addition, Utah is home to about 700 biotechnology and biomedical \nfirms that employ nearly 9,000 workers. These companies were conceived \nin research and development and will not survive, much less grow, \nwithout continuously conducting R activities.\n  In all, Mr. President there are approximately 80,000 employees \nworking in Utah's 1,400 plus and growing technology based companies. \nResearch and development is the lifeblood of these firms and hundreds \nof thousands like them throughout the nation.\n  If the credit is allowed to lapse, businesses will not be able to \nfactor the credit into their long-term plans. This uncertainty causes \nbusinesses to under-invest in research. This may slow the development \nof the next computer chip, the next household convenience, the next \ngeneration of heart monitoring equipment, or a new drug that stops \ncancer. We must ensure stability so that our business leaders can count \non the credit as they decide how much to invest in research and \ndevelopment.\n  Research and development is essential for long-term economic growth. \nInnovations in science and technology have fueled the massive economic \nexpansion we have witnessed over the course of the 20th century. These \nadvancements have improved the standard of living for nearly every \nAmerican. Simply put, the R tax credit is an investment in economic \ngrowth, new jobs, and important new products and processes.\n  In conclusion Mr. President, if we decide not to make the R tax \ncredit permanent, we are limiting the potential growth of our economy. \nHow can we expect the American economy to hold the lead in the global \neconomic race if we allow other countries to offer faster tracks than \nwe do? Making the tax credit permanent will keep American business \nahead of the pack. It will speed economic growth. Innovations resulting \nfrom American research and development will continue to improve the \nstandard of living for every person in the U.S. and also worldwide.\n  Mr. President, simply put, the costs of not making the R tax credit \npermanent are far greater than the costs of making it permanent. As the \nnext millennium closes in on us, we cannot afford to let the American \neconomy slow down. Now is the time to send a strong message to to the \nworld that America intends to retain its position as the world's \nforemost innovator.\n  I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                 S. 680\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF RESEARCH CREDIT.\n\n       (a) Credit Made Permanent.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 (relating to credit for increasing research activities) \n     is amended by striking subsection (h).\n       (2) Conforming amendment.--Paragraph (1) of section 45C(b) \n     of such Code is amended by striking subparagraph (D).\n       (b) Increase in Alternative Incremental Credit Rates.--\n     Subparagraph (A) of section 41(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 is amended--\n       (1) in clause (i), by striking ``1.65 percent'' and \n     inserting ``2.65 percent'',\n       (2) in clause (ii), by striking ``2.2 percent'' and \n     inserting ``3.2 percent'', and\n       (3) in clause (iii), by striking ``2.75 percent'' and \n     inserting ``3.75 percent''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsections (a) \n     and (b) shall apply to amounts paid or incurred after June \n     30, 1999.\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \njoin with my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, and my other \ncolleagues to introduce this bill, which is so critical to the ability \nof American businesses to effectively compete in the global \nmarketplace. I am particularly pleased that this bill includes as \noriginal co-sponsors one-third of the members of this body. This bill \nis bi-partisan and bi-cameral. Companion legislation, introduced in the \nHouse by Representatives Nancy Johnson and Robert Matsui, is co-\nsponsored by over one-quarter of the Members of the House.\n  Our Nation is the world's undisputed leader in technological \ninnovation, a position that would not be possible absent U.S. \ncompanies' commitment to research and development. Investment in \nresearch is an investment in our Nation's economic future, and it is \nappropriate that both the public and private sector share the costs \ninvolved, as we share in the benefits. The credit provided through the \ntax code for research expenses provides a modest but crucial incentive \nfor companies to conduct their research in the United States, thus \ncreating high-skilled, high-paying jobs for U.S. workers.\n  The R credit has played a key role in placing the United States \nahead of its competition in developing and marketing new products. \nEvery dollar that the federal government spends on the R credit is \nmatched by another dollar of spending on research over the short run by \nprivate companies, and $2 of spending over the long run. Our global \ncompetitors are well aware of the importance of providing incentives \nfor research, and many provide more generous tax treatment for research \nand experimentation expenses than does the United States. As a result, \nwhile spending on non-defense R in the United States as a percentage \nof GDP has remained relatively flat since 1985, Japan's and Germany's \nhas grown.\n  The benefits of the credit, though certainly significant, have been \nlimited over the years by the fact that the credit has been temporary. \nIn addition to the numerous times that the credit has been allowed to \nlapse only to be extended retroactively, the 1996 extension left a 12-\nmonth gap during which the credit was not available. This unprecedented \nlapse sent a troubling signal to\n\n[[Page S3128]]\n\nthe U.S. companies and universities that have come to rely on the \ngovernment's longstanding commitment to the credit.\n  Much research and development takes years to mature. The more \nuncertain the long-term future of the credit is, the smaller its \npotential to stimulate increased research. If companies evaluating \nresearch projects cannot rely on the seamless continuation of the \ncredit, they are less likely to invest in research in this country, \nless likely to put money into cutting-edge technological innovation \nthat is critical to keeping us in the forefront of global competition.\n  Our country is locked in a fierce battle for high-paying \ntechnological jobs in the global economy. As more nations succeed in \ncreating educationally advanced workforces and join the U.S. as high-\ntechnologically manufacturing centers, they become more attractive to \ncompanies trying to penetrate foreign markets. Multinational companies \nsometimes find that moving both manufacturing and basic research \nactivities overseas is necessary if they are to remain competitive. The \nuncertainty of the R credit factors into their economic calculations, \nand makes keeping these jobs in the U.S. more difficult.\n  According to a study conducted by Coopers & Lybrand last year, making \nthe R credit permanent will provide a substantial positive stimulus \nto investment, wage-growth, productivity, and overall economic activity \nfor this country. Payroll increases from gains in productivity are \nestimated to total $64 billion over the period 1998 through 2010. In \nthe year 2010 alone, the payroll increase is estimated to total nearly \n$12 billion.\n  Also according to the study, gross State Product, which is the basic \nmeasure of economic activity in a state, will rise overall by nearly \n$58 billion between 1998 and 2010 as a result of a permanent credit. \nNearly three-fifths of this increase nationally is attributable to \nadditional value added by industries that generally do not perform R \nthemselves, but benefit from the R done by companies in other \nindustries.\n  Gains in payroll and in Gross State Produce are not limited to states \nregarded as centers for technological innovation. Although such regions \nof the country certainly benefit from the credit, each and every state \nwill profit in some measurable way from the credit since all sectors of \nthe economy--agriculture, mining, basic manufacturing, and high-tech \nservices--benefit from productivity improvements resulting from the \nadditional research and development caused by the credit.\n  My own State of Montana is an excellent example of this economic \nactivity. The total increase in payroll due to the R credit for the \nyears 1998-2010 is estimated to be just over $250 million. The total \nincrease in Gross State Product during this same period is expected to \nbe $150 million. Neither of these increases place Montana in the top \ntier of States benefiting from the credit. However, looking beyond \nthose numbers, the impact of the credit in Montana is substantial. In \n1995, 12 of every 1,000 private sector workers were employed directly \nby high-tech firms in Montana. Almost 400 establishments provided high-\ntechnology services, at an average wage of $34,500 per year. These jobs \npaid 77 percent more than the average private sector wage in 1995 of \n$19,500 per year. Many of these jobs would never have been created \nwithout the assistance of the R credit. And many more jobs in Montana \nare dependent upon the growth and stability of the high-tech sector. \nAlthough the cumulative numbers may not be high in comparison with \nother States, the impact of the R credit on Montana's economy is \nclear.\n  Senator Hatch and I are not newcomers to this issue. We have jointly \nintroduced bills to make the R credit permanent in numerous previous \nCongresses only to end up with extensions of one year or less. But I \nlike to think that this year will be different. The hard work we have \ndone to bring our budget into balance is finally beginning to pay off, \nand the projected budget surpluses gives us an opportunity to think \ncarefully about how best to allocate our resources. We believe making \nthe R credit permanent is a wise use of budget dollars because of the \ndirect positive impact on economic growth and productivity. This is not \njust a corporate issue. This is a use of tax dollars that benefits all \nof us who are working to expand employment, increase wages and keep our \nNation at the cutting edge of technological development. I sincerely \nhope we can make this year the year that the R credit becomes a \npermanent part of our tax code.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, technology is the driving force \nbehind the U.S. economy, and investment in research and development is \nthe driving force behind technology. Without research and development, \nthe Internet would not exist. Without research and development, bone \nmarrow transplants would not be saving lives. Without research and \ndevelopment, global satellite networks would not bring instantaneous \nnews from around the world into our living rooms.\n  Quite simply, Mr. President, research and development encourages \neconomic growth, creates jobs, and gives U.S. businesses an edge in \ntoday's competitive world marketplace.\n  That is why I am proud to be an original cosponsor of legislation \nintroduced today by my colleagues Senator Hatch and Senator Baucus. \nThis bill to make permanent the R tax credit will enable private \nbusinesses large and small to spend more of their resources on research \nand development. I have long been a strong supporter of the R tax \ncredit and am delighted to join the effort to make it permanent.\n  As my colleagues know, the credit was first created in 1981 as a way \nto encourage the development of new and innovative commercial \ntechnologies and has been renewed nine times. Unfortunately, Congress \nhas never made the tax credit permanent. Such a year to year \nuncertainty prohibits companies from making long-term R plans that \ntake the tax credit into account. This lack of permanency leads \ninevitably to a lower rate of investment in research and development. \nThat, Mr. President, slows U.S. innovation and economic growth, results \nin fewer jobs for Americans, and places U.S. firms at a competitive \ndisadvantage to foreign companies.\n  Making the R tax credit permanent is one of the easiest and most \neffective measures we can take to boost the effectiveness and \nefficiency of the high tech industry.\n  The credit spurs economic growth. A recent study by Coopers & Lybrand \nfound that every dollar of tax benefit generates as much as one dollar \nof additional private R and D spending in the short term and as much as \ntwo dollars of long-term R and D investment. The study concluded that \nover the 1998-2010 period, U.S. companies would spend 41 billion \ndollars more on research and development if the credit were made \npermanent. Further, innovations from that additional R and D investment \nwould add more than 13 billion dollars a year to the economy's \nproductive capacity by the year 2010.\n  The credit creates jobs. Because it is targeted primarily at salaries \nand wages of employees directly involved in research and \nexperimentation, it is an incentive for companies to create and sustain \nhigh-skilled, high-paying jobs.\n  The credit helps U.S. companies compete. The R and D Tax Credit \nCoalition, a group of over 1000 American companies and 52 trade \nassociations dedicated to making the tax credit permanent, argues that \nthe credit is an essential tool for U.S. companies competing against \nforeign firms. Foreign companies often benefit from research and \ndevelopment subsidies from their governments. Such incentives lower the \ncost of R and D in foreign countries and give companies receiving the \nsubsidies a competitive advantage over U.S. firms. According to the \nCoalition, U.S. corporate research and development spending lags far \nbehind Germany and Japan as a percentage of sales. Making the tax \ncredit permanent will go a long way to eliminate this disadvantage.\n  In my home state of Washington, hundreds of businesses, both large \nand small, use the R tax credit to develop new and innovative \nproducts and create jobs. In fact, Washington is making a name for \nitself as the home of a large and growing high technology industry. \nLast year, the American Electronics Association named Washington a \n``cyber state'' and found that 45 out of every 1,000 private sector\n\n[[Page S3129]]\n\nworkers in the state are employed by high-tech firms. According to AEA, \nWashington leads the nation in high-tech wages with an average high-\ntech salary in the state of over 66 thousand dollars a year.\n  Not surprisingly then, we in Washington view the R credit as a \nvalued complement to our state's economic development policies. In \nfact, the Coopers and Lybrand study estimates that the credit will \nincrease Washington's Gross State Product by $1.4 billion and the \nstate's payroll by $1.6 billion over the next decade.\n  The Hatch-Baucus legislation to make the R tax credit permanent \nwill benefit Washington and every other state in the nation. It is a \nsmart and effective piece of legislation. It spurs economic growth, \ncreates jobs, and helps U.S. companies compete more effectively.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting innovation in America.\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nResearch and Experimentation Tax Credit, introduced by the Senators \nfrom Utah and Montana. This bill addresses what is in my opinion a \nlong-standing oversight in the tax code, and will create a permanent \nextension for the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit.\n  Indeed, this legislation is necessary because, despite a remarkable \nrecord of spurring innovation and success--it is regarded by many in \nthe business world as the single most effective tool government has to \nhelp business--the 18 year old research and experimentation tax credit \ninexplicably remains a temporary provision of the tax code.\n  Economists have linked the tax credit to steady economic growth and \nproductivity. Industry leaders have credited it with spawning private \nenterprise investments. It is especially important to high tech and \nemerging growth industries that are driving our economy. And, because \nit creates jobs and spurs economic activity, the research and \nexperimentation tax credit helps to increase the tax base, paying back \nthe benefit of the credit.\n  Yet, despite its many benefits, for 18 years the research and \nexperimentation tax credit has remained a temporary tax provision \nrequiring regular renewal. The President's budget request for FY2000 \nhas, once again, only requested a one year extension of the credit.\n  In fact, since 1981, when it was first enacted, the Research and \nExperimentation Tax Credit has been extended nine times. In four \ninstances the research credit had expired before being renewed \nretroactively and, in one instance, it was renewed for a mere six \nmonths.\n  This is not a process which is conducive to encouraging business \ninvestment in the innovative industries--high technology, electronics, \ncomputers, software, and biotechnology, among others--which will \nprovide future strength and growth for the U.S. economy.\n  Earlier in this decade California was faced with its severest \neconomic downturn since the Great Depression. Today, the California \neconomy is healthy and vibrant, and it is so in no small part because \nof the critical role played by innovative research and development \nefforts in nurturing new ``high tech'' industries.\n  Today the 150 largest Silicon Valley companies are valued at well-\nover $500 billion, $500 billion which did not exist two decades ago. \nMuch of this growth is a result of ability of companies to undertake \nlong-rage and sustained research in cutting-edge technologies.\n  To give just one example: Pericom Semiconductor, located in San Jose, \nCalifornia, has expanded from a start-up company in 1990 to a company \nwith over $50 million in revenue and 175 employees by the end of last \nyear. Pericom is ranked by Deloitte Touche as one of the fastest \ngrowing companies in Silicon Valley. And, according to a letter I \nreceived from the Vice President of Finance and administration at \nPericom, utilization of the research credit has been key to their \nsuccess, enabling them to add engineers, conduct research, and expand \ntheir technology base.\n  I will enter into the Record letters I have received from several \nCalifornia companies regarding the benefits of the research and \nexperimentation tax credit.\n  The new jobs created at companies like Pericom, Genetech, Intel, Lam, \nand Xylinx, along with a host of others, through utilization of the \nresearch and experimentation tax credit also create additional tax \nrevenue, paying back the benefit of the tax credit.\n  Research and experimentation is the lifeblood of high technology \ndevelopment, and if we want to replicate the success of companies like \nPericom across the country it is crucial that we create a permanent \nresearch and experimentation tax credit.\n  According to a 1988 study conducted by the national accounting firm \nCoopers & Lybrand, a permanent credit will increase GDP by nearly $58 \nbillion (in 1998 dollars) over the next decade. The productivity gains \nfrom a permanent extension will allow workers throughout the nation to \nearn higher wages.\n  Whether it is advances in health care, information technology, or \nenvironmental design, research and development are critical ingredients \nfor fueling the process of economic growth.\n  Moreover, aggressive research and experimentation is essential for \nU.S. industries fighting to be competitive in the world marketplace.\n  Right now American biotechnology is the world leader in developing \neffective treatments and biotech is considered one of the critical \ntechnologies for the twenty-first century. With other countries \nheavily-subsidizing research and development, it is critical that U.S. \ncompanies also receive incentive to invest the necessary resources to \nstay on top of breakthrough developments.\n  Most biotech research and development efforts are long term projects \nspanning five to ten years, sometimes more. The uncertainty created by \nthe temporary and sporadic extensions is incompatible with the basic \nneeds of biotech innovation--providing companies with a stable time \nframe to plan, launch, and conduct research activities. In the case of \na promising but financially intensive research project, such \nunpredictability can make the difference as to whether the project is \ncompleted or abandoned.\n  Anyone who has watched the growth of America's high tech sector in \nthe past two decades--much of it in California--has seen first hand how \nresearch and development investment leads to new jobs, new businesses, \nand even entire new industries. And anyone who has benefitted from \nbreakthrough products--from new treatments for genetic disorders to \ncleansing contaminated groundwater--has felt the effect of this tax \ncredit.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the research and experimentation tax \ncredit has proven its worth in creating new technologies and jobs, and \nin growing tax revenues for this country. It should not be imperilled \nby remaining a temporary credit, subject to termination because of the \nuncertainty of a given political moment. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill and to create a permanent extension for the Research \nand Experimentation Tax Credit.\n  I ask that letter in support of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n\n                                                      Pericom,\n\n                                                 October 13, 1998.\n     Sen. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Washington, DC.\n       This is a letter to let you know how we are able to utilize \n     the benefits of the Research and Development Tax Credit.\n       Pericom Semiconductor--located in San Jose, California--has \n     expanded from a start-up in 1990 to $50M in revenue with 175 \n     people as of September 1998. The savings that we obtain \n     through the utilization of the research credit have enabled \n     us to add engineers to help us expand our technology base. We \n     were ranked as one of the fastest growing companies in \n     Silicon Valley as a result of a Deloitte Touche survey.\n       The benefit to our country is that we export about 50% of \n     our revenue to Asia Pacific and Europe. This helps with the \n     balance of trade.\n       The engineers that we hire also pay their fair share of \n     taxes so the benefit of the tax credit is paid back and I'm \n     sure are more than revenue neutral. It enables them to buy \n     goods and services which has the spiral effect of making our \n     country that much stronger.\n       We respect your efforts on our behalf and view the \n     extension as a must for us. There is no known reason not to \n     pass it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Patrick B. Brennan,\n                       Vice President, Finance and Administration.\n\n[[Page S3130]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                Texas Instruments,\n\n\n                                        Silicon Systems, Inc.,\n\n                                    Santa Cruz, CA, March 9, 1999.\n     Hon. Diane Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write to you in my capacity as \n     Santa Cruz Fab Director of Texas Instruments. Although we \n     have operations throughout the United States, especially in \n     Texas, we have significant operations in Santa Cruz, San \n     Jose, Tustin and Santa Barbara, California. Thank you for \n     your support for the Research and Development (R) tax \n     credit and your efforts to make the credit permanent. We \n     support the bill recently introduced by Reps. Johnson and \n     Matsui. Making the R tax credit permanent is our top tax \n     priority for 1999.\n       Texas Instruments is a global semiconductor company \n     employing over 34,000 people worldwide. We are the world's \n     leading designer and supplier of digital signal processing \n     (DSP) and analog technologies, the engines driving the \n     digitization of electronics. DSP is the enabler of products \n     and processes yet to be imagined. It is a 3.9 billion dollar \n     market today. It should hit 13 billion dollars within the \n     next five years. If one adds mixed signal and analog \n     products, the total market could be in excess of 60 billion \n     dollars by the year 2002.\n       The R tax credit provides a significant incentive for \n     companies to perform additional amounts of R activity. \n     Given the inherent riskiness of this type of investment, the \n     credit makes for sound tax policy. Because the R credit is \n     primarily a wage credit, most of this additional investment \n     is directly connected to the creation and maintenance of \n     high-wage professional jobs.\n       Additionally, the creation of new products and broadening \n     the scope of technical knowledge benefits Americans \n     generally. We specialize in digital signal processing \n     solutions, enabling the nation to be more efficient and more \n     productive. Ultimately, the nation's employees will earn \n     higher wages and pay more taxes because Texas Instruments and \n     other California companies are investing in the future \n     through research.\n       To best harness the incentive nature of the R tax credit, \n     we believe that Congress should make the credit permanent. \n     Texas Instruments and the entire high tech community would \n     like to be able to rely upon the existence of the credit \n     beyond the average six months to 1\\1/2\\ year extension that \n     has characterized the treatment of the credit since 1986. \n     This would allow us to devote even more resources to R \n     activities, and quite possibly hire even more Californians.\n       There is another way to look at this: Congress and the \n     Administration need to take steps to ensure that U.S. \n     companies are equipped to compete in the international \n     marketplace. In the semiconductor industry, we have always \n     faced a continuing threat from foreign competitors such as \n     those in Japan, Korea or Taiwan. The R tax credit is a step \n     that helps U.S. companies as they compete in the global \n     marketplace. It does this by encouraging R activities, \n     which in turn result in greater employment opportunities.\n       As you know, high-technology firms have a critical role to \n     play in the future of the nation, and we all need to work to \n     keep businesses like ours here in the U.S. As the world \n     quickly shifts to a service economy, high salary jobs that \n     can sustain the American standard of living are becoming \n     increasingly linked to high value-added, high-tech \n     professions. Future economic growth and high employment \n     require us to continue to nourish innovation while \n     encouraging our employees to be as productive and creative as \n     possible. Our nation has the potential to lead the world into \n     a prosperous new century of growth, given appropriate federal \n     policy--such as making permanent the R tax credit.\n       Again, thank you for all your previous efforts in support \n     of the R tax credit. If there is any additional information \n     that we can provide to you in support of this important \n     provision, please feel free to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James D. Jensen,\n                                  Santa Cruz Fab Director.\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators \nHatch and Baucus today in cosponsoring a bill to make the Research and \nExperimentation Tax Credit permanent. Technological innovation is the \nmajor factor driving economic and income growth in America today. A one \npercent increase in our nation's investment in research results in a \nproductivity increase of 0.23 percent. Productivity increases are what \nallow us to increase wages and standards of living. The R undertaken \nby our companies today is too important to our economy and our wages to \nallow its encouragement through tax credits to be an unstable, \nhaphazard effort varying from one year to the next.\n  Moreover, R has a significantly higher rate of return at the \nsocietal level than at the company level. There is a huge spillover \neffect from one person's or one company's innovation to other firms, \nother industries, and benefits to consumers. That is why government has \na role in supporting R both directly through government funded \nresearch and through tax credits to private industry. All of society \nbenefits from increased R I strongly support making the R tax \ncredit permanent so that our companies can engage confidently in long-\nterm planning for sustained research investment.\n  I believe making the R tax credit permanent is a priority. I also \nfeel we must strengthen the United States investment in R through \nother means as well. Senators Frist, Rockefeller, Domenici, Gramm and I \nare sponsoring a bill, S. 296--with 29 cosponsors--to double federal \ninvestment in research over the next decade. Government labs and \nUniversity labs undertake much of the basic research in this country. \nWe need to nurture these incubators of basic research not only by \nincreasing government support for them, but to encourage private sector \nsupport and financing of them. That is why Senators Domenici, Bingaman, \nFrist and I support some reforms to the R tax credit that will \nencourage the private sector to partner with Government and University \nlabs. We will shortly be introducing a bill to increase the benefits of \nthe R credit to all companies, encourage research consortia, and give \nspecial attention to research investment by small businesses.\n  The reason we have been unable to make the R tax credit permanent \nis because it requires that the expenditures be scored for five years, \nthereby raising the budget costs. Extending the credit each year, \nsometimes at the last minute and sometimes retroactively, does not \nlower the cost to government, but increases the costs to industry by \nincreasing its risk and uncertainty. Let's stop this charade and do \nwhat's right. Let's make it permanent.\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with my \ncolleagues Senator Hatch and Senator Baucus in introducing legislation \nto permanently extend the research and experimentation (R) tax \ncredit. This credit provides a major incentive to the private sector to \ninvest in long-range, high-risk research. It has played, and continues \nto play an important role in fostering private-sector investment in \nresearch, driving innovation in our technology-based industries.\n  Economic studies have shown that for each dollar of lost tax revenue, \nthe tax credit stimulates an additional dollar of R in the short term \nand two additional dollars in the long term. These research investments \npromote technological innovation, enhance job growth, and increase \nproductivity, helping to maintain our nation's quality of life and \neconomic strength and well-being.\n  The R tax credit was enacted in 1981, and since then has been \ntemporarily extended nine times, for periods as brief as six months, \nand has been allowed to lapse at least three times before being renewed \nretroactively. This is simply not an acceptable situation, especially \nif we mean to create a business climate which encourages the private \nsector to fund as much R as possible in the U.S., and not to move \nthese activities off shore to countries that offer more substantial tax \nand financial incentives. This is a particularly critical concern for \nour high-growth, research-intensive industries, such as those in the \ncomputer, telecommunications, and biotechnology sectors. These \ncompanies depend on the R tax credit to undertake and continue long-\nterm research projects. To ensure the success of such projects it is \nessential that our support for industry research is both continuous and \npredictable--our future competitiveness in the world marketplace \ndepends upon it.\n  The federal government is reducing its commitment to research and \ndevelopment. We therefore need to encourage the private sector to \nexpand its investment in this area. By making the R tax credit \npermanent, so that companies can count on its availability from year to \nyear in planning their research investments, we create an environment \nconducive to promoting investment in R We must not allow a system \ncharacterized by the uncertainty of frequent expirations and renewals \nto continue. I therefore urge my colleagues to join me in support of \nthis legislation to make the R tax credit permanent.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Cleland, Mr. Johnson, Ms.\n\n[[Page S3131]]\n\n        Mikulski, Mr. Sarbanes, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 681. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act and Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 to require that group and \nindividual health insurance coverage and group health plans provide \ncoverage for a minimum hospital stay for mastectomies and lymph node \ndissections performed for the treatment of breast cancer, to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                  breast cancer patient protection act\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Breast Cancer \nPatient Protection Act of 1999, which requires health insurance plans \nto provide coverage for a minimum hospital stay for mastectomies and \nlymph node dissections performed to treat breast cancer.\n  This bill would prevent insurance companies and health maintenance \norganizations (HMOs) from forcing women to leave the hospital \nprematurely following a mastectomy or lymph node dissection or to have \nthese treatments on an outpatient basis. Insurance company accountants \nshould not make medical decisions without considering a doctor's \njudgments or a patient's needs. This legislation is part of my ongoing \neffort to protect patients and require that insurance companies deliver \nnecessary, promised coverage. The Patients' Bill of Rights Act, S.6, \nalso addresses these types of abuses, while providing a range of other \nimportant protections.\n  The Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act would guarantee women at \nleast 48 hours of inpatient care following a mastectomy and at least 24 \nhours following lymph node dissection. These standards were designed in \nconsultation with surgeons who specialize in this area and reflect the \nminimum amount of inpatient care necessary following these procedures. \nPatients, in consultation with their physicians, would be able to leave \nthe hospital earlier if their situation warrants. The bottom line is \nstill that insurers should allow coverage for the time necessary to \nensure a proper recovery.\n  Over the last several years, the average length of hospitalization \nfollowing a mastectomy has fallen from 4-6 to 2-3 days. Patients \nundergoing lymph node dissections in the past were hospitalized for 2-3 \ndays. While some of the reductions in length of care may be the result \nof better medical practices, hospitalization is still critical for pain \ncontrol, to manage fluid drainage, and to provide support and \nreassurance for women who have just undergone major surgery.\n  Nevertheless, some patients have been told that their health \nmaintenance organization (HMO) will cover their major surgery only on \nan outpatient basis. These determinations have been made on the basis \nof studies by their own actuarial consulting firms. However, both \nAmerican College of Surgeons and the American Medical Association have \nconcluded that inpatient stays are recommended in many cases. Women \nsuffering from breast cancer deserve to know that their insurance will \ncover care based on their medical needs rather than the coverage \nrecommendations made by HMO actuaries.\n  My bill is a companion to H.R. 116, which was introduced in the House \nof Representatives by Congresswoman DeLauro. I would like to express \nappreciation to Congresswoman DeLauro, and to Senators Feinstein, \nMikulski and Murray, for their tireless efforts on behalf of breast \ncancer patients. All have been invaluable leaders who have inspired and \nchallenged us to address the very real need for breast cancer treatment \nreform.\n  As we discuss the importance of ensuring quality care for breast \ncancer sufferers who have health insurance, it is also important to \nnote that many women in the United States must fight this life-\nthreatening disease without any health insurance at all. The Centers \nfor Disease Control (CDC) funds breast and cervical cancer screening--\nin South Dakota, 1300 low-income women have been screened during the \npast 18 months--but there is no funding for actual treatment when that \nscreening detects cancer. While the CDC effort is a critical part of \nthe fight against cancer, it is ironic that those women who test \npositive for breast and cervical cancer may have no way to pay for the \ntreatment they need.\n  With one in eight women expected to develop breast cancer, it is \nincreasingly likely that all of our families will be affected by this \ndevastating disease in some way. In South Dakota, 500 women will be \ndiagnosed with, and 100 will die of, breast cancer in the next 12 \nmonths. Let us take this small step to ensure the experience is not \ncomplicated by insecurity and confusion over health insurance coverage. \nLet us put critical health care decisions back in the hands of breast \ncancer patients and their physicians.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 681\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to implement the Hague Convention on Protection of \nChildren and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send to the desk legislation that the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu and I are \nintroducing today, its purpose being to implement the Hague Convention \non Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry \nAdoption--a treaty pending before the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Senator Landrieu and I have worked together on issues of adoption \nsince her arrival in the Senate in 1997. I am genuinely grateful for \nher leadership on this issue.\n  According to the most recent statistics, in 1998 almost 15,774 \nchildren were adopted by Americans from abroad. The majority of the \nchildren were brought to the United States from Russia, China, Korea, \nand Central and South American countries. In my state of North \nCarolina, 175 children were adopted in 1996 from outside the United \nStates.\n  The Intercountry Adoption Implementation Act will provide for the \nfirst time a rational structure for intercountry adoption. The act is \nintended to bring some accountability to agencies that provide \nintercountry adoption services in the United States, and strengthen the \nhand of the Secretary of State in ensuring that U.S. adoption agencies \nengage in efforts to find homes for children in an ethical manner.\n   Mr. President, I strongly support adoption. It is in the best \ninterest of every child--regardless of his or her age, race or special \nneed--to be raised by a family who will provide a safe, permanent, and \nnurturing home. However, it is also a process that can leave parents \nand children vulnerable to fraud and abuse.\n  For this reason, the legislation that Senator Landrieu and I are \nintroducing today includes a requirement that agencies be accredited to \nprovide intercountry adoption. Mandatory standards for accreditation \nwill include ensuring that a child's medical records be available in \nEnglish to the prospective parents prior to their traveling to the \nforeign country to finalize an adoption. (We are also requiring that \nagencies be transparent, especially in their rate of disrupted adoption \nand their fee scales.)\n  This legislation also places the requirements of implementing the \nHague Convention with the U.S. Secretary of State. Some have advocated \na role for various government agencies, but I believe that spreading \nresponsibility among various agencies will undermine the effective \nimplementation of the Hague Convention.\n  During hearings last year in the Foreign Relations Committee \nregarding international parental kidnaping, the Committee heard \ntestimony regarding the difficulties of coordination among agencies in \nimplementing the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of Parental \nAbduction. This situation provides a valuable lesson. As a result, our \nlegislation tasks the Secretary of State with establishing \naccreditation criteria for adoption agencies.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee soon will schedule hearings to \nconsider both the treaty and this legislation. I hope that these \nhearings will emphasize both the many benefits of intercountry \nadoption, but also several of the abuses that have resulted during this \ndecade.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am very proud to join with my friend \nand colleague, the senior Senator from North Carolina, in introducing \nthe implementing legislation for the Hague Convention on Intercountry \nAdoption. As many Members know, Senator Helms cares deeply about the \nwelfare of children and knows personally of the joy of building a \nfamily through adoption. I commend him for his strong commitment, his \nleadership, and the very thoughtful work that he has put into this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  In my office, I have a large black and white poster of a smiling \ninfant crawling only in a diaper. On the baby's bottom, on the diaper, \nis a huge bull's eye. The text says simply, ``Children always make the \neasiest targets.''\n  Unfortunately, Madam President, that seems to be true in our \nlegislative and budgetary process. They don't move very quickly, they \nare not very strong, they don't have very loud voices and they can't \nprotect themselves. We need to help them do that.\n  It would have been easy for the chairman of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee to come to this floor on one of the dozens of other \nimportant treaties that he has pending before his committee. It would \nhave required no effort to leave this relatively obscure treaty \nlanguishing in limbo for months or even years. Instead, Senator Helms \nmade this treaty a priority. I am very proud to join him as a lead \ndemocratic sponsor of its implementing legislation, which will benefit \nmillions of children throughout the world, and families around the \nglobe.\n  I have had the opportunity to meet with many foreign dignitaries on \nthe subject of intercountry adoption, from China to Russia, to Romania. \nMany countries have indicated that the United States ratification of \nthe Hague Convention is the single most important thing we can do to \nstrengthen the process of intercountry adoption. The United States \nadopts more children than any other country in the world. \nUnfortunately, this Nation and other large receiving nations have been \nsending the wrong message about our intentions regarding adoption.\n  A nation like Romania, for instance, which has had a tortured history \nin the field of child welfare indicated the importance of this treaty \nby being the first nation to ratify. For that, they should be \ncommended.\n  Other sending countries have similarly stepped up to the plate, while \nreceiving nations remain inactive. We must change that.\n  Today, in the Senate, we send a new message to the world. The United \nStates is serious about the Hague convention. We are serious about \nimproving and reforming the intercountry adoption system, and we will \nencourage other nations of the world to join us in that effort.\n  Habitat for Humanity's Millard Fuller, a man who has accomplished a \ngreat deal in the last few years, has a credo for his organization. He \nsays everyone deserves a decent place to live. He is right. With that \nsimple, but bold vision, Habitat for Humanity has been an incredible \nsuccess story, building homes around the world for millions of \nfamilies.\n  This is another simple but bold idea. Every child deserves a \nnurturing family. This treaty doesn't guarantee that, but it will give \nmillions of children their best chance for a family to call their own. \nFurthermore, it will give millions of would-be parents a better chance \nat the joy of parenthood. We cannot let arbitrary borders and national \npride get in the way of this simple but powerful idea, that every child \nshould have parents who can love and care for them. No child should \nhave to be raised alone.\n  The Hague Convention, by normalizing the process of intercountry \nadoption, brings this bold idea a step closer to reality.\n  I will briefly touch upon several important pieces of this \nlegislation. First, let me say that this treaty is not a Federal \nendeavor to take control of the adoption process. This system is \nworking for the most, and in many parts of the country it works very \nwell. The philosophy throughout has been to address the real need for \nreform of intercountry adoptions and leave the other debate to another \nday.\n\n[[Page S3134]]\n\n  This bill, however, does make several changes which will \nrevolutionize the status quo. First, the State Department will finally \nbe given legislative authority to track, monitor and report on \nintercountry adoptions. We will have hard figures on disruptions, \nadoption fees, and most importantly, the number of American children \nwho are adopted by people abroad.\n  Second, accredited agencies will need to provide some minimum \nservices to continue operating in the intercountry field. Among these \nservices are translated medical reports, 6 weeks of preadoption \ncounseling, liability insurance and open examination of practices and \nrecords. By allowing public scrutiny in this area, we believe the Hague \nimplementing legislation provides some basic consumer protection and \nwill help eliminate the few bad actors who occasionally grab headlines \nin the arena of international adoption.\n  Another significant feature of this treaty is the adoption \ncertificate which will be provided by the Secretary of State. With the \ncertificate, INS procedures and State court finalizations will become \nroutine and quick rather than involved and costly. This will be a \nwelcome relief for many families across this country waiting for \nchildren to come home.\n  Americans provide loving families for nearly 15,000 children from \naround the world. If we pass this convention, those numbers are most \ncertainly likely to increase, which will be an opportunity for families \nhere in the United States, as well as many children who desperately \nneed homes.\n  Every day, my colleagues speak eloquently from this floor about ways \nto help our children and families grow and become stronger, but rarely \ndo we have an opportunity to do something which can have a significant \nimpact on actually creating loving homes for children who have no one. \nThis is such an occasion. We should not miss this historic opportunity.\n  I look forward to working with our chairman from North Carolina as \nthis bill and treaty progress through the Senate in the months ahead. \nIt is with high hopes that we proceed, hoping that we can pass a \nstrong, bipartisan piece of legislation before the end of the year.\n  Madame President, the need to help children find loving homes, is as \nold as human history. You can look all the way back to Muhammad who \nstated that ``the best house is the house in which an orphan receives \ncare.'' I hope we can create many such houses with this bill. I would \nlike to conclude with a quote I read in preparation for this speech \nthat I found quite moving. It says that ``orphans, other than their \ninnocence, have no sin, and other than their tears, they have no way of \ncommunication. They cannot explain the wars, the struggles, the \npolitical disputes, or the geographical disputes which have all made \nthem homeless, helpless, fearful, and alone.

A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, to provide for \nfamily fishermen, and to make chapter 12 of title 11, United States \nCode, permanent; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               THE FISHERMEN'S BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION ACT\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nmake reorganization under Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code applicable \nto family fishermen. In brief, the bill would allow family fishermen \nthe opportunity to apply for the protections of reorganization in \nbankruptcy and provide to them the same protections and terms as those \ngranted the family farmer who enters bankruptcy.\n  Like many Americans, I'm appalled by those who live beyond their \nmeans, and use the bankruptcy code as a tool to cure their self-induced \nfinancial ills. I have supported and will continue to support \nalterations to the bankruptcy code that ensure the responsible use of \nits provisions. All consumers bear the burden of irresponsible debtors \nwho abuse the system. Therefore, I believe bankruptcy should remain a \ntool of last resort for those in severe financial distress.\n  As those familiar with the bankruptcy code know, business \nreorganization in bankruptcy is a different creature than the \nforgiveness of debt traditionally associated with bankruptcy. \nReorganization embodies the hope that by providing business a break \nfrom creditors, and allowing debt to be adjusted, the business will \nhave an opportunity to get back on sound financial footing and thrive. \nIn that vein, Chapter 12 was added to the bankruptcy code in 1986 by \nthe Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, to provide for bankruptcy \nreorganization of the family farm and to give family farmers a \n``fighting chance to reorganize their debts and keep their land''.\n  To provide the ``fighting chance'' envisioned by the authors of \nChapter 12, Congress provided a distinctive set of substantive and \nprocedural rules to govern effective reorganization of the family farm. \nIn essence, Chapter 12 was a recognition of the unique situation of \nfamily owned businesses and the enormous value of the family farmer to \nthe American economy and our cultural heritage.\n  Chapter 12 was modeled on bankruptcy Chapter 13 which governs the \nreorganization of individual debt. However, to address the unique \nproblems encountered by farmers, Chapter 12 provided for significant \nadvantages over the standard Chapter 13 filer. These advantages include \na longer period of time to file a plan for relief, greater flexibility \nfor the debtor to modify the debts secured by their assets, and \nalteration of the statutory time limit to repay secured debts. The \nChapter 12 debtor is also given the freedom to sell off parts of his or \nher property as part of a reorganization plan.\n  Unlike Chapter 13, which applies solely to individuals, Chapter 12 \ncan\n\n[[Page S3135]]\n\napply to individuals, partnerships or corporations which fall under a \n$1.5 million debt threshold--a recognition of the common use of \nincorporation even among small family held farms.\n  Without getting too technical, I should also mention that Chapter 12 \nalso contains significant advantages over corporate reorganization \nwhich is governed by Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. For example, \nChapter 12 creditors generally may not challenge a payment plan that is \napproved by the Court.\n\n  Chapter 12 has been considered an enormous success in the farm \ncommunity. According to a recent University of Iowa study, 74 percent \nof family farmers who filed Chapter 12 bankruptcy are still farming, \nand 61 percent of farmers who went through Chapter 12 believe that \nChapter 12 was helpful in getting them back on their feet.\n  Recognizing its effectiveness, my bill proposes that Chapter 12 \nshould be made a permanent part of the bankruptcy code, and equally \nimportant, my bill would extend Chapter 12's protections to family \nfishermen.\n  In my own state of Maine, fishing is a vital part of our economy and \nour way of life. The commercial fishing industry is made up of proud \nand fiercely independent individuals whose goal is simply to preserve \ntheir business, family income and community.\n  In my opinion, for too long the fishing industry has been treated \nlike an oddity, rather than a business through which courses the life's \nblood of families and communities. This bill attempts to bridge that \ngap and afford fishermen the protection of business reorganization as \nit is provided to family farmers.\n  There are many similarities between the family farmer and the family \nfisherman. Like the family farmer, the fisherman should not only be \nrespected as a businessman, but for his or her independence in the best \ntradition of our democracy. Like farmers, fishermen face perennial \nthreats from nature and the elements, as well as changes to laws which \nthreaten their existence. Like family farmers, fishermen are not \nseeking special treatment or a hand-out from the federal government, \nthey seek only ``the fighting chance'' to remain afloat so that they \ncan continue in their way of life.\n  Although fishermen do not seek special treatment from the government, \nthey play a special role in seafaring communities on our coasts, and \nthey deserve protections granted others who face similar, often \nunavoidable, problems. Fishermen should not be denied the bankruptcy \nprotections accorded to farmers solely because they harvest the sea and \nnot the land.\n  I have proposed not only to make Chapter 12 a permanent part of the \nbankruptcy code, but also to apply its provisions to the family \nfisherman. The bill I have proposed mirrors Chapter 12 with very few \nexceptions. Its protections are restricted to those fishermen with \nregular income who have total debt less than $1.5 Million, the bulk of \nwhich, eighty percent, must stem from commercial fishing. Moreover, \nfamilies must rely on fishing income for these provisions to apply.\n  Those same protections and flexibility we grant to farmers should \nalso be granted to the family fisherman. By making this modest but \nimportant change to the bankruptcy code, we will express our respect \nfor the business of fishing, and our shared wish that this unique way \nof life should continue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 685. A bill to preserve the authority of States over water within \ntheir boundaries, to delegate to States the authority of Congress to \nregulate water, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n               the state water sovereignty protection act\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the State Water \nSovereignty Protection Act, a bill to preserve the authority of the \nStates over waters within their boundaries, to delegate the authority \nof the Congress to the States to regulate water, and for other \npurposes.\n  Since 1866, Congress has recognized and deferred to the States the \nauthority to allocate and administer water within their borders. The \nSupreme Court has confirmed that this is an appropriate role for the \nStates. Additionally, in 1952, the Congress passed the McCarran \namendment which provides for the adjudication of State and Federal \nWater claims in State water courts.\n  However, despite both judicial and legislative edicts, I am deeply \nconcerned that the administration, Federal agencies, and some in the \nCongress are setting the stage for ignoring long established statutory \nprovisions concerning State water rights and State water contracts. The \nEndangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, the Federal Land Policy \nManagement Act, and wilderness designations have all been vehicles used \nto erode State sovereignty over its water.\n  It is imperative that States maintain sovereignty over management and \ncontrol of their water and river systems. All rights to water or \nreservations of rights for any purposes in States should be subject to \nthe substantive and procedural laws of that State, not the Federal \nGovernment. To protect State water rights, I am introducing the State \nWater Sovereignty Protection Act.\n  The State Water Sovereignty Protection Act provides that whenever the \nUnited States seeks to appropriate water or acquire a water right, it \nwill be subject to State procedural and substantive water law. The Act \nfurther holds that States control the water within their boundaries and \nthat the Federal Government may exercise management or control over \nwater only in compliance with State law. Finally, in any administrative \nor judicial proceeding in which the United States participates pursuant \nto the McCarran Amendment, the United States is subject to all costs \nand fees to the same extent as costs and fees may be imposed on a \nprivate party.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Reed, \n        Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 686. A bill to regulate interstate commerce by providing a Federal \ncause of action against firearms manufactures, dealers, and importers \nfor the harm resulting from gun violence; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n        the firearms rights, responsibilities, and remedies act\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprotect the rights and interests of local communities in suing the gun \nindustry. I am joined in this effort by Senators Chafee, Lautenberg, \nReed, Schumer, and Torricelli.\n  Frankly, I would prefer not to have to introduce legislation at all. \nBut, it has become necessary because the gun industry has begun a \nconcerted campaign to gag America's cities. In order to preserve local \ncontrol and options, federal legislation is needed. The federal \ngovernment must stand alongside our local communities to fight the gun \nviolence plaguing too many of America's cities.\n  So far, five cities--New Orleans, Atlanta, Chicago, Miami-Dade \nCounty, and Bridgeport, Connecticut--have filed lawsuits against the \ngun industry. Many more are considering such lawsuits, including, in my \nState of California, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Sacramento. These \ncities are suing because they are being invaded by guns.\n  Consider the city of Chicago. Chicago has one of the toughest handgun \ncontrol ordinances in the country. And yet, this year, the Chicago \npolice will confiscate some 17,000 illegal weapons. City officials \nacknowledge that's only a fraction of the guns on the streets. And \nthere are now 242 million guns in America. That's almost one for every \nman, woman, and child in this country.\n  The result is that each year, guns cause the death of about 35,000 \nAmericans. The number of handgun murders in this country far outpaces \nthat of any other country--indeed, most other countries combined. Japan \nand Great Britain have fewer than one murder by a handgun per one \nmillion population. Canada has about three and a half per million \npeople. But in the United States, there are over 35 handgun murders per \nyear for every million people.\n  In my state of California alone, there are five times as many handgun \nmurders as there are in New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Great Britain, \nCanada, and Germany combined. Yet those six countries together have ten \ntimes the population of California.\n\n[[Page S3136]]\n\n  Over 11 years, nearly 400,000 Americans have been killed by gunfire. \nCompare that with the 11 years of the Vietnam War, where over 58,000 \nAmericans died.\n  If this continues, the Centers for Disease Control estimates that in \njust four years, gun deaths will be the leading cause of injury-related \ndeath in America.\n  And for every American who dies, another three are injured and end up \nin an emergency room. The cost to our health care system is estimated \nto be between $1.5 billion and $4.5 billion per year. And 4 out of \nevery 5 gunshot victims either have no health insurance or are on \npublic assistance. U.S. News reported that one hospital in California--\nthe University of California-Davis Medical Center--lost $2.2 million \nover three years on gunshot victims. That means you and I and all \ntaxpayers are paying the bills.\n  That is why many cities want to sue. But, the NRA does not want to \nfight this in court. The gun industry wants to circumvent the legal \nprocess through special interest legislation--legislation imposed on \nour cities by big government.\n  To preserve local control and individual rights, federal legislation \nis needed. Today, I am introducing such legislation, known as the \nFirearms Rights, Responsibilities, and Remedies Act. This bill would \nensure that individuals and entities harmed by gun violence--including \nour cities--have the right to sue gun manufacturers, dealers, and \nimporters.\n  Specifically, my bill would create a federal cause of action--the \nright to sue--for harms resulting from gun violence. A gun \nmanufacturer, dealer, or importer could be held liable if it ``knew or \nreasonably should have known'' that its design, manufacturing, \nmarketing, importation, sales, or distribution practices would likely \nresult in gun violence. But, this is not an open-ended proposition. The \nterm ``gun violence'' is defined specifically as the unlawful use of a \nfirearm or the unintentional discharge of a firearm. It would not be \npossible to sue for every gun sold--or even for all violence and deaths \nthat result. A suit would only be possible if there is some negligence \non the part of a manufacturer, dealer, or importer. I believe this \nlanguage is broad enough to allow cities to pursue their claims, but \nnot so broad as to open the floodgates for every gun-related death and \ninjury.\n  Suits could be brought in federal or state court by States, units of \nlocal government--such as cities, towns, and counties--individuals, \norganizations, and businesses who were injured by or incurred costs \nbecause of gun violence. A prevailing plaintiff could recover actual \ndamages, punitive damages, and attorneys fees.\n  I am not saying that the gun industry should be required to pay any \nparticular amount of damages, and I am not advocating any particular \ntheory that would hold the gun industry liable. What I am saying is \nthat the gun industry should not be exempt from the normal course of \nbusiness in America. The right to redress grievances in court is older \nthan America itself--older than the Second Amendment to the \nConstitution. But the NRA is now pushing legislation in many states and \nhere in Congress to say that the gun industry should get special rights \nand special protections. I believe that the gun industry should be \ntreated like everyone else, and I believe that our cities should have \ntheir day in court.\n  My bill does not impose anything. It does not require anything. It is \ndesigned for one purpose: to preserve local control. As Jim Hahn, the \nCity Attorney of Los Angeles, noted in a letter to me endorsing my \nbill, what many States are considering would ``represent a significant \nintrusion in to the authority of local governments.'' And my bill \nwould, in the words of Alex Penelas, the Mayor of Miami-Dade County, \n``preserve access to the courts for local governments and individual \ncitizens.''\n  Now, Mr. President, there have been questions raised about the \nconstitutionality of this measure. It was not easy drafting a \nconstitutional measure, but in working with Kathleen Sullivan, the Dean \nof Stanford Law School, and Larry Tribe of Harvard, I believe we have a \nbill that is constitutional.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me just note a bit of irony in this whole \ndebate. Some of the legislation that the NRA has worked so hard to \ndefeat over the years--such as mandatory safety locks, smart \ntechnology, and product safety legislation--is the basis of some of \nthese suits by the cities. If the NRA had let us pass such laws, they \nwouldn't be facing so many lawsuits today. The NRA and the gun industry \ndo not want to be regulated and then they do not want to be held \naccountable. The NRA and the gun industry want to escape their \nresponsibilities for what they are doing to America's cities--and all \ntoo often, to America's children.\n  I sometimes wonder if N-R-A stands for ``No Responsibility or \nAccountability.''\n  It has been said that some Americans have a love affair with guns. \nBut we should not stand idly by when that love affair turns violent. \nToday we stand with America's cities to say enough is enough.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill and the letters from Mr. Hahn--\nas well as other letters of support from the City Attorney of San \nFrancisco, the Mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut, a letter from Ms. \nSullivan and Handgun Control--be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 686\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Firearms Rights, \n     Responsibilities, and Remedies Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the manufacture, distribution, and importation of \n     firearms is inherently commercial in nature;\n       (2) firearms regularly move in interstate commerce;\n       (3) firearms trafficking is so prevalent and widespread in \n     and among the States that it is usually impossible to \n     distinguish between intrastate trafficking and interstate \n     trafficking;\n       (4) to the extent firearms trafficking is intrastate in \n     nature, it arises out of and is substantially connected with \n     a commercial transaction, which, when viewed in the \n     aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce;\n       (5) gun violence results in great costs to society, \n     including the costs of law enforcement, medical care, lost \n     productivity, and loss of life;\n       (6) to the extent possible, the costs of gun violence \n     should be borne by those liable for them, including \n     manufacturers, dealers, and importers;\n       (7) in any action to recover the costs associated with gun \n     violence to a particular entity or to a given community, it \n     is usually impossible to trace the portion of costs \n     attributable to intrastate versus interstate commerce;\n       (8) the law governing the liability of manufacturers, \n     dealers, and importers for gun violence is evolving \n     inconsistently within and among the States, resulting in a \n     contradictory and uncertain regime that is inequitable and \n     that unduly burdens interstate commerce;\n       (9) the inability to obtain adequate compensation for the \n     costs of gun violence results in a serious commercial \n     distortion to a single national market and a stable national \n     economy, thereby creating a barrier to interstate commerce;\n       (10) it is an essential and appropriate role of the Federal \n     Government, under the Constitution of the United States, to \n     remove burdens and barriers to interstate commerce;\n       (11) because the intrastate and interstate trafficking of \n     firearms are so commingled, full regulation of interstate \n     commerce requires the incidental regulation of intrastate \n     commerce; and\n       (12) it is in the national interest and within the role of \n     the Federal Government to ensure that manufacturers, dealers, \n     and importers can be held liable under Federal law for gun \n     violence.\n       (b) Purpose.--Based on the power of Congress in clause 3 of \n     section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United \n     States, the purpose of this Act is to regulate interstate \n     commerce by--\n       (1) regulating the commercial activity of firearms \n     trafficking;\n       (2) protecting States, units of local government, \n     organizations, businesses, and other persons from the adverse \n     effects of interstate commerce in firearms;\n       (3) establishing a uniform legal principle that \n     manufacturers, dealers, and importers can be held liable for \n     gun violence; and\n       (4) creating greater fairness, rationality, and \n     predictability in the civil justice system.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Gun violence.--The term ``gun violence'' means any--\n       (A) actual or threatened unlawful use of a firearm; and\n       (B) unintentional discharge of a firearm.\n\n[[Page S3137]]\n\n       (2) Incorporated definitions.--The terms ``firearm'', \n     ``importer'', ``manufacturer'', and ``dealer'' have the \n     meanings given those terms in section 921 of title 18, United \n     States Code.\n       (3) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several \n     States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, \n     American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands.\n       (4) Unit of local government.--The term ``unit of local \n     government'' means any city, town, township, county, parish, \n     village, or other general purpose political subdivision of a \n     State.\n\n     SEC. 4. FEDERAL CAUSE OF ACTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     Federal, State, or local law, a State, unit of local \n     government, organization, business, or other person that has \n     been injured by or incurred costs as a result of gun violence \n     may bring a civil action in a Federal or State court of \n     original jurisdiction against a manufacturer, dealer, or \n     importer who knew or reasonably should have known that its \n     design, manufacturing, marketing, importation, sales, or \n     distribution practices would likely result in gun violence.\n       (b) Remedies.--In an action under subsection (a), the court \n     may award appropriate relief, including--\n       (1) actual damages;\n       (2) punitive damages;\n       (3) reasonable attorneys' fees and other litigation costs \n     reasonably incurred, including the costs of expert witnesses; \n     and\n       (4) such other relief as the court determines to be \n     appropriate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          City of Los Angeles,\n\n                                                   March 22, 1999.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Barbara: I write to express my strong support for the \n     Firearms Rights, Responsibilities, and Remedies Act which \n     will assure the ability of local governments to sue the gun \n     industry by creating a federal cause of action for claims \n     brought against the gun industry. In so doing, the act is \n     critical to the goal of making the gun industry accountable \n     for the toll of gun violence on cities nationwide.\n       The City of Los Angeles is exploring litigation against the \n     gun industry in order to recoup the City's costs in \n     addressing gun violence. Therefore, any attempt on the state \n     level to preclude local gun lawsuits would subvert cities and \n     counties' efforts in this regard and would also represent a \n     significant intrusion in to the authority of local \n     governments. The creation of a federal cause of action is \n     invaluable to guaranteeing that litigation remains available \n     to cities and counties.\n       The Firearms Rights, Responsibilities, and Remedies Act \n     represents a common-sense and reasonable approach to any \n     attempt to bar gun lawsuits by cities and counties. I am \n     pleased to offer my support for this important legislation.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                    James K. Hahn,\n     City Attorney.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Office of the Mayor,\n\n                            Miami-Dade County, FL, March 23, 1999.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: Thank you for your invitation to join \n     you today in Washington, DC, as you announce legislation \n     which will assist local governments, like Miami-Dade County, \n     on our legal efforts to compel the gun industry to \n     manufacture childproof guns. I regret that I am unable to \n     join you personally to offer my support and gratitude for \n     your efforts. Unfortunately, County business requires me to \n     be in our State Capitol today.\n       On January 21, 1999, Miami-Dade County filed a lawsuit \n     against the gun industry seeking to compel gun manufacturers \n     to make safer, childproof guns. To achieve our objective we \n     are hitting the gun industry where it hurts--in their \n     wallets. Every year, gun violence and accidental deaths costs \n     our community hundreds of millions of dollars. Until now, \n     taxpayers have borne the responsibility for many of these \n     costs while the gun industry has washed its hands of the \n     blood of countless victims, including many children and \n     youths. However, our efforts are not about money. In fact, if \n     the gun industry agrees to make childproof guns, install load \n     indicators on guns and change its marketing practices my \n     community will crop its lawsuit.\n       As you know, legislation has been filed in the Florida \n     Legislature that would not only preempt Miami-Dade County's \n     lawsuit, but would also make it a felony for any public \n     official to pursue such litigation. This NRA sponsored \n     legislation is undemocratic and hypocritical. If passed, \n     preemption legislation will effectively slam shut the doors \n     of justice and trample on the People's right to access the \n     judiciary in the name of defending the Second Amendment. \n     Additionally, while some Tallahassee and Washington \n     legislators claim to favor returning power to local \n     governments, they are the first to support legislation which \n     takes away our right to access an independent branch of \n     government.\n       Clearly, the gun lobby is out of touch with the will of the \n     people. Flordia voters, like Americans nationwide, have \n     repeatedly sent a strong message that they favor commonsense \n     gun safety measures. For example:\n       In 1991, Florida voters overwhelmingly supported requiring \n     criminal background checks and waiting periods on gun sales;\n       Last November, 72% of Floridians voted to close the Gunshow \n     Loophole, by extending criminal background check and waiting \n     period requirements to gunshows and flea markets;\n       Just last month a New York jury found the gun industry \n     civilly liable for saturating the market with guns.\n       Unfortunately, our prospects for success in defeating this \n     misguided state legislation are dim. However, I am confident \n     that the pressure on the gun industry to reform increase with \n     each passing day. Your legislation will add additional \n     pressure by sending a message to the gun lobby that they \n     cannot block access to the courts by strong-arming state \n     legislatures.\n       If successful, your legislation will preserve access to the \n     courts for local governments and individual citizens who are \n     demanding that the gun industry be held accountable for \n     callously favoring corporate profits over our children's \n     safety. I commend you for putting the public's interest ahead \n     of the powerful special interests that seek only to protect a \n     negligent industry that has ignored commonsense pleas to make \n     childproof guns. Be assured I stand ready to assist you in \n     advancing this significant legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alex Penelas,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Office of the City Attorney,\n\n                                San Francisco, CA, March 22, 1999.\n     Re: Proposed legislation\n\n     Senator Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I write to endorse your proposed \n     legislation that will allow local governments to sue gun \n     manufacturers, dealers, and importers. Each year in San \n     Francisco we admit numerous gunshot victims to our hospitals \n     with staggering costs to the general public. Sadly enough, \n     all too often these victims are children and young people. \n     The gun industry must be held responsible for its role in the \n     emotional and financial distress caused to anyone affected by \n     gun violence--including local government.\n       Your legislation would ensure that the normal legal \n     processes can be brought to bear upon a significant public \n     problem and that the gun industry would not be exempt from \n     the usual course of business in America. For these reasons, I \n     support your proposed legislation and commend you for your \n     ongoing efforts to stand with America's cities and its \n     people.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Louise H. Renne,\n     City Attorney.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Bridgeport City Hall,\n\n\n                                        Mayor Joseph P. Ganim,\n\n                                   Bridgeport, CT, March 23, 1999.\n\n                     Ganim Supports Boxer Gun Bill\n\n     The following is Bridgeport Mayor Joseph P. Ganim's statement \n         of support for Sen. Barbara Boxer's proposed federal \n         legislation:\n\n       I am in full support of the legislation drafted by Sen. \n     Boxer to allow people, groups or governments to exercise \n     their constitutional rights to seek redress through the \n     courts, I regret that I am not able to be in Washington as \n     the Senator makes this important announcement.\n       Bridgeport is one of five cities across the nation to file \n     a lawsuit against handgun manufacturers. We are seeking \n     damages to help lessen the financial burden Bridgeport must \n     carry due to the effects of gun violence in our City.\n       A handgun is the most dangerous weapon placed into the \n     stream of commerce in the United States. Surprisingly, there \n     are more safety requirements and regulations regarding the \n     manufacture of toy guns than for real handguns.\n       Sen. Boxer's bill will allow cities, states and individuals \n     to seek retribution for the economic strain that handgun \n     violence has caused. We are facing high medical and public \n     safety costs, but we are also battling drops in property \n     value in areas where handgun violence is most prevalent.\n       Because of measures taken by the Georgia State Legislature \n     and attempts by Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia in the U.S. \n     Congress, Sen. Boxer's bill becomes even more critical and \n     its passage even more important. This bill ensures that \n     everyone will have the right to fight back and hold the gun \n     manufacturers accountable for the damage their products have \n     caused.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Stanford Law School,\n\n                                     Stanford, CA, March 23, 1999.\n     Senator Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: You have asked me to review a draft of \n     a bill to enact the Firearms Rights, Responsibilities, and \n     Remedies Act of 1999, and to comment briefly upon its \n     constitutionality. I am happy to do so, with the caveat that \n     I am not in a position to comment upon the bill as a matter \n     of tort or product liability policy.\n       The bill appears to me to be within the authority of \n     Congress to enact under the interstate commerce power set \n     forth in the United States constitution, Article I, section \n     8. While the commerce power is not an unlimited one, Congress \n     is empowered to regulate both the flow of interstate commerce\n\n[[Page S3138]]\n\n     and any intrastate activity that substantially affects \n     interstate commerce. United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 \n     (1995). While one might fairly question whether any incident \n     of gun violence in and of itself constitutes an activity \n     substantially affecting interstate commerce, the bill does \n     not regulate gun violence but rather provides a federal cause \n     of action against the negligent ``design, manufacturing, \n     marketing, importation, sales, or distribution'' of guns. \n     Sec. 4(a). The ``design, manufacturing, marketing, \n     importation, sales, or distribution'' of guns plainly amounts \n     to economic activity that in the aggregate may in Congress's \n     reasonable judgment substantially affect interstate commerce. \n     Moreover, providing a uniform federal avenue of redress for \n     gun violence may in Congress's reasonable judgment help to \n     avert the diversion and distortion of interstate commerce \n     that, in the aggregate, accompanies any patchwork of separate \n     state regulations of firearm sales. Congress is entitled to \n     consider the interstate efforts of commercial gun \n     distribution in the aggregate without regard to whether any \n     particular gun sale that might be the subject of a civil \n     action is interstate or intrastate in nature. See, e.g., \n     Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942) (regulation of home-\n     grown wheat consumption); Perez, v. United States, 402 U.S. \n     146 (1971) (regulation of extortionate intrastate loan \n     transactions).\n       Nor does the bill appear to intrude upon state sovereignty \n     or the structural principles of federalism that are reflected \n     in the United States Constitution, Amendment X. To be sure, \n     one effect of the bill if enacted would be to allow cities or \n     other local governments to sue for damages incurred as a \n     result of gun violence, even if they are located in states \n     that had sought, through state legislation, to bar such city-\n     initiated lawsuits. But Congress remains free even within our \n     federal system to regulate state and local governments under \n     laws of general applicability, see Garcia v. San Antonio \n     Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U.S. 528 (1985), and the \n     proposed bill does just that. Rather than singling out state \n     or city governments for special advantage or disadvantage, \n     the bill simply confers upon states and cities the same civil \n     litigation rights as it does upon any other ``organization, \n     business, or other person that has been injured by or \n     incurred costs as a result of gun violence.'' Sec. 4(a). \n     Moreover, the proposed bill does not in any way \n     ``commandeer'' the legislative or executive processes of \n     state government in a way that might offend principles of \n     federalism. See Printz v. United States, 117 S. Ct. 2365 \n     (1997); New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992). It \n     does not require that any state adopt any federally authored \n     law, but instead simply provides federal rights directly to \n     individuals and entitites including but not limited to states \n     and cities. To the extent that the proposed bill would permit \n     civil actions to be brought in state as well as federal \n     forums, it is entirely consistent with Congress's \n     longstanding power to pass laws enforceable in state courts, \n     see Testa v. Katt, 330 U.S. 386 (1947), a power that neither \n     the Printz nor New York cases purported to disturb.\n       I hope these brief remarks are helpful in your \n     deliberations.\n           Very Truly yours,\n     Kathleen M. Sullivan.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Handgun Control Inc.,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 1999.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: On behalf of Handgun Control, I want to \n     commend you for your continued leadership on gun violence \n     prevention issues and to lend our support to the Frearms \n     Rights, Responsibilities and Remedies Act of 1999.\n       Access to the courts is one of the most fundamental rights \n     accorded our citizens and our communities. The legislation \n     that is being introduced today will protect the right of \n     cities and counties to seek redress in the courts for the gun \n     violence that afflicts so many communities. Cities, like the \n     citizens they represent, should be able to seek compensation \n     for the damages that arise from the negligence or misconduct \n     of the gun industry in the design, manufacture, sale and \n     distribution of their product.\n       The gun lobby, of course, believes that manufacturers \n     deserve special protection, that cities and counties should \n     be legally prohibited from suing manufacturers so long as \n     they don't knowingly and directly sell guns to convicted \n     felons and other prohibited purchasers. Such a grant of \n     immunity is not only unprecedented, it is wrong. The \n     manufacture of firearms is not subject to consumer \n     regulation. In fact, the Consumer Product Safety Commission \n     is prohibited by law from overseeing the manufacture of guns. \n     As an unregulated industry, gun manufacturers produce guns \n     that all too often discharge when they are dropped. They \n     design guns with a trigger resistance so low that a two-year \n     old child can pull the trigger. Many guns lack essential \n     safety features like a safety, a load indicator or a magazine \n     disconnect safety. And, even though the technology for making \n     guns unusable by children and strangers is readily available, \n     virtually all guns are readily usable by unauthorized users. \n     Time and time again, the gun industry has ignored legitimate \n     concerns regarding consumer and public safety.\n       But, at the urgent request of the gun lobby, one state has \n     already moved to prevent cities from filing complaints \n     against gun manufacturers and similar bills have been \n     introduced in at least ten states. A bill has even been \n     introduced in Congress that would bar cities from filing any \n     such action. Congress should move to ensure that the right of \n     cities to seek redress in the courts will be preserved. The \n     Firearms Rights, Responsibilities and Remedies Act of 1999 \n     will do just that.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Sarah Brady,\n                                                            Chair.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 687. A bill to direct the Secretary of Defense to eliminate the \nbacklog in satisfying requests of former members of the Armed Forces \nfor the issuance or replacement of military medals and decorations; to \nthe Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n    Eliminating the Backlog of Veterans Requests for Military Medals\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to take some time to address \nan unfulfilled obligation we have to our nation's veterans. The problem \nis a substantial backlog of requests by veterans for replacement and \nissuance of military medals. Today, I have introduced a bill, the \n``Veterans Expedited Military Medals Act of 1999,'' that would require \nthe Department of Defense to end this backlog.\n  I first became aware of this issue a few years ago after dozens of \nIowa veterans began contacting my State offices requesting assistance \nin obtaining medals and other military decorations they earned while \nserving the country. These veterans had tried in vain--usually for \nmonths, sometimes for years--to navigate the vast Pentagon bureaucracy \nto receive their military decorations. The wait for medals routinely \nexceeded more than a year, even after intervention by my staff. I \nbelieve this is unacceptable. Our nation must continue its commitment \nto recognize the sacrifices made by our veterans in a timely manner. \nAddressing this simple concern will fulfill an important and solemn \npromise to those who served to preserve democracy both here and abroad.\n  Let me briefly share the story of Mr. Dale Homes, a Korean War \nveteran. Mr. Holmes fired a mortar on the front lines of the Korean \nWar. Stacy Groff, the daughter of Mr. Holmes, tried unsuccessfully for \nthree years through the normal Department of Defense channels to get \nthe medals her father deserved. Ms. Goff turned to me after her letter \nwriting produced no results. My office began an inquiry in January of \n1997 and we were not able to resolve the issue favorably until \nSeptember 1997.\n  Ms. Groff made a statement about the delays her father experienced \nthat sum up my sentiments perfectly: ``I don't think it's fair. . .My \ndad deserves --everybody deserves--better treatment than that.'' Ms. \nGroff could not be more correct. Our veterans deserve better than that \nfrom the country they served so courageously.\n  Another example that came through my district offices is Mr. James \nLunde, a Vietnam-era veteran. His brother in law contacted my Des \nMoines office last year for help in obtaining a Purple Heart and other \nmedals Mr. Lunde earned. These medals have been held up since 1975. \nUnfortunately, there is still no determination as to when Mr. Lunde's \nmedals will be sent.\n  The numbers are disheartening and can sound almost unbelievable. For \nexample, a small Army Reserve staff at the St. Louis Office faces a \nbacklog of tens of thousands of requests for medals. So why the lengthy \ndelays?\n  The primary reason DOD officials cite for these unconscionable delays \nis personnel and other resource shortages resulting from budget cuts \nand hiring freezes. For example, the Navy Liaison Office has gone from \n5 or more personnel to 3 within the last 3 years. Prior to this, the \nturnaround time was 4-5 months. Budget shortages have delayed the \nagencies ability to replace employees who have left, and in cases where \nthey can be replaced, the ``learning curve'' in training new employees \nleads to further delays.\n  Last year, during the debate over the Defense Appropriations bill, I \noffered an amendment to move the Department of Defense to end the \nbacklog of unfulfilled military medal requests. The amendment was \naccepted by unanimous consent. Unfortunately, the Pentagon has not \nmoved to fix the problem. In fact, according to a recent communication \nfrom the Army, the problem has only worsened. The Army currently cites \na backlog of 98,000 requests for medals.\n\n[[Page S3139]]\n\n  So today, I am introducing a bill to fix the problem once and for \nall. My bill directs the Secretary of Defense to allocate resources \nnecessary to eliminate the backlog of requests for military medals. \nSpecifically, the Secretary of Defense shall make available to the Army \nReserve Personnel Command, the Bureau of Naval Personnel, the Air Force \nPersonnel Center, the National Archives and Records Administration, and \nany other relevant office or command, the resources necessary to solve \nthe problem. These resources could be in the form of increased \npersonnel, equipment or whatever these offices need for this problem. \nIn addition, this reallocation of resources is only to be made in a way \nthat ``does not detract from the performance of other personnel service \nand personnel support activities within the DOD.'' Representative Lane \nEvans of Illinois has introduced similar legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Veterans organizations have long recognized the huge backlog of medal \nrequests. The Veterans of Foreign Wars supports my legislation. I ask \nthat a copy of the letter of support be included in the record.\n  Our veterans are not asking for much. Their brave actions in time of \nwar deserve our highest respect, recognition, and admiration. My \namendment will help expedite the recognition they so richly deserve. \nOur veterans deserve nothing less.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter in support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 687\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Expedited Military \n     Medals Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ELIMINATION OF BACKLOG IN REQUESTS FOR REPLACEMENT OF \n                   MILITARY MEDALS AND OTHER DECORATIONS.\n\n       (a) Sufficient Resourcing Required.--The Secretary of \n     Defense shall make available funds and other resources at the \n     levels that are necessary for ensuring the elimination of the \n     backlog of the unsatisfied requests made to the Department of \n     Defense for the issuance or replacement of military \n     decorations for former members of the Armed Forces. The \n     organizations to which the necessary funds and other \n     resources are to be made available for that purpose are as \n     follows:\n       (1) The Army Reserve Personnel Command.\n       (2) The Bureau of Naval Personnel.\n       (3) The Air Force Personnel Center.\n       (4) The National Archives and Records Administration\n       (b) Condition.--The Secretary shall allocate funds and \n     other resources under subsection (a) in a manner that does \n     not detract from the performance of other personnel service \n     and personnel support activities within the Department of \n     Defense.\n       (c) Replacement Decoration Defined.--For the purposes of \n     this section, the term ``decoration'' means a medal or other \n     decoration that a former member of the Armed Forces was \n     awarded by the United States for military service of the \n     United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPORT.\n\n       Not later than 45 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a \n     report on the status of the backlog described in section \n     2(a).

Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the 2.1 million members \n     of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (VFW), I \n     thank you for introducing a bill to eliminate the backlog in \n     requests for the replacement of military medals and other \n     decorations. This bill would address an unfilled obligation \n     we have to our nation's veterans. The VFW realizes that the \n     substantial backlog of requests by veterans for medals needs \n     to be rectified in an auspicious manner.\n       If passed, the Secretary of Defense will make available to \n     the Army Reserve Personnel Command, the Bureau of Naval \n     Personnel, the Air Force Personnel Center, the National \n     Archives and Records Administration, and any other relevant \n     office or command, the resources necessary to resolve the \n     problem. The VFW believes that addressing this concern will \n     fulfill an important and solemn promise to those who risked \n     their lives serving their country.\n       The VFW thanks you for making veterans a number one \n     priority. They deserve the best from the country they served \n     so courageously.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Dennis Cullinan,\n                           Director, National Legislative Service.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Murkowski, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Kerry, and \n        Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 690. A bill to provide for mass transportation in national parks \nand related public lands; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                      transit in parks (trip) act\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \nentitled the ``Transit in Parks Act'' or TRIP, to help ease the \ncongestion, protect our nation's natural resources, and improve \nmobility and accessibility in our National Parks and Wildlife Refuges. \nI am pleased to be joined by Senators Reid, Murkowski, Boxer, Kennedy, \nMoynihan, Schumer, Kerry, and Murray who are cosponsors of this \nimportant legislation.\n  The TRIP legislation is a new federal transit grant initiative that \nis designed to provide mass transit and alternative transportation \nservices for our national parks, our wildlife refuges, federal \nrecreational areas, and other public lands managed by three agencies of \nthe Department of the Interior. I first introduced similar legislation \non Earth Day, 1998 and, during consideration of the Transportation \nEquity Act for the 21st Century, or TEA-21, part of my original bill \nwas included as section 3039, authorizing a comprehensive study of \nalternative transportation needs in our national park lands. The \nobjective of this study is to better identify those areas with existing \nand potential problems of congestion and pollution, or which can \nbenefit from mass transportation services, and to identify and estimate \nthe project costs for these sites. The fiscal year 1999 Transportation \nAppropriations bill included $2 million to help fund this important \nstudy. I am pleased to report that much important research that will \nmore fully examine the park transportation and resource management \nneeds and outline potential solutions and benefits is underway.\n  Before discussing the bill in greater detail, let me first provide \nsome background on the management issues facing the National Park \nSystem.\n  When the national parks first opened in the second half of the \nnineteenth century, visitors arrived by stagecoach along dirt roads. \nTravel through parklands, such as Yosemite or Yellowstone, was \ndifficult and long and costly. Not many people could afford or endure \nsuch a trip. The introduction of the automobile gave every American \ngreater mobility and freedom, which included the freedom to travel and \nsee some of our nation's great natural wonders. Early in this century, \nlandscape architects from the National Park Service and highway \nengineers from the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads collaborated to produce \nmany feats of road engineering that opened the national park lands to \nmillions of Americans.\n  Yet greater mobility and easier access now threaten the very \nenvironments that the National Park Service is mandated to protect. The \nongoing tension between preservation and access has always been a \nchallenge for our national park system. Today, record numbers of \nvisitors and cars has resulted in increasing damage to our parks. The \nGrand Canyon alone has five million visitors a year. It may surprise \nyou to know that the average visitor stay is only three hours. As many \nas 6,000 vehicles arrive in a single summer day. They compete for 2,000 \nparking spaces. Between 32,000 and 35,000 tour buses go to the park \neach year. During the peak summer season, the entrance route becomes a \ngiant parking lot.\n  In the decade from 1984 to 1994, the number of visits to America's \nnational parks increased 25 percent, rising from 208 million to 269 \nmillion a year. This is equal to more than one visit by every man, \nwoman, and child in this country. This has created an overwhelming \ndemand on these areas, resulting in severe traffic congestion, visitor \nrestrictions, and in some instances vacationers being shut-out of the \nparks altogether. The environmental damage at the Grand Canyon is \nvisible at many other parks: Yosemite, which has more than four million \nvisitors a year; Yellowstone, which has more than three million \nvisitors a year\n\n[[Page S3140]]\n\nand experiences such severe traffic congestion that access has to be \nrestricted; Zion; Acadia; Bryce; and many others. We need to solve \nthese problems now or risk permanent damage to our nation's natural, \ncultural, and historical heritage.\n  My legislation builds upon two previous initiatives to address these \nproblems. First is the study of alternative transportation strategies \nin our national parks that was mandated by the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act of 1991, ISTEA. This study, completed by \nthe National Park Service nearly five years ago in May 1994, found that \nmany of our most heavily visited national parks are experiencing the \nsame problems of congestion and pollution that afflict our cities and \nmetropolitan areas. Yet, overwhelmingly, the principal transportation \nsystems that the Federal Government has developed to provide access \ninto our national parks are roads primarily for private automobile \naccess.\n  Second, in November 1997, Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater \nand Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt signed an agreement to work \ntogether to address transportation and resource management needs in and \naround national parks. The findings in the Memorandum of Understanding \nentered into by the two departments are especially revealing:\n\n       Congestion in and approaching many National Parks is \n     causing lengthy traffic delays and backups that substantially \n     detract from the visitor experience. Visitors find that many \n     of the National Parks contain significant noise and air \n     pollution, and traffic congestion similar to that found on \n     the city streets they left behind.\n       In many National Park units, the capacity of parking \n     facilities at interpretive or science areas is well below \n     demand. As a result, visitors park along roadsides, damaging \n     park resources and subjecting people to hazardous safety \n     conditions as they walk near busy roads to access visitor use \n     areas.\n       On occasion, National Park units must close their gates \n     during high visitation periods and turn away the public \n     because the existing infrastructure and transportation \n     systems are at, or beyond, the capacity for which they were \n     designed.\n\n  The challenge for park management is twofold: to conserve and protect \nthe nation's natural, historical, and cultural resources, while at the \nsame time ensuring visitor access and enjoyment of these sensitive \nenvironments.\n  The Transit in Parks Act will go far to meeting this challenge. The \nbill's objectives are to develop new and expanded mass transit services \nthroughout the national parks and other public lands to conserve and \nprotect fragile natural, cultural, and historical resources, to prevent \nadverse impact on those resources, and to reduce pollution and \ncongestion, while at the same time facilitating appropriate visitor \naccess and improving the visitor experience. This new federal transit \ngrant program will provide funding to three Federal land management \nagencies in the Department of the Interior--the National Park Service, \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management--\nthat manage the 378 various parks within the National Park System, \nincluding National Battlefields, Monuments and National Seashores, as \nwell as the National Wildlife Refuges and federal recreational areas. \nThe program will allocate capital funds for transit projects, including \nrail or clean fuel bus projects, joint development activities, \npedestrian and bike paths, or park waterway access, within or adjacent \nto national park lands. The bill authorizes $50 million for this new \nprogram for each of the fiscal years 2000 through 2003. It is \nanticipated that other resources--both public and private--will be \navailable to augment these amounts in the initial phase.\n  The bill formalizes the cooperative arrangement in the 1997 MOU \nbetween the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of the \nInterior to exchange technical assistance and to develop procedures \nrelating to the planning, selection and funding of transit projects in \nnational park lands. The projects eligible for funding would be \ndeveloped through the TEA-21 planning process and selected in \nconsultation and cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior. The \nbill provides funds for planning, research, and technical assistance \nthat can supplement other financial resources available to the Federal \nland management agencies. It is anticipated that the Secretary of \nTransportation would select projects that are diverse in location and \nsize. While major national parks such as the Grand Canyon or \nYellowstone are clearly appropriate candidates for significant transit \nprojects under this section, there are numerous small urban and rural \nFederal park lands that can benefit enormously from small projects, \nsuch as bike paths or improved connections with an urban or regional \npublic transit system. Project selection should include the following \ncriteria: the historical and cultural significance of a project; \nsafety; and the extent to which the project would conserve resources, \nprevent adverse impact, enhance the environment, improve mobility, and \ncontribute to livable communities.\n  The bill also identifies projects of regional or national \nsignificance that more closely resemble the Federal transit program's \nNew Starts projects. Where the project costs are $25 million or \ngreater, the projects will comply with the transit New Starts \nrequirements. No single project will receive more than 12 percent of \nthe total amount available in any given year. This ensures a diversity \nof projects selected for assistance.\n  I firmly believe that this program can create new opportunities for \nthe Federal land management agency to partner with local transit \nagencies in gateway communities adjacent to the parks, both through the \nTEA-21 planning process and in developing integrated transportation \nsystems. This will spur new economic development within these \ncommunities, as they develop transportation centers for park visitors \nto connect to transit links into the national parks and other public \nlands.\n  Mr. President, the ongoing tension between preservation and access \nhas always been a challenge for the National Park Service. Today, that \nchallenge has new dimensions, with overcrowding, pollution, congestion, \nand resource degradation increasing at many of our national parks. This \nlegislation--the Transit in Parks Act--will give our Federal land \nmanagement agencies important new tools to improve both preservation \nand access. Just as we have found in metropolitan areas, transit is \nessential to moving large numbers of people in our national parks--\nquickly, efficiently, at low cost, and without adverse impact. At the \nsame time, transit can enhance the economic development potential of \nour gateway communities.\n  As we begin the final countdown to a new millennium, I cannot think \nof a more worthy endeavor to help our environment and preserve our \nnational parks, wildlife refuges, and federal recreational areas than \nby encouraging alternative transportation in these areas. My bill is \nstrongly supported by the American Public Transit Association, the \nNational Parks and Conservation Association, the Surface Transportation \nPolicy Project, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Community \nTransportation Association of America, the Environmental Defense Fund, \nAmerican Planning Association, Bicycle Federation of America, Friends \nof the Earth, Izaak Walton League of America, National Association of \nCounties, National Trust for Historic Preservation, Rails-to-Trails \nConservancy, Scenic America, The Wilderness Society, and the \nEnvironmental and Energy Study Institute, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat the bill, and a section-by-section analysis, and letters of \nsupport be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation and to recognize the enormous environmental and economic \nbenefits that transit can bring to our national parks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 690\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Amends Federal Transit laws by adding new section 5339, \n     ``Mass Transportation in National Parks and Related Public \n     Lands.''\n       II. Statement of Policies, Findings, and Purposes:\n       To encourage and promote the development of transportation \n     systems for the betterment of national parks and related \n     public lands and to conserve natural, historical, and \n     cultural resources and prevent adverse impact, relieve \n     congestion, minimize transportation fuel consumption, reduce \n     pollution and enhance visitor mobility and accessibility and \n     the visitor experience.\n       To that end, this program establishes federal assistance to \n     certain Federal land management agencies and State and local \n     governmental authorities to finance mass transportation \n     capital projects, to encourage public-private partnerships, \n     and to assist in the research and deployment of improved mass \n     transportation equipment and methods.\n       III. Definitions:\n       (1) eligible ``Federal land management agencies'' are: \n     National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau \n     of Land Management (all under Department of the Interior).\n       (2) ``national parks and related public lands'': eligible \n     areas under the management of these agencies\n       (3) ``qualified mass transportation project'': a capital \n     mass transportation project carried out within or adjacent to \n     national parks and related public lands, including rail \n     projects, clean fuel vehicles, joint development activities, \n     pedestrian and bike paths, waterborne access, or projects \n     that otherwise better protect the national parks and related \n     public lands and increase visitor mobility and accessibility.\n       IV. Federal Agency Cooperative Arrangements:\n       Implements the Memorandum of Understanding between the \n     Departments of Transportation and the Interior for the \n     exchange of technical assistance, the development of \n     transportation policy and coordination, and the establishment \n     of criteria for planning, selection and funding of capital \n     projects under this section. The Secretary of Transportation \n     selects the projects, after consultation with Secretary of \n     the Interior.\n       V. Assistance:\n       To be provided through grants, cooperative agreements, or \n     other agreements, including leasing under certain conditions, \n     for an eligible capital project under this section. Not more \n     than 5% of the amounts available can be used for planning, \n     research and technical assistance, and these amounts can be \n     supplemented from other sources.\n       VI. Planning Process:\n       The Departments of Transportation and Interior shall \n     cooperatively develop a planning process consistent with the \n     TEA-21 planning process in sections 5303 through 5305 of the \n     Federal Transit laws.\n       VII. Government's Share of the Costs:\n       In determining the Federal Transit Administration share of \n     the project costs, the Secretary of Transportation must \n     consider certain factors, including visitation levels and \n     user fee revenues, the coordination in the project \n     development with a public or private transit authority, \n     private investment, and whether there is a clear and direct \n     financial benefit to the applicant. The intent is to \n     establish criteria for a sliding scale of assistance, with a \n     lower Government share for large projects that can attract \n     outside investment, and a higher Government share for \n     projects that may not have access to such outside resources. \n     In addition, funds from the Federal land management agencies \n     can be counted as the local share.\n       VIII. Selection of Projects:\n       The Secretary shall consider: (1) project justification, \n     including the extent to which the project conserves the \n     resources, prevents adverse impact and enhances the \n     environment; (2) project location to ensure geographic \n     diversity and both rural and urban projects; (3) project size \n     for a balanced distribution; (4) historical and cultural \n     significance; (5) safety; (6) the extent to which the project \n     would enhance livable communities; (7) the reduction of \n     pollution, including noise and visual pollution; (8) the \n     reduction of congestion and the improvement of the mobility \n     of people in the most efficient manner; and (9) any other \n     considerations the Secretary deems appropriate. Projects \n     funded under this section must meet certain transit law \n     requirements.\n       IX. Projects of Regional or National Significance:\n       This is a special category that sets forth criteria for \n     special, generally larger, projects or for those areas that \n     may have problems of resource management, pollution, \n     congestion, mobility, and accessibility that can be addressed \n     by this program. Additional project selection criteria \n     include: visitation levels; the use of innovative financing \n     or joint development strategies; coordination with the \n     gateway communities; and any other considerations the \n     Secretary deems appropriate. Projects under this section must \n     meet certain Federal Transit New Starts criteria. This \n     section identifies some locations that may fit these \n     criteria. Any project in this category that is $25 million or \n     greater in cost will have a full funding grant agreement \n     similar to Federal Transit New Starts projects. No project \n     can receive more than 12% of the total amount available in \n     any given year.\n       X. Undertaking Projects in Advance:\n       This provision applies current transit law to this section, \n     allowing projects to advance prior to receiving Federal \n     funding, but allowing the advance activities to be counted so \n     the local share as long as certain conditions are met.\n       XI. Project Management Oversight:\n       This provision applies current transit law to this section, \n     limiting oversight funds to 0.5% per year of the funds made \n     available for this section.\n       XII. Relationship to Other Laws:\n       This provision applies certain transit laws to all projects \n     funded under this section and permits the Secretary to apply \n     any other terms or conditions he deems appropriate.\n       XIII. State Infrastructure Banks:\n       A project assisted under this section can also use funding \n     from a State Infrastructure Bank or other innovative \n     financing mechanism that funds eligible transit projects.\n       XIV. Asset Management:\n       This provision permits the Secretary of Transportation to \n     transfer control over a transit asset acquired with Federal \n     funds under this section in accord with certain Federal \n     property management rules.\n       XV. Coordination of Research and Deployment of New \n     Technologies:\n       This provision allows grants for research and deployment of \n     new technologies to meet the special needs of the national \n     park lands.\n       XVI. Report:\n       This requires the Secretary of Transportation to submit a \n     report on projects funded under this section to the House \n     Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Senate \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, to be included \n     in the Department's annual project report.\n       XVII. Authorization:\n       $50,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated for the \n     Secretary to carry out this program for each of the fiscal \n     years 2000 through 2003.\n       XVIII. Technical Amendments:\n       Technical corrections to the transit title in TEA-21.\n                                                   American Public\n\n\n                                          Transit Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 25, 1999.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n         Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: Thank you for forwarding us a copy \n     of the ``Transit in Parks (TRIP) Act'' which would amend \n     federal transit law at chapter 53, title 49 U.S.C.\n       The Act would authorize federal assistance to certain \n     federal agencies and state and local entities to finance mass \n     transit projects generally for the purpose of addressing \n     transportation congestion and mobility issues at national \n     parks. Among other things, the bill would implement the \n     Memorandum of Understanding between the Departments of \n     Transportation and Interior regarding joint efforts of those \n     federal agencies to encourage the use of public \n     transportation at national parks.\n       We strongly supported that Memorandum of Understanding, and \n     I am just as pleased to support your efforts to improve \n     mobility in our national parks. Public transportation clearly \n     has much to offer citizens who visit these national \n     treasures, where congestion and pollution are significant--\n     and growing--problems. Moreover, this legislation should \n     broaden the base of support for public transportation, a key \n     principle APTA has been advocating for many years. In that \n     regard, we will be reviewing your bill with APTA's \n     legislative leadership.\n       We also look forward to participating in the study of these \n     issues you were successful in including in TEA 21.\n       I applaud you for introducing the legislation, and look \n     forward to continuing to work with you and your staff. Let us \n     know what we can do to help your initiative!\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                William W. Millar,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                February 24, 1999.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: This letter expresses our support \n     for the legislation you are introducing, the Transit in Parks \n     Act, which provides a direct funding source for alternative \n     transportation projects in our national parks and other \n     federally-managed public lands. As you know, many of these \n     areas are experiencing unprecedented numbers of visitors \n     resulting in severe traffic\n\n[[Page S3144]]\n\n     congestion and degradation of some of the country's most \n     valuable and treasured natural, cultural and historic \n     resources.\n       You bill's establishment of a new program within the \n     Federal Transit Administration, dedicated to enhancing \n     transit options in and adjacent to these park lands, can have \n     a powerful, positive effect on the future integrity of the \n     park lands and their resources by reducing the need for \n     access by automobile, improving visitor access, and enhancing \n     the visitor experience.\n       We appreciate your leadership, which has been critical in \n     bringing attention to this emerging issue. The programs \n     funded through TRIP will be a major building block in what we \n     hope will be a broad effort to lessen the impacts of \n     visitation on these most important natural areas. We look \n     forward to working with you to move this legislation to \n     enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Planning Association; American Public Transit \n           Association; Bicycle Federation of America; Community \n           Transportation Association of America; Environmental \n           Defense Fund; Environmental and Energy Study Institute; \n           Friends of the Earth; Izaak Walton League of America; \n           National Association of Counties; National Trust for \n           Historic Preservation; Natural Resources Defense \n           Council; Rails-to-Trails Conservancy; Scenic America; \n           Surface Transportation Policy Project; The Wilderness \n           Society.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                National Parks and\n\n\n                                     Conservation Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 9, 1999.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the National Parks and \n     Conservation Association (NPCA) and its nearly 400,000 \n     members, I want to thank you for proposing a bill that will \n     enhance transit options for access to and within our national \n     parks. NPCA applauds your leadership and foresight in \n     recognizing the critical role that mass transit can play in \n     protecting our parks and improving the visitor experience.\n       Visitation to America's national parks has skyrocketed \n     during the past two decades, from 190 million visitors in \n     1975 to approximately 270 million visitors last year. \n     Increased public interest in these special places has placed \n     substantial burdens on the very resources that draw people to \n     the parks. As more and more individuals crowd into our \n     national parks--typically by automobile--fragile habitat, \n     endangered plants and animals, unique cultural treasures, and \n     spectacular natural resources and vistas are being damaged \n     from air and water pollution, noise intrusion, and \n     inappropriate use.\n       As outlined in your legislation, the establishment of a \n     program within the Federal Transit Administration dedicated \n     to enhancing transit options in and adjacent to the national \n     parks will have a powerful, positive effect on the future \n     ecological and cultural integrity of the parks. Your \n     initiative will boost the role of alternative transportation \n     solutions for national parks, particularly those most heavily \n     impacted by visitation such as Yellowstone, Yosemite, the \n     Grand Canyon, Acadia, Zion, and the Great Smoky Mountains. \n     For instance, development of transportation centers and auto \n     parking lots outside the parks, complemented by the use of \n     buses, vans, or rail systems, would provide much more \n     efficient means of handling the crush of visitation.\n       Equally important, the legislation will provide an \n     excellent opportunity for the National Park Service (NPS) to \n     enter into public/private partnerships with states, \n     localities, and the private sector, providing a wider range \n     of transportation options than exists today. These \n     partnerships could leverage funds that NPS currently has \n     great difficulty accessing.\n       NPCA wholeheartedly endorses your bill as a creative new \n     mechanism to fulfill the primary mission of the National Park \n     System: ``to conserve the scenery and the natural and \n     historic objects and the wildlife therein, and to provide for \n     the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as \n     will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future \n     generations.''\n       We look forward to working with you to move this \n     legislation to enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Thomas C. Kiernan,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Natural Resources Defense Council,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 1999.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Paul Sarbanes: On behalf of the 450,000 \n     members of the Natural Resources Defense Council, I am \n     writing to support your Transit in Parks Act. Many of our \n     national parks are suffering from the impacts of too many \n     automobiles: traffic congestion, air and water pollution, and \n     disturbance of natural ecosystems resulting in the \n     degradation of national park natural and cultural resources \n     and the visitor's experience. Providing dedicated funding for \n     transit projects in our national parks as your bill would do \n     is a priority solution to these problems in the National Park \n     System.\n       It is essential in many parks to get visitors out of their \n     automobiles by providing attractive and effective transit \n     services to and within national parks. A sound practical \n     transit system in many of our national parks will improve the \n     visitor's experience--making it more convenient and enjoyable \n     for families and visitors of all ages. Improved transit is \n     critical to diversifying transportation choices and providing \n     better access for the benefit of all park visitors. Air \n     pollutants from automobiles driven by visitors can exacerbate \n     respiratory health problems, damage vegetation, and \n     contribute to haze which too often obliterates park vistas. \n     To reduce the reliance on automobiles your bill would \n     authorize the funding so our national parks can provide \n     efficient and convenient transit systems which cost money to \n     build and operate.\n       We commend and thank you for your dedication and leadership \n     on this issue and more generally to the protection of our \n     national parks. Please look to us to help you establish \n     public transit in the national parks.\n           Sincerely\n                                                Charles M. Clusen,\n     Senior Policy Analyst.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Environmental Defense Fund,\n\n                                   New York, NY, February 3, 1999.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am writing on behalf of the \n     Environmental Defense Fund and our 300,000 members to express \n     support for your bill, the Transit in Parks Act, which will \n     provide dedicated funding for transit projects in our \n     national parks. Too many of our parks suffer from the \n     consequences of poor transportation systems: traffic \n     congestion, air and water pollution, and disturbance of \n     natural ecosystems.\n       Increased funding for attractive and effective transit \n     services to and within our national parks is essential to \n     mitigating these growing problems. A good working transit \n     system in a number of our national parks will make the park \n     experience not only more enjoyable for the many families that \n     travel there, it will help improve environmental conditions. \n     Having had the chance to experience the excellent transit \n     system in Denali National Park, I know how much of a \n     difference these systems can make.\n       Air pollutants that exacerbate respiratory health problems, \n     damage vegetation, and contribute to haze which too often \n     obliterates the views at our parks, will be abated by \n     decreasing the number of cars and congestion levels in the \n     parks. Improved transit related to our parks is key to \n     diversifying transportation choices and access for the \n     benefit of all who might visit our national park system.\n       We appreciate your leadership on this issue and your \n     dedication to the health of our national parks. We look \n     forward to working with you to move your legislation forward.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                       Fred Krupp,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Community Transportation\n\n\n                                        Association of America\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 22, 1999.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     Committee on Banking and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: It is an honor to once again support \n     your efforts to provide alternative transportation strategies \n     in our national parks and other public lands. Our \n     Association's over thirteen hundred members provide public \n     and community transportation in many of the smaller \n     communities which border these national treasures. We \n     supported your proposal last year because we know as \n     neighbors of these facilities how transportation alternatives \n     will help keep these areas safe in the twenty-first century.\n       All of us know the danger that congestion and the increase \n     in traffic pose for the future of these sites and locations. \n     Your efforts in the past, and more importantly this year, are \n     an important step forward to establish a dialogue on \n     protecting these areas that help make America's natural \n     beauty a continuous part of the nation's future. This work \n     was urgent last year and it remains urgent today. We support \n     your efforts because our need to begin is obviously overdue. \n     Every day that we fail to protect these areas diminishes \n     their future.\n       We will work with you any way we can to help make your \n     proposed Transit in Parks legislation a reality. We look \n     forward to helping you move this important work forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Dale J. Marsico,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. Bryan):\n  S. 692. A bill to prohibit Internet gambling, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   internet gambling prohibition act\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Internet \nGambling Prohibition Act.\n  From the beginning of time, societies have sought to prohibit most \nforms of gambling. There are reasons for this--and they are especially \napplicable to gambling on the Internet today. Consider the following.\n  Youth. A recent New York Times article warned that ``Internet sports \nbetting entices youthful gamblers into potentially costly losses.'' In \nthe same\n\n[[Page S3145]]\n\narticle, Kevin O'Neill, deputy director of the Council on Compulsive \nGambling of New Jersey, said that ``Internet sports gambling appeals to \ncollege-age people who don't have immediate access to a neighborhood \nbookie. . . . It's on the Net and kids think it's credible, which is \nscary.''\n  Listen to the testimony of Jeff Pash, the Executive Vice President of \nthe National Football League, before the Senate Judiciary Committee: \n``Studies . . . indicate that sports betting is a growing problem for \nhigh school and college students. . . . As the Internet reaches more \nand more school children, Internet gambling is certain to promote even \nmore gambling among young people.''\n  Families. Gambling often has terrible consequences for families and \ncommunities. According to the Council on Compulsive Gambling, five \npercent of all gamblers become addicted. Many of those turn to crime \nand commit suicide. We all pay for those tragedies.\n  Harm to Businesses and the Economy. Internet gambling is likely to \nhave a deleterious effect on businesses and the economy. As Ted Koppel \nnoted in a ``Nightline'' feature on Internet gambling, ``[l]ast year, \n1,333,000 American consumers filed for bankruptcy, thereby eliminating \nabout $40 billion in personal debt. That's of some relevance to all of \nus because the $40 billion debt doesn't just disappear. It's \nredistributed among the rest of us in the form of increased prices on \nconsumer goods. . . .'' He continued: ``If anything promises to \nincrease the level of personal debt in this country, expanding access \nto gambling should do it.''\n  Professor John Kindt testified before the House Small Business \nCommittee that a business with 1,000 workers can anticipate increased \npersonnel costs of $500,000 a year due to job absenteeism and declining \nproductivity simply by having various forms of legalized gambling \naccessible.\n  Addiction. Internet gambling enhances the addictive nature of \ngambling because it is so easy to do: you don't have to travel; you can \njust log on to your computer. Professor Kindt has described electronic \ngambling, like the type being offered in the ``virtual casinos'' on the \nInternet, as the ``hard-core cocaine of gambling.''\n  As Bernie Horn, the Executive Director of the National Coalition \nAgainst Legalized Gaming, testified before the House Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Crime: ``The Internet not only makes highly addictive \nforms of gambling easily accessible to everyone, it magnifies the \npotential destructiveness of the addiction. Because of the privacy of \nan individual and his/her computer terminal, addicts can destroy \nthemselves without anyone ever having the chance to stop them.\n  Unfair payouts. As Wisconsin Attorney General James Doyle testified \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee, ``[b]ecause [Internet gambling] \nis unregulated, consumers don't know who is on the other end of the \nconnection. The odds can be easily manipulated and there is no \nguarantee that fair payouts will occur.'' ``Anyone who gambles over the \nInternet is making a sucker bet,'' says William A. Bible, the chair of \nan Internet gambling subcommittee on the National Gambling Impact Study \nCommission.\n  Crime. Further, gambling on the Internet is apt to lead to criminal \nbehavior. Indeed, ``Up to 90 percent of pathological gamblers commit \ncrimes to pay off their wagering debts.'' A University of Illinois \nstudy found that for every dollar that states gain from gambling, they \npay out three dollars in social and criminal costs.\n  Cost. According to an article in the March 1999 ABA Journal, ``Online \nwagering is generating a $600-million-a-year kitty that some analysts \nsay could reach as high as $100 billion a year by 2006.'' I want to \nrepeat that: ``$100 BILLION a year.'' The article continues: ``The \nnumber of Web sites offering Internet gambling is growing at a similar \nrate. In just one year, that number more than quadrupled, going from \nabout 60 in late 1997 to now more than 260 according to some \nestimates.'' And a recent HBO in-depth report by Jim Lampley noted that \nvirtual sports books will collect more money from the Super Bowl than \nall the sports books in Las Vegas combined.\n  This affects all of us.\n  Not every problem that is national is also necessarily federal. \nInternet gambling is a national problem AND a federal problem. The \nInternet is, of course, interstate in nature. States cannot protect \ntheir citizens from Internet gambling if anyone can transmit it into \ntheir states. That is why the State Attorneys General asked for federal \nlegislation to prohibit Internet gambling. In a letter to the Judiciary \nCommittee members, the Chairs of the Association's Internet Working \nGroup stressed the need for federal involvement: ``[M]ore than any \nother area of the law, gambling has traditionally been regulated on a \nstate-by-state basis, with little uniformity and minimal federal \noversight. The availability of gambling on the Internet, however, \nthreatens to disrupt each state's careful balancing of its own public \nwelfare and fiscal concerns, by making gambling available across state \nand national boundaries, with little or no regulatory control.''\n  Further, in reaffirming his support for the bill, the former \nPresident of NAAG, Wisconsin Attorney General Jim Doyle, wrote: \n``Internet gambling poses a major challenge for state and local law \nenforcement officials. I strongly support Senator Kyl's Internet \nGambling Prohibition Act. Prohibiting this form of unregulated gambling \nwill protect consumers from fraud and preserve state policies on \ngambling that have been established by our citizens and our \nlegislators.''\n  In 1961, Congress passed the Wire Act to prohibit using telephone \nfacilities to receive bets or send gambling information. [18 U.S.C. \nSec. 1084.] In addition to penalties imposed upon gambling businesses \nthat violate the law, the Wire Act gives local and state law \nenforcement authorities the power to direct telecommunication providers \nto discontinue service to proprietors of gambling services who use the \nwires to conduct illegal gambling activity. But, as pointed out in the \nMarch 1999 ABA Journal, ``The problem with current federal law is that \nthe communications technology it specifies is dated and limited.'' The \nadvent of the Internet, a communications medium not envisioned by the \nWire Act, requires enactment of a new law to address activities in \ncyberspace not contemplated by the drafters of the older law.\n  The Internet Gambling Prohibition Act ensures that the law keeps pace \nwith technology. The bill bans gambling on the Internet, just as the \nWire Act prohibited gambling over the wires. And it does not limit the \nsubject of gambling to sports. The bill is similar to the one that the \nSenate, by an overwhelming 90-10 vote, attached to the Commerce-\nJustice-State Appropriations bill last year. Let me take a moment to \nexplain the bill.\n  The bill covers sports gambling and casino games. Businesses that \noffer gambling over the Internet can be fined in an amount equal to the \namount that the business received in bets via the Internet or $20,000, \nwhichever is greater, and/or imprisoned for not more than four years. \nTo address concerns raised by the Department of Justice, the bill (like \nthe Wire Act) does not contain penalties for individual bettors. Such \nbetting will, of course, still be the subject of state law.\n  The bill contains a strong enforcement mechanism. At the request of \nthe United States or a State, a district court may enter a temporary \nrestraining order or an injunction against any person to prevent a \nviolation of the bill, following due notice and based on a finding of \nsubstantial probability that there has been a violation of the law. In \neffect, the illegal website will have its service cut off. I have \nworked with the Internet service providers to address concerns they \nraised about how they would cut off service, and, as a result, the \nprovisions dealing with the civil remedies have been revised along the \nlines of the WIPO legislation.\n  In sum, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act brings federal law up \nto date. With the advent of new, sophisticated technology, the Wire Act \nis becoming outdated. The Internet Gambling Prohibition Act corrects \nthat problem.\n  I would like to take a moment to review the consideration of the bill \nduring the last Congress. In July 1997, the Judiciary Subcommittee on \nTechnology held a hearing on S. 474. A wide variety of people testified \nin support of the legislation: Senator Richard Bryan; Wisconsin \nAttorney General Jim Doyle, the then-President of the\n\n[[Page S3146]]\n\nNational Association of Attorneys General; Jeff Pash, Counsel to the \nNational Football League; Ann Geer, Chair of the National Coalition \nAgainst Gambling Expansion; and Anthony Cabot, professor at the \nInternational Gaming Institute.\n  Ann Geer stated that ``Internet gambling would multiply addiction \nexponentially, increasing access and magnifying the potential \ndestructiveness of the addiction. Addicts would literally click their \nmouse and bet the house.''\n  As I noted earlier, Wisconsin Attorney General James Doyle testified \nthat ``gambling on the Internet is a very dumb bet. Because it is \nunregulated . . . odds can be easily manipulated and there is no \nguarantee that fair payouts will occur. . . . Internet gambling \nthreatens to disrupt the system. It crosses state and national borders \nwith little or no regulatory control. Federal authorities must take the \nlead in this area.''\n  Additionally, in June, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on FBI \noversight at which I said to FBI Director Louis Freeh: ``the testimony \nfrom other Department of Justice and FBI witnesses has supported our \nlegislation to conform the crime of gambling on the Internet to \nexisting law. And I would just like a reconfirmation of the FBI's \nsupport for that legislation.'' Director Freeh replied ``yes, I think \nit's a very effective change. We certainly support it.''\n  The Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology passed S. 474 by a unanimous \npoll and sent the bill to the full Committee for consideration. The \nJudiciary Committee passed S. 474 by voice vote.\n  In July 1998, by a 90 to 10 vote, the Internet Gambling Prohibition \nAct was attached to the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill. In \nthe House, the bill passed Representative McCollum's Crime Subcommittee \nunanimously, but due to the lateness of the session, the bill failed to \nmove farther in the House and was not included in the final CJS bill.\n  The bill has broad bipartisan support in Congress and the strong \nsupport of law enforcement. As I just mentioned, FBI Director Freeh has \ntestified that the bill makes a ``very effective change'' to the law \nand the National Association of Attorneys General sent a letter \nsupporting S. 474 to all Senators.\n  Further, the President of NAAG, Wisconsin Attorney General Jim Doyle, \nwrote a letter expressing his support of the bill: ``Internet gambling \nposes a major challenge for state and local law enforcement officials. \nI strongly support Senator Kyl's Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. \nProhibiting this form of unregulated gambling will protect consumers \nfrom fraud and preserve state policies on gambling that have been \nestablished by our citizens and our legislators.''\n  Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth also wrote a letter \nstressing the support of the states for this bill: ``The adoption of a \nresolution on this issue by NAAG represents overwhelming support from \nthe states for a bill which, in essence, increases the federal presence \nin an area of primary state concern. However, it is clear that the \nfederal government has an important role in this issue which crosses \nstate as well as international boundaries.''\n  In the 105th Congress, S. 474 was strongly supported by professional \nand amateur sports. The National Football League, the National \nCollegiate Athletic Association, the National Hockey League, the \nNational Basketball Association, Major League Soccer, and Major League \nBaseball sent a joint letter of support to all Senators.\n  I would like to read a passage from this letter:\n\n       Despite exiting federal and state laws prohibiting gambling \n     on professional and college sports, sports gambling over the \n     Internet has become a serious--and growing--national problem. \n     Many Internet gambling operations originate from offshore \n     locations outside the U.S. The number of offshore Internet \n     gambling websites has grown from two in 1996 to over 70 \n     today. It is estimated that Inernet sites will book over $600 \n     million in sports bets in 1998, up from $60 million just two \n     years ago. These websites not only permit offshore gambling \n     operations to solicit and take bets from the United States in \n     defiance of federal and state law but also enable gamblers \n     and would-be gamblers in the U.S. to place illegal sports \n     wagers over the Internet from the privacy of their own home \n     or office.\n\n  The letter concludes: ``We strongly urge you to vote in favor of S. \n474 when it is considered on the Senate floor.''\n  On behalf of the NCAA, Bill Saum testified in February before the \nNational Gambling Impact Study Commission on the dangers of Internet \ngambling:\n\n       Internet gambling provides college students with the \n     opportunity to place wagers on professional and college \n     sporting events from the privacy of his or her campus \n     residence. Internet gambling offers the student virtual \n     anonymity. With nothing more than a credit card, the \n     possibility exists for any student-athlete to place a wager \n     via the Intenet and then attempt to influence the outcome of \n     the contest while participating on the court or the playing \n     field. There is no question the advent of Internet sports \n     gambling poses a direct threat to all sports organizations \n     that, first and foremost, must ensure the integrity of each \n     contest played.\n\n  Today, in the Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology, I chaired a \nhearing on Internet gambling. The testimony in today's hearing \nconfirmed that Internet gambling is addictive, accessible to minors, \nsubject to fraud and other criminal use, and evasive of state gambling \nlaws. State Attorneys General from Wisconsin and Ohio asked for federal \nlegislation to address the mushrooming problem of online gambling, and \nrepresentatives of the National Football League and the National \nCollegiate Athletic Association expressed their concerns over the \neffect of Internet gambling on athletes, fans, and the integrity of \nsporting contests.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Bryan for his hard work \non this bill. His support and assistance have been invaluable. I would \nalso like to extend a special thanks to the NFL, NCAA, and the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General.\n  The Internet offers fantastic opportunities. Unfortunately, some \nwould exploit those opportunities to commit crimes and take advantage \nof others. Indeed, as Professor Kindt stated on ``Nightline,'' ``Once \nyou go to Internet gambling, you've maximized the speed you've \nmaximized the acceptability and the accessibility. It's going to be in-\nyour-face gambling, which is going to have severe detrimental effects \nto society. . . . it's the crack cocaine of creating new pathological \ngamblers.''\n  Internet gambling is a serious problem. Society has always prohibited \nmost forms of gambling because it can have a devastating effect on \npeople and families, and it often leads to crime and other corruption. \nThe Internet Gambling Prohibition Act will curb the spread of online \ngambling.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url":

Res. 73\n\n       Whereas on March 7, 1999, the Republic of El Salvador \n     successfully completed its second democratic multiparty \n     elections for President and Vice President since the signing \n     of the 1992 peace accords;\n       Whereas these elections were deemed by international and \n     domestic observers to be free and fair and a legitimate \n     nonviolent expression of the will of the people of the \n     Republic of El Salvador;\n       Whereas the United States has consistently supported the \n     efforts of the people of El Salvador to consolidate their \n     democracy and to implement the provisions of the 1992 peace \n     accords;\n       Whereas these elections demonstrate the strength and \n     diversity of El Salvador's democratic expression and promote \n     confidence that all political parties can work cooperatively \n     at every level of government; and\n       Whereas these open, fair, and democratic elections of the \n     new President and Vice President should be broadly commended: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the Government and the people of the \n     Republic of El Salvador for the successful completion of \n     democratic multiparty elections held on March 7, 1999, for \n     President and Vice President;\n       (2) congratulates President-elect Francisco Guillermo \n     Flores Perez and Vice President-elect Carlos Quintanilla \n     Schmidt on their recent victory and their continued strong \n     commitment to democracy, national reconciliation, and \n     reconstruction;\n       (3) congratulates El Salvadoran President Armando Calderon \n     Sol for his personal commitment to democracy, which has \n     helped in the building of national unity in the Republic of \n     El Salvador;\n       (4) commends all Salvadoran citizens and political parties \n     for their efforts to work together to take risks for \n     democracy and to willfully pursue national reconciliation in \n     order to cement a lasting peace and to strengthen democratic \n     traditions in El Salvador;\n       (5) supports Salvadoran attempts to continue their \n     cooperation in order to ensure democracy, national \n     reconciliation, and economic prosperity; and\n       (6) reaffirms that the United States is unequivocally \n     committed to encouraging democracy and peaceful development \n     throughout Central America.\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \non El Salvador along with Senators Coverdell, Graham and Dodd. This \nresolution congratulates the government and the people of El Salvador \non successfully completing free and democratic elections on March 7, \n1999.\n  On March 7, 1999 the Republic of El Salvador successfully completed \nits second democratic multiparty election since the signing of the \npeace accords in 1992. These elections, like the legislative elections \nin 1997 and the Presidential elections in 1994, were deemed free and \nfair by domestic and international observers. Moreover, the elections \nwere conducted in an environment of peace, where all parties contested \nfor the right to govern in a spirited political campaign.\n  This resolution today commends the government of El Salvador and most \nimportantly the people of the country, who thought their participation \nin the political process have demonstrated the strength and diversity \nof El Salvador's democratic expression. It also congratulates Mr. \nFrancisco Flores, President-elect, and Vice President-elect, Mr. Carlos \nQuintanilla-Schmidt for their electoral victory and for their\n\n[[Page S3148]]\n\ncommitment to democracy and to the continued progress of El Salvador.\n  This election further consolidates El Salvador's dramatic \ntransformation in the seven short years since the signing of the peace \naccords. Today, El Salvador has moved from a country racked by civil \nwar into a stable multiparty democracy. The country has attained a \nbalance of power among the Executive, Judicial and Legislative \nBranches. It has enacted measures to guarantee the full respect of \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, and has adopted policies that \nstrengthen municipal governments and provide much-needed social \nservices to local communities.\n  The country has also undergone an equally dramatic economic \ntransformation. Its economy, which suffered decades of decline, has \nbecome one of the fastest growing economies in the region. For the past \neight years, the GDP in El Salvador has averaged 5.3 percent. \nInflation, which averaged above 20 percent prior to 1992, now tops at \n1.5 percent. El Salvador's privatization program is one of the most \nsuccessful in the region. Moreover, it is considered today one of the \nbest sovereign credit risks in Latin America.\n  All of these accomplishments are testament to the will of the \nSalvadoran people to put their past behind them and focus on creating a \nfuture of social stability and economic prosperity. It is also a \ntestament to the political leadership of the Salvadoran government. \nWhen President Calderon Sol took office five years ago, he had the \nresponsibility to assure full compliance with the peace accords, as \nwell as keep the economy of El Salvador on the path of economic reform. \nHe deserves today to be applauded by this body of Congress for his \naccomplishments and for leading his country successfully into the 21st \ncentury.\n  El Salvador's dramatic transformation is not unlike the changes that \nhave taken place across Central America. Today marks the first time in \nthe history of the region that all of Central America is at peace, \nimplementing free market reforms and led by Democratic governments. For \nthose of us who were in Congress during the 1980s, we know what a \nremarkable feat this is and how significant it is that we can today, in \na bipartisan fashion, applaud the consolidation of democracy in El \nSalvador.\n  We should not take the strides that the region has taken for granted. \nThe devastation brought by Hurricane Mitch has dealt a severe blow to \nthe fortunes of the region. History has shown that natural disasters \ncan be the breeding grounds for civil and political unrest and the \nerosion of civil liberties. I urge my colleagues to support the \nemergency aid package to the region that is currently on the Senate \nfloor for debate. In addition, IO ask that we also pass the CBI \nenhancement bill so that these countries also have the opportunity to \nhelp themselves.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate and commend the people of El Salvador \nfor continuing to move forward in a way that will bring our hemisphere \ntogether--and increase the likelihood that for all of us, the 21st \ncentury will be a time of peace, freedom, and prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/23/senate-section/article/S3148-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 21--AUTHORIZING THE PRESIDENT OF THE \n UNITED STATES TO CONDUCT MILITARY AIR OPERATIONS AND MISSILE STRIKES \n   AGAINST THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA (SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO)\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Levin, Mr. Byrd, Mr. \nMcConnell, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Lieberman, and \nMr. Robb) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

Res. 22\n\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1. PROMOTION OF COVERAGE OF INDIVIDUALS UNDER LONG-\n                   TERM CARE INSURANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) As the baby boom generation begins to retire, funding \n     social security and medicare will put a strain on the \n     financial resources of younger Americans.\n       (2) Medicaid was designed as a program for the poor, but in \n     many States medicaid is being used for middle income elderly \n     people to fund long-term care expenses.\n       (3) In the coming decade, people over age 65 will represent \n     20 percent or more of the population, and the proportion of \n     the population composed of individuals who are over age 85, \n     and most likely to need long-term care, may double or triple.\n       (4) With nursing home care now costing an average of \n     $40,000 to $50,000 per year, long-term care expenses can have \n     a catastrophic effect on families, wiping out a lifetime of \n     savings before a spouse, parent, or grandparent becomes \n     eligible for medicaid.\n       (5) Many people are unaware that most long-term care costs \n     are not covered by medicare and that medicaid covers long-\n     term care only after the person's assets have been exhausted.\n       (6) Widespread use of private long-term care insurance has \n     the potential to protect families from the catastrophic costs \n     of long-term care services while, at the same time, easing \n     the burden on medicaid as the baby boom generation ages.\n       (7) The Federal Government has endorsed the concept of \n     private long-term care insurance by establishing Federal tax \n     rules for tax-qualified policies in the Health Insurance \n     Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.\n       (8) The Federal Government has ensured the availability of \n     quality long-term care insurance products and sales practices \n     by adopting strict consumer protections in the Health \n     Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Federal Government should take all appropriate \n     steps to inform the public about the financial risks posed by \n     rapidly increasing long-term care costs and about the need \n     for families to plan for their long-term care needs;\n       (2) the Federal Government should take all appropriate \n     steps to inform the public that medicare does not cover most \n     long-term care costs and that medicaid covers long-term care \n     costs only when the beneficiary has exhausted his or her \n     assets;\n       (3) the Federal Government should take all appropriate \n     steps not only to encourage employers to offer private long-\n     term care insurance coverage to employees, but also to \n     encourage both working-aged people and older citizens to \n     obtain long-term care insurance either through their \n     employers or on their own;\n       (4) appropriate committees of Congress, together with the \n     Department of Health and Human Services and other appropriate \n     executive branch agencies, should develop specific ideas for \n     encouraging Americans to plan for their own long-term care \n     needs; and\n       (5) the congressional tax-writing committees, together with \n     the Department of the Treasury, should determine whether \n     modification of the tax rules for long-term care insurance is \n     necessary to ensure that the rules adequately facilitate the \n     affordability of long-term care insurance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/23/senate-section/article/S3148-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n           COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSION\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, this past Friday, the Society for \nHistory in the Federal Government awarded its annual James Madison \nprize for the most distinguished article on an historical topic \n``reflecting on the functions of the Federal Government.'' This year, \nthe award was presented to a member of my staff, Mark A. Bradley, for \nan article he wrote on the disappearance of the U.S.S. Scorpion (SSN \n589).\n  The Scorpion was a Skipjack class nuclear submarine. In 1968, after a \nMediterranean deployment with the 6th Fleet, the Scorpion was lost with \nall hands aboard about 400 miles of the Azores. It had been on a secret \nintelligence mission and the exact circumstances of the tragedy \ncontinue to be debated. Mr. Bradley's article recounts the events that \nled to the loss of the Scorpion and offers an insightful explanation of \nwhat might have caused the accident.\n  Our own Senator Robert C. Byrd for his masterly work on the Senate, \nhistorian Ira Berlin for his work on Emancipation in the American \nSouth, and the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress, for its \nW. Averell Harriman project are all past Society for History in the \nFederal Government award winners.\n  As a Rhodes scholar, Mr. Bradley is no stranger to distinguished \nawards. He is an accomplished historian who, in his spare time, serves \nas the Associate Editor of Periodical, the Journal of America's \nMilitary Past, where his award winning article, ``Submiss: The \nMysterious Death of the USS Scorpion (SSN 589) appeared. We are proud \nof him and thankful that he has chosen to apply his talents here in the \nSenate in the service of the nation.\n  I ask that a portion of his award winning article be printed in the \nRecord and intend to have the remainder of the article printed in the \nRecord over the next several days.\n  The material follows:\n\n   Submiss: The Mysterious Death of the U.S.S. ``SCORPION'' (SSN 589)\n\n                           (By Mark Bradley)\n\n       At around midnight on May 16, 1968, U.S.S. Scorpion (SSN \n     589) slipped quietly through the Straits of Gibraltar and \n     paused just long enough off the choppy breakwaters of Rota, \n     Spain, to rendezvous with a boat and offload two crewmen and \n     several messages. A high performance nuclear attack submarine \n     with 99 men aboard, the Scorpion was on her way home to \n     Norfolk, Virginia, after completing three months of \n     operations in the Mediterranean with vessels from the Sixth \n     Fleet and NATO. Capable of traveling submerged at over 30 \n     knots, she expected to reach her home port within a week.\n       Upon entering the Atlantic, the Scorpion fell under the \n     direct operational control of Vice Admiral Arnold Schade, the \n     commander of the U.S. Navy's Atlantic Submarine Fleet. On May \n     20, he issued a still-classified operations order to the \n     submarine that diverted her from her homeward trek and \n     required her to move toward the Canary Islands and a small \n     formation of Soviet warships that had gathered southwest of \n     the islands. Under U.S. Naval air surveillance since May 19, \n     this flotilla consisted of one Echo-II class nuclear \n     submarine, a submarine rescue vessel, and two hydrographic \n     surveys ships. Three days later, a missile destroyer capable \n     of firing nuclear surface-to-surface missiles and an oiler \n     joined the group.\n       At approximately 7:54 p.m. Norfolk time on May 21, the \n     Scorpion rose to within a few feet of the rolling surface, \n     extended her antenna, and radioed the U.S. Naval \n     Communication Station in Greece. Her radioman reported that \n     she was 250 miles southwest of the Azores Islands and \n     estimated her time of arrival in Norfolk to be 1 p.m. on May \n     27. On that day, as the families of the crew gathered on Pier \n     22 in a driving rain and waited for their husbands and \n     fathers to surface off the Virginia capes, the captain of the \n     U.S.S. Orion, who was the acting commander of Submarine \n     Squadron 6, the Scorpion's unit, told Schade what the Vice \n     Admiral secretly knew: the Scorpion had failed to respond to \n     routine messages about tug services and her berthing \n     location. After an intensive effort to communicate with the \n     submarine failed, Schade declared a SUBMISS at 3:15 p.m. and \n     launched a massive hunt.\n       Numbering over fifty ships, submarines and planes, the \n     searchers retraced the Scorpion's projected route to Norfolk \n     and found nothing. What most in the Navy, including the \n     crew's families, did not know was that Schade already had \n     organized a secret search for the submarine on May 24 after \n     she had failed to respond to a series of classified messages \n     and, by May 28, he and others in the service's \n     command believed the Scorpion had been destroyed. Highly \n     classified hydrophone data indicated to them that she had \n     suffered a catastrophic explosion on May 22 and had been \n     crushed as she twisted to the ocean's floor.\n       On June 5, the Navy officially declared the submarine \n     presumed lost and her crew dead. On June 4, the service's \n     high command had established a formal court of inquiry \n     chaired by Vice Admiral Bernard Austin (Ret), who also had \n     headed the Navy's investigation into the 1963 loss of U.S.S. \n     Thresher which had cost the lives of 129 men. After \n     evaluating nearly 50 days of testimony, the Court concluded \n     that it could not determine the exact cause for the \n     Scorpion's loss. On October 28, 1968, the Navy found the \n     Scorpion's shaattered remains in over 11,000 feet of water \n     approximately 400 miles southwest of the Azores Islands. On \n     November 6 Admiral Austin reconvened his court, which studied \n     thousands of photographs taken of the\n\n[[Page S3150]]\n\n     wreckage by U.S.N.S. Mizar. After two more months of \n     investigation, the Court again held that it could not \n     determine precisely how the submarine had been destroyed.\n       Frustrated by their lack of any clear answers, the Navy's \n     high command turned to the Trieste II, a specially designed \n     deep water submersible capable of plunging down to the \n     gravesite. Between 2 June and 2 August 1969, this bathyscape \n     made nine dives to the Scorpion, photographing and \n     diagramming her broken corpse. Although these efforts \n     provided a clearer view of where she was and in what \n     condition, they again failed to tell what had happened to one \n     of the service's most elite warships. After thirty years, the \n     Scorpion's fate still remains shrouded in mystery, a not so \n     ironic end for a member of the silent service that spent her \n     life on the shadowy front lines of the Cold War.\n       Launched on December 19, 1959, and commissioned on July 29, \n     1960, the Scorpion was built by General Dynamics' Electric \n     Boat Division in Groton, Connecticut. One of six Skipjack \n     class nuclear attack submarines, which combined a tear drop-\n     shaped hull with a S5W reactor, the 252 foot Scorpion was \n     capable of traveling over 20 knots while on the surface and \n     over 30 knots while submerged. Her top underwater speed was \n     more than 8 knots faster than that of U.S.S. Nautilus, the \n     world's first nuclear submarine, launched in 1954, and twice \n     that of the best World War II German U-boats. While the \n     Nazis' Type XXI submarine, completed in 1944 could travel at \n     a top speed of 16.7 knots for 72 minutes without resurfacing, \n     the Scorpion could easily travel submerged at top speed for \n     70 days. These capabilities for high underwater speed and \n     unlimited endurance gave the Navy new tactical abilities \n     undreamed of in 1941-1945.\n       Although World War II had witnessed two great submarine \n     campaigns, the first in the Atlantic where the Germans tried \n     to sever England's supply lines and the second in the Pacific \n     where the Americans assaulted the Japanese merchant fleet, \n     the submarines of that period were strikingly similar to \n     their World War I counterparts in submerged speed and \n     endurance. Dependent upon diesel oil while traveling on the \n     surface and batteries while underneath, these submarines were \n     forced to spend the bulk of their time above water \n     recharging, only submerging once they had spotted a target. \n     Their reliance on two propulsion systems made them easy prey \n     for air and surface attacks. Only near the war's end did \n     Hitler's U-boats experiment with snorkels and more powerful \n     batteries, and American submarines regularly employ sonar and \n     radar. Even with these innovations, the United States Navy \n     still lost nearly one-fifth of its submarine force while \n     fighting in both theaters. The dropping of the atomic bomb \n     changed all this and made possible not only one fuel system \n     but also much greater underwater speed and endurance.\n       The Navy quickly seized upon these new capabilities and \n     deployed its nuclear submarines in a variety of missions, \n     particularly in gathering intelligence about the Soviet \n     fleet. In 1959, President Dwight Eisenhower approved one of \n     the most closely guarded intelligence operations ever mounted \n     by the United States. Code named Operation HOLYSTONE, its \n     original purpose was to use specially equipped submarines to \n     penetrate Soviet waters to observe missile launches and \n     capture readouts of their computer calculations. Later, they \n     also were used to photograph and gather highly sensitive \n     configuration and sound data on the Russian navy, \n     particularly its submarines. This information was then used \n     by intelligence analysts to track hostile warships by \n     listening to their noise patterns and sound signatures.\n       While the Scorpion specialized in developing undersea \n     nuclear warfare tactics, she also was used to collect \n     intelligence. For instance, in the late winter and early \n     spring of 1966, and again that fall, she was engaged in what \n     the Navy has called ``special operations.'' Her then-\n     commanding officer received the Navy's commendation medal for \n     outstanding service. Although much about her last mission \n     remains a mystery--five out of the last nine messages sent to \n     her between May 21 and May 27 from Norfolk are still \n     classified top secret--it seems likely that the Scorpion was \n     engaged in or had just completed a highly sensitive \n     intelligence operation when she was lost.\n       According to the first Court of Inquiry's sanitized \n     declassified report, the Scorpion had been diverted to shadow \n     a Soviet flotilla engaged in a ``hydroacoustic'' operation. \n     This means the Russians were also collecting and analyzing \n     information derived from the acoustic waves radiated by \n     unfriendly ships and submarines. The Navy would have been \n     greatly interested in any activity of this sort, \n     particularly given the Soviets' location off the Canary \n     Islands and near the Straits of Gibraltar, the gateway to \n     the Mediterranean.\n       The Soviets also may have been trying to gather \n     intelligence on the Americans' highly secretive Sound \n     Underwater Surveillance System (SOSUS), an elaborate global \n     network of fixed sea bottom hydrophones that listened for \n     submarines. First developed in 1950 and installed in 1954, \n     SOSUS formed the backbone of the United States' anti-\n     submarine detection capability. This system became even more \n     crucial in the late 1960s as the Soviet Navy began shifting \n     its focus away from protecting Russia's coastal waters to \n     building a blue water fleet spearheaded by advanced hunter-\n     killer and ballistic missile nuclear submarines. This forced \n     the Pentagon to place a premium on intelligence about the \n     Kremlin's undersea operations.\n       By 1968, the Americans had deployed a SOSUS network off the \n     Canary Islands and were laying another off the Azores \n     Islands. Both were aimed at tracking Soviet submarines \n     nearing the Straits of Gibraltar and approaching the Cape of \n     Good Hope. Any Soviet attempt to disrupt or penetrate SOSUS \n     would have aroused a great deal of interest in Norfolk and \n     may explain the Navy's decision to send the Scorpion toward \n     the Canary Islands.\n       Whatever he last mission was, it appears likely that the \n     Scorpion had completed her operational phase by 7:54 p.m. on \n     May 21, when she broadcast her last position and estimated \n     time of arrival in Norfolk. Operating under strict orders to \n     maintain electronic silence ``except when necessary'', the \n     Scorpion sent only this message after she left Rota. At the \n     time of her last communication, she was approximately two \n     hundred miles or six hours away from the Soviet formation she \n     had been sent to monitor. Nearly twenty-four hours later, \n     SOSUS and civilian underwater listening systems ranging from \n     Argentina to Newfoundland picked up the shock of an \n     underwater explosion along the Scorpion's projected route \n     followed by crushing sounds not unlike those recorded during \n     the Thresher's destruction in 1963. According to these \n     readouts, the entire episode lasted slightly over three \n     months.\n       Applying sophisticated mathematics to these recordings and \n     tracing the Scorpion's presumed track and speed to Norfolk, \n     the Navy designated an area of ``special interest'' for its \n     search some 400 miles southwest of the Azores Islands. On May \n     31, the U.S.S. Compass Island, a navigational research ship, \n     was dispatched to conduct an underwater survey and on October \n     28, 1968, the U.S.N.S. Mizar, another navigational ship with \n     advanced photographic equipment, finally found the wreckage \n     only three miles away from where SOSUS computers had \n     estimated it to be. Broken into two pieces, the Scorpion's \n     remains lay in over 11,000 feet of water.\n       Deeply shaken and still reeling from the loss of the U.S.S. \n     Thresher (SSN 593) five years earlier, the Navy began its \n     post-morten with only the SOSUS readouts, the Scorpion's \n     operational history and the testimony of her former crew \n     members. The first Court of Inquiry deliberated from 4 June \n     1968 until 25 July 1968 and examined 76 witnesses as it \n     considered a broad array of fatal possibilities. First among \n     these was that the Soviets had intercepted the Scorpion and \n     finished her in an undersea dogfight. The Court discarded \n     this theory after it examined the reports the intelligence \n     community provided and found no evidence that the Soviet \n     formation which the Scorpion had been sent to shadow had \n     launched an attack or fired any weapons when SOSUS recorded \n     the explosion. The Court also noted that there were no other \n     Russian or Warsaw Pact vessels within 1,000 miles of the \n     Scorpion's last reported position.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/23/senate-section/article/S3150-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3150-S3151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AVIATION SAFETY PROTECTION ACT\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise today to share with my \ncolleagues an article written by Max Rowe. On November 8, 1998, Mr. \nRowe, a guest columnist for the Springfield Journal-Register, wrote an \narticle paying tribute to John Glenn entitled, ``Glenn is a hero for \nthe ages.''\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak for a brief moment about Mr. \nRowe and some of his accomplishments. Max attended the University of \nIllinois where he received his B.A. and law degree (J.D.). Following \nhis academic career at the University of Illinois, he furthered his \neducation by pursuing a Master of Business Administration from the \nUniversity of Chicago. After completing his education, Max went on to \nwork for the Kirkland & Ellis law firm where he dedicated over 30 years \nof his life to his true passion, the practice of law. In 1995 Max was \nelected to the Illinois Senior Hall of Fame, and he volunteers part-\ntime at the Memorial Medical Center in Springfield. On the side, he is \na management consultant and writes for the Journal-Register.\n  I believe Max's life experiences inspired him to pay tribute to John \nGlenn, a man whom he respects so much, and a man who will keep \nwithstanding the test of time, much like himself. John Glenn, one of \nhis all-time heroes and someone I have had the honor to serve with in \nthe Senate, is an inspiration to so many people in so many ways. To \nsome he is a husband, a father, a grandfather, an astronaut, a United \nStates Senator, or a Presidential candidate, but to all of us he is a \ntrue American hero.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of Max Rowe's article, \n``Glenn is a hero for the ages,'' be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n         [From the Springfield Journal-Register, Nov. 8, 1998]\n\n                      Glenn is a Hero for the Ages\n\n                             (By Max Rowe)\n\n       One of my all-time heroes is former and present astronaut \n     John Glenn, who is now 77 years old and has just completed a \n     mission with six other astronauts on the space shuttle \n     discovery.\n       We senior citizens and those of you over 50 remember well \n     when John Glenn blasted off Cape Canaveral into Earth orbit \n     on Friendship 7 almost 37 years ago. In that five-hour \n     mission he would orbit the Earth three times at an altitude \n     of 100 miles, traveling at over 17,000 mph.\n       From start to finish the venerable and trusted Walter \n     Cronkite covered the flight on our TVs, using words only, as \n     there were no sophisticated cameras at Cape Canaveral or on \n     board Glenn's space ship that could cover the actual flight. \n     At lift-off Cronite yelled, ``Go, baby!''\n       On board Friendship 7, John Glenn had only one simple, \n     hand-held camera to snap shots out of his window. In Glenn's \n     interviews after his splashdown, he kept using the word \n     ``pleasant'' to describe his experience with zero gravity on \n     his flight and his views of Earth. He is quoted as saying, \n     ``This free-floating feeling, I don't know how to describe it \n     except that it is very pleasant. It's an interesting feeling. \n     Sunset at this altitude is tremendous. I've never seen \n     anything like this. It was a truly beautiful, beautiful \n     sight.''\n       Before Glenn's 1962 spaceflight, two Russians had orbited \n     Earth, Glenn helped us catch up with (and eventually surpass) \n     the Russians in spaceflight experience and technology.\n       On the afternoon of Oct. 29, 1998, I sat before my TV \n     waiting through two short delays for the launch. At 1:20 p.m. \n     ``successful lift-off'' put John Glenn and six other \n     astronauts into an almost nine-day space flight on Discovery. \n     What a contrast to his 1962 flight! Discovery has about a \n     dozen high-tech cameras to keep NASA and us informed of every \n     phase of the flight and thousands of controls and pieces of \n     complicated, marvelous equipment to record everything from \n     start to finish. At last we will learn, among other things, \n     the effect of spaceflight on an older person and on the aging \n     process.\n       John Glenn has been a role model for us all his life, \n     serving with great distinction in World War II as a Marine \n     combat flier on 59 missions. He has been decorated with 20 \n     metals, including six Distinguished Flying Crosses and the \n     Congressional Space Medal of Honor.\n       He married his childhood sweetheart in 1943 and has two \n     children and two grandsons.\n       Glenn will retire in January 1999 after serving as a U.S. \n     Senator from his home State of Ohio for 24 years. He has \n     proven it is possible to be a happy and devoted family man in \n     spite of living for so many years with fame and in the \n     spotlight of Washington, DC.\n       I hope every American is as proud and thrilled as I was as \n     John Glenn and his six companions headed off into space on \n     their historic mission. John Glenn's return to space is \n     important to all us senior citizens and to people over 50 \n     years young, who will soon join our rapidly growing senior \n     group. He is verifying that we are not ``over the hill'' and \n     that with proper physical, emotional and mental activity, we \n     still have many satisfying and useful years to live.\n       Before heading into space, Glenn spent over 500 hours in \n     rigorous physical training to prepare himself for his very \n     demanding space journey. Those of you who have been reading \n     my earlier columns will remember that one of my \n     recommendations for living to age 104 is regular, vigorous \n     exercise. For most of us seniors, a 30-minute daily brisk \n     walk will do wonders for our health and happiness.\n       The worldwide interest in this spaceflight will do much to \n     heighten interest in space travel for the rest of us and help \n     NASA's future programs and funding. Let's you and I make a \n     date to fly to Mars in the year 2010!\n       God bless you and keep you safe, John Glenn. You truly have \n     all ``The Right Stuff!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/23/senate-section/article/S3151-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3151-S3152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RETIREMENT OF LSU SYSTEM PRESIDENT ALLEN COPPING\n\n Mr. BREAUX.

Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to \nrise in observance of Greece's 178th anniversary of National \nIndependence. Today, we are here to pay tribute to Greek and American \ndemocracy, and to our shared commitment to peace and stability in the \nBalkans and Eastern Mediterranean.\n  On March 25, 1821, the Greek people initiated their victorious \npursuit of liberty from four centuries of oppressive Ottoman rule. \nAfter nearly ten years of struggle against overwhelming odds, the \nGreeks accomplished this historic request, reaffirming their commitment \nto the individual freedoms that are at the heart of the Greek \ntradition.\n  From the beginning of their revolution, the Greeks had the support, \nemotional and material, from a people who had recently gained freedom \nfor themselves: the Americans. Looking back at their triumphant march \ntoward liberty, the American people followed with affinity the Greek \npursuit for national independence. Since then, our two nations have \nremained firmly united by a shared commitment to democratic principles. \nThese ties were reinforced by thousands of Greeks who came to America \nfor greater economic opportunity. These immigrants and their \ndescendants continue to make their own important and unique \ncontributions to America's economic and political strength.\n  As a nation whose founders were ardent students of the classics, \nAmerica has drawn its political convictions from the ancient Greek \nideals of liberty and citizenship. And just as America looked to the \nGreeks for inspiration, Greek patriots looked to the American \nRevolution for strength in the face of their own adversity. The \nexuberance and passion of a young nation dedicated to freedom lifted \nthe spirits of the Greek patriots, and reminded them of their long-\nstanding democratic legacy.\n  As we enter the next century, it is appropriate that we retrace our \ncommon struggle to build societies based on individual rights, equality \nand the rule of law. During World War I, our nations forged a steadfast \nalliance to maintain peace in the Balkans. During the Second World War, \nGreeks heroically resisted the brutal Nazi regime, defeated Mussolini's \ntroops, and contributed in no small part to the allied victory over the \nAxis Powers. At the Cold War's inception, President Truman and the \nAmerican people committed to helping Greece rebuild their war-ravaged \nnation through the Marshall Plan. Greece continues to play an important \nrole as a valued member of the international community within NATO and \nthe European Union.\n  Today, as one of the few stable democracies in its region, Greece has \nplayed a stabilizing role throughout the Balkans and is helping its \nneighbors progress toward greater political and economic security. \nGreek economic modernization, along with its status as a member of the \nEuropean Union, allow Greece to act as a model for and play a \nconstructive role in the economic well being of its neighbors.\n  Mr. President, the new millennium promises an even stronger Greek-\nAmerican relationship and further cooperation in the areas of our \nmutual interests. Through ties of blood and affection, as well as \nshared political goals and philosophical ideals, Greece has retained a \nspecial relationship with the United States. Therefore, on this \nimportant occasion, it is fitting that we remember this historical \nlegacy and rededicate ourselves to the principles which inspired the \nfree and democratic peoples of America and Greece.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/23/senate-section/article/S3152-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3152-S3153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 CENSUS\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I was troubled by a recent \nreport in Roll Call which details a plan by House Republicans to devise \na media campaign to support their efforts to shut down the government \nin order to restrict census sampling. I ask that this article be \nprinted in the Record at the end of my statement.\n  Mr. President, the census is a critical issue for my State and for \nthe nation. The census count determines how nearly 200 billion of \nfederal funds are allocated. An inaccurate count means that these \nfederal funds are misallocated.\n  According to a recent study by the nonpartisan General Accounting \nOffice, the 1990 census undercounted the United States population by \nabout 4 million people--or approximately 1.6 percent of the entire \npopulation.\n  Many states had undercounts above the national average. California's \nundercount was 2.7 percent; New Mexico's was 3.1 percent; Texas' 2.8 \npercent; and Arizona's 2.4 percent, just to name a few.\n  According to the GAO, 22 of the 25 large formula grant programs use \ncensus data as part of their allocation formula. Those funds are used \nfor our schools, health care facilities, and transit systems. \nCalifornia was the most harmed because of the 1990 census undercount, \nlosing nearly 2.2 billion in federal funds, or 2,660 per person missed.\n  In 1998 alone, California lost 198 million in federal funds for \nMedicaid; 9.4 million for foster care; 3.2 million for Social Security; \n1.9 million for child care and development; and 1.1 million for \nvocational training. Millions more in federal dollars for adoption \nassistance, prevention and treatment of substance abuse, highway \nplanning and construction, and other programs did not flow to \nCalifornia because of the inaccurate census.\n\n  Other states also suffer: Texas lost almost 1 billion because of the \n1990 undercount, and Arizona, Florida, Georgia, and Louisiana each lost \nover $100 million.\n  Moreover, all areas and groups are not undercounted at the same rate, \nand some members of our society are more likely to be missed than \nothers. According to the GAO, 5.7 percent of African Americans were not \ncounted in the 1990 Census. Nor were 5 percent of Latinos and 4.5 \npercent of Native Americans. Of the 835,000 people undercounted in \nCalifornia, most were minorities. Nearly half the net undercount--47 \npercent--were Hispanic. Twenty-two percent were African-American and 8 \npercent were Asian.\n  Such differences in census coverage introduce inequities in political \nrepresentation and in the distribution of federal funds. Because \nHispanics, African-Americans, and other minority groups had a larger \nundercount than whites in the 1990 Census--as in prior censuses--\nminorities and the communities in which they live have been \ndisadvantaged in government programs in which population is an \nimportant factor in fund allocation.\n  This is an issue of basic fairness. Every American should be counted. \nAnd unless we can provide the Census Bureau with our support for an \naccurate census, and do so without any political intervention, then we \nrun the risk of doing a grave injustice to our citizens.\n  Since the failed 1990 population count, the Census Bureau has worked \nwith experts to design a more accurate census for 2000. The National \nAcademy of Sciences, in three separate reports, concluded that the key \nto improving accuracy in the census is the use of sound statistical \nmethods to count those missed during the conventional ``head count.'' \nThis involves detailed ``statistical sampling'' to determine the \ncharacteristics of those who are missed by the head count.\n  But for partisan reasons, some in Congress evidently prefer to ignore \nthe expert advice and plan to shut down part of the government rather \nthan see an accurate count. They argue that sampling is unnecessary. \nUnfortunately, during the Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal the undercount \nwas 6.5 percent for Sacramento, California; 3.1 percent for the \nMenominee Indian Reservation in Wisconsin; and 9.1 percent for the \nentire state of South Carolina.\n  The magnitude of such undercounts and the implications for the 2000 \nCensus that fails to correct the problem are particularly great for \nstates with large and diverse populations, such as Florida, Texas, \nArizona, New York, California and many others.\n  The Supreme Court has affirmed that sampling is required for purposes \nother than apportionment if `feasible'.\n  The census should not be about politics. And Mr. President, I will \noppose any efforts to include any restrictions on the ability of the \nBureau of the Census to conduct the most accurate census possible. \nAnything else would simply be unfair.\n  The article follows:\n\n[[Page S3153]]\n\nGOP GIRDS FOR CENSUS BATTLE FIRST TO HOLD JOB, HE'S LEAVING FOR PRIVATE \n                                 SECTOR\n\n                  (By Jim VandeHei and John Mercurio)\n\n       Fearing the loss of two dozen House seats if his party \n     blinks, Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) has tapped former \n     National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Bill \n     Paxon (N.Y.) to prepare GOP troops for a budget fight over \n     the 2000 Census that could provoke a partial government \n     shutdown.\n       At Hastert's request, Paxon huddled this week with NRCC \n     Chairman Tom Davis (Va.), Republican media strategist Eddie \n     Mahe and others to help devise a coordinated strategy to \n     block President Clinton's plan to use sampling in the 2000 \n     Census.\n       ``I am one of a group of people trying to figure out how to \n     keep Mr. Bill Clinton from imposing his political \n     calculations on the census,'' Mahe said in an interview.\n       The impending battle will erupt in earnest next month when \n     GOP leaders begin working on the funding bill for Commerce, \n     Justice, State, the judiciary and related agencies. During \n     last year's budget negotiations, Republicans and Clinton \n     agreed to put off final decisions on whether to fund the use \n     of sampling until this June, when the results of the Census \n     Bureau's dress rehearsals would be available and the Supreme \n     Court would have ruled on a much-anticipated legal challenge \n     to sampling.\n       The budget fight follows the High Court's decision in late \n     January that the bureau's plan to use sampling in the \n     decennial for reapportionment of House seats violates the \n     Census Act.\n       But according to pro-sampling Democrats' interpretation of \n     Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's majority opinion, the federal \n     government can, ``if feasible,'' use sampling for the very \n     different purpose of redistricting, or the redrawing of House \n     district boundary lines, within each state.\n       Following the court's ruling, Census Bureau Director \n     Kenneth Prewitt said the Clinton administration will seek an \n     increased level of funding to conduct two counts--one using \n     the GOP-backed practice of trying to count every American, \n     the other using the Clinton-endorsed sampling.\n       Meanwhile, Democrats are trying to amend the Census Act to \n     allow sampling for reapportionment, and Republicans will try \n     to place language in the spending bill that would restrict \n     funding for any sampling practices associated with the \n     census.\n       The GOP plan, according to informed sources, likely will \n     include a media campaign against Clinton's plan, which most \n     House Democrats support.\n       It will also include a lobbying campaign to convince \n     Republican Members to stand up to Clinton if he threatens to \n     shut down the government to scare off opposition.\n       ``Everybody knows this is 'do or die' for the party,'' said \n     one GOP official familiar with the nascent strategy. ``We're \n     not going to back down on this.''\n       That spending plan will include a provision preventing the \n     bureau from using statistical sampling, which Hastert and \n     Paxon fear will cost Republicans dozens of House seats in the \n     new millennium.\n       ``The Speaker and virtually every GOP leader believe no \n     single vote will have greater ramifications on the future of \n     the Republican majority than the vote to block President \n     Clinton from changing the way we conduct the census,'' said \n     one Hastert confidant.\n       But Democrats understand that if Clinton backs down, \n     Republicans' chances of retaining their majority will \n     increase.\n       He won't capitulate to GOP demands, according to \n     senior Democratic leadership sources.\n       ``They have never shown any weakness and I don't know why \n     they would,'' said a top Democratic adviser, who insisted \n     White House officials will shut down the government if \n     Republicans refuse to back down.\n       Democrats said the Republican moves show they are preparing \n     to allow this battle to result in a shutdown. A government \n     shutdown in 1995 caused their party's support to plummet and \n     ultimately led to a more conciliatory tone among House GOP \n     leaders.\n       ``They weren't able to convince the American people to \n     believe they were justified in doing that in 1995, and I \n     don't see how they would be able to do so in 1999,'' said \n     Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the \n     Government Reform Committee.\n       ``If they do make it a partisan issue and close down three \n     departments of government, they're going to need to spend a \n     lot of money to try to convince people they're not being \n     partisan again,'' Waxman said. ``And I don't think they're \n     going to succeed.''\n       Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), the ranking member of the \n     Government Reform subcommittee on the census, said Democrats \n     can turn back the Republican budget proposal by appealing to \n     ``at least 10 Republicans'' to support sampling. So far, only \n     three Republicans--Reps. Connie Morella (Md.), Christopher \n     Shays (Conn.) and Nancy Johnson (Conn.)--have sided with \n     Democrats in the sampling battle.\n       ``I truly believe there are at least 10 Republicans who \n     truly care about their constituents and their country who \n     would not go along with this.''\n       But Maloney said the GOP media plan ``wouldn't surprise me. \n     The Republican machine has been focussing like a laser beam \n     on this subject in their attempts to make sure that blacks, \n     Hispanics and Asians are not counted. It's wrong, and they \n     should stop.''\n       While talk of a government shutdown may be hyperbole by \n     both sides, the political posturing underscores how \n     contentious the upcoming budget debate will be.\n       Last Congress, Republican and Democratic leaders ended \n     months of bickering over the census by delaying a final \n     decision until after the election. They passed a six-month \n     funding bill and agreed to tackle the tricky topic when the \n     pressure of impending elections subsided and the Supreme \n     Court had ruled on a legal challenge to the sampling plan.\n       The six-month funding bill expires in June, but Hastert \n     wants appropriators to start work soon, likely early next \n     month, to provide leadership with as much as time as possible \n     to avert a shutdown.\n       In the meantime, Paxon is working with several Members and \n     strategists to develop a plan to win the public relations war \n     over the census.\n       Besides Davis, Mahe and Paxon, House Administration \n     Chairman Bill Thomas (R-Calif.); Rep. Dan Miller (R-Fla.), \n     chairman of the Government Reform subcommittee on the census; \n     and two GOP strategists, Bill Greener and Chuck Greener, are \n     intimately involved in the strategizing, sources said.\n       Paxon's team is considering a paid media campaign to \n     educate voters on the census issue in the weeks leading up to \n     a final vote on legislation and a variety of communications \n     ideas to prevent the PR debacle in the wake of the 1995 \n     government shutdown, the sources said.\n       GOP leaders have not decided who will run the media \n     campaign or who will pay for it.\n       In the meantime, Hastert plans to hand more money to Miller \n     and his census subcommittee to conduct an oversight \n     investigation into how the administration is reacting to the \n     Supreme Court decision on sampling.\n       He also plans to educate Members on the topic and lobby \n     them to support the leadership's position.\n       Davis said GOP leaders don't anticipate more than one \n     Republican defecting, though both Shays and Morella remain \n     opposed to leadership's position, according to their \n     spokesmen. ``And we'll pick up some Democrats,'' he said, \n     though he refused to list any possibilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/23/senate-section/article/S3153-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Madam President, it is fitting that we have passed this \nlegislation to name the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs (HUD) \nWashington, D.C. headquarters after Dr. Robert C. Weaver, adviser to \nthree Presidents, national chairman of the NAACP, and the first \nAfrican-American Cabinet Secretary.\n  In 1961, President Kennedy appointed Dr. Weaver to head the Housing \nand Home Finance Agency, the precursor to the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development. In 1966, when President Johnson elevated the agency \nto Cabinet rank, he chose Dr. Weaver to head the department. Bob Weaver \nwas, in Johnson's phrase, ``the man for the job.'' He thus became its \nfirst Secretary, and the first African-American to head a Cabinet \nagency.\n\n[[Page S3154]]\n\n  Dr. Weaver began his career in government service as part of \nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt's ``Black Cabinet,'' an informal \nadvisory group promoting Federal job and educational opportunities for \nblacks. The Washington Post called this work--``the dismantling of a \ndeeply entrenched system of racial segregation in America''--his \ngreatest legacy. Indeed it was.\n  Bob Weaver was my friend, dating back more than 40 years to our \nservice together in the administration of New York Governor Averell \nHarriman. Dr. Weaver was appointed Deputy Commissioner of Housing for \nNew York State in 1955, and later became State Rent Administrator with \nCabinet rank. It was during these years, working for Governor Harriman, \nthat I first met Bob; I was Assistant to the Secretary to the Governor \nand later, Acting Secretary. Our friendship and collaboration continued \nthrough the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. Later, he and I served \ntogether on the Pennsylvania Avenue Commission.\n  Bob Weaver died in July 1997, at his home in New York City. When he \ndied, America--and Washington, in particular (for he was a native \nWashingtonian)--lost one of its innovators, one of its true leaders. I \nwas privileged to know him as a friend. He will be missed but properly \nmemorialized, I think, if we can get this legislation to name the HUD \nbuilding after him to President Clinton for his signature.\n  I wish to thank Senators Boxer, Durbin, Graham, Hollings, Kennedy, \nKerry, Robb, Sarbanes, and Schumer, for cosponsoring S. 67, and I wish \nto thank the majority and minority leaders for scheduling its \nexpeditious passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my statement, a July 21, \n1997 editorial in the Washington Post, and a July 19, 1997 obituary \nfrom the New York Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From The New York Times, July 19, 1997]\n\n         Robert C. Weaver, 89, First Black Cabinet Member, Dies\n\n                           (By James Barron)\n\n       Dr. Robert C. Weaver, the first Secretary of Housing and \n     Urban Development and the first black person appointed to the \n     Cabinet, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was \n     89.\n       Dr. Weaver was also one of the original directors of the \n     Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was formed to rescue \n     New York City from financial crisis in the 1970's.\n       ``He was catalyst with the Kennedys and then with Johnson, \n     forging new initiatives in housing and education,'' said \n     Walter E. Washington, the first elected Mayor of the nation's \n     capital.\n       A portly, pedagogical man who wrote four books on urban \n     affairs, Dr. Weaver had made a name for himself in the 1930's \n     and 40's as an expert behind-the-scenes strategist in the \n     civil rights movement, ``Fight hard and legally,'' he said, \n     ``and don't blow your top.''\n       As a part of the ``Black Cabinet'' in the administration of \n     President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dr. Weaver was one of a \n     group of blacks who specialized in housing, education and \n     employment. After being hired as race relations advisers in \n     various Federal agencies, they pressured and persuaded the \n     White House to provide more jobs, better educational \n     opportunities and equal rights.\n       Dr. Weaver began in 1933 as an aide to Interior Secretary \n     Harold L. Ickes. He later served as a special assistant in \n     the housing division of the Works Progress Administration, \n     the National Defense Advisory Commission, the War Production \n     Board and the War Manpower Commission.\n       Shortly before the 1940 election, he devised a strategy \n     that defused anger among blacks about Stephen T. Early, \n     President Roosevelt's press secretary.\n       Arriving at Pennsylvania Station in New York, Early lost \n     his temper when a line of police officers blocked his way. \n     Early knocked one of the officers, who happened to be black, \n     to the ground. As word of the incident spread, a White House \n     adviser put through a telephone call to Dr. Weaver in \n     Washington.\n       The aide, worried that the incident would cost Roosevelt \n     the black vote, told Dr. Weaver to find the other black \n     advisers and prepare a speech that would appeal to blacks for \n     the President to deliver the following week.\n       Dr. Weaver said he doubted that he could find anyone in the \n     middle of the night, even though most of the others in the \n     ``Black Cabinet'' had been playing poker in his basement when \n     the phone rang. ``And anyway,'' he said, ``I don't think a \n     mere speech will do it. What we need right now is something \n     so dramatic that it will make the Negro voters forget all \n     about Steve Early and the Negro cop too.''\n       Within 48 hours, Benjamin O. Davis Sr. was the first black \n     general in the Army; William H. Hastie was the first black \n     civilian aide to the Secretary of War, and Campbell C. \n     Johnson was the first high-ranking black aide to the head of \n     the Selective Service.\n       Robert Clifton Weaver was born on Dec. 29, 1907, in \n     Washington. His father was a postal worker and his mother--\n     who he said influenced his intellectual development--was the \n     daughter of the first black person to graduate from Harvard \n     with a degree in dentistry. When Dr. Weaver joined the \n     Kennedy Administration, whose Harvard connections extended to \n     the occupant of the Oval Office, he held more Harvard \n     degrees--three, including a doctorate in economics--than \n     anyone else in the administration's upper ranks.\n       In 1960, after serving as the New York State Rent \n     Commissioner, Dr. Weaver became the national chairman of the \n     National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, \n     and President Kennedy sought Dr. Weaver's advice on civil \n     rights. The following year, the President appointed him \n     administrator of the Housing and Home Finance Agency, a loose \n     combination of agencies that included the bureaucratic \n     components of what would eventually become H.U.D., including \n     the Federal Housing Administration to spur construction, the \n     Urban Renewal Administration to oversee slum clearance and \n     the Federal National Mortgage Association to line up money \n     for new housing.\n       President Kennedy tried to have the agency raised to \n     Cabinet rank, but Congress balked. Southerners led an attack \n     against the appointment of a black to the Cabinet, and there \n     were charges that Dr. Weaver was an extremist. Kennedy \n     abandoned the idea of creating an urban affairs department.\n       Five years later, when President Johnson revived the idea \n     and pushed it through Congress, Senators who had voted \n     against Dr. Weaver the first time around voted for him.\n       Past Federal housing programs had largely dealt with \n     bricks-and-mortar policies. Dr. Weaver said Washington needed \n     to take a more philosophical approach. ``Creative federalism \n     stresses local initiative, local solutions to local \n     problems,'' he said.\n       But, he added, ``where the obvious needs for action to meet \n     an urban problem are not being fulfilled, the Federal \n     government has a responsibility at least to generate a \n     thorough awareness of the problem.''\n       Dr. Weaver, who said that ``you cannot have physical \n     renewal without human renewal,'' pushed for better-looking \n     public housing by offering awards for design. He also \n     increased the amount of money for small businesses displaced \n     by urban renewal and revived the long-dormant idea of Federal \n     rent subsidies for the elderly.\n       Later in his life, he was a professor of urban affairs at \n     Hunter College, was a member of the Visiting Committee at the \n     School of Urban and Public Affairs at Carnegie-Mellon \n     University and held visiting professorships at Columbia \n     Teachers' College and the New York University School of \n     Education. He also served as a consultant to the Ford \n     Foundation and was the president of Baruch College in \n     Manhattan in 1969.\n       His wife, Ella, died in 1991. Their son, Robert Jr., died \n     in 1962.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From The Washington Post, July 21, 1997]\n\n                            Robert C. Weaver\n\n       Native Washingtonian Robert C. Weaver, who died on Thursday \n     in New York City at age 89, had a life of many firsts. Dr. \n     Weaver served as a college president, Cabinet secretary, \n     presidential adviser, chairman of the National Association \n     for the Advancement of Colored People and as a director of \n     the Municipal Assistance Corp., which helped save New York \n     City from financial catastrophe. But his greatest legacy may \n     be the work he did, largely out of public view, to dismantle \n     a deeply entrenched system of racial segregation in America.\n       Before the landmark decade of civil rights advances in the \n     1960s, Dr. Weaver was one of a small group of African \n     American officials in the New Deal era who, as part of the \n     ``Black Cabinet'' pressured President Franklin D. Roosevelt \n     to strike down racial barriers in government employment, \n     housing and education. It was a long way to come for the \n     Dunbar High School graduate who ran into racial \n     discrimination in the 1920s when he tried to join a union \n     fresh out of high school. Embittered by that experience, Bob \n     Weaver went on to Harvard (in the footsteps of his \n     grandfather, the first African American Harvard graduate in \n     dentistry) to earn his bachelor's, master's and doctorate in \n     economics. At another time in America, his university degrees \n     might have led to another career path. For Bob Weaver in \n     1932, however, those credentials--and his earlier job as a \n     college professor--made him an ``associate advisor on Negro \n     affairs'' in the U.S. Department of the Interior.\n       Subsequent work as an educator, economist and national \n     housing expert--and behind-the-scenes recruitment of scores \n     of African Americans for public service--led to his \n     appointment as New York State rent administrator, making him \n     the first African American with state cabinet rank. President \n     John F. Kennedy appointed him to the highest federal post \n     ever occupied by an African American--the Housing and Home \n     Finance Agency. Despite the president's support, however, the \n     HHFA never made it to Cabinet status, because Dr. Weaver was \n     its administrator and southern legislators rebelled at the \n     thought of a black secretary. Years later President Lyndon \n     Johnson pushed through the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development and named Robert Weaver to the presidential \n     Cabinet.\n\n[[Page S3155]]\n\n       For the nation, and Robert Weaver, the appointment was \n     another important first. For many other African Americans who \n     found lower barriers and increased opportunity in the last \n     third of the 20th century, Robert Weaver's legacy is lasting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/23/senate-section/article/S3155-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                LLOYD D.

Mr. President, I have remained after the conclusion of \nthe vote to comment about the vote and about a very significant \nhistorical precedent which was established tonight. The Senate of the \nUnited States took up its constitutional responsibility to make a \ndecision as to whether Congressional authority would be given for the \nUnited States to commit an act of war in Kosovo following a request by \nthe President of the United States for such a vote.\n  In modern times, we have seen the erosion of the congressional \nauthority to declare war. Tonight in the Senate, we reaffirmed the \nbasic constitutional responsibility and authority of the Congress on \nthat very subject, after the President had made a significant request \nfor authorization to use force.\n  This action tonight follows the situation in January of 1991 when the \nCongress of the United States authorized the use of force in the \nPersian Gulf following a similar request by President Bush. I believe \nthat this is of great importance historically as a precedent, to guide \nthe future Presidents, that their authority as Commander in Chief does \nnot extend to involving the United States in war. Where acts of war are \ninvolved, it is a matter for the Congress of the United States and not \nthe unilateral action of the President of the United States.\n  On the merits of this evening's vote, it was a very difficult vote. \nIt was the choice of two very undesirable alternatives. In voting aye \nand supporting the use of force, I chose what I considered to be the \nlesser of the undesirable alternatives.\n  The President in his letter today said that the United States \nnational interests are clear and significant. I disagree with that \nconclusion by the President.\n  The President then went on in his letter to amplify those national \ninterests. Yet the absence of a very strong purpose and reason \nunderscores my conclusion that this is an extremely difficult question \non U.S. national interests. The President's letter continues, the first \nline of the second paragraph says, ``The United States national \ninterests are clear and significant.'' The second line says, ``The \nongoing effort by President Milosevic to attack and repress the people \nof Kosovo could ignite a wider European war with dangerous consequences \nto the United States. This is a conflict with no natural boundaries. If \nit continues it will push refugees across borders and draw into \nneighboring countries.''\n  That is a statement of possibility, but we know that this is \nintervention by NATO, including the United States, in what is \nessentially a civil war. The President then went on in the second \nparagraph to say, ``NATO has authorized airstrikes against the former \nYugoslavia to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and to address the \nthreat to peace and security of the Balkan region and Europe.''\n  The President relies quite substantially upon the ``humanitarian \ncatastrophe'', he may really be saying the use of force for \nhumanitarian purposes, and it may be that this standard is a one which \nought to be adopted. But I do suggest that this may be a departure from \nwhat has previously been recognized as U.S. policy to use force where \nthere is a vital United States national security interest. If we look \nfor humanitarian catastrophes, we can find them all around the world, \nand we have been criticized for not doing more at an earlier stage in \nBosnia. We have been criticized for not doing more in Rwanda. There \nhave been many criticisms leveled against the United States and the \ncivilized world for not intervening on prior occasions. It may be that \nwith such a thin statement of vital national interests, the \nauthorization to use force in Kosovo really reflects a shifting \nstandard. As the President articulates, ``to prevent a human \ncatastrophe.''\n  (Mr. BROWNBACK assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, several weeks ago, I filed a resolution \nfor the use of airstrikes in Kosovo. This was essentially a vehicle to \nmove the Senate of the United States to take up the issue of the use of \nforce, to debate it and to decide the question. It has always been my \nview, as expressed in 1991 in the debate on the use of force in the \nPersian Gulf and, before that in 1983, where we debated the War Powers \nAct with respect to deployment of marines in Lebanon, that the \nconstitutional issue of Congress' sole authority to declare war is of \nparamount importance.\n  I congratulate our leadership today for moving through a procedural \nmorass, where we had a cloture vote--that is, a vote to cut off \ndebate--on the resolution pending by the Senator from\n\n[[Page S3157]]\n\nNew Hampshire, Senator Smith. Afterwards, in consultation, this \nresolution was crafted so the Senate could vote yes or no on this \nimportant issue. As noted by others, we did have a bipartisan vote of \n58-41 in favor of the use of force, with some 17 Republicans joining 41 \nDemocrats, making a total of 58, and 38 Republicans and 4 Democrats \nvoting in the negative. There is a strong bipartisan showing by these \nfigures.\n  It would have been vastly preferable, Mr. President, had President \nClinton taken this issue to the American people at a much earlier stage \nso the American people could be aware of the consequences of this very, \nvery important decision. The President did address the matter in the \nopening remarks on his press conference on Friday.\n  I concurred with what the Senator from Delaware said yesterday--when \nhe and I debated or discussed the subject for about a half hour--this \nwas most appropriately a subject for a 30-minute Presidential speech. \nThe president should lay out the issue in great detail. There is a \nlarge concern on my part, and on the part of many others, that the \nAmerican people are not really prepared for the consequences as to what \nmay occur in Kosovo. There have been forceful statements that the risks \nare very, very high, and that the air defenses in Serbia are very \nstrong.\n  It is important that the American people understand the substantial \nrisks involved so we do not retreat as we did in Somalia. The way to \nguard against that is to build up a public understanding as to what the \nscenario is in Kosovo with as forceful an articulation as possible, and \nI repeat, much more forceful than the President's letter today. The \nPresident should articulate in great detail about the savagery of the \nassaults on people and the brutality and the ethnic cleansing which has \ngone on in Kosovo. Those details, I think, are a concern to the \nAmerican people but they have not been stated in a way which really \nbrings forth the magnitude of the human catastrophe in Kosovo so the \nAmerican people would be willing to accept and undertake the risks that \nare involved in this matter.\n  But all of that is prologue. Now we have the authorization by the \nSenate for the use of force. On a very difficult question, I think it \nis the lesser of the undesirable alternatives, and featuring \nprominently is the desire of keeping NATO intact. We seem to have more \nsupport from our European allies on this matter than at any time in the \npast. Our precarious position on NATO has occurred because the \nadministration has moved us into a position without congressional \nauthorization to an executive commitment really, in effect, to support \nthe NATO decision to use force in Kosovo.\n  To that extent, so that we do not have a breach of making NATO look \nbad and do not have a breach of making the United States look bad, \nwhich would in effect be a backdown, we are in a sense backing into the \nissue. But the more important aspect is the fact that the President did \ncome to the Senate.\n  I was interested in the discussion with our distinguished senior \nSenator from West Virginia and to hear his comment where he had \nexpressed to the President today the view that the President should not \nlean so heavily on Presidential prerogatives but should ask the \nCongress of the United States for authority to use force. The President \nhas done so.\n  Now we have a very significant precedent which should be a clarion \ncall to future Presidents not to exercise their authority as Commander \nin Chief and unilaterally engage the United States in war. The \nPresident should take this issue to the Congress of the United States \nand to the American people. The President should do this at an early \ntime so the issue can be fully debated, not on a short time limit, as \nwe had this evening.\n  It must be a source of some wonderment to people who were watching on \nC-SPAN II to see such an important issue debated in such a brief period \nof time with 2 minutes allotted to Senators to speak on the subject and \n1 minute taken by the manager, the Senator from Delaware. There had \nbeen extensive debate yesterday, but we could have used even more time. \nUnfortunately, we were caught in the press with the budget resolution, \nwhich is first on the docket for tomorrow.\n  I thank the Chair for setting this extra overtime.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/23/senate-section/article/S3157-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
