Mr. President, we are facing a deadline this week--\nOctober 1. Every family in America knows about deadlines: April 15, you \nhad better get your taxes in. A deadline is coming for shopping for \nChristmas, for Hanukkah. We are faced with many deadlines. October 1 is \nanother deadline; that is our fiscal year. If Congress does nothing \nelse during the course of a session, we are supposed to pass spending \nbills so when the fiscal year starts, the agencies know how much money \nthey have and can go about the business of conducting their affairs and \nmanaging the Government.\n  Now, I will have to be honest with you; in the 17 years I have been \non Capitol Hill, in the House and Senate, rarely, if ever, has any \nparty in control of the Senate or the House really met that deadline, \nhad everything in place by October 1. Sometimes it takes a little extra \ntime to put it together. But I would have to tell you that in my \nexperience on the Hill, I can never recall a time when we reached \nOctober 1, as we will this week, with such chaos. There appears to be \nno plan in place, no conversation between the leaders on Capitol Hill \nand the White House, and we will be asked today to vote on what is \ncalled a continuing resolution; that is, an extension of about 3 weeks \nso we can continue the business of Government while the leaders of the \nHouse and Senate get down to the business of leading. I hope that \nhappens because, frankly, to date, we have seen precious little \nleadership when it comes to the important issues facing our country.\n\n  I am going to yield the floor at this point to my colleague from the \nState\n\n[[Page S11522]]\n\nof Washington, Mrs. Murray, who is a member of the Labor-HHS \nappropriations subcommittee, a very important subcommittee when it \ncomes to spending money for education. She comes to the Senate floor \nspeaking not only as a Senator from Washington but as a former \nclassroom teacher. So her perspective on education and what we are \ndoing to either meet our obligations or fail to meet them is especially \nimportant.\n  At this point, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield to the \nSenator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair and my colleague from Illinois for \ndefining for us what our challenge is in this week as we reach the \nOctober 1 deadline and our commitment to make sure the budget is \nenacted and appropriations bills are passed. Clearly, we are going to \nbe unable to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/28/senate-section/article/S11522-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11522-S11524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LABOR-HHS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, what is most appalling to me is that we \nhave left the Labor, Health, and Human Services bill to the very last. \nThis bill is extremely important to every family in this country. It \nfunds everything from health care to NIH research to education, key \nprograms that we are responsible for at the Federal level, being a \npartner in making sure every child in this country gets an education so \nthey can be successful.\n  Last night, we referenced the Subcommittee on Labor, Health, and \nHuman Services. We were unable to offer any amendments, and I was \ndisappointed in that. I was pleased that the Republicans put forward a \nbudget that does appear--and I use the word ``appear''--to fund \neducation at much better levels than the House, and we are grateful for \nthat. We have been out here on the floor innumerable times saying \neducation is a top priority and in this budget we want to make sure \nthat happens. Surely our colleagues have listened to this, and the \nnumbers on the paper show they have. However, what is underneath those \nnumbers is very disconcerting to me, and it should be very \ndisconcerting to every parent and every family across this country.\n  Let me talk for a minute about a very important initiative we passed \nlast year to reduce class size in the first, second, and third grades.\n  It was a bipartisan effort. We negotiated with our Republican \ncolleagues. Every Member in the Senate and House voted for it and \nagreed with us that reducing class size would make tremendous gains in \neducation across this country. In the budget that is put forward that \nthe Labor Committee will be hearing this afternoon, I do not see any \nclass-size money. This money has been taken away. The 30,000 new \nteachers who have been hired this year who are in our classrooms \nlooking our children in the eyes as we speak will be fired if we pass \nthis Labor bill as it now appears before us.\n  I do see $1.2 billion for something called teacher assistance \ninitiative. We have no idea what that is. Clearly, it is not class-size \nreduction. We do not have any idea what it is, and it is subject to \nauthorization, meaning essentially those dollars will never come \nforward. If that is the case, this bill is terribly underfunded when it \ncomes to education and the needs of families across our country. But I \nam very concerned that the class-size money has been taken out of this \nbudget.\n  I simply cannot support going out and firing 5,000 teachers across \nthis country. These teachers are in place today. This was a commitment \nwe made in the Senate 1 year ago when we told them we were going to \nwork with them to reduce class size.\n  Why did we say we wanted to reduce class size? Because we know that \nstudents from small classes enroll in more college-bound courses such \nas foreign languages, advanced math, and science. This has been proven. \nWe know students in small class sizes in first, second, and third \ngrades have higher grade point averages. We know they have fewer \ndiscipline problems. And we know they have lower drop-out rates.\n  We knew that last year so we said as a Federal Government we were \ngoing to begin a process of hiring 100,000 new teachers across this \ncountry so students in the first, second, and third grade can have the \nattention they need and the teacher time they need to learn the basic \nskills of English, math, and science. We know those kids who come from \nthose classes will do better.\n  Smaller class sizes mean higher grades, more kids will be able to \ncompete when they graduate from high school, more kids will be \nsuccessful, and more students will less likely have discipline problems \nand, as we all know, turn to violence as a means of making their voices \nheard.\n  We are going to fight for class size on this side of the aisle. We \nwant those teachers who have been hired and those children in those \nclassrooms to know what we said a year ago will not be taken away \nbecause it is a new year. We want them to know we are committed to \neducation, we are committed to being the partner we are supposed to be, \nand it is not just for today, it is for tomorrow.\n  Numbers and rhetoric on a piece of paper do not educate a child. \nMaking sure our kids are in classes that are small enough and that we \nhave the dollars and commitment is critical, and making sure school \nconstruction is part of what we do--and there is no money in this bill \nfor school construction--and making sure each child knows we care about \nthem is critical. The Senator from California has been out on the floor \nmany times to talk about afterschool programs, which are funded in this \nbill but less than what the President requested.\n  We are pleased the Republicans have brought us a budget with the \nnumbers on a piece of paper, but we want to know that those commitments \nare real, that those teachers are not going to lose their jobs because \nof some rhetoric on the floor this year and smoke and mirrors and no \nfunding, and we do not know how it is all going to happen in the end \nand, gee, 6 months from now, gosh, the program is gone. We want it \nreal, we want language now, we want numbers now, and we want to tell \nour kids we care about them in a manner that is true. That is for what \nthe Democrats are going to be fighting. I thank my colleagues on this \nside of the aisle.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my colleague yield for a few questions?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. First, I thank the Senator from Illinois for setting the \nstage for this conversation, and I thank him for yielding such time as \nshe needed to the Senator from Washington because, as he has stated, \nshe has been a leader in this whole area of education.\n  Education, in my view, is the No. 1 issue in this country today. Why? \nBecause we know that if we do not give our children a good education, a \nseries of bad things happen: They will not be productive, they will \ndrop out, they will get into trouble, and all the rest.\n  We are now in the global marketplace. We all know this. I daresay \neveryone on both sides of the aisle says that education is important. I \nwant to probe my friend a little bit because she sits on that all-\nimportant appropriations subcommittee on education. I want to make sure \nI understand exactly what she has told the Senate.\n  My understanding is that the Senate, on paper, is spending more than \nthe House and even exceeds the President's number on paper; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is correct. If one looks at the numbers, that is \nwhat it looks like.\n  Mrs. BOXER. But is it not true that out of that increase there is \n$1.2 billion for a program that does not exist and the funds will not \nbe spent unless the program is authorized? And is it not true that $1.2 \nbillion is supposed to replace the lower classroom size initiative that \nmy friend has been pushing in the Senate?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from California is absolutely correct. They \ntook the number of $1.2 billion, which we passed last year and were \nsupposed to continue this year, to reduce class size, only our \ncommitment was to increase that to $1.4 billion so we would add on to \nthose 30,000 teachers until we reached our verbal commitment of having \n100,000 new teachers.\n  On paper, they took the $1.2 billion and put it into something called \nteacher assistance initiative. I have never heard of that. I do not \nknow what it is. I have seen no language about it. I can tell my \ncolleague one thing: sitting on the education committee in the Senate, \nit is not a program anyone knows about, and the language in the bill \nsays\n\n[[Page S11523]]\n\nit is authorized, meaning we are going to have to go through hearings, \npass a bill through the Senate and the House, and have it signed by the \nPresident before we leave in a few short weeks, and I just do not see \nthat happening. Really it is smoke and mirrors.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It seems as if there is a shell game being played with \nmoney that is not behind the piece of paper, and they have completely \nzeroed out this important class-size reduction plan which we began.\n  Is my friend saying to me that unless we can change that, school \ndistricts are going to have to fire teachers? Can my friend elaborate \non that? How many teachers is it, and is it all around the country?\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct. If this bill passes as written \nand we go home, what will happen is next year, beginning in September, \nthose 30,000--it is actually 29,000--teachers who have been hired will \nno longer be there.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So this bill that purports to do something for our \nchildren, in essence, is a pink slip for 29,000 teachers across this \ncountry who were hired under the Clinton-Murray initiative to lower \nclassroom size; is that correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from California is correct. I was out in one \nof my school buildings last Monday, a school in Tacoma, where they have \ntaken their class-size money for first, second, and third grades and \nput it all into the first grade, and the first grade teachers have 15 \nstudents.\n  Each one of those kids in those 57 classrooms will read at the end of \nthis year. You can see it in 10 days of classroom instruction. These \nkids were moving ahead rapidly, and they were going to be reading. \nContrast that with a class of 30 kids where maybe part will be able to \nread at the end of the year and, obviously, some will not. They move on \nto second grade, and the second grade teacher starts all the way back \nat the beginning with the kids who are at the bottom.\n  These 57 classrooms and those 15 kids in each of those classrooms \nwill know how to read, and that second grade teacher next year can move \nthem on from there. It is going to make a tremendous difference.\n  Those teachers pleaded with me not to lose funds so they can continue \nto do the job they have been trained to do.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If we do not make changes and if the President does not \nprevail with the Republicans and this bill passes as it is, we will not \nonly lose 29,000 teachers out of the classrooms, but next year a lot of \nthose kids who were in classroom sizes of 15 will now find themselves \nin classroom sizes of 30, and we are back to where we were and we have \nwiped out this advantage we have given some of our children.\n  I have two more other questions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That will take away the promise we have given to \nstudents across this country, and their families, that we are going to \ninvest in education. Essentially, this $1.2 billion put in there as a \nteacher assistance initiative will never go out to districts, never be \nseen, and everyone will lose.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think it gets back to what our colleague from Illinois \nsaid: There is a lot of chaos. Imagine the chaos. Last year we passed \nthis school reduction effort, and then we turn around--the Republicans \ndo--and walk away from it. Talk about chaos--chaos on Capitol Hill \nbecause we do not know what we are doing, chaos in the classrooms--a \nterrible message.\n  I have two other areas I want to ask the Senator about. One that she \nmentioned is very near and dear to my heart, which is afterschool care. \nWe know it works. We know that juvenile crime peaks at 3 o'clock and \nstarts to go down at 6 or 7 in the evening when the kids go home. We \nknow if they do not have a place to go after school, they get in \ntrouble.\n  All of these things are so obvious. The smaller class sizes--it does \nnot take a degree in sociology or education or psychology to understand \nif a teacher can give you one-on-one help, you are going to do better. \nIf you have a safe place to go after school, you are not going to get \nin trouble. Again, we can track academic performance.\n  In this bill, the Republicans did put more money into afterschool \ncare, but they underfunded it by $200 million less than the President's \nrequest. The President requested $600 million; they came in with $400 \nmillion. That $200 million affects thousands and thousands and \nthousands of children.\n  I know my friend taught in the classroom. I know how she supports \nafterschool care. Is it not a fact, I say to my friend, that she was \nunable to offer an amendment on afterschool care or school construction \nor smaller class sizes, that she was prohibited by the Republicans \nunder the rules of their markup?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from California is correct. We did not even \nvote. We are moving to full committee this afternoon, and I intend to \noffer my amendments. I hope my colleagues will support us. If they \ndon't, we are going to be debating this again and again and again.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Exactly.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Because the investments we make in our children, as the \nSenator from California knows, pay dividends far into the future. \nPutting down numbers on a piece of paper--that is not reality, that \ndoes not provide teachers, that does not provide classroom space, that \ndoes not provide afterschool care--does not mean anything to anybody.\n  We want to make sure the budgets we pass are real, that they are \nfunded in reality, that those programs are there, and that this country \nmakes sure that our kids get the education we ought to be providing in \nour schools.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The last question I have for my friend is in regard to \nschool construction. I read in the paper today that the President was \nin a school in Louisiana. It was a school that was built before the \nturn of the century. The school is falling down. The tiles are falling \ndown from the ceiling. When it rains, the rain comes into the \nclassrooms.\n  It reminded me of a school I visited in Sacramento where the same \nthing was happening. I could not believe it. We were in the gym, I say \nto my friend from Washington, and I looked at the ceiling. Tiles were \ngone. I said to a construction worker: What has happened to the tiles \non the ceiling? He said: They fell down. I said: Do they ever hit a \nstudent? He said: Yes.\n\n  I have to ask my friend, what kind of message are we sending to our \nkids when, on the one hand, we say to them as parents that education is \ncrucial to them in this incredibly important global marketplace where \nthey are in competition with students from Europe and Asia and all over \nthe world, and then we send them to a school where the tiles are \nfalling on their heads? Can my friend tell me again, how much do the \nRepublicans have in their education bill for this important and worthy \nproject of school construction and fixing up our schools? How much do \nthey put in?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from California is correct. There is zero \nfor school construction. What kind of message is that for our young \nkids, who are sitting in public schools, to show that we care about \nthem, and that we are paying attention to them, and that we believe \ntheir education is important.\n  It is hard to pass that message along when you are sitting in \nclassrooms with a leaky roof, with no new desks, with materials that \nare inappropriate, that are not good for education. A child goes home \nand says: The adults in my world don't care about me.\n  We all know the results of that. There is not a dime in this bill for \nschool construction.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So in my sum up, from what I get from the Senator from \nWashington, there is no money for school construction, there is no \nmoney for class size reduction, and there is $200 million less for \nafterschool care.\n  I say to my friend, please, when you are in that committee this \nafternoon, do what you did on the floor; lay out the situation. I hope \nall of America is going to learn that despite the moving of the numbers \nand the smoke and mirrors and all the rest of it, the things that need \nto be done are not done in this bill.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from California and urge all of our \ncolleagues to look at this and past rhetoric and put the numbers in \nreality for our children in our country.\n  I yield my time back to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n\n[[Page S11524]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair for that information.\n  Four years ago, we had a Government shutdown. Congress failed so \nmiserably in its responsibilities to fund the agencies of Government, \nwe actually shut down agencies. We sent Federal employees home. They \nwere paid later on even for the time they missed. We barred the door \nwhen they wanted to come back to work, and the Republican leaders in \nCongress said: We're going to prove a point.\n  They certainly did. They proved they could not pass the spending \nbills on time; they could not maintain the orderly flow of Government \nservices to the people of America. That was 4 years ago.\n  You would think that over time the Republican leadership in the House \nand Senate would have learned from that experience. Last year, we had a \nlittle different experience. In the closing minutes of the session, we \nwere presented with a 4,000-page budget bill, an appropriations bill, \nwhich literally no Member of Congress was able to read, and we were \ntold: Take it or leave it. We either pass this and go home or sit \naround here for weeks, if not months.\n  The bill passed. A lot of us, with regret, voted for it saying: What \nis the alternative?\n  This year, we are going into a new phase, a new chapter in the \nRepublican congressional leadership when it comes to budgetary \nresponsibility. October 1--this week on Friday--is the new fiscal year. \nIt is, in fact, Republican Responsibility Day. As leaders in Congress, \nthey are responsible for passing spending bills or at least charting \nout a course so we can see an orderly process to result in spending and \nbudget bills that do serve America.\n  As I stand here today, we do not have it. We will pass a continuing \nresolution which says we will continue Government for another 3 weeks, \nwith no end in sight. Neither the leaders on Capitol Hill nor anyone on \nthe Republican side have suggested how we are going to end this.\n  Instead, to quote a friend of mine with whom I served in the House, \nCongressman Dave Obey of Wisconsin, we hear the Republican leadership \nposing for holy pictures as they stand and say: We will not breach the \ncaps on spending which led to the balanced budget. And we certainly \nwill never touch the Social Security trust fund.\n  The facts do not back that up. What we find is they have broken the \ncaps already. They have already reached deep into the Social Security \ntrust fund to fund their favorite projects, and we still have no end in \nsight.\n  It is one thing to beat your chest and say you are going to stand up \nfor certain principles, but it is hollow rhetoric when you cannot \nproduce the spending bills.\n  You heard the Senator from Washington and the Senator from \nCalifornia. Imagine, if you will, in this time of prosperity, when the \nRepublicans have said we are so awash in money in Washington that we \ncan offer a $792 billion tax cut--and thank goodness the President did \nnot sign that and explained it to the American people--at the same time \nthe Republicans are calling for a massive tax cut, primarily for \nwealthy people, they cannot fund education, sending 29,000 teachers \nhome.\n  Imagine families across America that get a note from the school \nsaying: Mrs. Smith will not be here next year. She may not be here next \nmonth because Congress failed to continue a program to provide teachers \nin our school, teachers to make sure that class sizes are smaller.\n\n  Is that what this is all about, that we have gone on for month after \nweary month with all of this rhetoric in Washington, and at the end of \nthe day we are going to send 29,000 teachers home and say to the \nschools: You have no choice but to increase the enrollment in each one \nof your classrooms.\n  That is as good as we can do for all the billions of dollars that we \nhave to spend. I don't think so. I certainly hope the Republican \nleadership will sit down with the Democrats and the President and work \nout something that is good for the Nation and good for families across \nour country that are concerned about quality schools and quality health \ncare.\n  I visited St. Francis Hospital in Peoria, IL, yesterday, a wonderful \nhospital that has faced Medicare cuts that, frankly, threaten this \nteaching hospital, this safety-net hospital, another item we have to \naddress and should address before we go home.\n  I didn't run for the House and for the Senate to come here and punch \nthe clock on my pension. I came here to work on the issues that are \nimportant to people in Illinois and across the Nation. To date, this \nCongress has failed miserably when it comes to addressing those issues, \nwhether it is education or health care, the basic things we expect.\n  We had the Columbine School massacre a few months ago; it shocked the \nNation. We passed a juvenile justice bill because Vice President Gore \ncame and broke the tie. We said we need sensible gun control, \nbackground checks, to make sure fugitives, felons, and stalkers don't \nget their hands on guns. We passed that bill over to the House, and it \ndisappeared, never seen again.\n  We are now in another school year. We still want safe schools. We \nstill want sensible gun control. This Congress has failed miserably \nwhen it comes to bringing that issue through, passing a law, and \nsending it to the President. It hasn't happened.\n  Time and again we have made the speeches; we have punched the clock; \nwe have gone home without meeting our responsibilities. If last year's \nCongress was a do-nothing Congress, this Congress has done less, less \nto meet the challenges the American people have given to us, challenges \nwhich include a responsible budget, education, and health care, \nchallenges which include, of course, a Patients' Bill of Rights so \nthose who have health insurance through managed care companies have a \ndecision made by a doctor and not by an insurance bureaucrat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today, along with my distinguished \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, to discuss legislation we \nintroduced in July concerning prescription drug coverage. The \nlegislation is known as the Seniors Prescription Insurance Coverage \nEquity Act, or SPICE.\n  We have come to the floor to address a number of questions that have \nbeen raised with respect to our legislation. We want to answer some of \nthose questions so the Members of this body can be informed in terms of \nwhat our legislation is all about on this most critical issue.\n  I am also pleased to announce Representatives Roukema and Pallone \nhave introduced a companion bill to our legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I have always believed, as being part of the elective process, we \nhave an obligation to serve the people by addressing the problems that \nare the most immediate and most critical. We are not here solely for \nthe purpose of creating issues so our parties can run on those issues \nin the next election. Yet it seems all too often now Congress is only \nfocusing on the difference between the two parties, the difference \nbetween Congress and the President, instead of focusing on how we can \nachieve a consensus on the most significant issues facing this country, \nwhere we can make a meaningful difference in the lives of our \nconstituents. The people of this country rightfully expect us to \nlegislate good public policy on those issues, to address problems \nfacing this country.\n  Yet, time and again, it seems the more critical issues we face in \nCongress and in this country are the ones that are the most polarized. \nTime and time\n\n[[Page S11525]]\n\nagain, we fail to achieve a consensus on the key issues. The most \nnotable, recently, of course, is the tax cut bill. While we might all \nhave differences in terms of what kind of tax cut bill we should have \nor how much, there was no difference of opinion with the President or \nwith Congress in terms of having a tax cut but, rather, what the size \nof that tax cut package should be. People say to me: Where is it going \nfrom here? I say: That is a good question.\n  Inevitably, there will be another train wreck, and it doesn't have to \nbe so. We ought to be able to demonstrate to the American people we are \nvery serious about creating solutions, rather than issues, as a \nplatform and a basis for the next election, which, by the way, is more \nthan a year away. It is almost as if compromise has become a lost art.\n  So here we are in September, approaching October, closer and closer \nto adjournment, and the only thing that will be falling faster than the \nleaves will be our legislative agenda and the public's faith. America \nexpects us to build bridges and not to draw lines. So often \nbipartisanship has become a joke. It may well be within the beltway, \nbut I can tell my colleagues, in the real world, it is no laughing \nmatter.\n  That is why Senator Wyden and I are taking the floor, not only to \ndiscuss our legislation but to urge the Members of the Senate and of \nthe Congress, and the President, to come together on this most vital of \nissues to our Nation's citizens. That is why we are here, because we \nhave introduced a bill that puts the interests of the American people \nover the best interests of politics, a bill that gives us a chance to \nshow America's seniors and the American people that, yes, we can come \ntogether on an issue of great significance to our constituency.\n\n  I believe that how a society treats its seniors speaks volumes. What \ndoes it say that while America is 4 or 5 months shy of its longest \nexpansion ever in the history of this country, while this Nation enjoys \nan era of unprecedented wealth and prosperity and growth, a third of \nMedicare recipients still have no insurance coverage whatsoever on one \nof their most basic health needs, prescription drug coverage? What does \nit say, when seniors are cutting prescription medications out of their \nbudgets and their lives simply because they cannot make ends meet; they \ncannot afford to pay for them?\n  What does it say when the New England Journal of Medicine reports \nthat poor elderly persons without Medicaid coverage spend about 50 \npercent of their total income on out-of-pocket health care costs such \nas Medicare premiums and prescription drugs? It says: Wait until next \nyear.\n  Wait until next year? That may be good and may be acceptable in the \nworld of sports and elections, but it is not acceptable when it comes \nto America's seniors and a matter of life and death. For them the \nstatus quo is a bitter pill to swallow.\n  Our plan--the only bipartisan one, I might add, in the Senate--\nrepresents a straightforward, comprehensive, responsible approach. It \nwill appeal to anyone who wants seniors to have coverage, to have \nchoice, to pay for it in a responsible fashion, to get it done this \nyear, regardless of whether or not we have Medicare reform.\n  How does it work? Instead of reinventing Medicare, because we know \nthat is complicated and contentious, we created a program that builds \non the existing medigap system, using the basis and the model of the \nFederal Employees Health Benefit Plan, the one that benefits Members of \nCongress and all Federal employees, and we have choice. So why \nshouldn't seniors have the same choices that are afforded Members of \nCongress and Federal employees with respect to their health insurance \nand to this prescription drug coverage?\n  All Medicare-eligible individuals will have the option of purchasing \nthis plan. It will be voluntary, a supplemental insurance program. It \nwill be similar to medigap. We create a board that will disseminate the \ninformation on the choices available. Not only is this approach better \nfor Medicare beneficiaries, but it keeps the costs down by encouraging \ncompetition because we have a potential pool of 39 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries. All seniors will receive some premium support assistance \non a sliding scale: 100 percent for those with incomes under 150 \npercent of the poverty level and under, and then it phases out to 175 \npercent and above to 25 percent, so at least at a minimum 25 percent \npremium support, and 100 percent for those under 50 percent of poverty \nlevel.\n  Individuals will pay for the copayments and the deductibles. The \npolicies will be the threshold standard developed by the board, which \nwill include consumers and State representatives, insurance \nrepresentatives, commissioners, designed with the seniors' needs in \nmind. There will be a number of choices based on the need and based on \nencouraging competition among a number of insurance companies across \nAmerica because of the size of the pool.\n  The question people ask the most about our plan is, Are you changing \nseniors' current Medicare program? No. SPICE will not be a part of \nMedicare. What is more, it is completely optional. Best of all, we pay \nfor it with a reasonable and reliable funding mechanism that would not \nin any way affect the solvency of Medicare or dip into Social Security \nsurpluses, which is a key issue, both on the Social Security and \nMedicare question.\n  Senator Wyden and I, as members of the Budget Committee, last March \noffered an amendment to the budget resolution. At that time we had an \namendment that allowed for the use of surpluses for the financing of a \nprescription drug program, predicated on the Senate Finance Committee \nand the House Ways and Means, to report out a Medicare reform \npackage. This seemed a great way to create an incentive for Medicare \nreform and also a way of financing a prescription drug program, given \nthat we will have projected surpluses of a trillion dollars over the \nnext 10 years.\n\n  But in the event we don't have a reform package--and I hope we do \nwork on it because it is critically important and we should not be \ndeferring this issue, but given the fact that we might not, and given \nthe precarious state of the projected surpluses, Senator Wyden and I \ndecided to offer another alternative of financing a prescription drug \nprogram when the budget came up.\n  We offered an amendment based on the President's proposal to increase \nthe tobacco tax by 55 cents and also accelerate the scheduled tax \nincrease of 15 cents on tobacco. Even though we were defeated on a \nbudgetary point of order that required 60 votes, we got 54 votes. We \nhad a majority of support for financing a prescription drug program \nthrough tobacco tax revenues. It makes good policy sense. Columbia \nUniversity did a study in 1995, and it showed, in that year alone, \nsmoking-related illnesses cost the Medicare program $25 billion or 14 \npercent of the total expenditures of the Medicare program. There is no \nreason whatsoever to think those costs have diminished at all. So we \nthink this is a reasonable, logical way to finance a prescription drug \nprogram.\n  People may have differences and say: We don't want to raise any kind \nof tax, even if it is a tobacco tax. But I urge my colleagues that \nthere are other alternatives. We have to have funding. It isn't \nresponsible to introduce a prescription drug program and have no \nfinancing mechanism. What we don't want to do with the SPICE program is \nto add layers of bureaucracy. We are minimizing bureaucracy by creating \na board that will maximize oversight. But HCFA will not be presenting \nthis program. We will not affect current Medicare benefits, and we \nwon't be affecting the solvency of the program.\n  I urge the Members of the Senate to give careful consideration to the \nlegislation we are offering. It is critically important. We have the \nluxury, so to speak, of deferring issues, but our seniors in this \ncountry--certainly in the State of Maine--don't have the luxury of \ndeferring their well-being. A third of Medicare enrollees have nothing, \nnot to mention the patchwork quilt involved in the coverage for all the \nother seniors.\n  Now, if you think it is acceptable for 15 million enrollees in the \nMedicare program not to have any coverage whatsoever, then fine. But if \nyou are truly concerned about the fact that 15 million Americans have \nnothing, then I urge you to consider this legislation.\n  Some of our opponents have said, well, the lack of prescription drug \ncoverage isn't a crisis; it is a mirage. They\n\n[[Page S11526]]\n\nlabel our bill, and other bills for prescription drug coverage, a \n``solution in search of a problem.'' They use words such as \n``misguided,'' ``regressive,'' ``unnecessary,'' and ``fictitious.'' \nThey say our claims about seniors having to choose between drug \ncoverage and filling their cupboards are simply not true.\n  Ask the seniors in my State and all across this country who have \nwritten to us and said they are cutting their pills in half, or cutting \ndosages, or skipping dosages, and not simply filling prescriptions when \nthey get them from the doctor because they are unable to pay for them. \nThat is the bottom line. It will be a big surprise to older Americans \nif you say it is not a problem.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my colleague, Senator Wyden from Oregon, 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it has been a pleasure to listen to my \ncolleague from Maine. I think she has said it superbly. It has been a \npleasure to be working with her over the last few months. The reality \nis that nothing important in the Congress gets done unless it is \nbipartisan. It is just that simple.\n  What Senator Snowe and I have said repeatedly is that we want to get \nbeyond some of the squabbling that goes on in Washington, DC, and \nreally come together as a Congress, across the political aisle, and get \nprescription drug coverage added to the Medicare program.\n  I think it is especially important now to hear from the Nation's \nsenior citizens. For the last few months, we have been hearing from all \nof these beltway experts. Some of them, as Senator Snowe mentioned, \nhave actually said seniors don't need these benefits. They say, well, \nthis isn't a very serious problem, in spite of the fact that we have \nmore than 20 percent of the Nation's elderly spending $1,000 a year out \nof pocket on their prescription medicine. We have some of these self-\nstyled experts in Washington, DC, going to conferences and programs and \nsaying seniors really don't need this coverage.\n  So what we want to do is take this debate about prescription drug \ncoverage and the need to assist seniors out of the beltway, get it out \nbeyond Washington, DC, and start hearing from seniors and their \nfamilies.\n  Maybe some of these experts have good coverage and that is why they \ndon't think it is important to cover the needs of seniors. Maybe they \nare not talking to their parents. But I can tell you, the seniors who \ncome out to town meetings in Maine and Oregon are saying they can't \nafford prescription medicine and, very often, they will leave an order \nthat has been phoned in by their physician at a pharmacy because they \ncan't afford to pick it up. They are told to take three pills as part \nof their program to recover, but they start off taking two; they can't \nafford that; and then they take one; and eventually they get much \nsicker and end up needing much more expensive care.\n  So we want to make sure in the days ahead, in our effort to pass a \nbipartisan prescription drug bill, that the Senate and the Congress \nhear from the Nation's older people. We would like to say today that we \nhope senior citizens and their families across this country who want to \nsee the Congress pass a bipartisan bill to add prescription drug \ncoverage--we hope those seniors and their families, just as this chart \nnext to me indicates, will send copies of their bills to their Senator \nand their Member of Congress.\n  Right next to me is a chart showing how simple it is for seniors and \ntheir families to make sure their voices aren't drowned out by some of \nthese experts saying we don't need prescription drug coverage as part \nof Medicare. Just as this chart shows, a simple note to a Member of \nCongress, a Member of this body, can help us forge a bipartisan \ncoalition and actually get this done. We hope when we hear from seniors \nand their families, they will support the SPICE legislation. But what \nis really important is that the Congress hear from those older people \nand their families.\n  We think ours is a good bill. For example, under our legislation, \nseniors will have the bargaining power and the clout in the marketplace \nthe way the big health maintenance organizations have, so we can keep \nthe costs of prescription drugs down.\n  A lot of our colleagues, both in the Senate and in the House, are \ntouting studies about how seniors spend a lot more when they walk into \na pharmacy for their prescription drugs than would a big buyer such as \na health maintenance organization. That is true. Seniors get hit by a \ndouble whammy: They can't afford prescription drug coverage. Yet when \nthey walk into a pharmacy, they subsidize those big buyers, the \npurchasers through a health maintenance organization who get a \ndiscount.\n  Well, Senator Snowe and I think that if a health plan is good enough \nfor Members of Congress and their families and that health plan uses \nmarketplace forces to hold costs down, let's use a model such as that \nto serve the needs of older people. We are not reinventing the wheel. \nWe are not having the Federal Government take over health care. We are \nusing a system that Members of Congress and their families know well, a \nsystem that ensures that seniors will be in a position to hold down the \ncosts of their medicine as well as be able to obtain coverage.\n  I am very pleased to have a chance to work with Senator Snowe and to \nspend a few minutes discussing issues with her. I think the big \nchallenge is to get this issue out of the beltway and to work in a \nbipartisan fashion. Senator Snowe and I have been trying to do that in \nthe Budget Committee. There are some who want to make this a political \nissue for the 2000 campaign. We are not naive. We recognize that.\n  Certainly if there were no good ideas to tackle this problem, it \nwould be an issue that would come up in the campaign. However, Senator \nSnowe and I think because more than half of the Senate has already \nvoted for the funding plan that we propose, because we are relying on a \nmodel we know works for Members of Congress and their families, we \nshouldn't wait another 2 years for another election to act. We think \nthe time to act is now.\n  I will address my colleague by way of saying, Senator, what strikes \nme as missing is the voice of seniors and their families. We have heard \nfrom all the experts in Washington, DC. What has been missing is the \nvoices of seniors and their families. I want them to start sending in \ntheir bills and telling Members what they think about the crushing \ncosts of prescription medicine.\n  Perhaps the Senator could comment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I commend Senator Wyden for his idea on \nhaving seniors in this country send their prescription drug bills to \nthe Members of the Senate and to their Representatives. It is \nabsolutely critical for people to understand the significance of this \nissue in the daily lives of our seniors.\n  Doesn't the Senator find it somewhat remarkable there are some in \nWashington saying there is no crisis among our Nation's seniors when it \ncomes to prescription drug coverage, that this is a fictitious problem? \nMy seniors are telling me: We cannot afford to pay for our prescription \ndrug bills.\n  I met with a senior recently who said she is reducing the number of \npills she takes every day because she cannot afford to fill the entire \nprescription. So she tries to make it last longer. That is a real \nstory. It is happening all across America.\n  I find it somewhat amazing people are suggesting it is not a problem. \nOn average, the seniors will spend $642 a year on drugs. That is on \naverage. Prescription drug access in America, for most seniors, is out \nof reach. I think we have to impress upon Members of this body, \nCongress, and the President, this is an issue we all need to come \ntogether on, to work out now, not 2 years from now.\n  People say: After the election. The election is a year from November. \nThen it will be another year, at the minimum, before we can get \nanything passed. That is 2 years.\n  The American seniors cannot defer their health, their well-being. In \nmany instances, it is the difference between life and death. Much \nsicker seniors are being discharged from hospitals today than ever \nbefore. That is why prescription medication becomes all the more \ncompelling and urgent in helping our seniors.\n\n[[Page S11527]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. We know new prescriptions are right on the forefront of \npreventive medicine. What is exciting about the new medicines is they \nhelp to lower blood pressure and they can be helpful in dealing with a \nwide variety of health concerns, including cholesterol and other \nproblems seniors have.\n\n  Could the Senator tell Members a little bit about how the model SPICE \nbenefit was devised? It seems to me the Senator is trying to focus on \nwellness, holding costs down, and making prescriptions affordable.\n  Ms. SNOWE. The Senator raises an important question about the choices \nthat would be available to seniors by creating this board. We look at \nthe needs of seniors. What are the prescription drugs seniors most use? \nWhat is most available? What is out there already for insurance \ncoverage? Where are the gaps? This board will have the ability to \ndevise a number of plans across the board and make it available to \nseniors. Then they can make decisions as to whether or not that plan is \ntailored to their needs, similar to what Members of Congress get.\n  Members of Congress can avail themselves to an array of plans that \nprovide for prescription drug coverage. The seniors in America should \nhave the same choices. We want them to have choices and to avail \nthemselves, as Senator Wyden indicated, to the state-of-the-art, \nadvanced developments in prescription drugs and medications.\n  We did not rely on Government programs, a big bureaucracy of price \ncontrols in order to achieve prescription drug coverage because there \nare bills out there in the House and the Senate that will either \ncontrol the price of drugs or create a huge Government bureaucracy or \nimpinge on the Medicare Program that already has significant financial \nproblems.\n  Could the Senator tell Members how our bill will help seniors without \nrelying on Government price controls but at the same time giving them \nthe ability to have access to the most advanced prescription drug \ncoverage in America?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate my colleague's question. We use marketplace \nforces. We use a dose of free enterprise, how our Federal employee \nhealth plan works.\n  What troubles me is a lot of those other bills focus on an approach \nof Government purchasing the medicine, but that will shift the costs \nonto a lot of other people.\n  I am very fearful that under some of those approaches, particularly \nthe ones in the House, because Medicare essentially would control \nprices, they will shift the costs. What will happen is an African \nAmerican woman who is 27, maybe single with a couple of children, will \nend up with a higher prescription drug bill because that person will \nend up seeing the costs shifted when prices are controlled just for the \nMedicare Program.\n  I think we ought to use marketplace forces, competitive principles. \nThat is what our legislation does. It will prevent cost shifting and \nhelp to hold down costs for all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague, Senator Wyden, \nfor the comments he made. It is critically important to understand the \ndifferences in our approach as compared to others for controlling the \nprice of drugs which will have an impact on the developments that have \noccurred in prescription drugs in America.\n  Most importantly, Senator Wyden and I have come together on an \napproach we think is reasonable both from a fiscal standpoint as well \nas from a policy standpoint. We are allowing competition; we are \nallowing choice. We don't create a bureaucracy; we don't affect \nMedicare. We provide a financing mechanism.\n  It truly is a reasonable solution to a crisis that is facing \nAmerica's seniors. I encourage my colleagues to take a very close look \nat this bipartisan proposal, the only one that has been introduced in \nthe Senate, to talk to Members to see if we can come together so we can \naddress this issue this year in this Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/28/senate-section/article/S11527-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Sandra Day O'Connor was born on March 26, \n1930, the first of three children of Harry A. Day and Ada Mae Wilkey \nDay. After attending secondary school in El Paso, she pursued her \nundergraduate education at Stanford University.\n  Justice O'Connor initially studied economics at Stanford with the \nultimate goal of running her family ranch. She was uninterested in the \nlaw until she took a business law class her junior year. She fell in \nlove with law. Justice O'Connor enrolled in Stanford law school, and \nwas able to graduate with her undergraduate and law degrees in 6 years. \nShe excelled in law school, becoming a member of the Stanford Law \nReview's board of editors and graduating third in her class. While in \nStanford Law School, she met her future husband, John Jay O'Connor III, \nas well as future Chief Justice William Rehnquist.\n  Upon graduating, the only job offer she received was for a position \nas a legal secretary. Unable as a female attorney to find employment \nwith a private firm, she became a deputy county attorney in California. \nSoon after, her husband joined the Judge Advocate General's office for \nthe U.S. Army and was stationed in Germany. Justice O'Connor joined her \nhusband oversees as a civilian lawyer for the Quartermaster Corps.\n  The young couple returned to the United States in 1957, settling in \nPhoenix, Arizona. Within 6 years, the O'Connor's had three sons: Scott, \nBrian, and Jay. In 1958, after the birth of her first child, Justice \nO'Connor and a friend started their own law firm. Two years later, \nafter the birth of her second child, Justice O'Connor became a full-\ntime mother and immersed herself in volunteer work. She was a volunteer \njuvenile-court referee, chair of a juvenile home visiting board, and \nshe organized a lawyer-referral service. In 1965, she returned to \npublic service as an assistant state attorney general for Arizona.\n  In 1969, Justice O'Connor was appointed to a vacated seat in the \nArizona Senate by the County Board of Supervisors. She won reelection \nto the Senate for two successive terms. Not surprisingly, she excelled \nas a state senator, and in 1972 she was elected majority leader. As \nwould become standard for her, she was the first woman to hold such a \nsenior legislative office anywhere in the United States.\n  In 1974, Justice O'Connor was elected to the Maricopa County Superior \nCourt, where she served for 5 years. She was later encouraged to run \nfor Governor, but declined. In 1979, Governor Bruce Babbitt's first \nappointee to the Arizona Court of Appeals was Sandra Day O'Connor.\n  On August 19, 1981, President Reagan nominated Justice O'Connor to \nbecome the 102nd Supreme Court Justice, replacing the retiring Justice \nPotter Stewart. She was the first woman nominee to the Supreme Court. \nShe was confirmed by a vote of 99 to 0, and took the oath of office on \nSeptember 25, 1981.\n  Justice O'Connor's tenure on the Court has been marked by her defense\n\n[[Page S11528]]\n\nof states' rights, equal protection, and religious liberty. Justice \nO'Connor is known as a restrained jurist, a strong supporter of \nfederalism, and a cautious interpreter of the Constitution.\n  She has been described not only as committed and intense, but also as \nwarm and down-to-earth, and a loving mother and grandmother.\n  Last Wednesday, September 22nd was the 18th anniversary of their \nconfirmation as Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and last \nSaturday was the 18th anniversary of the day she took the oath of \noffice. To honor her service to this nation and to the law, Senator \nMcCain and I have introduced a bill to name the new Phoenix courthouse \nin her honor as the ``Sandra Day O'Connor United States Courthouse.''\n  Obviously Justice O'Connor, being extremely modest, has repeatedly \ndeclined my overtures to have the courthouse named after her. However, \nin the face of my continued campaign and my obvious determination to \nsee that she is given the recognition she has earned--and because the \ntimeline of the courthouse's construction and dedication next spring \nrequire immediate action on the Senate's schedule--the Justice finally \nrelented and allowed me to go forward with this legislation.\n  Justice O'Connor's place in history is set: she has been a \ntrailblazer for women in the law--rising to the top in every area in \nwhich she has worked. Justice O'Connor is one of the most important \njurists in our nation's history, It is fitting that a beautiful, yet \nvery functional new Federal courthouse in Phoenix, Arizona, be \ndedicated in her honor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).

Mr. President, I rise today to read a statement I am \nsending to Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman regarding USDA's \napproach to emergency farm legislation. The letter goes like this:\n  ``Dear Mr. Secretary''--Dear Dan, we are personal friends--\n\n     We all agree that we need to get the emergency agriculture \n     bill out of conference, passed and get the assistance to our \n     farmers as fast as possible. In this regard, I am concerned \n     with recent comments you have made regarding how these \n     payments should be funded and made available to farmers. \n     Instead of using the current Agriculture Marketing Transition \n     Act--[and the acronym for that is AMTA--instead of using \n     that] payment system that farmers and their lenders were \n     promised and banked on several months ago, you and others \n     within the Administration have recommended alternative \n     payment plans.\n       In your September 15 testimony before the House Agriculture \n     Committee, you said:\n       ``There is an immediate need to provide cash assistance to \n     mitigate low prices, falling incomes, and in some areas, \n     falling land values.''\n       But then you said:\n       ``Congress should enact a new program to target assistance \n     to farmers of 1999 crops suffering from low prices. The \n     Administration believes the income assistance must address \n     the shortcomings of the farm bill by providing counter-\n     cyclical assistance. The income assistance should compensate \n     for today's low prices and therefore they should be paid \n     according to this year's actual production of the major field \n     crops, including oilseeds.''\n       [Mr. Secretary--] Dan, I know the Administration, the \n     Farmer's Union and some Democrats in the Congress want to \n     change the farm bill in the emergency legislation. And I know \n     some of the budget [folks, I call them] ``wonks'' in the \n     Office of Management and Budget--[I do not mean to perjure \n     their intent, what they do, but they are] sending mixed \n     signals and I know the politics of the issue. [There has been \n     a lot of that.] Nevertheless, I urge you to reconsider for \n     the following reasons:\n       First: The very farmers who need the assistance [and who \n     would receive the assistance] oppose this plan.\n       The commodity organizations representing producers of \n     soybeans, wheat, corn, cotton, grain sorghum, sunflowers, \n     canola and rice and the American Farm Bureau--the very \n     farmers you stressed in your statement--strongly disagree \n     with your philosophy and proposal. In a letter to the \n     chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Ted \n     Stevens, they said and I quote:\n       ``We strongly disagree with that [and I am saying] (your) \n     philosophy. The current economic distress is party a result \n     of the unfulfilled promises of expanded export markets, \n     reduced regulations and tax reform that were part of the \n     promises made during deliberation of the 1996 farm bill. The \n     costs of these unfulfilled promises fall upon those people \n     who were participating in farm programs at that time.\n       [They go on to say, and I am quoting:\n       ``The current AMTA payment process is in place and can \n     deliver payments quickly. The administration costs of \n     developing an alternative method of payments would be very \n     high and eat into funds that should go to farmers. Given the \n     7\\1/2\\ months it took the Department to issue weather \n     disaster aid last year, we are unwilling to risk that \n     producers might have to wait that long for development and \n     implementation of a new farm program and disaster aid \n     formula. Time is also critical for suppliers of goods and \n     services to producers. They need payments for supplies now to \n     stay in business, not just promises that something will \n     happen in the future.\n       ``Supplemental AMTA payments provide income to producers of \n     corn, wheat, cotton, rice, barley and grain sorghum.''\n\n  Again, these are the very organizations, the commodity groups that \nrepresent the producers, that would receive the assistance. They go on \nto say:\n\n       ``Soybean producers will receive separate payments under \n     the Senate language. Crop cash receipts for these producers \n     in 1999 will be down over 20 percent from the 1995-97 yearly \n     average. Producers who have smaller than normal crops due to \n     weather problems will receive normal payment levels. This is \n     better than using the loan deficiency payment program which \n     are directly tied to this year's production.''\n\n  Finally they say:\n\n       ``We urge you to retain the $5.5 billion in supplemental \n     AMTA payments as the method of distribution for farm economy \n     aid in the agriculture appropriations conference agreement. \n     Any alternative would certainly take additional time to \n     provide assistance to producers--time which we cannot \n     afford.''\n\n  My second reason for opposing these alternative plans:\n\n       Changing the payment plan will mean farmers will not \n     receive their payments until next year.\n       The term you used, Mr. Secretary, in your statement \n     regarding the emergency payments was ``immediate.'' The \n     difference between using the AMTA payment system--\n\n  That is the current one--\n\n       and the several alternative methods you have suggested is: \n     Three weeks or 3 months. Or this year or next.\n       Last week, Farm Service Agency official Parks Shackelford \n     said: ``All the king's horses and all the king's men could \n     not get the payments made as quickly as Congress desires.''\n       Well, Dan, last year the USDA was able to distribute \n     payments through the AMTA system in less than 3 weeks after \n     passage of the legislation by Congress. They began on \n     November 3, the date of the election, by the way, and farmers \n     received their payments before Thanksgiving.\n       Last year, in delivering disaster assistance, through a \n     formula developed by the Department, it took 7\\1/2\\ months to \n     receive these payments.\n\n  I say to the Secretary with no disrespect:\n\n       Dan, you are the ``king'' and you have the horses, just do \n     it.\n       Third: No specific or formal plan has been presented and in \n     terms of the actual farming practices, the criticism, in my \n     view, just doesn't add up.\n       Staff on both the authorizing and the appropriations \n     committees tell me no formal plan for an alternative \n     distribution plan has been developed or submitted. What has \n     been developed and submitted, however, is repeated criticism \n     of current policy.\n\n  That has been ongoing for sometime, not only at the Department, not \nonly by one major farm organization, but certainly on the floor of the \nSenate and the House, for that matter.\n\n       However, these comments show either naivete from people who \n     do not understand the current legislation or worse, that the \n     Department is breaking the law.\n       In recent weeks, the USDA and Office of Management and \n     Budget officials have criticized plans to distribute \n     income assistance through the AMTA system.\n       Their first complaint was, ``Payments actually go to people \n     who planted no crops.''\n       I respectfully ask are producers who lost their crops due \n     to hail, disease, drought, or flooding in better financial \n     condition than\n\n[[Page S11529]]\n\n     those producers who had crops to harvest in 1999? Yes, our \n     farmers can receive AMTA payments without planting a crop. \n     That is part of the flexibility of the farm bill. But you and \n     I know, Mr. Secretary, they must plant a cover crop for \n     conservation requirements, and you and I also know that \n     farmers have shifted the crops they plant and the current \n     price crisis affects all crops. I know of no farmers who have \n     quit planting altogether.\n\n  Farmers don't do that.\n\n       Last Friday, you said these payments are being made on many \n     acres that are no longer planted to crops but rather have \n     been switched over to pasture and to grassland. If that is \n     the case, certainly hard hit livestock producers will also \n     benefit from the AMTA payments. But more to the point, you, \n     some in the Department and many of our friends across the \n     aisle have urged production and/or acreage controls because \n     farmers have allegedly planted ``fence row to fence row'' \n     under the 1996 farm bill. The dramatic changes in production \n     figures on major crops you cited arguing the administration's \n     new payment distribution proposal clearly shows the large \n     grain surpluses did not come from U.S. farmers. However, the \n     current AMTA payment plan is, in fact, a paid diversion if \n     the farmer wishes to make that decision.\n       Those who propose acreage or production controls should \n     embrace AMTA payments in that it affords farmers the \n     opportunity to be paid for shifting to other crops or putting \n     the ground into good conservation practices. They won't, of \n     course, because the controls are not mandatory and did not \n     simply come out of Washington.\n       The second complaint we have heard is, ``Payments are being \n     made to those who share no risk in farm production,'' or the \n     landlords.\n       Dan, if they are, both the USDA and the recipient are \n     simply breaking the law. The 1996 farm bill clearly states \n     that payments can be made only to those who ``assume part or \n     all of the risk of producing a crop.'' If payments are indeed \n     being made to those who share no risk in production, it is a \n     clear violation of the law and disciplinary action should be \n     taken for any official approving payments in an illegal \n     manner.\n       The third complaint was, ``The income assistance component \n     must address the shortcomings of the farm bill by providing \n     countercyclical assistance.''\n       I am not going to go into a detailed description of a \n     portion of the farm bill that we call the Loan Deficiency \n     Payment Program--\n\n  And the acronym for that is LDPs--\n\n       but what on Earth is the loan deficiency payment if it is \n     not countercyclical? As a matter of fact, your own Department \n     estimated last week that at least $5.6 billion in loan \n     deficiency payments will be going out to farmers this year \n     because prices are low and the lower prices are, the higher \n     the LDP payments--\n\n  i.e., they are countercyclical--\n\n       even to the point of exempting them from payment \n     limitations.\n\n  That is how much money is going out under the LDP Program.\n\n       How can you get more safety net countercyclical than that?\n       Fourth: The alternative plans that you have proposed--\n\n  And there have been several of them--\n\n     have problems in regard to how they would work.\n       While no formal alternative plan has been submitted--\n\n  And I emphasize the word ``formal'' and specific--\n\n     you have indicated such a plan would base payments off of a \n     State average yield or off of a 5-year production average \n     that farmers would have to prove.\n       On one hand, you are telling farmers their payment will be \n     based on ``actual production yields'' while on the other you \n     state you intend to use the 1999 State averages or 5-year \n     average yields. We both know that widespread discrepancies \n     can occur in yields from one region of a State to another. We \n     do not need western Kansas versus eastern Kansas arguments in \n     regard to equity or similar arguments with any State or \n     region throughout the country.\n       Fifth: Our farmers, and their lenders, will not know the \n     amount of payment not to mention when they will receive it.\n       Any change in the AMTA distribution payments also changes \n     what farmers and their lenders are promised and they banked \n     on several months ago when we passed the bill in the Senate. \n     We should use the current AMTA system where the producers and \n     the lenders know exactly what their payments will be.\n       Finally, Dan, as we have discussed, no farm bill is set in \n     stone and none is perfect by any means.\n\n  Certainly the current bill fits that description.\n\n       That debate is and should be taking place but not on an \n     emergency bill. It has been 6 months now since you requested \n     an emergency bill. To date, I still don't know the \n     administration's budget position, and I have not seen a \n     specific plan. Some within OMB tell the appropriators they \n     want less lost income payments and more disaster and others \n     just the opposite.\n       Summing up, with all due respect, Mr. Secretary, your \n     proposal:\n       1. Is opposed by the very farmers who will receive \n     emergency assistance.\n       2. Will delay the payments until next year.\n       3. Is based upon comments from those who apparently do not \n     understand the legislation (and, I might add, not to mention \n     farming) or if their comments are true, mean the USDA is \n     breaking the law.\n       4. Has yet to be formally presented to staff and involves \n     serious distribution and equity problems.\n       5. Breaks the commitment made to farmers and lenders when \n     the Senate passed the emergency bill months ago.\n       With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, I don't think we \n     should be in the business of changing horses after the stage \n     left.\n\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in what has become one of the more \nunpleasant annual rituals here in the Senate, the majority leader has \nonce again put the Senate on notice that we may soon consider \nlegislation related to the disposal of high-level nuclear waste at the \nYucca Mountain site in Nevada.\n  Since the Senate last considered this subject, the sponsors of this \nlegislation have realized that the Senators from Nevada, and the \nClinton administration, will never yield to the outrageous and \ndangerous--in my view very dangerous--demands of the nuclear power \nindustry.\n  This year, it appears that the industry and its advocates here in the \nSenate have finally conceded defeat, and dropped their misguided \nattempts to require ``interim'' storage of high-level nuclear waste in \nNevada.\n  We have been fighting the ``interim'' storage proposal since 1995, \nand its demise is a major victory not only for Nevadans, but for \nmillions of other citizens, and taxpayers across the country.\n  Some of what remains in the current nuclear waste proposal, S. 1287, \nis reasonable.\n  In particular, I have long supported providing financial relief to \nutilities, and their ratepayers, who are financially damaged by the \nFederal Government's failure to begin removing waste from reactor sites \nin 1998.\n  Under the leadership of Secretary Richardson, the administration has \noffered to work with the utilities to provide such financial relief, \nand several of the provisions of this legislation are intended to give \nthe Secretary the legal authority he needs to carry out this proposal.\n  If financial relief for the utilities was all we were talking about, \nI believe we could pass a bill today.\n  Other provisions of the bill, will, I expect, continue to draw a veto \nthreat from the White House.\n  Should the Senate actually attempt to move to the bill in the coming \nmonths, I will have a lot more to say about the unsafe and \nirresponsible changes this legislation would make to the Federal high-\nlevel waste program, but today I want to focus briefly on one \nparticular provision that in my view is threatening and dangerous and \nthat is the attempt to lower the radiation protection standard to be \napplied to a potential repository site at Yucca Mountain.\n  The starting point for any fair evaluation of a potential repository \nis a fair and protective radiation release standard.\n  Since it is against this standard that the predicted performance of a \nrepository is measured, the health and safety of the public depend on a \nstrict and comprehensive standard.\n  The legislation reported by the Senate Energy Committee, if enacted, \nwould emasculate current law and the Environmental Protection Agency's \neffort to establish a fair Yucca Mountain standard by shifting the \nresponsibility for setting the standard to the NRC, the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, and establish, by legislative fiat, a standard \nfar less protective of the public and the environment.\n  Since its creation by President Nixon nearly 3 decades ago, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency has been the Federal agency charged \nwith developing radiation release standards.\n  The EPA was created for a sound reason, which still holds true today: \nto\n\n[[Page S11530]]\n\nconsolidate the Federal Government's effort to protect the environment \nin one Federal agency.\n  As the lead Federal Agency for environmental protection, the EPA has, \nfor many years, set standards for a wide variety of pollutants, \nincluding radiation, to be applied by a wide variety of Federal \nagencies and regulatory bodies.\n  In addition to its general authority to set radiation standards, the \nEPA was specifically charged, by statute, with setting standards for \nhigh-level waste disposal by the original Nuclear Waste Policy Act of \n1982.\n  Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the EPA is charged with setting \nthe standard, the NRC is charged with implementing the standard, and \nthe DOE is charged with characterizing and building a repository.\n  When the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was amended in 1987, numerous \nchanges were made, but the EPA's role as the standard setting agency \nwas left untouched.\n  In 1992, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was amended once again, and \nover my objections, this time the statute relating to the standard was \nchanged.\n  In an effort by the nuclear power industry to influence the outcome \nof the EPA's work, the National Academy of Sciences was instructed to \nmake recommendations to the EPA regarding the standard, and the EPA \nstandard was required to be consistent with the NAS recommendations.\n  In 1992, Congress nevertheless was still unwilling to set the \ndangerous precedent of taking the standard setting authority away from \nthe EPA.\n  To the disappointment of the nuclear industry and its supporters, \nhowever, this attempt in 1992 to have legislative changes to modify the \nlaw in an attempt to prejudice the EPA's work backfired--the industry \nwas unhappy with the NAS's 1995 study, and renewed its effort to \njerryrig a legislative standard that gutted the EPA provisions in the \noriginal Nuclear Waste Policy Act.\n  Recently, after years of work, and numerous delays, the EPA issued a \nproposed radiation release standard for Yucca Mountain.\n  The EPA is currently accepting comments on the proposed standard, and \nwill continue to work with all parties interested in developing a final \nstandard in the next few years.\n  But supporters of the industry's efforts to target nuclear waste for \nNevada do not want a fair standard. They want a standard so low that \nYucca Mountain, or any other site, simply could not fail.\n  The industry wants a standard that will provide a path around the \nmany failings of the site, irrespective of the effects on public health \nand safety.\n  Although the radiation release standards are technical in nature, and \nquite complicated, the major issues of contention between the EPA, the \nNRC, and industry, however, are not.\n  First, what is the maximum increase in exposure to radiation Nevadans \nshould be expected to bear due to the operation of the repository? And \nthe second question is, should we protect a major aquifer that lies \nunderneath the proposed repository site?\n  On the first subject--the level of protection--the report prepared by \nthe National Academy of Sciences provides some helpful guidance.\n  This exhibit, as reflected in the chart, reflects that range. The \nwhite brackets here indicate the standard range from 2 to 20. The NRC \nstandard, as one can see, in S. 1287, the current legislation, is far \nbeyond the parameters of what the NAS, the National Academy of \nSciences, has recommended. The EPA standard, on the other hand, set at \n15 millirems, is well within those standards. So that is consistent \nwith what the 1992 legislative changes mandated.\n  The exposure levels suggested by the NAS and the EPA were not simply \nplucked out of thin air. Both agencies relied heavily on similar \nstandards established in the United States and by other countries. As \nthis chart indicates, again, at the top is S. 1287, 30 millirems, which \nis far beyond the standard of most other countries; EPA at 15, the \nUnited Kingdom at 2; Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, and \nFinland at 10.\n  Once again, the EPA standard lies well within the midrange of \nstandard practices around the world, while the standard included in S. \n1287, as I indicated, lies at the extreme upper end of the range of \nexisting practice.\n  More technical, but just as important, is the issue of what \npopulation the standard is measured against.\n  For the EPA proposal, the standard will be applied to the group of \npeople most likely to be harmed--using reasonable assumptions regarding \ndistance from the repository, and average eating and other personal \nhabits, the EPA standard protects the ``maximally exposed individual.'' \nS. 1287 would apply the standard to an ``average'' member of what could \nbe a very large group of individuals--leading to the possibility of \nvery large exposures to members of the group who are at greater than \n``average'' risk from the repository.\n  Proponents of gutting the radiation release standard, and of taking \nthe EPA out of the process, claim that Nevadan's concerns are \nmeaningless, and that natural variations in background radiation \nbetween regions render our concerns with an increased millirems a year \nmeaningless.\n  That argument shows a blatant disregard for the health and safety of \nthe people of Nevada.\n  We all live with whatever background radiation we may be exposed to; \nthere is nothing we can do about that.\n  What we can do, as a matter of sound public health policy, is limit \nthe amount of radiation exposure we add to background from manmade \nsources.\n  An ordinary chest x-ray--something we all subject ourselves to when \nnecessary, but certainly don't consider a desirable event to occur on a \nregular basis--results in an exposure of about 5 millirems.\n  Under the legislation reported by the Energy Committee, Nevadans \nwould be subjected to the equivalent of at least 6 additional, and \nunnecessary, chest x-rays each and every year.\n  We don't really know what the full health related effects of this \ntype of exposure can result in, but I doubt that any member of the \nSenate would volunteer to subject his or her state, or family, to that \ntype of risk.\n  Even under the EPA's proposed standard, individuals could expect to \nbe subjected to future exposures equivalent to three chest x-rays a \nyear--a proposal which, while more suitable than the alternatives \noffered by the nuclear power industry over the years, provides little \ncomfort to Nevadans.\n  The second major issue which has raised such outrage by the nuclear \npower industry, the NRC, and their supporters here in Congress is the \nEPA's insistence upon requiring compliance with a separate groundwater \nstandard.\n  Under the EPA's proposed standard, the repository would need to be in \ncompliance with the goals of the Safe Drinking Water Act, which, in \neffect, limits radiological contamination of the groundwater to 4 \nmrems.\n  The proposed Yucca Mountain site lies over a major, if largely \nuntapped, aquifer.\n  Water from the aquifer is currently a source of drinking water for \nseveral small communities in the vicinity of Yucca Mountain; it could, \nin the future, provide a drinking water source for several hundred \nthousand people.\n  While it is clearly not now a cost-effective source of drinking water \non a large scale, it is incomprehensible to someone from the desert \nSouthwest to intentionally contaminate such a large potential source of \ndrinking water.\n  The EPA has been charged with protecting our nation's drinking water \nsources, and it takes that responsibility very seriously.\n\n  It has established standards to protect drinking water sources in a \nwide variety of regulatory programs, including those related to \nhazardous-waste disposal, municipal-waste disposal, underground \ninjection control, generic spent nuclear fuel, high level waste, and \ntransuranic radioactive waste disposal, and uranium mill tailings \ndisposal.\n  All of these, and other, EPA standards and programs work together to \nprotect groundwater resources throughout the nation, and the Yucca \nMountain standard is merely another piece of this important regulatory \nframework.\n  The bottom line is simple: the groundwater under Yucca Mountain needs \nto be protected.\n\n[[Page S11531]]\n\n  The standard proposed earlier this year by the NRC, and the standard \nincluded in S. 1287, encourage the intentional contamination of a \npotentially important aquifer running under the proposed repository \nsite.\n  The EPA is duty bound to protect this aquifer, and has done so in its \nproposed standard.\n  It would be unconscionable for Congress to step in and reverse course \non what has been a nearly 30 year effort by the EPA, and numerous other \nfederal, state, and local governmental agencies, to protect and \npreserve our valuable natural resources.\n  While the Yucca Mountain standard is controversial, this is not the \nfirst time the federal government has gone through the exercise of \nsetting radiation release standards.\n  Most recently, the EPA established standards for the Waste Isolation \nPilot Project in New Mexico.\n  Like the proposed Yucca Mountain standard, the EPA's WIPP standard \nprovides a maximum exposure of 15 millirems/year, and includes a \nseparate 4 millirems groundwater standard.\n  It is not unreasonable for Nevadans to expect the same level of \nprotection offered the citizens of New Mexico--and that is exactly what \nthe EPA has proposed.\n  Fair treatment of Nevadans, of course, is not something that appears \non the nuclear power industry's list of priorities.\n  Unfortunately for Nevadans, the nuclear power industry does not care \nmuch about the justification behind the EPA proposed standard.\n  For the industry and its supporters, the EPA is nothing more than an \nimpediment to their ultimate plan to ship high-level nuclear waste to \nNevada, no matter what the cost.\n  For the nuclear power industry, the test of whether or not a standard \nwill be acceptable is not how protective it may be of the public health \nand safety, it is whether or not it allows a repository to be licensed.\n  Instead of focusing its attention on whether or not the Yucca \nMountain site can meet a fair radiation release standard, the nuclear \npower industry is attempting to rig the standard to comport to what is \nbeing found at Yucca Mountain.\n  This cynical approach to public health and safety has led the \nindustry along a strategy that seeks to undo decades of \nfederal environmental protection policy, and to ask Congress to \nestablish a very dangerous precedent of ``forum shopping'' for \nenvironmental protection standards and regulation.\n\n  Mr. President, Nevadans have the most at stake with the development \nof the Yucca Mountain standard.\n  The health and safety of future generations of Nevadans depend on a \nfair, protective standard.\n  There are, however, broader issues at stake here as well.\n  The integrity of our system of federal environmental protection is at \nrisk.\n  The fundamental reason the EPA was created was to consolidate and \ncoordinate federal environmental protection in a single agency.\n  Reassigning important standard setting authority to a more \nsympathetic agency on the whim of a particular industry could well mark \nthe unraveling of decades of progress in protecting our environment.\n  Should the nuclear power industry have its way with Congress, and \nsucceed in its efforts to undermine the EPA's long standing authority \nto set standards, who is next? Should we start down a path of returning \nto the days before 1970, when environmental protection was a hit or \nmiss proposition for the federal government, leading to events such as \n1969 fire near Cleveland, where sparks from a passing train actually \nignited the polluted Cuyahoga river? I hope not.\n  Some in Congress continue to claim that Nevadans' concerns are \nfoolish, that the shipment and burial of 80,000 metric tons of high-\nlevel nuclear waste are nothing to worry about.\n  Anyone subscribing to that line of reasoning should talk to some of \nthe downwinders suffering genetic and cancer effects from our \natmospheric nuclear testing; or the thousands of children suffering \nthyroid and other problems due to the 1986 Chernyobl accident; or the \nthousands of DOE workers at the Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah, \nKentucky, now agonizing over the effects of 40 years of mismanagement \nand coverup.\n  As Secretary Richardson has said about the situation in Paducah ``we \nweren't always straight with them in the past.''.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has plenty of work to do this fall.\n  Only one Appropriations bill has been signed into law, and the fiscal \nyear ends this week.\n  Inportant measures that most of us agree need to pass, such as the \nBankruptcy bill, or the FAA reauthorization, sit on the calendar \nawaiting action.\n  The nuclear waste bill reported by the Energy Committee is an \nenvironmental travesty which stands no chance of being enacted, and I \nhope the Majority leader will come to the conclusion that we should not \nwaste any more of the Senate's time on this irresponsible special \ninterest legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/28/senate-section/article/S11531-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11531-S11538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n2605, making appropriations for energy and water development for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2000, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2605) have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by all of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 27, 1999.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 1 \nhour of debate equally divided between the chairman and ranking member.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Nevada, my \nranking member, does he have any time problems that would make his \nschedule better if he went first?\n  Mr. REID. I have some things to do, as does the chairman, but I think \nthe chairman should go first.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  We have before us the Energy and Water Development Act, which is the \nappropriations bill for the year 2000. Last night, the House passed \nthis conference report by a vote of 327-87, and I hope the Senate will \nalso overwhelmingly support this conference report.\n  Incidentally, while this is a small bill in terms of total dollars in \ncomparison to some of the very large bills, such as Labor-Health and \nHuman Services, and many others, this is a very important bill. A lot \nof Senators don't know, and a lot of people don't know, that the title \nof this subcommittee and this bill--energy and water development--is \nkind of a misnomer because if you wanted to put in the major things \nthat are in this bill that are of significance to America's well-being \nand security, you would hardly think that an energy and water \ndevelopment bill would have that in it.\n  But this bill funds the entire research, development, maintenance, \nand safety of the nuclear weapons of the United States. It funds the \nthree major National Laboratories which are frequently called America's \ntreasures of science. One is in Los Alamos, NM. The history of why it \ngot started is well known and why it was selected to be up on that \nmountain. A sister institution is in California, which is called \nLawrence Livermore, and there is an engineering facility that is \ndifferent from those two. The other two labs are used to design and \ndevelop the weapons themselves; that is, the bombs.\n  Incidentally, we are not building any new bombs now. People keep \nchallenging us when we put money in this bill, asking us how many \nweapons we are building. The argument is that Russia keeps building \nthem and we are not building them. We are not terribly frightened about \nthat. They build them differently, and they have a different philosophy \nabout how to build them than we do.\n  These National Laboratories are engaged in the mission of maintaining \nthese nuclear weapons indefinitely, without underground testing. For \nall of\n\n[[Page S11532]]\n\nthe history of the building and development of nuclear weapons, the \nState of Nevada could be added as the fourth site that was of \nsignificance for America to keep its weapons of a nuclear nature safe, \nsound, reliable, and capable of doing what we expect them to do. That \nis because we tested these weapons underground, in cavernous \nunderground facilities loaded with all kinds of equipment that did \nmeasurements, and that was in the great State of Nevada. Now, those are \nshrunk because we have adopted a policy, sometimes called the Hatfield \namendment, by a vote in the Senate, signed by the President, which says \nwe don't do any underground testing.\n\n  The question is, If we are not going to do any testing, how do we \nmake sure the weapons are reliable, safe, efficient, and effective? So \nthere is a new concept and these three laboratories, in conjunction \nwith the Nevada underground test site, which does some lesser \nexperiments--not the nuclear blasts--are engaged in trying to prove \nthat our weapons are safe and sound. If parts need to be replaced over \ntime, we are able to know which ones, how, why, and that is called \nscience-based stockpile stewardship--science-based stockpile \nstewardship--instead of science-based underground testing.\n  So we have to develop new kinds of activities at these laboratories, \nand it is about a 5-year venture. This is the sixth year of funding. \nMaybe this year, we will have put it into the lexicon of programs that \nAmerica has on the nuclear weapons side, where maybe it will be \npermanent and accepted.\n  As we discuss the international treaty prohibiting underground \ntesting, there will be a lot of discussion about whether this approach \nis adequate over time to let us sign a treaty that we will never do \nunderground testing again. That will be a separate debate, but it will \nturn, to some extent, on the credibility and reliability of this \nscience-based stockpile stewardship. So I am very pleased we were able \nto fund that at a very healthy level, and I am pleased that we have \nbeen able to get this bill to this point. The House and Senate passed \nversions of their respective bills and had very different priorities. I \nam not critical, but for some time I worried whether we simply would be \nable to reach an agreement because we were so far apart in terms of the \namount of funding for this bill and the amount of money for the nuclear \nweapons side.\n  However, a very distinguished California legislator who has been in \nthe House a long time is Chairman Packard. He chairs the subcommittee \nin the House. We met 2 weeks ago and dedicated ourselves to a \nchairmen's recommendation on all items. I will tell you that I have the \ngreatest respect for Chairman Packard. He is new at this job, but he is \nnot new at being a legislator. Together, we have overcome differences \nthat, had they occurred between two other chairmen, might have been \nirreconcilable.\n  I must acknowledge openly that this subcommittee has a wonderful \nminority leader in the name of the minority whip for the Democratic \nParty, Senator Reid. Senator Harry Reid understands these issues. He is \ngrowing, and if he is not already, he will be a national spokesman when \nwe get off track, and don't worry about maintaining this nuclear \nstockpile until we have a different world or until we have a different \npolicy about what we are going to do with our nuclear weapons and how \nmany we are going to have, et cetera.\n  So in the conference report before you, we have recognized that the \nSenate is as interested in water projects as is the House, and the \nconference has provided water projects. We all know what those are. \nThey are in every State. They are flood protection projects, Corps of \nEngineers projects, dams and the like; they are the dredging of the \nharbors of America to keep them sound and in an appropriate maintenance \nof depth and the like. We have moved in their direction by increasing \nthe water projects in our bill $415 million over the level proposed in \nthe Senate.\n\n  However, as we have done this, we have been very strict about not \nincluding newly authorized projects included in the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 1999 or any that might be brought to our attention. \nEven those that were authorized in that act are so numerous and so \nexpensive that, if we started to give one Senator one piece of that, \neither Democrat or Republican, or similarly in the House, there would \nbe no end to how many projects we would have to fund.\n  So we stuck to our guns in that regard and we did not put any of \nthose projects, and we did not put in any unauthorized projects, which \nI think many people urged us to do over time, and we are pleased to \nmake that announcement. As I indicated, if we tried to add those, we \nwould be overwhelmed and we probably would not be here today.\n  As we have increased water projects, we decreased funding for some of \nthe accounts the Senate proposed. The weapons activities of the \nenvironmental management, science, and energy research accounts have \nborne a portion of the reduction. I am here to say that we have done \nquite well, and I believe those programs can continue at a pretty good \nlevel, in particular, those centering on science-based stockpile \nstewardship.\n  Finally, we had to deal with a number of very onerous, general \nprovisions in the House bill, and I believe those issues have been \nresolved to our satisfaction. I don't believe, on many of them, there \nis any concern at this point about the way we wrapped them up, be it on \npower marketing or on the nuclear weapons or the laboratories. I need \nto address Secretary Richardson's views.\n  First of all, I am very pleased the President of the United States \nhas indicated that he will sign the Defense authorization bill. That is \nthe bill that authorizes the entire funding for the military of the \nUnited States, which also bears an amendment that will establish within \nthe Department of Energy a new entity, a semiautonomous agency that \nwill be in charge of all the nuclear weapons activity--the most \nsignificant reform in perhaps 28 to 30 years in a department that has \ngrown like Topsy and is filled with programs that don't necessarily \nrelate one to another. We will carve out of it a management scheme that \nwill be far more accountable, reliable, and trustworthy than we had \nbefore.\n  Now, obviously, those specifics in that new scheme are not funded \nprecisely, but they are funded in the general sense, and we hope \nSecretary Richardson and the President will begin quickly to implement \nthat new management scheme so we can show the American people that \nthere is a better way to do it. None of this casts any aspersions on \nSecretary Richardson. He inherited this department, which has no \naccountability to speak of, with reference to secret activities. It is \nvery hard to find who is responsible if something goes wrong. In many \nother respects, it is very dysfunctional in terms of the way it manages \nthings. We have attempted to pursue with vigor some new management \nprojects in terms of major projects.\n\n  Secretary Richardson in his press release of last night said we did \nnot do well enough, we deny that $35 million in cybersecurity upgrades. \nI want to address the situation in two regards. First, in response to \nthe problems at the Department, whether cybersecurity or other \nproblems, Secretary Richardson has taken an oversight approach. That \nmeans more independent, internal watchdogs, security czar, a \ncounterintelligence czar.\n  As many as my colleagues know, more layering at more levels of \nmanagement, while well intentioned, can have the opposite effect. \nMaking watchdog groups responsible for safety, health, or security \nremoves that from the day-to-day responsibilities of the Department \nemployees.\n  I want to address cybersecurity in another manner with reference to \nthe specific item the Secretary raised about not funding $35 million in \nnew money. Let me say what we have funded in that regard: Nuclear \nsafety guards and security, $69.1 million, $10 million over the request \nto protect against physical and cyberintrusions; security \ninvestigations, $35 million, $3 million over the request; independent \noversight, $5 million to support the new office reporting directly to \nthe Secretary.\n  We believe when those are added up, that is about all a Department \ncan assimilate unless one assumes there is a renewed vigor in security \nby overlapping of these new pieces of the Department that the Secretary \nhas announced. We believe when they begin\n\n[[Page S11533]]\n\nto reorganize this, they will find this is plenty of money to do the \nsecurity work under the new streamlined agency. We never intended to do \nanything but fund adequately the notions expressed in the Secretary's \nletter.\n  He mentioned a project in the State of Tennessee, the Spallation \nNeutron Source, a new project of high excitement in the science \ncommunity. It has had difficulty meeting its goals of meeting scheduled \nattainment of construction, and it may very well be a case of overruns \nwhere it will spend more than expected. Nonetheless, it is important we \nproceed. The House only funded it for $50 million. We funded it for \n$150 million. I regret to say I could only split the difference--$100 \nmillion plus $17 million to operate. Obviously, the Secretary would \nlike $130 or $140 million. I couldn't do it. I hope the project can \ncontinue in this scaled-down number. I remain committed. I believe the \nsubcommittee remains committed to it. I think everybody ought to know \nwe will eventually take care of it. It will not be delayed very long \nbased upon underfunding this year.\n  With reference to other matters in this bill, I have worked with the \nDepartment on various issues the administration is considering with \nreference to a possible supplemental request. I suggest it is \nimpossible to fund the Department of Energy request regarding their \ncomputers in the weapons complex. They indicate it would cost \napproximately $450 million next year. That is $150 million per \nlaboratory and $150 million for the production complex. There is no way \nwe could fund that kind of money in these appropriations. We leave it \nto the administration. If they seek this in a supplemental next year, \nwe will look at it carefully. We stand ready eventually to fund that. \nIt is not possible in a budget of this size to fund this year $450 \nmillion for cybersecurity. It is not possible.\n  DOE has also reviewed its fiscal security. I am hearing reports of \nsubstantial costs that may need to be incurred in the coming year to \nimprove fiscal security. However, in our conference with the House, it \nwas made clear we have never before been told cybersecurity or fiscal \nsecurity problems were the result of lack of funding. The problem may \nvery well be more than that and may be a combination of things. We \nstand ready and willing to help.\n  Senators Kyl and Murkowski have proposed, along with this Senator, \nreform in the Department which I outlined early in my remarks. When \nthat reform is made and we begin to implement the so-called National \nSecurity Administration, I will be open to reviewing all costs \nnecessary to ensure our nuclear weapons complex is safe. I am not going \nto try to resolve this problem solely by putting huge amounts of new \nmoney in before we have the new agency beginning to streamline itself \npursuant to the new bill which will soon be signed by the President \nwhen he puts his signature on the defense authorization.\n  Regarding wetlands provisions contained in the House version, I will \nsummarize the conference agreement which I think is acceptable to the \nadministration. It is a very difficult issue, and it is very dear to \nmany House Members. The legislation contains $5 million for the Corps \nto fully implement an administrative appeals process for their \nregulatory reform. This is the so-called 404 permitting of the Corps: \nThe process shall provide for a single level of appeal for \njurisdictional determination.\n  The conferees dropped the language proposed by the House which would \nhave made the determinations the final agency action under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, thus permitting early appeal to the \nFederal court system.\n  The conference agreement also includes language proposed by the House \nrequiring the Corps to prepare a report regarding the impacts of \nproposed replacement permits for the nationwide permit of 25 on the \nregulatory branch workload and compliance costs.\n  The conference dropped language that would require the report be \nsubmitted to Congress by December 30, 1999, and dropped language that \nwould hold matters in abeyance until the report was forthcoming. This \npart of the bill was worked out carefully with representatives of the \nexecutive branch, and I believe it is acceptable to them.\n  I had one other issue I wanted to state here for the Record because \nmy colleagues from the State of Arkansas, Senators Hutchinson and \nLincoln, wanted to have explained a project called Grande Prairie in \nthe State of Arkansas which is not funded in this bill.\n  The Grande Prairie project in Arkansas, which has an overall long-\nterm Federal cost of perhaps as much as $245 million, will provide \nground water protection for agricultural water supply and environmental \nrestoration in rural areas of Arkansas. Funding at $8 million was \nprovided in 1999 to initiate construction. Since the appropriation, the \nCorps of Engineers has used only $3.8 million, with $5 million being \nreprogrammed from the project for use in other activities. This leaves \nabout $1.2 million for use in the year 2000.\n  The Corps has been having problems with local sponsors finalizing \ntheir cost-sharing agreement which is reviewed before construction can \nbegin. Some local interests believe it is cheaper for them to find \nother options rather than to come up with their cost share. For the \nproject to proceed, the cost share agreements must be entered into. The \nattitude of some is, this is complicating efforts to execute a local \ncost-sharing agreement.\n  We have clearly indicated that the Corps of Engineers has not been \nable to use the $8 million appropriated and it is unlikely significant \nfunds can be used in 2000. The conference agreement leaves an estimated \n$1.2 million as carryover funding, and the managers' statement states \nthat the conferees' expectation is that if issues surrounding the \nproject are resolved, conferees expect the Corps to reprogram funding \nback to the project for construction.\n  I hope that is satisfactory. I have indicated the same in a letter to \nSenator Hutchinson, who inquired about this.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 28, 1999.\n     Senator Tim Hutchinson,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Tim: I want to assure you of my personal commitment to \n     the success of the Grand Prairie project in Arkansas.\n       This year's Energy and Water Development Act was especially \n     hard to craft. In short, we simply did not have sufficient \n     resources to fund all deserving water projects at the optimum \n     level. In the case of Grand Prairie, it is my understanding \n     that additional funds will not be needed in the coming year \n     because of the availability of funds appropriated last year \n     that have not been spent due to problems negotiating a \n     project cost-sharing agreement.\n       I've attached the language from the conference report that \n     clearly indicates the conferees' action was taken without \n     prejudice. If additional funds are needed in the coming year, \n     the Corps has authority to reprogram funds into the project.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Pete V. Domenici,\n\n                                  Chairman, Subcommittee on Energy\n                                            and Water Development.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, with that, I am ready to answer any \nquestions. I think it is a good bill. We are within the budget. There \nis no significant increase over last year, for those who were \nwondering, in the total cost. So I think we have a bill that ought to \nget very strong support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am very fortunate to be the ranking member \non this subcommittee because I always have a hole card and that hole \ncard is the chairman of the subcommittee. I say that because not only \ndoes he serve on this very important subcommittee as chairman, he is \nalso chairman of the Budget Committee, which helps when we run into \nmoney problems--No. 1, for understanding the budget issues in their \nentirety, since he has been in the process over the many years of \nsetting the budget, the process that we have here, but the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee also is able to work with the Office of Management \nand Budget, able to work with the Congressional Budget Office, and \nother people who make this bill one that has been able to move through \nthe process. It is a very difficult process.\n  So I say to my friend, the chairman of the subcommittee, the chairman \nof\n\n[[Page S11534]]\n\nthe full Budget Committee, I appreciate very much his including me in \nmatters when I would not have to have been included. The chairman of \nthe subcommittee, the manager of this bill, and this Member, can be \nabout as partisan as anybody can be or needs to be. We do what we need \nto do to protect our two parties. But when it comes to matters where \nyou have to set aside your partisan differences and move forward for \nthe good of the country, I think we have set a pretty good example. We \nhave been able to work through a very difficult process. This is an \nimportant bill--$22 billion. I understand the awesome responsibility I \nhave to satisfy the needs of my State, the needs of the respective \nDemocratic Senators who come to me for assistance, and Republican \nSenators who come to me for assistance; and I understand the importance \nof this bill to the country. This is a very important bill. I repeat, I \nexpress my appreciation to the chairman of this subcommittee for \nworking with the minority in coming up with this bill.\n  This is a tough bill because there are so many very good projects, \ngood measures we were unable to take care of; there simply was not \nenough money. It is hard to go to a Member and say: We couldn't do \nthis.\n  Why?\n  We had a formula set up and you didn't fall within the formula.\n  Why couldn't you do this for me?\n  If we did it for him, we would have to keep doing it for some other \npeople. We set up some standards, we kept to those standards as best we \ncould, and we came up with what we think is a very good bill.\n  This bill deals with many important matters. I believe, as does \nSenator Simon, who served in this body and has since leaving here \nwritten a book on water, that future wars are not going to be fought \nover territory. They are going to be fought over water. In this country \nof ours, we have a lot of water problems developing. This subcommittee \nhas a tremendous responsibility to handle those water problems.\n  We do not have much in this bill dealing with the water problems of \nthe southern part of the United States, but we are going to get them. \nAs a result of Hurricane Floyd, North Carolina has been devastated. \nNorth Carolina has water problems they never dreamed of having. There \nis talk that their different aquifers are being polluted as a result of \nthe tremendous discharge of human and animal waste as a result of this \nhurricane. We are going to get some of those problems in this bill next \nyear.\n\n  I could go through this bill, and it is printed in the Record, and go \nto any place you wanted in this bill and pick projects that we have \nfunded that are extremely important: Llagas Creek, CA; San Joaquin, CA; \nCaliente Creek, CA; Buffalo--Small Boat Harbor--NY; city of Buffalo, \nand on and on.\n  I just recounted a couple of these in alphabetical order. But there \nare many projects we could talk about and we could spend our full time, \nour allocated hour, talking about one of these projects, how good it is \nfor the region, how good it is for the country. We are not going to do \nthat. But I repeat, we could also take considerable time talking about \nprojects that were not funded that are also good for this country and \ngood for the region that we simply did not have the dollars to fund.\n  The Corps of Engineers was founded by our Founding Fathers. It is an \nold institution within the military that is so essential to this \ncountry. In the State of Nevada, we have survived, certainly the growth \nin Las Vegas Valley has been able to go forward, as a result of the \nwork of the Corps of Engineers handling floods.\n  We only get 4 inches of rain a year in Las Vegas. I hear on the radio \nand when I watch television I see in Eastern States you get 10, 12 \ninches a day in some places. One of these storms comes through dumping \nall kinds of water, but we do not get that in Nevada. But because of \nthe Corps of Engineers handling flood control in Las Vegas--we may not \nget a lot of rain but we do not have places for it to drain. That is \nthe way the desert is. So the Corps of Engineers has worked with us and \nwe have been able to divert a lot of floodwater. We have detention \nbasins. We have huge diversion tunnels. The Corps of Engineers has \nworked very hard to make Las Vegas safe.\n  I can remember, going back to the late 1960's, when we had a flood \ncome through that washed hundreds of cars away at Caesar's Palace--it \nwashed cars away. Anyway, we are doing much better.\n  The Corps of Engineers does a good job. They could do much better if \nwe would fund them with more money. It is difficult to do all they are \nrequired to do.\n  The Bureau of Reclamation--I talked about water--this little, tiny \nagency does so much. It does so much for the arid West. The first \nBureau of Reclamation project in the history of the country took place \nin Nevada. It was called the New Lands Project, started in 1902. There \nis good and bad coming from that New Lands Project. That is the way \nthese projects have been, all the way, all over the western part of the \nUnited States. The Bureau of Reclamation was doing a good job, and they \nstill are, but with limited resources. We would like to give them more \nmoney but we don't have it. We would like to keep the budget \nconstraints that we have and we should have.\n  The defense part of this bill is extremely important. The safety and \nreliability of our nuclear arsenal is all within this bill--the safety \nand reliability. We have huge nuclear weapons. They are stored around \nthe country. You cannot just leave them there and hope everything is \ngoing to be OK. You have to test them for safety and reliability. We \ncannot do the testing the way we used to do it. We cannot do it in the \nunderground tunnels and shafts all over the Nevada Test Site. Over \n1,000 tests have been conducted in the Nevada Test Site. Now we have to \ndo it in a more scientific manner.\n\n  This bill does more for science than any bill we have. Computers, we \nhear all that is going on in the private sector with computers, and I \npat them on the back. I am glad we are moving forward the way we are. \nBut this bill is accelerating the development of computers. Very \npowerful computers now exist, but they are going to pale in \nsignificance compared to the computers we will build as a result of the \ncomputer research we are funding in this bill. Why are we doing it? \nBecause we want to be able to maintain a safe and reliable nuclear \nstockpile, and we are going to do that.\n  We are so scientifically correct now that we do not do testing the \nway we used to do it. To make sure our weapons are safe and reliable, \nwe will start a nuclear reaction and we stop it before it becomes \ncritical. But through the work we can do with computers, we can tell \nwhat would have happened had the test gone critical. That is how \nsophisticated we have become. We have to become more sophisticated. Our \nscientists tell us they need more computerization, and we are working \non that in this bill.\n  This bill is important. The chairman of the committee, the manager of \nthis bill, has talked about the wetlands rider. We worked very hard on \nthat. We worked very hard on that to come up with something that is \nacceptable, and we have the assurance of the administration that they \nwill sign this bill. I say to the chairman of the committee, we spent a \nlot of time Friday making sure the administration--Jack Lew was there \nand they indicated they would sign this bill. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I think that is important. Everyone should know this bill \nmeets the very stringent standards, as far as the wetlands rider and \nsome other funding matters the administration set.\n  I also say to my friend, the manager of this bill, there was some \nquestion about the new structure that has been set up within the \nDepartment of Energy and whether they needed more money to comply with \nthe strictures that we have set under the new legislation. I think \neveryone agreed, this conference, if it takes more money, then they can \ncome back. We will have a supplemental down the road early next \nCongress. They can come back to us and make a case that, because of the \nnew legislation, they have been required to do new things that they \nwere unable to pay for out of the budget that they have, and we will \nlook to that with favor. I think that is a fair way to go.\n\n  The path to this year's bill was rocky. It certainly was through no \nfault of the chairman. We spent a lot of\n\n[[Page S11535]]\n\ntime trying to understand what the House wanted. We were able to work \nthat out.\n  I also say to my friend from New Mexico, I came to Congress with the \nchairman of the House subcommittee in 1982. He is a very fine man. He \nis a good subcommittee Chair. He is going to be even better. I can see \nthe progress since we did our supplemental to this bill. He is a fine \nman and is trying to do the right thing. That is Congressman Ron \nPackard from the San Diego area.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I have to leave \nthe floor for a few minutes. He is probably going to be finished soon. \nThere is nobody else seeking time.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the chairman to join with me in asking that as soon \nas I finish my remarks, all time be yielded back and the two leaders \nset a time to vote this afternoon.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Has that time been agreed on?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is that time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. 2:15 p.m.\n  Mr. REID. That is fine. All time will be yielded back when I finish \nmy remarks, and we will vote at 2:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back all remaining time I have.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I indicated, this was a rocky road. I am \nsurprised we are where we are. Ten days ago I did not think this was \npossible. The House and Senate were apart by $1 billion. We have worked \nthat out. We have gotten more money in the bill. In fact, we have about \n$1 billion which has made this possible.\n  The final conference report is very balanced among the needs of water \nprojects. I indicated how important they are for the corps and the \nBureau of Reclamation, as well as the very important science and \nnational security responsibilities of the Department of Energy. These \nresponsibilities, the water projects and the Department of Energy, \ncould stand alone, but they do not stand alone. We have to balance \nthem.\n  I have spoken a lot about the importance of this bill. I did that \nearlier. I do believe it is important. Year after year, I am amazed at \nwhat this bill does to meet the needs of this very complex country in \nwhich we live, with the natural resources that are different from one \ncoast to the next.\n  Earlier this year, Congress passed the Water Resources Development \nAct of 1999. We call it WRDA. We have not been able to fund a single \nproject that we authorized in that. That is unfortunate, but that is \none of the rules we set. The bill passed after this bill started, and \nif we are going to have some limitations, this is a good place to \nstart. Next year, we are going to receive a number of requests from \nthis bill, as well we should. We need to look for a way to fund them.\n  On the energy side, this bill is a solid compromise. It has sizable \ngaps both technologically and fundingwise, but we are going to make \nprogress. We have battles on the Senate floor every year this bill is \nbefore us with solar and renewable energy. We have to do better than we \nhave. We were funded well below last year's request. We have made \nprogress, and I think we can continue to make progress.\n\n  The conference compromise was the best we could do, given the \navailable funds. It was not enough, but it was the best we could do.\n  This is a good bill. It is a bill that will next year, I hope, be \neven better. It is balanced. There are good things in it. We have \nhurricane protection for Virginia, funds for the Everglades in Florida, \nChicago shoreline funding which will help keep the Great Lakes out of \ndowntown Chicago, healthy funding for our National Labs, and dozens of \nother examples throughout this conference report that do help this \ncountry. My frustration is merely that there is so much more to be done \nthat we cannot do.\n  Each year this bill is the product of hundreds and hundreds of hours \nof staff work on both sides of the aisle and in both Chambers. The \nstaff worked very well together and produced the best possible result \nfor the American people. That is what it is all about.\n  As I indicated, there comes a time--and we should do it much more \noften--when we must set aside our partisan differences and move forward \nwith positive results. This bill is good for the country. We could have \nchosen to be partisan and neither of us budge and wind up with nothing, \nand that is what the American people would have gotten--nothing. We \nthink setting aside our partisan differences has been a positive \naccomplishment.\n  The staff set the example. They worked to produce the best possible \nresult for the American people, and I am very grateful to all our \nstaff. I thank some of the key members of the Senate staff who made \nthis bill possible: Gregory Daines, my energy and water clerk; Sue Fry, \nan Army Corps of Engineers detailee to the Appropriations Committee; \nBob Perret, a fellow on my personal staff; Liz Blevins, an \nAppropriations Committee staff member; and Andrew Willison, who is on \nmy personal staff who has worked very hard on this bill; and Alex \nFlint, David Gwaltney, and Lashawnda Leftwich of the majority staff who \nhave been very helpful to us on this bill.\n  As always, as I have indicated, it is a pleasure to work with my \ncounterpart, the chairman of this subcommittee, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee. I hope we are able to work on this bill for many \nyears to come.\n  I yield back my time.\n\n\n                   doe environmental management funds\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to engage my colleague, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Energy and Water Appropriations \nSubcommittee, in a colloquy to discuss the importance of research as it \nrelates to Environmental Management (EM) in the Department of Energy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be glad to engage in such a colloquy with my \ncolleague, the Senator from Idaho and a member of the Energy and Water \nAppropriations Subcommittee.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is very important there be research conducted at the \nIdaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) that \nsupports the EM mission of the Lab. I would point out that the INEEL \nhas been designated as the lead Environmental Lab in the DOE Lab \ncomplex. If INEEL is to lead, there must be funds available to exert \nsuch leadership.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree with my colleague on the importance that such \nfunding be available.\n  Mr. CRAIG. With that need in mind, I ask my colleague if he would be \nsupportive of increased funding in the EM-50 account to assure that \nsuch research can be conducted?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to my colleague from Idaho that I would support \nsuch funding in the EM-50 account and encourage the DOE to make such \nfunding available.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise to support the energy and water \ndevelopment appropriations conference report. Within this bill is \nfunding for a critical effort that is essential to the long-term future \nfor citizens of the Northwest: the cleanup and restoration of the \nHanford site in the State of Washington.\n  The citizens near the Hanford area played a major role in the \nNation's successful effort to win the cold war. Now it is the \nresponsibility of our Federal Government to conduct environmental \nremediation so that the site will not threaten the health of future \ngenerations. This bill appears to fully fund the cleanup effort based \non the priorities presented in the administration's February budget \nrequest.\n  One unresolved Hanford-related concern pertains to the Fast Flux Text \nFacility (FFTF). This is one of the world's premier research reactors, \nand last month the Secretary of Energy made the right decision to \nproceed with an Environment Impact Statement (EIS) on future missions \nfor this facility. The FFTF holds the potential to create a sufficient \nand dependable source of medical isotopes used to cure cancer; it can \nalso meet the needs of a variety of other missions, including the \nproduction of needed material for deep space missions.\n  In the administration's budget request, an inadequate amount of \nfunding was requested for the FFTF. Subsequently the Secretary's \ndecision to proceed with an EIS will require additional funds to \ncomplete this necessary analysis. I call on the Secretary to address \nthis situation immediately so that the necessary reprogramming of\n\n[[Page S11536]]\n\nfunds can be approved expeditiously, something he has not yet done.\n  This conference report also wisely deletes or fixes several \nprovisions that were attacks on the Power Marketing Agencies generally \nand the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) specifically. Report \nlanguage asks BPA to report on fish and wildlife costs that will be \nincorporated within the upcoming BPA rate case. The timing of this \nrequest is awkward as it calls for a report prior to the end of the \nrate case; I request that BPA only make this report if it has no \nnegative consequences on the rate case process.\n  Another area of concern pertains to the solar and renewable energy \nportion of this report. Due to budget restrictions, the amount of \nfunding available for this program is less than ideal. Not only has \nthis area of energy development seen recent dramatic breakthroughs in \ncost-effectiveness, it holds great promise for developing nations and \nemerging economies. My State of Washington is home to many of the \nNation's leading solar and renewable energy companies and projects. I \nhope we will be able to give greater emphasis to this program next \nyear.\n  On this subject, the conference report also references a specific \nappropriation to develop a materials center pertaining to photovoltaic \nenergy systems. I hope the Department of Energy is aware that \nWashington State University has been leading an effort--along with 14 \nother top-tier universities and the National Renewable Energy \nLaboratory--specific to this area of research. DOE should proceed with \nthese efforts in a competitive process, allowing the WSU-led consortium \nto remain under serious consideration for leading this area of \nresearch.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am forced to vote against the Energy \nand Water conference report. Not to do so would be to break a \ncommitment to small businesses across America, to hurt farmers and \nranchers and rural communities, and to threaten the energy security of \nthe United States.\n  The people across the United States demand increased funding for \nrenewable energy. Poll after poll shows that our citizens believe we \nshould spend more on renewable energy.\n  A majority of the United States Senate--54 Senators--believe we \nshould increase funding for renewable energy.\n  This bill defies the will of the American people and a majority of \nU.S. Senators. It does not provide more money for renewable energy. It \nprovides less money. It provides 130 million dollars less than the \nadministration's request. It cuts funding for renewable energy by 30%.\n  Mr. President, by decreasing funding for renewable energy, we \njeopardize the security of our Nation, we hurt small businesses, \nranchers, farmers, and rural communities, we hurt our ability to \ncompete internationally, and we hurt the environment.\n  Mr. President, our Nation needs to increase domestic energy \nproduction--not cut funding for developing an unlimited source of \nenergy made in America. Our Nation needs a lower balance of payments--\nnot an increased trade deficit. We need to help farmers, ranchers, and \nrural communities develop affordable, reliable, locally produced \nenergy--not cut it off. We need to stand up for U.S. companies selling \nU.S. manufactured energy technologies in overseas markets--not leave \nthem dangling in the wind while the Japanese and Europeans grossly \noutspend us. We need to spur job markets in every state in the Nation--\nnot send our good jobs overseas.\n  Apparently there are still some who fail to realize that clean, \ndomestic energy production is important. Perhaps they have not noticed \nthat the U.S. has a trade deficit larger than any other nation, ever. \nOr maybe they have forgotten that imported foreign oil is the number \none contributor to our trade deficit. Or maybe they just do not realize \nwhat the rest of the nation has long ago realized--that clean, made in \nAmerica renewable energy can give us the energy security, jobs, and \nhealthy environment that our people demand.\n  I am deeply disappointed in the severe cuts to renewable energy in \nthis bill. I vow to fight even harder next year to give renewable \nenergy the funding it deserves.\n\n\n                burbank hospital regional cancer center\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman's willingness to \nengage in a colloquy regarding the FY00 Energy and Water conference \nreport. The conference report, which passed the House last night and is \nbeing considered in the Senate Chamber this morning, includes $1 \nmillion in Department of Energy's Biological and Environmental Research \n(BER) account for cancer research at the Burbank Hospital Regional \nCancer Center. It is important that the word ``research'' be addressed \nin the Record, since the original request by my Massachusetts colleague \nin the House, Representative John Olver, asks that funds be made \navailable for the Burbank Hospital Regional Cancer Center in Fitchburg, \nMA.\n  Since this is a small hospital serving a rural area, I and my \ncolleague in the House want to stress the importance of the $1 \nmillion's being dedicated to the hospital for the underserved \npopulation, rather than for research purposes. If the chairman could \nclarify to the Department that the $1 million should be made available \nto the Burbank Hospital in Fitchburg, MA, without its being contingent \non ``research,'' it would be greatly appreciated. I thank the gentleman \nvery much for his time and effort.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I appreciate the Senator's interest and wish to clarify \nto the Department of Energy that the $1 million should be made \navailable to the Burbank Hospital in Fitchburg, MA, for the under-\nserved population.\n\n\n    Budgetary Impact of H.R. 2605, the Energy and Water Development \n                 Appropriations Bill, Fiscal Year 2000\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I submit for the Record the official \nBudget Committee scoring of the pending bill--H.R. 2605, the energy and \nwater development appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000.\n  The conference agreement provides $21.3 billion in new budget \nauthority (BA) and $13.3 billion in new outlays to support the programs \nof the Department of Energy, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the \nBureau of Reclamation, and related Federal agencies. The bill provides \nthe bulk of funding for the Department of Energy, including Atomic \nEnergy Defense Activities and civilian energy research and development \n(R) other than fossil energy R and energy conservation programs.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the conference report totals $21.3 \nbillion in BA and $20.8 billion in outlays for FY 2000. The conference \nreport is at the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for BA, and $29 \nmillion below the 302(b) allocation for outlays.\n  The conference report is $0.1 billion in BA and $0.5 billion in \noutlays above the 1999 level. The conference report is $0.3 billion in \nboth BA and outlays below the President's budget request for FY 2000.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the FY 2000 Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations bill conference report be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nH.R. 2605, ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS, 2000, SPENDING COMPARISONS--\n                            CONFERENCE REPORT\n               [Fiscal year 2000, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    General\n                                    purpose   Crime  Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference Report:\n  Budget authority...............    21,280  ......  .........    21,280\n  Outlays........................    20,839  ......  .........    20,839\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority...............    21,280  ......  .........    21,800\n  Outlays........................    20,868  ......  .........    20,868\n1999 level:\n  Budget authority...............    21,177  ......  .........    21,177\n  Outlays........................    20,366  ......  .........    20,366\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority...............    21,557  ......  .........    21,557\n  Outlays........................    21,172  ......  .........    21,172\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority...............    20,190  ......  .........    20,190\n  Outlays........................    19,674  ......  .........    19,674\nSenate-passed bill:\n  Budget authority...............    21,277  ......  .........    21,277\n  Outlays........................    20,868  ......  .........    20,868\n \n  CONFERENCE REPORT COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority...............  ........  ......  .........  ........\n  Outlays........................       -29  ......  .........       -29\n1999 level:\n  Budget authority...............       103  ......  .........       103\n  Outlays........................       473  ......  .........       473\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority...............      -277  ......  .........      -277\n  Outlays........................      -333  ......  .........      -333\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority...............     1,090  ......  .........     1,090\n  Outlays........................     1,165  ......  .........     1,165\nSenate-passed bill:\n  Budget authority...............         3  ......  .........         3\n\n[[Page S11537]]\n\n \n  Outlays........................       -29  ......  .........       -29\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding. Totals adjusted\n  for consistency with scorekeeping conventions.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I want to express my personal appreciation \nto all the conferees who participated in the fiscal year 2000 energy \nand water development appropriations conference for including funding \nand language for Louisiana projects.\n  Flood control, hurricane protection and navigation are all vital to \nthe safety and well-being of our citizens. These water-related \ninfrastructure projects are of major economic importance to the state. \nA number of them are of major importance to the nation.\n  Of the Louisiana projects in the fiscal year 2000 report and the \nStatement of Managers, there are two Louisiana projects which I would \nlike to discuss further at this time: the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal \nLock Project and the Bayou Darrow Floodgate, Aloha-Rigolette Flood \nControl, Red River Project.\n  I appreciate all that the conferees have done for these projects. I \nam taking this opportunity to express my views to the Senate on some \nkey issues affecting them. Resolution of these issues is critical to \nthe two projects being built in a timely manner to provide the \nprotection and service for which they have been authorized.\n  With regard to the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal Lock, I am most \nappreciative of the funding which the conferees have included for it \nand its mitigation. On the related key project issue, it is of the \nhighest importance that the Corps of Engineers use the full replacement \ncost to value the real estate and facilities which it acquires from the \nPort of New Orleans as part of the project.\n  The Port of New Orleans had expected the Corps to use full \nreplacement value when it acquires the Port's properties. I am told \nthat full replacement cost is the value which the Corps is using to \nacquire other similarly-situated property and facilities for the lock \nproject.\n  Senator Landrieu and I contacted the conferees about this full \nreplacement cost issue.\n  As I understand and which I appreciate very much, the conferees noted \nthat there are significant differences in the estimates used by the \nCorps and the Port to value the Port's properties to be acquired. As I \nalso understand, conferees expect the Corps to work in good faith to \narrive at an equitable solution to this issue in accordance with \ncurrent law, which I also appreciate very much.\n  If, indeed, the Corps is using, in accordance with current law, full \nreplacement cost for other similarly-situated properties which it will \nacquire for the lock project, then it is only equitable and fair that, \nin accordance with current law, it use full replacement cost to acquire \nthe Port's properties for the project.\n  With regard to the Bayou Darrow Floodgate, Aloha-Rigolette Flood \nControl, Red River Project, I am most appreciative that the conferees \nhave provided FY 2000 funding for the project. I also appreciate their \nconsideration of the request by Senator Landrieu and I which was not \nable to be included as part of the conference agreement, that is, to \nauthorize full federal responsibility for project costs which are in \nexcess of those anticipated in the 1994 Project Cooperation Agreement.\n  The excess costs have arisen due to extenuating circumstances which \nincluded, as I understand, project-related contract negotiations, but \nabout which the Town of Colfax, the non-federal sponsor, says it was \nnot consulted. The Town, which is a very small rural community, says it \nis unable to pay the share of the excess costs assigned to it by the \nCorps.\n  I am most concerned about this situation. I hope that the Corps of \nEngineers will work very closely with the Town of Colfax to resolve the \nexcess cost issue soon and that this much-needed flood control project \nwill be able to be completed in a timely manner.\n  This concludes my statement, Mr. President.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Chairman \nDomenici, Senator Reid, and the other Conferees for addressing vitally \nimportant issues for Louisiana in this bill. As you know, Mr. \nPresident, the annual Energy and Water Appropriations Bill provides \nfunding to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to protect our citizens \nfrom flooding and to facilitate the flow of maritime commerce through \nour many waterways. Both of these endeavors are very important to \nLouisiana and our nation.\n  The FY 2000 Energy and Water Appropriations Conference Report (H. \nRept. 106-336) addresses the Inner Harbor Navigational Canal (IHNC) \nLock Replacement Project in New Orleans which is very important to \nmaritime commerce. I thank the Conferees for providing $15.9 million \nfor this project. I also thank the Conferees for including report \nlanguage that would expedite the community mitigation plan and ensure \nthat the Corps work in good faith to arrive at an equitable solution in \ndetermining the value of property to be transferred by the Port of New \nOrleans to the Corps to complete the project. Notably, I understand \nthat the Corps is also acquiring nearby property from another landowner \nfor this project and that the Corps is employing a replacement cost \nmethodology to determine the value of this nearby property. Therefore, \nI believe that an equitable solution to determining the value of the \nPort's property requires a valuation in the same manner as that \nemployed for the nearby property.\n  Additionally, the Conference Report addresses the Aloha-Rigolette \nProject. I thank the Conferees for providing $581,000 for this project. \nAlthough not included, I also thank the Conferees for considering my \nrequest for bill and report language that would authorize full federal \nresponsibility for project costs in excess of what was anticipated in \nthe Project Cooperation Agreement issued in 1994 in connection with the \nBayou Darrow Floodgate portion of the project. I sought this language \nat the request of the local project sponsor, the Town of Colfax. Mayor \nConnie Youngblood of Colfax informed me that the Corps negotiated a no-\ncost termination with the project contractor without consulting the \nTown and is now expecting the Town to cost-share the additional costs \nthat have resulted. Because the Town of Colfax is a very small rural \ncommunity and unable to pay the unanticipated additional costs which it \ndid not consent to, I remain very concerned about this matter. \nAccordingly, I ask the Corps to work with the Town of Colfax to resolve \nthis matter so that the project can be completed in a timely manner.\n  In closing, I again thank the Conferees for their work on the FY 2000 \nEnergy and Water Appropriations Bill and the attached Conference \nReport.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I congratulate my respective \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle for successfully completing work \non this important spending bill. I regret that I was not able to be \nhere to vote on the final Energy and Water conference report for fiscal \nyear 2000.\n  The conferees deserve credit for their notable efforts in forging \nthis conference agreement and continuing funding for the Department of \nEnergy, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation and \nother critical energy programs important to our nation. I am \ndisappointed to say that, just as this final report ensures that \nnecessary functions and programs of the Federal Government are funded, \nthe practice of pork-barrel spending also continues.\n  When the Senate passed its version of the energy and water \nappropriation bill just 2 months ago, I found $531 million in low-\npriority, unnecessary, and wasteful spending. While a half a billion \ndollars is an incredible amount of pork, it is remarkable that this \nfinal conference report has been fattened up with an additional $200 \nmillion in pork barrel projects.\n  A lot of this pork is concentrated in sections of the bill detailing \nprojects to be funded by the Army Corps of Engineers. While I am \ncertainly supportive of our water infrastructure and civil works \nprograms, I am appalled at the process by which the conferees have \ndirected money in these accounts. A majority of the projects do not \nappear to be funded based on a competitive or merit-based review, but \ninstead funding is clearly directed toward projects\n\n[[Page S11538]]\n\nwhich are not requested in the budget and more closely resemble special \ninterest projects.\n  We sought to curb Federal spending and reduce our tremendous deficit \nby passing the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. However, because we now enjoy \na robust economy and balanced budget, we have detracted from our \nimportant goal of spending tax-payer's hard-earned dollars prudently.\n  A clear example of this fiscal irresponsibility is exemplified by the \n``emergency spending'' bills we have enacted over the past two years. \nWhy did we have to pass these supplemental appropriations bills? \nBecause those areas of the country which are not the recipients of \nthese special interest earmarks are suffering because there is not a \nrealistic chance to compete for federal funding through established \nnormal procedures and guidelines when budgetary spending is based more \non parochial actions.\n  Over the years, I have reported to the American taxpayers the pork-\nbarrel spending that continues through our annual appropriations \nprocess. I believe we owe it to the American public to report how we \nspend their taxpayer dollars. Sadly, the taxpayers will have to \nshoulder the burden of financing pork barrel projects to the tune of \n$759 million included in this energy and water spending measure.\n  I will not waste the time of the Senate going over each and every \nearmark. I have compiled a list of the numerous add-ons, earmarks, and \nspecial exemptions in this conference report. Due to its length, the \nlist I compiled of objectionable provisions included in this conference \nreport cannot be printed in the Record. This list will be available on \nmy Senate webpage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/28/senate-section/article/S11538-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nproceed to a period of morning business with Senators permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, I want to ask the \nmajority leader a question before we move forward. I have been waiting \nwith amendments that speak to the pain and suffering of farmers in my \nState. Are there going to be opportunities for me, as a Senator from an \nagricultural State, to bring forth substantive amendments that will \nspeak to what has happened to the farmer? Will there be vehicles or \nopportunities to come to the floor and introduce amendments and pass \nlegislation that will help farmers in my State?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I was under the impression we had already \ndone the Agriculture appropriations bill for this fiscal year, and it \ndid include some disaster and drought money.\n  That conference is meeting right now, or will be meeting during the \nday and has been meeting, to make sure we are giving proper \nconsideration to the negative impact of low prices on agriculture in \nAmerica and also to assess as best we can the impact of the drought. \nThe Senate has already considered that. It was subject to amendment. We \ndo also wish to make sure bankruptcy laws are applicable and necessary \naction is taken. I know Senator Grassley is working, along with \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, to make sure the bankruptcy laws \nand their benefits are available to our farmers.\n  We certainly are working very aggressively to try to make sure we \naddress these problems appropriately. I don't think we need to revisit \na whole number of amendments in this area on the bankruptcy bill \nitself. I think when we get to bankruptcy we should be on bankruptcy \nand not use that as an ``in basket'' for every problem that may be on \nsome Member's mind.\n  However, I think I have answered the question. We are working on \nagriculture needs. Hopefully, within the week we will have an \nagreement, and we will be voting on that bill either later on this week \nor early next week.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, let me simply follow up \nwith a question. My understanding is the conference committee has not \nmet for the past week; second, I know Senator Byrd and Senator Dorgan \nwill speak about what is or is not in the\n\n[[Page S11539]]\n\nbill. In this appropriations bill, we were not able to come out with \nany legislation that dealt with the price crisis, the whole question of \nconcentration of power that dealt with what is happening to the family \nfarmers.\n  Is the bankruptcy bill the pending business after the morning \nbusiness? Will we bring the bankruptcy bill to the floor with \nopportunities for Senators to introduce amendments that will make a \ndifference for family farmers? Will we have that opportunity?\n  Mr. LOTT. I cannot answer that question at this time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, I will do everything I \ncan between now and however long it takes, if I am the last person \nstanding, to insist I have a right as a Senator from Minnesota to come \nto the floor and introduce legislation that will speak to the pain and \nsuffering of family farmers in my State. I will not stop colleagues \nfrom speaking in morning business, but forthwith I will have to stay on \nthe floor until I have a chance to make a difference for farmers.\n  Mr. LOTT. I wonder if the Senator might want to take this up in the \nAgriculture Committee and with Members of the Senate who are involved \nand work with the appropriators on both sides of the aisle. They are \nworking now to try to deal with these issues.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, Democrats have not been \ninvolved in that Appropriations Committee to my knowledge in terms of \nany meeting over the last week. Second, with all due respect to the \nmajority leader, we are an amending body. Quite often we come to the \nfloor with amendments. We especially come to the floor with amendments \nwhen we are dealing with a crisis situation.\n  We are dealing with a crisis situation in rural America. It is not \nbusiness as usual. I am going to insist that I have the right to come \nto this floor with amendments that will speak to farmers in Minnesota \nand around the country to make a difference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, I will not object, but I \nwant to correct a misimpression on the floor. The conference committee \nin the agricultural appropriations area has not been meeting. I am a \nconferee. I would know if they are meeting. There is no meeting. It \nadjourned in the middle of last week. There has been no meeting since. \nI read the speculation in the newspapers and in the press that there \nhave been agreements made. In fact, one suggestion indicated the \nmajority leader had signed off on certain things. I have no idea who is \nreaching these agreements. I have no idea whether that is accurate.\n  It is not accurate to say the conference committee is meeting. The \nconference committee is not meeting. No Democratic member of the \nconference committee is able to meet because the conference is not in \nsession.\n  I will not object either, but I will say there are some who think it \nis appropriate to have a conference between the House and the Senate on \nsomething this important--and it is one of the most important issues to \nmy State dealing with this farm crisis--and it be done behind closed \ndoors with one party in secret, and an agreement is brought to the \nfloor of the Senate which says take it as it is or leave it.\n  That is not the way it will work. I do not have the capability to \nmake things happen that I want to have happen, but I can slow things \ndown.\n  I wanted to correct the impression left when the majority leader said \nthe conference has been meeting. The conference has not been meeting. \nIt adjourned nearly a week ago. We passed our bill in the Senate August \n4. It is now October. With the urgent crises in farm country, we have \nslow motion going on and no conference at all. I hope the majority \nleader can agree with me that the way we are supposed to legislate is \nto have a conference; that when we call meetings with conferees, we \nhave Republicans and Democrats there, we debate the issues, and we take \nvotes. I wanted to correct the misimpression there has been a \nconference committee meeting. I am a conferee. That committee has not \nbeen meeting, and it should.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will be very brief. I should be in a \nmarkup of the Appropriations Committee on the Labor-HHS appropriations \nbill right at this moment.\n  Mr. President, as we quickly approach the end of Fiscal Year 1999, \nthere is a portion of the American population that is not faring very \nwell. The small family farmers of the North-Eastern and Mid-Atlantic \nStates have been struggling to survive a fifteen-month-long drought. \nWith all fifty-five of our counties receiving an emergency drought \ndeclaration on August 2 from the Secretary of Agriculture, farmers in \nWest Virginia are no exception. These farmers have been waiting for a \nsignificant and timely response to their emergency, a feeling I imagine \nwould be similar to dialing nine-one-one and getting a busy signal.\n  Yet, over the years, this Congress has responded quickly to provide \nthe necessary resources to help the victims of national disasters, not \nonly in this country, but around the world. From the $1 billion for the \nvictims of Mount Saint Helens in 1980; to the $2.7 billion for the \nvictims of Hurricane Hugo in 1989; to the nearly $3 billion for the \nLoma Prieta earthquake victims, also in 1989; to the more than $10 \nbillion for Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki in 1992; to the $6.8 billion in \ndisaster funds for victims of the Mississippi floods in the Summer of \n1993; to the North Ridge earthquake victims in 1994, for which almost \n$12 billion was appropriated. Throughout the 1990's, emergency disaster \nassistance has also been provided to the victims of tornadoes, tropical \nstorms, droughts, floods, wildfires, blizzards, and so on.\n  In 1999, emergency aid has gone to Central American and the Caribbean \nnations needing assistance with reconstruction after hurricane damage, \nto Kosovo military and humanitarian operations, and to American farmers \nsuffering from low commodity prices. I voted for all of these. I have \nbeen willing to support emergency aid in these instances--all of them. \nHowever, I cannot understand why the drought emergency goes ignored. I \ncannot understand why we are not answering the emergency calls of long-\nsuffering Northeast and Mid-Atlantic farmers.\n  The drought has devastated--devastated--the lives of thousands of \nfamily farmers in this region. I know that the word devastated is used \nso often that one expects it to be pure hyperbole, but West Virginia \nfarmers work hard on land most often held in the same family for \ngenerations. They farm an average of 194 acres in the rough mountain \nterrain, and they earn an average of just $25,000 annually. That is \n$25,000 annually for 365 days of never-ending labor. Farming is an \nevery-day, every-week, every-month, 365-day operation every year with \nno time off. West Virginia farmers average $68.50 a day for days that \nbegin at dawn and run past sunset. These small family farmers are the \nlast to ask for assistance. They are hard-working, they are self-\nreliant individuals. They\n\n[[Page S11540]]\n\nhave a sense of pride that prevents them from requesting federal aid \nunless they are in a desperate situation. These farmers are now in a \ndesperate situation, and they are asking us to respond to them in their \ntime of need. Now is the time that we must assist them and assist them \nby not by burdening them with more debt--they are over their heads in \ndebt all right, many of them, so they are not asking for more loan \nprograms. They need help. By providing grants, we can give them help \nthat will help them to recover from the drought.\n  For many farmers it is already too late. They are disposing of their \nherds. They have sold off their livestock from land that has been \nfarmed by their family for generations. Their pastures are grazed to \nstubble and will need fertilizer, lime, and reseeding if they are to \nsupport cattle again in the Spring. In the meantime, cattle must still \nbe fed, and what little hay could be cut locally has already been \neaten. The West Virginia Commissioner of Agriculture informs me that of \nthe 21,000 surviving small family farms in West Virginia--and there \nwere 90,000 back when I was in the State legislature in 1947. There \nwere 90,000 farmers in West Virginia. Now there are 21,000 surviving, \nand over half of these are at risk as a result of drought. America \ncannot afford to let the small family farm die. A small family farming \noperation is the foundation on which America is based. We cannot afford \nnot to help drought-stricken farmers.\n  Granted, in this area the drought seems to be a thing of the past. \nThe water restrictions to conserve water in the Washington, D.C. \nmetropolitan area have recently been lifted. Lawns have greened up \nagain, and the drone of lawn mowers again dominates the weekend. \nSchools canceled classes in this area two weeks ago because hurricane \nFloyd threatened to deluge the city with too much rain too quickly. \nHowever, I assure you that the drought in West Virginia continues. \nHurricane Floyd's rains did not scale West Virginia's mountains. The \ndrought is so far-reaching that schoolchildren in Fayetteville, WV, had \ntheir classes canceled last week and the Fayette County Courthouse has \npostponed arraignments until October 1 because the city's reservoir has \ngone dry. The grass in West Virginia is not getting greener, as it is \nhere in the Washington area. It is simply not growing.\n  Seventeen North-Eastern and Mid-Atlantic States have received a \nSecretarial drought emergency declaration this year and five more are \nawaiting a decision. Yet, the emergency aid package that the \nAgriculture Conference Committee is still negotiating includes a mere \n$500 million in general aid for all disasters declared by the Secretary \nof Agriculture throughout 1999. The Secretary of Agriculture estimates \nthat losses due to the drought of 1999 may total $2 billion. Losses in \nWest Virginia alone are estimated at $200 million--and we are not a big \nfarming State, not a big farming State. Most of ours are small farms, \nbut these are people who have been on the land for generations. These \nfarms have been handed down through the line of several generations.\n  Mr. President, what happened to the small family farmers in ancient \nRome is happening in this country. They are leaving the land, and with \nthem will go our family values.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture estimates, as I say, that the losses due \nto the drought of 1999 may total $2 billion, and in West Virginia alone \nthey are estimated at $200 million. So the emergency aid package now \nattached to the Agriculture appropriations bill falls short by some \n$1.5 billion.\n  I want colleagues to understand that although a drought is a slow-\npaced disaster, it nevertheless deserves much-needed attention as an \nemergency and merits a response much greater and faster than the one we \nhave so far given. A drought can, and this one has, caused farmers to \ngo out of business.\n  My farmers know that farming is inherently a risky business. It does \ndepend on the weather. I urge this body to help with this natural \ndisaster. American farmers merit federal assistance to ensure their \nfuture productivity, and, more importantly, to preserve a heritage that \nI believe essential to this nation's history, to its moral fiber and to \nits character. We regularly hear talk of the small family farmer. Now \nis the time to help small family farmers. Congress must act on this \nopportunity to direct emergency funds toward a real emergency with \nwide-reaching effects, that impacts our most treasured Americans, our \nfarmers. The devastation of the drought will only be compounded if we \ndo not offer assistance now. If fields are not treated now, they will \nnot be productive come spring. Farmers normally finance this activity \nwith profits from fall sales, or secure loans based on such sales. But \nthis time they have nothing to sell.\n  We need to increase appropriations that will be directed to farmers \nsuffering from the drought of 1999. I urge my fellow conferees on the \nAgriculture Appropriations Conference Committee and I urge the \nleadership in both Houses, to answer the call of the small family \nfarmer and support increasing emergency assistance directed toward \nfarmers suffering as a result of the drought of 1999. Do not let their \n911 call for help be answered by a busy signal. Instead, let us answer \nthe call of farmers by sending the signal that we are busy working for \nfarmers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Iowa is to go \nfirst. Is there an agreement as to the order?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. There is not. I ask that Senator Torricelli go ahead of \nme on the issue of bankruptcy so he and I can speak together.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, will the Senator from Iowa yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I wonder if the Senators will yield to me. I will be \nbrief. I have 5 or 6 minutes. I know the Senators from Iowa and New \nJersey are together on the same subject, and this Senator has been \nstanding here for some time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If Senator Torricelli has time, I have time.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I think it \nis best we go next to each other.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I want to say, before Senator Byrd \nleaves the floor, however, how much I identify with his remarks. Like \nthe Senator from West Virginia, year after year, with natural disasters \naround this country, in the House of Representatives and now in the \nSenate, I have come to the floor as an American, as part of a national \nunion to respond to their emergencies.\n  Like the Senator from West Virginia in advocacy of his small farmers, \nI will not allow, as long as I serve in the Senate, the State of New \nJersey to be a caboose on the train of the national union. We have a \nfarming crisis. The Appropriations Committee not only reducing but \neliminating any assistance for farmers who are being bankrupt and \nforced from the land is inexcusable. Like the Senator from West \nVirginia, at the appropriate time, I will come to the floor and if it \nrequires standing here day after day, night after night, I will not see \nthem abandoned.\n  I apologize for taking the time. I wanted to comment on the Senator's \ncomments.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I think the Senator from Iowa still has the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is my understanding the Senators from Iowa \nand New Jersey have no objection to the Senator from Montana being \nrecognized at this time. The Senator from Montana is recognized for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I very much appreciate the Senator from Iowa and the \nSenator from New Jersey for letting me go ahead of them.\n  I agree with the statement of the Senator from New Jersey \ncomplimenting the Senator from West Virginia, and, in the same vein, \nthe earlier remarks of the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone. The \nfact is, our farmers are in desperate straits, and this Congress is \ndoing very little about it. It is that simple. No one can dispute that, \nand many of us are, quite frankly, concerned because the Senate is not \ndoing enough. Because it looks as if the Senate might not do enough, we \nwill be constrained to take extraordinary measures in the Senate to \nstand up for our constituents, the people who sent us here; namely, the \nfarmers, in this instance, to pass as best we can appropriate and \nremedial legislation to help our farmers. It is that simple.\n  I compliment the Senator from West Virginia, the Senator from New \nJersey, and others.\n\n[[Page S11541]]\n\n  In fact, that is very relevant to the statement I am going to make \nconcerning the introduction of a bill.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Baucus pertaining to the introduction of S. 1648 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much thank my colleagues and good \nfriends, the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from New Jersey, for \ntheir courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/28/senate-section/article/S11541-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11541-S11543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE BANKRUPTCY REFORM BILL\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise with some considerable regret \nto discuss the bankruptcy reform bill that was pulled from the floor of \nthe Senate last week. Senator Grassley and I have worked for over 8 \nmonths to craft what I believe is a broadly bipartisan bankruptcy bill. \nIndeed, Senator Grassley has worked tirelessly for years to craft this \nlegislation. He deserves the considerable gratitude of every Member of \nthis institution.\n  I regret that after all these months of work, last week we were \nforced to vote on a cloture motion. I do not believe that the cloture \nvote was in any way indicative of support for the bill. It is important \nthat that be understood.\n  Bipartisan support for this bankruptcy legislation is broad and it is \ndeep. The legislation has seven cosponsors; five of them are Democrats. \nThe legislation was voted successfully out of the Judiciary Committee \nwith support from both parties. The inability to move forward on a \nbankruptcy reform bill is entirely due to unrelated events. The \nlegislation on its merits still stands.\n  I believe it is important that Senator Grassley and I make clear to \npeople, both within the institution and outside the institution, that \nwe are absolutely committed in this Congress, in this year, to \ncontinuing to have bankruptcy legislation considered and passed. \nIndeed, I believe if the majority leader brings bankruptcy reform to \nthe floor of the Senate, in a matter of only a few days we can resolve \nthe outstanding issues.\n  I also think it is important that our colleagues understand why we \nare so motivated to have this bankruptcy reform legislation passed. \nThere are considerable reasons.\n  We are, to be sure, living in the most prosperous economic period in \nour Nation's history. The facts are renowned: Unemployment is low, \ninflation is low, the Nation has created 18 million new jobs, and now \nthe Federal Government is having a burgeoning budget surplus.\n  But amidst all this prosperity, there are some troubling signs, \nthings that deserve our attention. One is a rapidly declining personal \nsavings rate. Indeed, that is what motivated me to vote for tax cut \nlegislation: To stimulate private savings in America so Americans will \nprepare for their own futures.\n  But second is an issue that relates to this legislation: A rapid, \ninexplicable rise in consumer bankruptcies. In 1998 alone, 1.4 million \nAmericans sought bankruptcy protection--this is a 20-percent increase \nsince 1996 and a staggering 350-percent increase in bankruptcy filings \nsince 1980.\n  It is estimated that 70 percent of the petitions filed were in \nchapter 7, which provides relief from most unsecured debt. Only 30 \npercent of the petitions were filed under chapter 13, which requires a \nrepayment plan.\n  No matter what the cause of so many bankruptcies, what every American \nneeds to understand is that somebody is paying the price. If people are \navailing themselves of chapter 7, rather than chapter 13, which \nultimately requires the repayment of many of these debts, the balance \nis going to be paid by somebody, and that somebody is the American \nconsumer.\n  Indeed, I believe this is the equivalent of an invisible tax on the \nAmerican family, estimated to cost each and every American family $400 \na year, as retailers and financial institutions adjust the prices of \ntheir products and their costs to reflect this growing tide of \nbankruptcy.\n  The reality is that the majority of people who file for bankruptcy--\nlow- to middle-income, hard-working people--do so to manage \noverwhelming financial problems. That is as it should be. That is why \nthe United States has always had a bankruptcy code--to protect people \nand allow them to reorganize their lives, to give people a second \nchance in American society.\n  But just the same, with these staggering numbers of increase--\n20 percent in only 3 years--there must be something else going on in \nour society. That something is revealed in a recent study by the \nDepartment of Justice indicating that as many as 13 percent of debtors \nfiling under chapter 7--182,000 people each year--can, indeed, afford \nto repay a significant amount of their outstanding debt. That amounts \nto $4 billion that would have been paid to creditors but is being \navoided, inappropriately, by what amounts, in my judgment, to a misuse \nof the bankruptcy code.\n\n  I believe the Congress must act. This invisible tax impacts the \nhealth of our financial institutions, forces small business people to \nabsorb these costs, forces some family businesses out of business, and \nit is a cost we can avoid.\n  The bankruptcy legislation that Senator Grassley and I have crafted \nstrikes an important balance, making it more difficult for the \nunscrupulous to abuse the system but ensuring that families who really \nneed bankruptcy protection to reorganize their lives still have access \nto it.\n  At its core, the Grassley-Torricelli bill is designed to assure that \nthose with the ability to repay a portion of their debts will be \nrequired to do so but that judicial discretion will ensure that no one \nwho is genuinely in need of debt cancellation is prevented from having \na fresh start in American life.\n  When this legislation passed the Judiciary Committee, there were \nthose who had legitimate concerns about some of its other provisions. I \nwas among them and stated so at the time. These ranged from the \nliability of a debtor's lawyer to ensuring that low-income debtors with \nno hope of repaying their debts were not swept into the means test.\n  Colleagues should understand that Senator Grassley and I are \nprepared, with a managers' amendment, both to ensure that the debtor's \nlawyers are protected from liability and that low-income people are not \ninappropriately subjected to this means test. That managers' amendment, \nI believe, will pass and will make this far better legislation than the \nSenate considered previously or the legislation that passed the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I am very pleased that we have come so far with this bill. It is \ncritical for our financial institutions and, indeed, it is critical for \nAmerican families.\n  There remains one other central issue, however, that must be in this \nlegislation, and that is dealing with the other half of this balance. \nIt is the question of the abuse, I believe, of credit in the Nation \nitself.\n  The credit card industry last year sent out 3.5 billion \nsolicitations--41 mailings for every American household; 14 for every \nman, woman, and child. No one wants to interfere with poor or working \npeople getting access to credit. They should have the availability to \ndo so, but there is something wrong when 14 solicitations per person \nare being received; when college students, juveniles, poor people are \nsolicited again and again and again, often for high-interest credit. \nIndeed, these solicitations for high school and college students are at \nrecord levels.\n  The result of this solicitation is not surprising: Americans with \nincomes below the poverty line have doubled their credit usage; 27 \npercent of families earning less than $10,000 have consumer debt that \nis more than 40 percent of their income. Indeed, it is not our \nintention to restrict access to credit for low-income people or even \nyoung people. Senator Grassley and I have crafted legislation that will \nat least ensure that consumers are protected by giving them knowledge, \nby having full disclosure so people can make informed judgments, when \nreceiving these solicitations, about how much debt they want and what \nit will take to repay it and on what kind of a schedule.\n  Taken as a whole--all of the provisions in the managers' amendment, \nthe legislation from the Judiciary Committee--Senator Grassley's work \nin consumer protection is a well-crafted and a very balanced bill.\n  My hope is it can receive early consideration but that, under any \ncircumstances, this Senate does not adjourn for the year without \nproviding\n\n[[Page S11542]]\n\nfor American families this credit protection by full disclosure, by \nproviding for American business protection against bankruptcy abuse, \nand by redesigning this code so that it is fair to our businesses and \nour consumers alike.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I know the Senator from New Jersey has to leave. But \nbefore he does, in front of all of my colleagues, I want to thank him \nvery much for an outstanding statement that focuses on the complexity \nof the bankruptcy problem. Most importantly, he focused attention on \nthe bipartisanship of this legislation and on our commitment to getting \nit passed not only this Congress, but this year. It can be done.\n  I encourage the Democratic and Republican leaders to have the \nnecessary meetings and conversations it takes to bring this bill to the \nfloor under a reasonable agreement so we can start work on it. In just \na few hours, we can work our way through the disagreements that other \nMembers might have and do it in a bipartisan way and get this bill on \nits way to the President of the United States.\n  So in public, I am happy to thank the Senator from New Jersey for his \ncooperation. He has worked with me in a truly bipartisan way. For \nconstituents who might be listening anyplace in the United States who \nare concerned about this body or Congress as a whole or Washington, DC, \nbeing too partisan, this bankruptcy bill is an example of where bi-\npartisanship has worked. If I had tried to do this in a partisan \nmanner, this bill would not even be as far as it is.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Before getting to the big bankruptcy bill, I want to \ntouch on a related matter--the problem of the sunsetting of the \nagricultural provisions of the bankruptcy code, chapter 12. I believe \nit is the only section of the bankruptcy code that is sunset from time \nto time. It is not a permanent part of the bankruptcy code. It was \npassed about 13 years ago to meet the needs of agriculture in \ndepression in the 1980s, and it has been renewed by Congress \ncontinually since then.\n  It has been a very successful part of the bankruptcy code because, of \nthe farmers who have sought the protection of chapter 12, an Iowa State \nUniversity study indicates that 84 percent are still in business \nfarming, family farmers still farming.\n  We are at a situation where 1 year ago, about this period of time, \nchapter 12 actually sunset. It was extended for 6 months in the omnibus \nspending bill because the feeling was that we wanted to take it up at \nthe very same time a revision of the entire bankruptcy code was taken \nup. The comprehensive bill is the bill that Senator Torricelli has \nspoken about and which I will discuss shortly. Within that bill, there \nis a permanency brought to chapter 12 in the bankruptcy code so it will \nno longer sunset.\n  The March 31 deadline came, and this bill was not up. It was extended \nyet again for 6 months. I urged the majority leader to extend it for a \nyear because I anticipated some of the problems we have recently faced \nregarding the bankruptcy code. It was thought by a lot of interests in \nthis city that it was necessary to have chapter 12 not made permanent, \nseparate from the entire bankruptcy law, because it was needed to help \nget the general bankruptcy revisions through. So it was extended for \nanother 6 months.\n  This week it is going to expire again. It is ludicrous that the House \nof Representatives, just yesterday, passed only a 3-month extension of \nchapter 12 so that somehow if we don't get this permanent bankruptcy \nbill passed, we are going to have chapter 12 expiring again on New \nYear's Eve. That is a Y2K problem for agriculture we better be alerted \nto because Congress is not going to be in session on New Year's Eve to \nrenew chapter 12. I hope that when the Senate considers the House \nversion, we ignore it, and we move with a permanent extension of \nchapter 12 bankruptcy which I introduced last week and which is \ncurrently on the calendar.\n  As the Senators from West Virginia, New Jersey, and also the Senator \nfrom Montana were just speaking about the agricultural crisis, it is \nthat way in agriculture any place in the United States. This is no time \nto play footsie with chapter 12 being extended for just a 3-month \nperiod of time. Those are games that don't need to be played. They \ndon't do justice to agriculture in America, and they do not put the \nfamily farmer in the forefront of our policymaking or thinking in \nWashington.\n  I want to go to this issue about which Senator Torricelli spoke--the \nSenate not invoking cloture on the bankruptcy bill last week.\n  While this is unfortunate, I think it is important to say a few words \nin support of the bill outside of the adversarial context and the very \npolitical context of the cloture vote. I think it would really be a \ntragedy if both parties can't come together and deal with this bill, \nwhich has such broad support from Senators on both sides of the aisle. \nIt was voted out of committee by a 14 to 4 vote, very bipartisan.\n  Bankruptcy reform is really all about a return to personal \nresponsibility in a bankruptcy system which actively discourages \npersonal responsibility by wiping away debts on a no-questions-asked \nbasis.\n  Basic common sense tells you every time a debt is wiped away through \nbankruptcy, someone loses money. Of course, when somebody who extends \ncredit has that obligation wiped away in bankruptcy, that creditor is \nforced to make a decision: Should this loss simply be swallowed as a \ncost of doing business? Or, do you raise prices for other customers to \noffset those losses?\n  When bankruptcy losses are rare and infrequent, lenders may be able \nto swallow a loss. But when bankruptcies are very frequent and common, \nas they are today, lenders have to raise their prices to offset losses. \nFor this reason, when Treasury Secretary Larry Summers testified at his \nconfirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, he said that \nbankruptcies tend to drive up interest rates.\n  If you believe Secretary Summers, bankruptcies are everyone's \nproblem. Regular, hard-working Americans have to pay higher prices for \ngoods and services as a result of bankruptcies. That is a real problem \nfor the American people, and one which the Senate has an obligation to \ntackle.\n  Under our current bankruptcy laws, someone can get full debt \ncancellation in chapter 7 with no questions asked. If we pass our \nreform bill, if someone seeking bankruptcy can repay his or her debts, \nthey will be channeled into chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code, which \nrequires people to pay some portion of their debts as a precondition \nfor limited debt cancellation.\n  The bankruptcy bill, which the Senate will hopefully consider soon, \nwill discourage bankruptcies and, therefore, lessen upward pressure on \ninterest rates and prices. Right now, under present bankruptcy laws, \none of the richest captains of industry could walk into bankruptcy \ncourt and walk away with his debts erased. Of course, the rest of \nAmerica will pay higher prices for goods and services as a result. If \nwe pass this bill, higher-income people will be unable to use \nbankruptcy as a financial planning tool. All Americans will be better \noff. The message of Senate bill 625 is simple: If you have the ability \nto pay debt, you will not get off scot-free.\n  These are good times in our Nation, thanks to the fiscal discipline \ninitiated by Congress, and the hard work of the American people--and \nmore due to the hard work of the American people than what we have done \nin Congress. We have the first balanced budget in a generation, \nunemployment is low, we have a burgeoning stock market. Most Americans, \nexcept for the American farmers who are in a depression, are optimistic \nabout the future. But in the midst of such prosperity, about one and a \nhalf million Americans declared bankruptcy in 1998. Based on filings \nfor the first two quarters of 1999, it looks like there will be just \nunder 1.4 million bankruptcy filings for this year. To put this in some \nhistorical context, since 1990, the rate of personal bankruptcy filings \nhas increased almost 100 percent.\n  Now, I don't think anyone knows all of the reasons--I don't pretend \nto know either--underlying the bankruptcy crisis. But I think I can \ntalk about what is not at the root of the bankruptcy crisis. I have a \nchart here that has four smaller charts on it that I think demonstrates \nit is not the economy that is\n\n[[Page S11543]]\n\ndriving the crisis. Here we have the high rise in bankruptcies over the \nlast 6 years, a very rapid near 100-percent increase in bankruptcy \nfilings. We have, during that same period of time, a very dramatic drop \nin unemployment in the country. We have a very sharp rise in the Dow \nJones Industrial Average. We have a rise in the average wage of \nAmerican workers. This shows that it is not the economy that is causing \nso many bankruptcies.\n  The economic numbers tell us that the bankruptcy crisis isn't a \nresult of people who can't get jobs; and the jobs that people do have \nare paying more than ever. So the bankruptcy crisis isn't about \ndesperate people confronting layoffs and underemployment. With the \neconomy doing well and with so many Americans with high-quality, good-\npaying jobs, we have to look deep into the eroding moral values of some \npeople to find out what is driving the bankruptcy crisis. Some people \nflat out don't want to honor their obligations and are looking for an \neasy way out. In the opinion of this Senator, a significant part of the \nbankruptcy crisis is basically a moral crisis. Some people just don't \nhave a sense of personal responsibility.\n\n  It seems clear to me that our lax bankruptcy system must bear some of \nthe blame for the bankruptcy crisis. Just as the old welfare system \nencouraged people not to get jobs and encouraged people not to even \nthink about pulling their own weight, our lax bankruptcy system doesn't \neven ask people to consider paying what they owe, particularly when \nthey have the ability to pay. Such a system, obviously, contributes to \nthe fray of the moral fiber of our Nation. Why pay your bills when you \ncan walk away with no questions asked? Why honor your obligations when \nyou can take the easy way out through bankruptcy? If we don't tighten \nthe bankruptcy system, the moral erosion will certainly continue.\n  The polls are very clear that the American people want the bankruptcy \nsystem tightened up. In my home State of Iowa, 78 percent of Iowans \nsurveyed favor bankruptcy reform, and the picture is the same \nnationally. According to the Public Broadcasting System program Techno-\nPolitics, almost 70 percent of Americans support bankruptcy reform.\n  The American people seem to sense that the bankruptcy crisis is \nfundamentally a moral crisis. I have a chart that also deals with that. \nThis chart is done by the Democratic polling firm of Penn & Schoen. It \ntalks about the perceptions people have about bankruptcy. You can see \nhere that 84 percent of the people think that bankruptcy is more \nsocially acceptable than it was a few years ago. This is the same \npolling firm President Clinton uses; so I think this number is very \ntelling, given that it was produced by a liberal polling firm. In my \nState of Iowa, the editorial page of the Des Moines Register has summed \nup the problem that we have with the bankruptcy system by stating that \nbankruptcy ``was never intended as the one-stop, no-questions-asked \nsolution to irresponsibility.'' I totally agree.\n  I hope we can soon get to the bankruptcy bill, which has so much \nsupport in the Senate. As my colleague who worked so closely with me on \nthis legislation, the Senator from New Jersey, has said, we are \ncommitted to bringing this bill to a vote this year and getting it done \nin a fashion that will show the bipartisanship that has operated \nthroughout this year to bring us a 14-4 vote out of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, to duplicate that wide margin on the floor of the \nSenate, to send a clear signal to people who use bankruptcy as \nfinancial planning that if you have the ability to pay, you are never \ngoing to get out of paying what you have the capability of paying. That \nis good for our country, it is good for the economy and, most \nimportant, it is good for the pocketbooks of honest Americans. \nBankruptcies cost the average American family to the tune of $400 a \nyear. That's not fair to the American men and women working to pay \ntaxes and make a better life to have to pay $400 more per year because \nsomebody else isn't paying their debts.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/28/senate-section/article/S11543-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, as I understand it, that resolution is the \ncontinuing resolution that will keep the Government running for the \nnext 3 weeks based on the 1999 spending figures; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will not interpret the content of \nthe legislation. However, that is the topic of the resolution.\n  Does the Senator seek recognition?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I do. I yield myself such time as I may consume from the \nDemocratic leader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think we have reached a moment on the \nfloor of the Senate that ought to be marked. Very sadly, it is a moment \nof failure for this Republican Congress, a moment of failure after \npromising a moment of success.\n  Why do I say that? There were three promises made by the Republican \nleader to the people of the United States of America. The first promise \nwas that the spending bills, all 13 of them, would pass on time and \nwithin the context of the balanced budget; the second promise was that \nthe Republicans would not touch the Social Security trust fund to pay \nfor their programs; the third promise was that they would stay under \nthe spending caps that were approved before.\n  In my opinion and in the opinion of many others, all three of those \npromises are being broken. In the lead story in the New York Times \ntoday, we read about the shenanigans going on in trying to get this \nbudget accomplished.\n  I have proudly served on the Budget Committee in the Senate for 7 \nyears; in the House, I served on the Budget Committee for a total of 6 \nyears. I know there have been times when neither side has performed as \nit should. However, I never, ever remember it being this bad. I never, \never remember it being this chaotic. It is very sad because the rest of \nthe country is doing great fiscally. This is the best economic recovery \nwe have had. In my lifetime, these are the best statistics I can \nremember for low unemployment, low inflation, high home ownership. \nThings are going really well. Yet in that context, when things are \ngoing really well, we cannot get our act together around here. I have \nto say it is a failure of Republican leadership.\n\n  What is before us today is a bill that will continue the functions of \nGovernment for the next 3 weeks because, out of the 13 spending bills, \nonly 1--only 1--has received a signature from this President. \nTherefore, we have to have a continuing resolution or the Government \nwill shut down. I understand that. But let me simply say this. I think \nthe reason my Republican friends are in so much trouble--and I hope \nsome of them will come to the floor because this is their continuing \nresolution; I assume they are on their way so we can have a little bit \nof a debate here--I think the reason the Republicans are in so much \ntrouble is, they have locked out the President, they have locked out \nthe Democrats, and they are coming up with plans that are out of touch \nwith reality and with what the American people want.\n  Let me give an example. Everyone around here says children are a \npriority and education is a priority. Yet the last bill my Senate \nfriends have looked at in the Appropriations Committee, the one they \nsaved until last, is education. HHS--Health and Human Services--\nincludes education.\n  Why do I say the Republicans are out of step with the American \npeople? I say it based on three simple facts.\n\n[[Page S11544]]\n\n  There is nothing in that bill, not one penny, to continue to put \nteachers in the schools and to lower class sizes--nothing, not a penny, \nnot even to continue what we started last year when Senator Murray and \nthe President of the United States of America put before us a very \nimportant program to place 100,000 teachers in the schools.\n  Last year, as a result of our getting together, we compromised at \n30,000 teachers. To be exact, 29,000 teachers have been hired under \nthis program. There is not one penny in this education bill to continue \nthat program. We were hoping we would have funding to continue the \n29,000 and go forward with the rest of the 100,000. We know that when \nthere are smaller class sizes, kids do much better. We know that. It is \na fact. It is indisputable. Yet in their Republican budget, not only do \nthey not expand this program but they do not put one penny in to pay \nfor the 29,000 teachers all over the country who are already in the \nclassroom. This Republican budget is a pink slip for 29,000 teachers. \nHow does that comport with what the American people want? How does that \ncomport with the reality the American people expect from us? It does \nnot.\n  Another thing the American people say they want from us is to rebuild \nour crumbling schools. You do not have to have a degree in education or \nsociology to understand our schools are falling down. What kind of \nmessage is it to our children when we say how important education is in \nthis global marketplace and their parents are telling them how \nimportant it is, and they walk into school, and what happens? The \nceiling tiles are falling down on their heads. I saw it in Sacramento, \nCA. I saw it in Los Angeles County. Yesterday, the President was in a \nLouisiana school. He saw the same thing. We need to make sure we \nrebuild our crumbling schools. That is another issue the American \npeople want resolved.\n  Third, after school; I have brought the issue of after school to the \nSenate for many years. I am very pleased to say we are moving forward. \nBut we have thousands and hundreds of thousands of children on waiting \nlists for afterschool programs.\n  Why are they important? Because we know in many cases parents work \nand kids get in trouble after school. We know when they have good \nafterschool programs, they learn, they get mentoring, the business \ncommunity comes in, the police community comes in, they learn about the \ndangers of drugs, they can get help with their homework, and they do \nimportant things. I have been to some fantastic afterschool programs, \nand I have seen the look on the kids' faces. I tell you, they are doing \nwell. Studies show they improve their academic performance--by 80 \npercent in one particular program in Sacramento--if they have \nafterschool.\n  What does the Republican education budget do for after school? It \ncomes in $200 million below the President's request. What that means is \nthat 387,000 children will be denied after school.\n  What I am saying is, we have a budget situation that is out of touch \nwith what the American people want. I am just giving three examples--\nteachers in the schools, school construction, afterschool programs. \nThose are just examples. Guess how they pay for it. As I understand \nit--and it keeps changing every day--essentially they tap into the \nSocial Security trust fund. They do it in a dance, and a bob and a \nweave that is impressive, but I understand it.\n  What I understand they are going to do is take $11 billion in \nauthorizing funds out of the defense budget--OK?--and put it into \neducation. Follow me on this. And then, as soon as they have done that, \nthey declare that $11 billion of defense spending is an emergency. That \nis the way they get around the caps.\n  There is only one problem: It comes out of the Social Security trust \nfund. All emergency spending comes out of the Social Security trust \nfund. So, yesterday what was not an emergency in the military budget \ntoday will become an emergency, and the Social Security fund will be \nraided. I have to say, this is gamesmanship.\n  I think what we ought to do is pay as you go around here. If we want \nto spend more, we ought to pay for it. That is why the President's \nbudget had well over $30 billion of offsets to handle the new \nrequirements. It doesn't dip into the Social Security trust fund, and \nit doesn't play shell games between defense and domestic priorities.\n  So here we are going to have a continuing resolution to get us \nthrough these next 3 weeks. I truly have not decided whether I am going \nto vote for it or not because, on the one hand, I understand we are \ncoming down to the end of the fiscal year and we have to continue the \nGovernment; on the other hand, I believe, as the Senator from the \nlargest State in the Union, the way they are doing this budget around \nhere is something I do not want my fingerprints on. I really do not. I \ndo not approve of it. I think it is wrong. I do not think it is honest. \nI do not think it is direct with the people. I do not think it is \nfiscally responsible. I think it takes us down the road we do not want \nto go down. I don't want more smoke and mirrors. We have had enough of \nthat on both sides of the aisle. We are finally getting on our fiscal \nfeet. We ought to stay on our fiscal feet.\n  I just want to say to my friends, I have a solution to their \nproblem--because they are having problems on this. If they will open \nthe door to this President and work with him on some compromises here, \nwe can finish our work and be proud and go home. Will everyone get what \nhe or she wants? No. That is what compromise is. But we will each get \nmaybe halfway there, and we can feel good about ourselves, that we have \nreached across the party lines. This President has his strong \npriorities. The Republican Congress has its strong priorities. I think \nif they add to that the Democratic leadership here, Senators Daschle \nand Reid, and then on the House side Congressman Gephardt, Congressman \nBonior, and the other leaders, of both sides, I think we will find we \ncan do business together.\n  One of the reasons I hesitate to vote for this continuing resolution \nis, as I said, I am not sure I want my fingerprints on what has \nhappened so far. On the other hand, it is not too late. In the next 3 \nweeks, we could open up the doors. We could have a summit. We could \nbring everyone to it. We could all lay out what we want to have happen, \nshow the American people we are willing to put them in front of \npolitics, and come out with something we can be proud of, a true \neducation plan that is going to meet their needs, a budget that is in \nbalance, both in its actual numbers and in its priorities. I think we \ncan go home and be very proud of ourselves.\n\n  I was on my feet for many hours last week over an issue called oil \nroyalties. It is very interesting, in this continuing resolution, that \nmoratorium on fixing the oil royalty problem is nonexistent. It is \npossible that the Interior Department could issue rules and stop the \nthievery that is going on. I hope they will do it. I really hope they \nwill do it.\n  Talk about needing money. We estimate that $66 million a year is \nbeing lost out of the coffers because the oil companies are not paying \ntheir fair share in oil royalties. We had a vote on this, a very close \nvote. Senator Hutchison was able to defeat me by 1 vote on the cloture \nvote, and I think the final vote was 51-47. I was unable to defeat her \non the substance of her amendment. But John McCain wrote in and said he \nwould have voted with me, which would have made it 51-48.\n  I hope Bruce Babbitt is watching this and he will take advantage of \nthis 3-week hiatus we have in front of us where he is now able to fix \nthis problem. I hope he will do it. I really appreciate the editorials \nacross the country saying we have exposed a real scam and it ought to \nbe fixed. I hope, again, if Secretary Babbitt is listening, perhaps he \nwill do something good in these 3 weeks and move forward to resolve \nthat issue.\n  Be that as it may, that is a relatively small issue compared to \nkeeping this Government going. I know we will keep this Government \ngoing with or without my vote. We will move it forward. I once more \nappeal to my colleagues: You made three promises, you have not kept \nthem. Why not open the door and see if we can help you out because you \ncannot obviously come to this decision on your own. You have not done \nthe bills on time, you are dipping into Social Security, and, in \nessence, you are bypassing the caps by calling things emergency \nspending today that did not warrant emergency spending yesterday. Why \ndon't we stop the smoke and mirrors and shell games? Why don't we\n\n[[Page S11545]]\n\npass a budget that reflects all of us to a certain degree.\n  In the House of Representatives, there are only 11 votes that \nseparate Republicans and Democrats. I have been over there. I was over \nthere when we were in the majority. We probably had a 50-, 60-seat \nmajority. The Republicans have an 11-seat majority in the House and a \n10-seat majority in the Senate. They run the place. That is the way it \nis. Even if they had a 1-vote majority, they would run the place. I \naccept that. That is how the voters wanted it. But it is kind of tough \nwhen it is that close to do the right thing unless we all sit down \ntogether.\n  We have good people on both sides of the aisle. I have so many \nfriends on the other side of the aisle whom I respect very much, \nincluding the Presiding Officer with whom I have worked on many issues. \nThere is no reason why we cannot sit down in these next 3 weeks and \nfind the answers and make the compromises. But we are never going to do \nit if we put politics ahead of bipartisanship. That is my plea before \nwe have a vote.\n  I thank the Chair very much for his patience. I know it is sometimes \nhard to sit there and listen, and he has done that in a very fine way.\n  I yield the floor and, of course, retain the remainder of the \nleader's time on this side. I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that it be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume from the Democratic leader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I very much appreciate the opportunity to speak on \nwhat I consider is perhaps the most important issue facing us, and that \nis the future of our educational system.\n  Everywhere I go in my State people are worried about the future of \nour education system. They are worried in the inner city; they are \nworried in the wealthy suburbs; they are worried in the rural areas; \nthey are worried in the upstate cities. Everywhere we go, people are \nworried and concerned.\n  Their gut feeling, as usual with the American people, is right. They \nknow we are entering a profound new time where ideas generate wealth. \nAlan Greenspan I thought put it best. He said: High value is added no \nlonger by moving things but by thinking things.\n  America, God bless us, does very well in this type of ideas economy. \nIn fact, if one looks at probably a core sentence at the very key of \nour existence as Americans, it is competition of ideas. That is what \nthe Founding Fathers fought for, that there could be a free and open \ncompetition of ideas, free speech, or in the spiritual sense, which is \nfreedom of religion, or in a business sense which is capitalism, free \nenterprise, or in a political sense, which is democracy, all of which \nare at the core of this country.\n  In general, we are doing extremely well as an economy because we \nbelieve in the competition of ideas. It does not matter who you are, \nfrom where you come; if you have a good idea, you can either go out and \nmake money or become an author or professor or whatever. It works. But \nwhen our world is becoming so focused on the competition of ideas and \nideas in general, we cannot afford to have a second-rate educational \nsystem. When I read that we are 15th, say, in math of the 25 or 22 \ndeveloped countries, or we are 18th in biology or 12th in geography, I \nworry, and I think every American worries, whether they voice it in \nthese terms or in other terms.\n  We face a real problem, and that is the future of our educational \nsystem. It is not the best.\n  I can imagine a country, let's say an imaginary country, of, say, 20 \nmillion citizens, many fewer than we have. It can be a complete desert: \nNo fertile fields, no wealth in the mines, but if they had the best \neducational system and churned out top-level people, they could become \nthe leading economy in the world.\n  We have an imperative to create not the second best, not the third \nbest, not the fourth best, but the best educational system in the \nworld.\n  We have pockets of excellence. I have seen them in my State. But we \nalso have pockets--broader than pockets, we also have broad plains of \nschools that are not the best. I say this as somebody who is a father \nof two daughters who are both in public schools in New York City. One \nis 15 and one is 10. They are getting a good education. My wife and I \ndo everything we can to see that the education is the best. But every \nparent and every grandparent and every young person worries about the \nfuture of our educational system.\n\n  With the Education, Labor and HHS conference report, one of the first \nthings I look at, perhaps the first, is how is it for education?\n  At first glance, it does not look too bad. Funding levels are \nmarginally better than last year on some of the major school programs. \nWhen you consider how contentious this bill can be, at first glance it \nseems this is a pretty fair, good-faith effort. But then there is the \nfine print. When you get to the fine print, it is frustrating and \nmaddening. It is not a good bill for education. If we care about our \ncountry's future, our children and our grandchildren, we will not \nsupport a proposal that is as weak as it is on education.\n  The most egregious item in the bill is the so-called teacher \nassistance initiative. This is our program to hire 100,000 new \nteachers. There is funding in the bill of $1.2 billion. That is all \ngreat, except when you read the fine print. It says this money is \nsubject to authorization. To the average citizen, it means this money \nis not there at this point in time.\n  We all know we are not going to authorize this program this year. So \nmoney for new teachers will disappear at a time when we need better \nquality teachers. I have introduced a ``Marshall Plan'' for education \nfocusing on the quality of teachers. At a time when we need to reduce \nclass size, what we are doing is taking away money that would now \nexist, and then we are afraid to say so.\n  So we put in this chimerical program which says the money is here, \nand then it isn't. The language for this program is designed, in short, \nnot to hire teachers but to fool parents; it is a bait and switch, \nbecause what is really going to happen to the $1.2 billion for new \nteachers is that it is going to be spent on something else. Who knows \nwhat it will be. It could be on anything. But it will not be on \nteachers.\n  What disturbs me is that the shortage of good, qualified teachers is \nreaching crisis proportions. Half of our teachers are at retirement \nage; too few new teachers are taking their place; and in today's world, \nwhere the success of an individual depends more on the content of their \nmind than on the strength of their back, we cannot continue this \nholding pattern on education.\n  But this proposal is not just a holding pattern. It is worse. It is a \nstep backward because last year we made the initial downpayment on the \nhiring of 100,000 new teachers, and this year we are leaving cities and \ntowns across the country in the lurch.\n  It is a shame. It is a shame this bill makes a false promise that we \nare going to continue to fund this emergency teacher program, when we \nall know that unless the language in the bill is deleted, not a single \ndollar will be spent on new teachers.\n  I would ask our Senate leadership--plain and simple--to allow us to \nvote on this language.\n  There are two other problems with the education portion of this bill. \nThe first is school construction--another national crisis. We have \ninner city schools that are overcrowded. We have kids in the suburbs \ngoing to school in trailers.\n\n  I learned this firsthand from my own daughter when she was in \nkindergarten and went to an overcrowded school in my hometown of \nBrooklyn, NY. There were two classes in one kindergarten room on the \nday my wife and I went to Open School Day. We understood the difficulty \nbecause you had one class in one part of the room and one class in the \nother part of the room, and when our daughter's teacher was speaking, \nyou could not understand her because you heard, in the background, the\n\n[[Page S11546]]\n\nother teacher speaking in the other part of the classroom.\n  We have students in New York who are in temporary classrooms because \neither their suburban school districts or their city school districts \nare growing or because the decrepit buildings that were built 40, 60, \nand 80 years ago are in desperate need of repair.\n  Some might say, let the localities do all this. Have you ever seen \nthe property taxes in localities throughout our States and large parts \nof our country? The local governments do not have the wherewithal for \nthese kinds of major expenditures. So we can come up with some kind of \nrule that the Federal Government is not going to help, whereby this \nproblem continues, or we can step into the lurch. I would like to step \ninto the lurch.\n  Our school districts need Federal help. This bill offers nothing for \nschool construction and is a grievous blow to our schools and our kids.\n  Last, there is no money for afterschool programs. These are programs \nthat help students with tutoring and help gifted students with advanced \nlearning. It is also an important part of our strategy of keeping kids \nout of trouble by keeping them in schools so they are not marching \naround the streets or the shopping malls. There is nothing in this bill \nfor them.\n  When I was a young man growing up in Brooklyn, I attended the Madison \nHigh School Afterschool Center and Night Center. I spent a lot of time \nplaying basketball. I had fun. We were not very good. Our team's motto \nwas: We may be small, but we're slow. But it kept me in constructive \nactivity. It did not cost much. There is nothing in the bill for \nsomething like that.\n  Again, could the local school district do this? Yes; and some are \nable to. But with property taxes through the roof in so many \ndistricts--in the suburbs, in the cities, in rural areas --most school \ndistricts say they cannot afford it and they simply let the localities \nfend for themselves.\n  So there is nothing in this bill for students who need and want a \nplace to go after the final bell rings.\n  In sum, this bill, which on first blush does not look too bad, is a \nreal disappointment. Much of the promised money is ``phantom'' money, \nand it saddens me because our education crisis is anything but \n``phantom.''\n  The economic strength of this Nation, as I mentioned at the beginning \nof my little chat, is directly tied to the ability of our schools to \nproduce young men and young women who are the best, who are innovative \nand creative and analytical, skilled in math and science and technology \nand communications.\n  Just today I introduced legislation with the Senator from Virginia, \nMr. Robb, and the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, and the \nSenator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, which talks about how we are using \nforeign workers for the most highly skilled professions because we do \nnot have enough Americans to fill those positions. Let's make sure we \nhave enough Americans 5 and 10 and 15 years from now to fill those \npositions. This bill does not do it.\n  In my view, we should be doing much more for our kids and for schools \nthan what we would do in this bill, even if all the funding was real. \nThis is the one place we should be spending more money. We should be \nspending it intelligently. We should be spending it with standards. I \nbelieve we should not have social promotion. I believe teachers should \nhave standards and be tested and meet certain levels. But we should be \nspending it. This bill, even if the gimmicks were eliminated, basically \ntreads water. With the gimmicks in it, it means we are drowning. I am \ndisappointed we can't produce a bill that does more for our kids and, \nparticularly, that there is funding here that we know is a phantom. The \nleast we should do is make sure the 100,000 teachers provision is real \nand whole because our problems are not about to fade away.\n\n  We need to embark on a massive effort to improve education. If the \nFederal Government can help do that, I think we should.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from New York talked about the 100,000 \nteachers program, the program to try to reduce class size all around \nthis country and improve schools, improve learning as a result.\n  I came from a markup of the appropriations bill that will provide the \nresources for various education functions. We had a discussion in that \nmarkup on this subject. It is the case, as the Senator from New York \nindicates, that unless something affirmatively is done, we will come to \nthe next school year and 25 or 30,000 teachers across this country, \nteachers in every State, will get a pink slip saying: You are not any \nlonger hired under this program.\n  Last year, during the negotiation over the budget and appropriations \nbetween President Clinton and the Republicans and Democrats in \nCongress, a program was both authorized and funded that said it shall \nbe the objective in this country to reduce class size and provide \nteachers to help accomplish that. Why? Because we know kids learn \nbetter in smaller classes. Does a kid have more attention from the \nteacher and more individualized instruction in a class with 15 or 16 \nstudents than with 30 students? The answer is, yes, of course. From \nstudy after study, in State after State, we understand it makes a \ndifference in a child's education to reduce class size.\n  Unless this Congress continues to fund that effort, up to 30,000 \nteachers will be fired. Isn't it the case that this program was \nauthorized last year and appropriated last year, almost 1 year ago now? \nAnd the bill that will come to the floor tomorrow, by the way, will \npropose that we not fund that, that we decide not to fund that program; \nisn't that the case? And isn't it the case that we will have to wage a \nfight on the floor of the Senate for an amendment that affirmatively \nsays: We as a country want to retain and continue this objective of \nreducing class size to improve education and improve the opportunities \nof young children to learn in schools?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from North Dakota, \nhe is right on the money, literally and figuratively--literally \nbecause, as I understand it, this proposal says they are going to use \n$1.2 billion, the amount we need to continue the program of hiring \n100,000 new teachers, but then it says only if it is authorized. The \nSenator may correct me if I am wrong, but I believe the program is not \nauthorized and there is virtually no chance we will authorize it this \nyear. Am I right about that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from New York is correct. There is a \ncircumstance in the markup document that we saw today, and that we took \naction on this afternoon, that says there will be money available, if \nauthorized. But, of course, the authorization committee is not going to \nbe on the floor reauthorizing elementary and secondary education. It \nsets up a circumstance where they know and we know they will not \ncontinue this program to reduce class size.\n  How do you reduce class size? You hire additional teachers. We don't \nhave a large role in education at the Federal level. Most of elementary \nand secondary education is handled locally. Local school boards, State \ngovernments, and others decide the kind of education system they want. \nWhat we have done is establish national objectives. One of our \nobjectives is to say we can improve education, we know how to improve \neducation, if we can devote more resources to teachers in order to have \nmore teachers and reduce class size.\n  Walk into a classroom bursting with 30 children. Then ask yourself, \ndoes that teacher have the same capability to affect each of those \nchildren's lives that a teacher who is teaching 15 children would have \nin the same classroom? The answer is, no, of course not. That is why \nthis is so important.\n  There is nothing much more important in this country than education. \nAlmost everything we are and everything we have been and almost all we \nwill become as a country is as a result of this country deciding \neducation is a priority, that every young child in this country shall \nhave the opportunity to become the best they can be.\n  I walked into a school one day in North Dakota. I have told about it \non the floor of the Senate. A little third grader--this was a school \nwith almost all young Indian children--whose name was Rosie said to me: \nMr. Senator, are you going to build us a new school? Regrettably, I \ncouldn't say yes; I don't\n\n[[Page S11547]]\n\nhave the money. I don't have the authorization. I don't have the \ncapability. But she needs a new school. One hundred and fifty kids, one \nwater fountain, and two bathrooms crammed in a building that in \nlarge part is condemned. These kids need new schools. They need smaller \nclassrooms, better teachers.\n\n  How do we do that? We devote resources to it. If we have $792 billion \nto give in a tax cut over the next 10 years, maybe there ought to be \nsome money to care about Rosie and to care about other kids crammed \ninto classrooms across this country, classrooms that are too crowded, \nclassrooms where learning isn't accomplished, where we know it can be \naccomplished if we have more teachers and reduce the size of the \nclassroom. Isn't that the substance of this debate? Isn't that why it \nis important?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have to go to another meeting with \nfolks from Binghamton, but the Senator is on the money again. We need \nto help improve our educational system. Instead of moving forward, this \nbill is a step backward on teachers and smaller class size, on school \nconstruction, afterschool programs.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, in the Senate \nto reject this bill until it does good for education. I thank my \ncolleague from North Dakota for bringing forward these points so \neloquently and so forcefully.\n  With that, I yield back my time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Eighteen minutes 24 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are debating a continuing resolution \nfor 3 weeks. The continuing resolution, which probably doesn't mean \nmuch to a lot of people, commonly called a CR here in Congress--means \nwe continue the appropriations level of those appropriated accounts \nthat now exist for a time until the appropriations bills are debated \nand voted on by the Congress.\n  Normally, we should do that by September 30, and then, by October 1, \nthe new fiscal year starts. When the new fiscal year starts, the new \nappropriations bills which we have passed come into effect and provide \nthe funding. Because we have not passed, finally, between the House and \nthe Senate, appropriations bills from the conference reports, we don't \nhave funding that is assured for the coming fiscal year. Therefore, \nthere will be a continuing resolution.\n  Why haven't we passed the appropriations bills coming out of a \nconference with the House of Representatives? The answer is, simply, we \nhave not been able to do that because the money doesn't exist to fit \nall of the priorities in the budget that was passed by the Republicans \nthis spring.\n  We can have a long debate about priorities: What is important and \nwhat isn't; what works, what doesn't; what we should do and what we \nshould not do for the future of this country. Earlier this year, we had \na debate in part about that with respect to the budget. I said then \nthat 100 years from now, when we are all dead and gone, those who want \nto evaluate what we were about, what we thought was important, what our \npriorities were, can take a look at the Federal budget and evaluate \nwhat we decided to invest in, what we wanted to spend money on. Did we \ndecide education was a priority, health care, health care research, \nfood safety, or family farmers? Go down the list; there are literally \nhundreds of priorities. One could evaluate what people thought was \nimportant by evaluating what they decided to put in their budget and \nthen what they decided to fund.\n  The two largest appropriations bills have been held until the end of \nthis Congress because the money didn't exist to fund them. We have \nbudget caps that everyone in this Chamber knows do not now fit. We \nfinish appropriating money for defense and a number of other agencies \nand then come to the remaining appropriations bills and are told: You \nhave to do a 17-percent, 27-percent, or 30-percent across-the-board cut \nin all of these other issues: education, health care, and more.\n  That is not something anyone would bring to the floor of the Senate. \nSo we start doing creative financing. The majority party said: We can \nsolve this problem by creating a 13th month.\n  That was one of the ideas last week or the week before. We can just \ndescribe a 13th month. If you could just have a 13th month, then you \ncould move money around and pretend you had solved the problem.\n  Well, the Washington Post wrote about that and said ``GOP Seeks to \nEase Crunch with 13-month Fiscal Year.'' That didn't work real well \nbecause nobody knew what to call it. Of course, folks immediately \ndescribed it as smoke and mirrors and not a very thoughtful approach.\n  The Wall Street Journal wrote this article: ``GOP Uses Two Sets of \nBooks.'' It describes ``double counting.'' Of course, that doesn't work \nreal well either. Double entry bookkeeping doesn't mean you can use the \nsame dollars twice. Some described a new accounting system using two \nsets of books. That hasn't turned out to work real well either.\n  Now we have what is called ``virtual money.'' I heard somebody \ndescribed funding for a ``virtual university'' that Governors want to \ncreate. I thought that was appropriate. We now have a ``virtual \nfunding'' scheme for the largest appropriations bill. We will see how \nthat works.\n  This process, at the end of this session of Congress, is about as \ndisorganized and messy as any I have seen in the years I have served in \nCongress. This isn't the way to do the Senate's work or the country's \nwork. The thoughtful way to do it is to pass appropriations bills, one \nby one, during this year when they should be passed, go to conference, \nreach accommodations and compromise between the House and Senate, \nbetween Republicans and Democrats, between the Congress and the \nPresident, and then fund the programs that are important for this \ncountry's future.\n  None of that is happening. Earlier today, the majority leader \nindicated on one of the very important appropriations bills that I care \nabout--the Agriculture appropriations bill--that the conference was \n``ongoing.'' He said, in response to the Senator from Minnesota, the \nconference is underway. I pointed out that the conference isn't \nunderway. I am a conferee. That conference hasn't met for a week.\n  I went back to my office after pointing that out to the majority \nleader and I read this memo that was sent to all conferees. This is \nfrom a staff person with the Republican majority on the conference \ndealing with agriculture. Mind you, there is not much that is more \nimportant as an issue to my State, North Dakota, than agriculture and \nthe health of family farming. We face a very serious crisis with the \ncollapse of grain prices, and dried up trade markets, and a whole range \nof issues, such as sprout damage with our grain, and just a range of \nissues. We are in a real crisis.\n  We passed a bill on August 4 in the Senate to try to respond to the \nneeds of family farmers. Then, for 6 or 7 weeks, there was this foot \ndragging with nothing happening. We finally went to conference last \nweek, and it was adjourned abruptly and there has been no meeting \nsince.\n  The majority leader said the conference is meeting. It isn't meeting. \nAfter I had that dialog with the majority leader, I received this today \nfrom a staffer, a Republican staffer, on the conference, apparently:\n\n       As of this morning, the Senate Majority Leader signed off \n     on a package which was offered from the Speaker--\n\n  Speaker of the House--\n\n     to resolve our stalled agriculture appropriations conference.\n\n  It is interesting that the majority leader signed off on a package \noffered by the Speaker. If that is so, I have not seen the package; I \nnever heard of it. There have been no meetings. Is there a group in \nthis Capitol that is deciding what is going to happen outside the \npurview of the conference? Does the majority leader plan to tell us \nwhat is in this package he signed off on? Is it his decision or the \nSpeaker's decision that conferences do not matter anymore? Can they \nmake decisions about family farmers, agriculture, disasters, and farm \nemergencies without including input from those of us who represent farm \nStates? Is that what is happening?\n\n  It says:\n\n       The conference will not reconvene and all items are closed.\n\n  I am one of the conferees. We haven't met for a week. We are in the \nmiddle of\n\n[[Page S11548]]\n\na full-scale crisis and disaster on America's family farms. A week ago, \nwe had 100,000 hogs floating dead in the Carolinas, a million chickens, \nuntold cattle, crops devastated up and down the east coast from \nHurricane Floyd. You think they don't have a disaster? You think they \ndon't have a crisis? That needs to be addressed in this conference. How \nis it going to be addressed? Who is going to do it?\n  The conference was adjourned. Do you know why it was adjourned? \nBecause some on the conference--on the Republican side in the House--\ndidn't like what we did in the Senate with respect to embargoes on food \nand medicine. What we did, in a bipartisan way, with Senators Ashcroft \nand Dodd, was say that we ought not ever use food as a weapon again. We \nare sick and tired of it. Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Cuba, you name it--\nwhen you slap an embargo on countries that are not behaving well and \nyou include in that the cut off of food and medicine to those \ncountries, you shoot yourself in the foot. We all know it. We have \nknown it for 40 years. This Senate, by 70 votes, said it is time to \nstop that--no more food embargoes or using food as a weapon.\n  Well, we got to conference and the Republicans on the House side \ndidn't like that, and so they adjourned and haven't met since. Now I am \ntold, by notification of a staffer, that the conference is over, the \nconference will not reconvene, all items are closed and, as of this \nmorning, Senate Majority Leader Lott has signed off on a package that \nwas offered from Speaker Hastert to resolve our stalled appropriations \nconference.\n  That is some bipartisan way to run a Senate or a Congress. It \nshortchanges America's family farmers, and it shortchanges those of us \nwho serve here who are supposed to have an opportunity to serve on \nthese conference committees. In my judgment, it really turns a blind \neye to the needs of rural America.\n  We will discuss this at some greater length, but we have to do a \ncontinuing resolution now--that is what this debate is about--because \nthis bill wasn't done. This bill wasn't done because we have been \nstalling for months and months because they didn't feel they had the \nmoney to do it. Then we have full-scale emergencies arise with the \ncollapse of grain prices, Hurricane Floyd, a drought in some parts of \nthe country, and, finally, it is decided we have to do some kind of a \nbill and then it gets into conference, and we have all these folks who \ncan't decide to agree, so they just quit. The majority leader and the \nSpeaker made a decision on how this is going to go, and they will bring \nit to the floor.\n  That is not satisfactory to me and my colleagues, a number of whom \nserve on this conference committee and have waited for that conference \ncommittee to be called back into session. That is not the way to do \nbusiness. A CR is not the way to do business, and we all know it. I am \nnot going to object to a 3-week continuing resolution. I will vote for \nit. I told Senator Daschle I will vote for it. But we all know it \nrepresents a failure of this Senate to get its business done on time, a \nfailure of the Senate to describe the right priorities and support \nthem.\n  I hope this is the last of those kinds of failures. I hope that at \nthe end of 3 weeks, we will have had the opportunity to debate, offer \namendments, and consider a range of opinions in this Chamber on a range \nof issues, going from education to farm policy, and more.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum, \nand I ask unanimous consent that the time be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time to address the \npending issue for a couple of minutes.\n  It is with some reluctance that we find ourselves in a situation of \nhaving to support a continuing resolution for the next 3 weeks. \nAlthough most Democrats will support this resolution, I don't know that \nour caucus will be united in its support. And on behalf of those of us \nwho are supportive, I think it has to be said--and I haven't had the \ngood fortune to hear any of the debate--we do so with great reluctance \nand great disappointment. We hope this will be the only CR that will be \nvoted on and addressed this year.\n  Our Republican colleagues made three promises last spring. The first \npromise was, they would not use Social Security trust funds to pay for \nother government programs; the second promise was, there would be no \nlifting of the discretionary spending caps, that we could live within \nthe caps we all agreed to in 1997; the third promise or commitment was, \nwe would meet the deadlines.\n  We all understand the new fiscal year begins October 1, and we strive \nto complete our work by the first day of the new fiscal year. Here we \nare, a couple of days away from the new fiscal year, and what has \nhappened? Our Republican colleagues told Members during the budget \ndebate: No, we really don't want any Democratic amendments. We will do \nthis on our own. We will pass a Republican budget--not a bipartisan \nbudget but a Republican budget. That Republican budget passed without \nDemocratic support and without Democratic involvement.\n  We then had a Finance Committee markup, and our Republican colleagues \nagain said: No, we really don't want any Democratic input. We will pass \na tax cut of a magnitude that goes way beyond anything the Democrats \ncould support--recognizing it cuts into the very investments we have \nexpressed so much concern about today, recognizing it cuts into Social \nSecurity as they promised they would not do.\n  Then we had the appropriations process. With the exceptions of the \nVA/HUD and defense bills, Democratic Members were largely shut out of \nthe appropriations subcommittee markups, the full committee markups, \nand the conferences with the House\n  We hate to say we told you so, but that is exactly where we are \ntoday: We told you so. We knew they could not do what they said they \nwere going to do earlier this spring and this summer. We knew \nultimately they would have to cut Social Security to get to this point, \nand they have. We knew they would probably be forced to increase the \ncaps, and now they have admitted that is most likely what they will do. \nWe knew they wouldn't make the deadline, and, unfortunately, that too \nhas come to pass.\n  Our Republican colleagues are coming to the floor now asking we join \nwith them in passing a continuing resolution to give them 3 more weeks \nin spite of the fact we were told they really didn't need our help this \nspring, they didn't need it this summer. In fact, one of the leadership \nin the House, Congressman DeLay, was quoted as saying: We are going to \ntrap the Democrats. We are going to trap them into recognizing they \nhave to use Social Security. They have to break the caps.\n  I have to say, this is no way to legislate. The word I use to \ndescribe our current appropriations and budget circumstances is \n``chaos.'' In all the years I have been here, I don't recall a time \nwhen there has been greater appropriations disarray than there is right \nnow. I frankly don't know whether we can put it back together in 3 \nweeks. But we ought to try. We know we cannot go home until this is \ndone. We are hopeful.\n  I was a little concerned when the Speaker was asked, Will you shut \nthe Government down? He said, I hope that won't be necessary, or \nsomething to that effect. I would have hoped there could have been a \nmore definitive statement--that under no circumstances would the \nGovernment be shut down.\n\n  Our Republican colleagues are in a box. They violated their promises \non Social Security and raising the caps and not meeting the deadlines. \nThey can't mask it over now with some charade of bipartisanship when, \nup until this point, there has not been any.\n  Democrats have voted in good faith on many occasions, opting to move \nthis process along with an expectation and hope that somehow in \nconference or at some point prior to the end of the fiscal year we \ncould come together. That hasn't happened yet. As a result of our \ninability to come together, the President is now threatening to veto up \nto six of the thirteen appropriations bills.\n\n[[Page S11549]]\n\nAnd after he vetoes them, then where are we?\n  This is a disappointing day. Republican responsibility day is October \n1. Republican responsibility day is the day when we should all ask the \nquestion, Have the promises been kept? On Social Security, the answer \nis no. On keeping the caps, the answer is no. On meeting the deadline, \nthe answer is no.\n  Now we are faced with an appropriations dilemma on education. They \nhave cut education budgets by 17 percent. They are using a new, \nextraordinarily innovative approach to offsetting the shortfall in \neducation by moving money we have already appropriated out of defense \ninto education. They will then make defense whole again by declaring \nbillions of defense spending an emergency. If that isn't the most \nextraordinary demonstration of flimflam budgeting, I don't know what \nis.\n  This is quite a moment. We have not yet talked about education. We \nwill save that for tomorrow. I am disappointed we have to be here today \nwith the recognition that those promises have not been kept, that we do \nneed a 3-week CR, that we are facing up to six vetoes, and that we \nhaven't been able to come together as Democrats and Republicans in a \nbipartisan way to resolve these problems before it is too late.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the budget gridlock \nwe are now facing. We are considering a continuing resolution today \nbecause Congress has failed to do its job. Congress is supposed to pass \nthe 13 appropriations bills by the new fiscal year. The fiscal year \nstarts October 1. To date, only 1 of the 13 appropriations bills has \nbeen signed into law--1.\n  This is failure on a grand scale. If you look back over the last \nseveral years, in 1995, 5 appropriations bills had not been acted on \nand had to be wrapped into a year-end omnibus measure. In 1996, it went \nto 6 appropriations bills that had to be wrapped in one package, put on \nthe desk of Members with no chance for review and voted up or down. In \n1998, it was 8 appropriations bills that had not been acted on in a \ntimely fashion, that had to be wrapped together. This year maybe we are \nheaded for 12. I do not know. Maybe we can get some others done. But so \nfar, only 1 of the 13 appropriations bills has been signed into law.\n  Does anyone see a pattern here? Does anyone see we have gone from 6 \nappropriations bills in 1996 not enacted to 8 in 1998 and now we have \nonly 1 done on the eve of the new fiscal year? Our Republican \ncolleagues who are in charge here, in the House and the Senate, bear \nresponsibility for this failure to get the job done.\n  I must say, the other side promised very clearly three things. They \nsaid they would get the budget done on time this year. They failed. \nThey said they would hold to the spending caps that were put in place \nby the 1997 bipartisan budget agreement. They failed. They said they \nwould not raid Social Security. They failed. On each and every one of \nthese counts, our Republican colleagues have gone back on what they \npromised. In each and every case, they have said one thing to the \nAmerican public and done another thing in Congress.\n  I understand today they are getting really creative. Today, the \nSenate Appropriations Committee came up with $15 billion for the Labor-\nHHS bill. Where did they get it? They borrowed it from the defense \nbill. That is a new tactic. We have already passed the Defense bill. \nThat is not signed either, by the way. Now they decide to go and borrow \nfrom that bill, they will put it over in the Labor bill, they will \nspend it there, and then they will come careening back and say they \nneed emergency spending for the Defense bill. All of a sudden \neverything is an emergency with our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle.\n  There are things that really are emergencies. The agriculture \nsituation facing this country, that is an emergency. Hurricane Floyd, \nthat is an emergency. But our Republican colleagues are calling \neverything an emergency. They are calling the census an emergency--the \ncensus. We do that every 10 years. We have done that since we started \nas a country and now they are calling that an emergency; something that \nwas not foreseen, an emergency, something we did not know was coming.\n  I must say, the former House Appropriations Committee chairman, the \nformer Speaker-to-be, Bob Livingston, said:\n\n       . . . the census has been with us since the conception of \n     the Constitution of the United States. This is not an \n     emergency.\n\n  He is right. This is not an emergency. Nor is it an emergency as they \nhave now designated the LIHEAP program, that is low-income heating \nassistance. We have had that program for 20 years. Now they say that is \nan emergency.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a lot in the last few days. We heard we \nwere going to a 13th month; that was going to solve the problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 1 hour of debate for the minority has now \nexpired and 54 minutes 53 seconds remain to the majority.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for 30 additional seconds, if I might, and ask for \nit to be added on both sides.\n  Mr. THOMAS. The request is for 30 seconds?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the other point that should be made is now \nour friends on the other side have started the raid on the Social \nSecurity trust fund. That is wrong. I had a reporter ask me: Senator, \ndidn't you put them in this box a number of years ago during the \nbalanced budget debate by insisting we not raid Social Security?\n  I said:\n\n       Absolutely, I am proud of it. We should not raid Social \n     Security. If they want additional spending, they ought to pay \n     for it. And they ought to do it without raiding Social \n     Security. That ought to be a litmus test for any budget.\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments about \nwhere we are, what we are faced with this afternoon, and what we are \nfaced with over the next few weeks. We have heard, of course, a great \ndeal from my friends on the other side of the aisle, some of which is a \nlittle hard to understand, I believe, but nevertheless I guess \nlegitimate conversation.\n  We, of course, are prepared now to take a vote within the next hour, \nor less, on the idea of a continuing resolution. It is not a new idea. \nIt is one that has been used a number of times. Would we all like to be \nthrough now? Of course we would. This matter of appropriations is a \nvery difficult task.\n  I must tell you at the outset, one of the bills I have had in since I \nhave been in the Congress--I brought it with me from the legislature in \nWyoming--says we ought to have a biennial budget. Instead of going \nthrough this every year, we ought to do it every 2 years: Budget 1 \nyear, appropriations the other year, which would give us more \nopportunity to have the kind of oversight Congress is responsible to \ndo, but we do not do that. We go through this each year. Unfortunately, \nthe appropriations becomes kind of the direction for the Congress, \nwhich is wrong. It seems to me we ought to set our priorities, do that \nin the authorizing committees, and then we fund it.\n  The process, of course, is to have a budget. The budget was passed \nthis year on time. The budget is designed to break down the total \nrevenue, the total amount we are willing to spend, break it down by \nvarious subcommittees within the appropriations, and those are the \namount of dollars with which each has to work. So we have done that, of \ncourse.\n\n  This is a pretty positive year in many ways. I certainly wish we were \nfurther along. I think everyone does for various reasons. I have a few \nideas as to why we are not, I might say to my friends on the other \nside. But there are some positive things about which we ought to talk. \nHow long has it been, I say to my friend, how long has it been since we \nhave had a balanced budget? How long has it been since we have had \nincome more than our expenditures? Has it been 25 years? Has it been 30 \nyears? I think so. I think so. So this is kind of a positive thing \nabout which we are talking.\n  This year's caps were less than last year's. Why? Because last year \nwe took some out of this year to pay for it. This year's caps were less \nthan last year's. I would like to stay with the caps; I voted for the \ncaps. But when we bring\n\n[[Page S11550]]\n\nup the kind of emergencies that my friend from North Dakota insisted on \nin agriculture--good idea? Sure. Nevertheless, that is over the caps, \nisn't it? That is an expenditure, and we have had a good deal of that.\n  We have some positive things. We will not get into Social Security. \nWe have not gotten into Social Security. That is one of the things we \nare dedicated not to do. We had about $14 billion, I believe, in this \nbudget, that is not Social Security, and we are not going to spend \nSocial Security. That is a commitment that we have.\n  What are the pressures? The pressures have constantly been, from the \nWhite House, from the other side of the aisle, for more spending. That \nis the principle of this administration: Spend more. Spend more taxes.\n  We are not willing to do that. On the contrary, we have been \ndedicated to keeping spending down, keeping Government size down. So it \nis not an easy project.\n  I am not an appropriator. I am not familiar with the processes that \nhave gone on internally within the committee. Talk about not being \ninvolved--I don't know that. But I do know this has been a very \ndifficult task. I am told within these 13 bills, about 12 of them that \nhave pretty much been completed on this floor are within the spending \ncaps--except for the emergencies. Emergencies in military? Of course. \nNot a bad idea--Kosovo, all those kinds of things that were here to do \nsomething to strengthen the military, to which everyone on this floor \nagrees.\n  These are the kinds of things, certainly, that got us where we are. \nOne of the reasons it has been difficult, of course, it has been hard \nto move things on the floor. We, just this last week, have gone through \na couple of filibusters, as a matter of fact, in which the very folks \nwho have been up this afternoon talking participated. That kept us for \n2 or 3 days talking about MMS, Minerals Management Service. That is one \nof the reasons we are where we are. It has been difficult to move along \nthat way. But that is the way a legislative body works.\n  We tried very hard to do some things to ensure Social Security would \nbe kept as it was--the Social Security lockbox. How many times did we \nbring that up? There was unwillingness to accept it on the other side \nof the aisle. They did not want to do it, so we put that aside.\n\n  They have not been willing to talk about what we want to do with \nSocial Security and individual accounts so that the money will be \nthere.\n  When there is surplus money in this place, it will be spent. Could we \nget tax relief? No. No, our friends on the other side of the aisle did \nnot want to do that; we ought to keep this money here so we can spend \nit. That is how we get into some of these things.\n  I am persuaded there has to be a system if you have excess money: You \neither have to get it out to people on Social Security, put it in those \naccounts, or you have to give it back to the people who paid it, if \nthere is an excess amount of money.\n  No, they do not want to do that. What they want to do is spend more \nof it. That is where we got into this.\n  Gridlock? Yes, indeed, we have had some gridlock. I have been here \nfor less than one term, but I do not believe I have seen as much \ngridlock as there has been this year in terms of bringing up amendments \nto bills we have had to take 2 or 3 days to deal with, constantly \nbringing up an agenda that was different from the agenda that was on \nthe floor.\n  These are the things that, to me, certainly, have created \ndifficulties in getting our task done. I agree, however, that is our \ntask, that is what we are here to do, and I am disappointed we have not \ngotten it done by the end of the fiscal year. But we have not.\n  We are not going to allow ourselves to get into the position--I do \nnot think anyone wants to have that happen--where there is a closure \nand a shutdown of the Government. Certainly we are not interested in \nallowing that to happen, or encouraging it to happen, or promoting an \nopportunity for it to happen. Indeed, we want to move forward with the \nappropriations as they should be dealt with, and we are persuaded that \nis the thing we are going to talk about doing.\n  Again, however, I do think there are some very positive things that \nhave happened. For the first time in 25 years, we are not spending \nSocial Security money, we are not spending deficit money in this \nbudget. It has been a very long time since that has happened.\n  Mr. President, I suspect what we ought to do is move forward. I yield \nback the time allotted to the Members on this side of the aisle and \nask--I was going to ask for the yeas and nays, but I don't think I can \ndo that. I ask unanimous consent that the vote on adoption of House \nJoint Resolution 68 occur at 5:15 this evening and that paragraph 4 of \nrule XII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Presiding Officer, in his capacity as a \nSenator from the State of Washington, reserves the right to object and \nsuggests the absence of a quorum. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as the fiscal year 2000 rapidly approaches, \nRepublicans find themselves scrambling to pass appropriations bills \nbefore the October 1, 1999 deadline. Once again the majority has proven \nincapable of managing the appropriations process. Only four of the \nthirteen appropriations conference agreements have been completed, and \nthe Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill has yet to be voted on in \neither House. I recognize there is going to have to be some time so we \ncan try to work out the differences.\n  What has gone on this past year is something about which we need to \ntalk. We know they have put the most important of the 13 appropriations \nbills, Labor-HHS, at the bottom of the totem pole. Instead of doing \nthis bill first, a bill that is vital to our country in dealing with \nhealth research and education, it has been put at the bottom. I do not \nthink that is appropriate.\n  They have done all kinds of things: The majority has added a 13th \nmonth to the fiscal year. They are talking about delaying tax credits \nfor low-income Americans. They are trying to spread 1 year's funding \nover 3 years. They are talking about making certain things an \nemergency, such as the census. This is just nonsensical.\n  I suggest that putting off for 3 weeks decisions we are going to have \nto make is unnecessary. The majority has consistently failed to finish \ntheir work on appropriations bills. The Senator from North Dakota, Mr. \nConrad, has done an excellent job of illustrating this point. We had \ntwo Government shutdowns in 1995, and this year, rather than developing \nlegitimate spending offsets to increase funding available for the next \nfiscal year, we have come up with all these gimmicks.\n  It is like a Ponzi scheme, a pyramid scheme, which, if you did \noutside the Halls of Congress, is illegal. We have developed a massive \nPonzi scheme while ignoring all of the budget rules. What they are \ndriven toward and are already looking for is to spend Social Security \nmoney even though the talk is different. They are trying to spread this \nfunding over 3 fiscal years, adding a 13th month, declaring things \nemergency that really are not emergencies, and waiting to do the most \nimportant bill the last, Labor-HHS. This is a Ponzi scheme, a pyramid. \nIt is a house of cards that is just about to fall.\n  We keep delaying this. We have to sit down and work out our \ndifferences. We have to do the business of this country, and that means \npassing the appropriations bills in this body, finishing the \nconferences quickly, and getting the President to sign these bills.\n  If we have to do a continuing resolution that takes us through the \nyear on some or all of these appropriations bills, we have to get to \nthat right now. We have spent a lot of time treading water and going \nnowhere. Extending this funding for 3 weeks is doing just that, it is \ntreading water.\n  We have to start doing something that is meaningful, and that means \nmaking tough decisions. Tough decisions, is not extending the year for \nanother month. It is not declaring things like the census an emergency. \nIt is not using welfare moneys that the Governors have kept to offset \nthe problems we are having here. The Governors\n\n[[Page S11551]]\n\nshould be able to use that money any way they want. And there are many \nother things they have attempted to do in an effort to avoid the tough \ndecisions. The tough decisions have to be made. They should be made now \nrather than prolonging this for 3 weeks.\n  Mr. President, has there been a time set for a vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Not yet.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield such of the Republican time to \nmyself as I may use. And for the information of the Senator from \nNevada, I believe I may be the last speaker on this side, and I have \nbeen instructed, unless someone else on this side comes to speak later, \nwhen I have finished, to yield back the remainder of our time, and we \nwill vote then, which probably means a vote before 5:30.\n  Mr. REID. The minority's time is all used.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, yesterday in this Chamber, I was engaged \nin what I believe was a debate on a fantasy. The minority party spent a \ngreat deal of time debating two resolutions on education, one proposed \nby their side and one proposed by our side, with the resolution \nproposed by their side based on the proposition that Republican \nappropriations bills were going to reduce the amount of money spent on \neducation from last year by some 17 percent.\n  That resolution was long and detailed, and ``17-percent cut,'' ``17-\npercent reductions'' appeared all the way through it.\n  I say this was a fantasy debate because by the time the debate began, \nevery member of the Appropriations Committee knew that not only was \neducation not being reduced in the Republican proposal but it was being \nrather significantly increased, in fact, being increased by some $500 \nmillion more than the amount for education recommended by President \nClinton in his budget at the beginning of this year. So there was the \nexercise of a process of beating a dead horse for at least an hour on \nthe other side of the aisle before we voted on our respective \nproposals.\n  There was a significant second difference in that debate over \neducation that was not a fantasy and was not beating a dead horse \nbecause the Democratic proposal was that we do more of the same thing \nthat we have been doing the last 30 years with respect to our Federal \ninvolvement in education, without any particular or notable success, \nwhile we on our side were proposing not only that we focus more of our \nattention in dollars on education but that we begin to trust the \nparents and professional educators and principals and superintendents \nand elected school board members across the United States of America to \nmake the decisions about the education of their children, which they \nhave devoted their lives to doing, rather than making all of these \ndecisions and saying that the same rules should apply to a rural \ndistrict in North Carolina as apply to an urban district in \nMassachusetts.\n  That is a real debate. It is a debate which I suspect we will be \nengaged in tomorrow when we take up the appropriations bill for Labor-\nHealth and Human Services, and it is a debate in which we will be \nengaged in, in an even more spirited fashion, when we come up to the \nrenewal of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  But in the course of the last hour, it seems to me, we have been \nengaged in another fantasy debate. The minority leader, and several of \nhis members, have been on the floor making a number of statements that \nhave very little relationship to the reality that is before us at the \npresent time. They said, among other things, that they were cut out of \nthe debate on a budget resolution. They were not. They voted against a \nbudget resolution, not on the grounds of its spending policies but \nbecause they were vehemently opposed to any tax relief for the American \npeople, tax relief which we desired to give to the American people.\n  At one level, we won that debate. We passed significant tax relief \nfor a wide section of the tax-paying people. It has been vetoed by the \nPresident. So at that level, at least, they ultimately won. That money \nwill come to the Treasury of the United States and will stay in the \nTreasury of the United States.\n  But they also said, now that they got their way, now that there was \nno 17-percent reduction in spending on education--always a fantasy--now \nthat we are spending so much, we are raiding the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  I am here to say these appropriations bills do not eat into the \nSocial Security surplus. They do, in fact, eat into some of the non-\nSocial Security surplus, not only for the year 2000 but probably for \nthe year 2001 as well. But they are within the estimates of those non-\nSocial Security surpluses in the years in which all of the moneys in \nthese appropriations bills will, in fact, be spent.\n\n  That criticism, that we are raiding the Social Security trust fund, \nwhile it has no statistical validity, would at least have a certain \ndegree of moral caution attached to it had we, during the course of the \nlast several weeks, in debating appropriations bills, heard from a \nsingle Member of the other side that we were spending too much. But we \ndid not hear that at all.\n  In fact, an hour or so ago, when the Appropriations Committee was \napproving this large bill for Labor and Education and Health, the only \nsignificant Democratic amendments were to spend more money, without any \noffsets whatsoever. So the cries that somehow or another we are \nbreaking caps that that side did not want to break or that we are \nraiding the Social Security trust fund by spending too much money are \nin direct contradiction--as rhetoric--to the actions that, in fact, \nhave taken place by the minority party, which consistently has said, if \nanything, not that we are spending too much money this year but that we \nare spending too little.\n  I have no doubt that within a few days the President of the United \nStates, backed by many Members on that side, will say; yes, we need to \nspend even more money. If the President vetoes some of these bills, his \nveto will likely be based on the fact that we are not spending enough. \nAnd, in fact, he will ask us to increase taxes, having vetoed the \nopportunity to provide some tax relief for the American people.\n  Finally, we have heard complaints about the fact that we have not yet \ncompleted all of our work on appropriations bills. That is true; we \nhave not. In fact, in the last 20 or 25 years, we have only done that \non one occasion. If, however, within 2 days, we complete action on the \n13th and last of these appropriations bills, at least the Senate will \nhave passed its versions of all of these bills before the end of the \nfiscal year.\n  I had to manage one of those bills, one of the smaller of the bills, \nthe one dealing with the Department of the Interior and other similar \nagencies. While it was spasmodic and interrupted by debate on other \nmatters, we began the debate on that bill in the first week of August \nand ended it last week. Why did it take so long? Because one single \namendment literally was filibustered by a Member on the other side of \nthe aisle--unsuccessfully, as it turned out--delaying the passage of \nthat bill by a good 2 weeks, and making it certain that--just \nphysically--we cannot settle our differences with the House, modest \nthough they are, in time to send such bill to the President of the \nUnited States by the day after tomorrow.\n  Nor has this Senator noticed that Members of the other party were not \nconsulted or did not participate in the drafting of all of these \nappropriations bills. The overwhelming bulk of them in this body--\nperhaps not in the House of Representatives--were drafted in a \ncollegial and bipartisan fashion by the Appropriations Committee and \nwere supported by most of the members of both parties in almost every \nsingle instance.\n  Three or 4 hours ago, we passed a final conference report on the \nenergy and water appropriations bill by a vote of 96 to 3.\n  Mr. President, does that sound like a partisan exercise in the \ndeliberations in which one of the parties was excluded?\n  The Senate version of the Interior bill passed last week, if memory \nserves me correctly, by a vote of something like 87 to 10. I pride \nmyself, as the chairman of that appropriations subcommittee, in \nconsulting with members of both parties, listening to their\n\n[[Page S11552]]\n\npriorities, and meeting their priorities to the maximum possible \nextent. It was in no way a partisan exercise. Last Friday, a much \nlarger and more controversial bill on the Veterans' Administration and \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development was passed by a voice \nvote. No one even bothered to ask for a rollcall because agreement on \nthat bill was so widespread.\n  Yes, it is too bad we have to pass a 3-week continuing resolution at \nthe present time. It is too bad there are differences between the House \nand the Senate. It is too bad there are such disagreements between the \nPresident and the Congress. That is the way we arrive, in a society \nsuch as this, at appropriate answers to all of these questions. It is a \nlong way from being unprecedented. With any luck, this year, we won't \nhave one agglomeration, one huge bill that no Member understands at the \nend of this process, but we will deal with 13 individual appropriations \nbills for determining the priorities of the United States.\n  Tomorrow, we will once again be engaged in a debate on education, \namong other subjects. I hope that debate will be more realistic than \nthe debate that took place yesterday, that had no relationship to \nreality whatsoever, in connection with the basis for the Democratic \nresolution on the subject.\n  I hope it will be on a serious subject matter, not just of the amount \nof money we in the United States are going to devote to education--\nthough that is vitally important, and this bill is quite generous in \nconnection with it--but on the way in which that money ought to be \nspent. It ought to be spent in a way that increases the student \nperformance of the children in the United States in our schools through \ngrade 12 all the way across the board.\n  We ought to have the imagination to revise a system that has not been \na notable success by any stretch of the imagination and go forward to a \nnew system that looks not at forms to be filled out by school districts \nall across the country, not at the presumed wisdom of 100 Members of \nthis body, many of whom seem to think they know more about education \nthan the professionals who deal with it every day, but one that trusts \nin the genius of the American people and the dedication of the American \neducational establishment to make their own decisions in communities \nall across the United States of America about what may very well be the \nmost important of all of our social functions--the education of the \ngeneration to come.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator, who is very \nknowledgeable and, of course, is involved. I want to talk about an \ninteresting thing that has to do with the last year Democrats were in \ncharge of the majority--fiscal year 1993. I don't think it is an \nexcuse, but I think it is interesting, given all the conversation we \nhave had.\n  These are the dates that the appropriations bills were passed in \n1993: The foreign assistance bill was passed in the Senate on September \n30 and approved on September 30; the legislative branch bill, of \ncourse, which has to do with operating the Congress, was passed early, \nAugust 6, and approved on August 11; Treasury-Postal was approved in \nthe Senate October 26 and signed on October 28--this, of course, was \nthe same fiscal year we are dealing with now--Energy and Water was \npassed on October 26, signed on October 27.\n  This was the year the Democrats were in the majority. This is the \nkind of thing they are talking about today.\n  Military construction was passed in the Senate on October 19, signed \non October 21; VA-HUD, October 28, when it was approved; District of \nColumbia, October 29; Agriculture, October 21; Labor, Health and Human \nServices, Education, October 21; Commerce, Justice, and State, October \n27; Interior, passed November 11 and signed; emergency supplementals, \nof course, were before that; Transportation, October 27; Defense, \nNovember 11; the continuing resolution, the first one, on September 30, \nand a further continuing resolution on October 29.\n  This was 1993. The Democrats were in the majority. The idea of a \ncontinuing resolution is not a brand new idea.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask that the vote occur immediately \nfollowing the comments of the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I am here to express my disappointment in this process \nand the vote we are about to cast this afternoon. I will probably vote \nfor the continuing resolution because I don't want to shut down the \nGovernment. I will also probably vote with the expectation that we will \nget our work done in the 3 following weeks. I am not happy about it, \nand I don't believe we have fulfilled our obligation and commitment to \nthe American people.\n  For over 200 years, it has been the responsibility of Congress to \npass the 13 appropriations bills that make the Federal Government tick. \nIt is our only constitutionally mandated responsibility, the only thing \nwe absolutely have to do.\n  We have had 9 months. In the same amount of time, I produced twins. \nIt wasn't easy, but we did it. My chief of staff, unfortunately, had an \naccident at Christmas, has been through two major surgeries, and has \nmade a resounding comeback, unbelievably. My legislative director has \ngotten married. She has finished law school and bought a home in those \n9 months. Amazing things can be done if one actually works at them.\n  I came to Washington, sat through an impeachment trial, bought a \nhouse, and moved two 3-year-old boys, one husband, and a dog to \nVirginia so I could work in the Senate. It is time to get down to work.\n  I fully expect us to end this monkey business. To pass fair, thought-\nout appropriations bills within the next 3 weeks is certainly not \nsomething we should take for granted.\n  I will not support an omnibus appropriations package similar to the \none passed last year. One of the most frightening stories I heard, when \nI first arrived in the Senate, was the process that happened in the \nlast few days of the session last year when only a couple people came \naround a table and decided the budget for this entire Nation without \nthe assent of all of those who should have been at that table. What an \nirresponsible way for us, as Government, to work on behalf of the \nAmerican people.\n  This way of governing is absolutely irresponsible, ineffective, and \nit is not what I came here to do. I imagine many of my colleagues did \nnot come here to act in such an irresponsible way. To do so is to sell \nthe American people down the river. I hope my colleagues will put \npolitics aside and get our business done, the only constitutional \nresponsibility that we have in this body; that is, to take care of the \nAmerican people's business.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have listened to the comments on the \nother side of the aisle about the management of things around here and \nhow we could not get this bill finished on time and what a mess \neverything is. I remind Senators, obviously, we are going to have to \nmake some major change beyond the process we have because it might \nstartle some to know that since 1950--that is almost 50 years--we have \ncompleted our appropriations bills on time twice--twice.\n  What is all the talk about? Since 1950, that side of the aisle has \ncontrolled the Senate three-quarters of the time. So three-quarters of \nthe time since 1950, all the appropriations bills--including Labor, \nHealth, and Human Services--have been completed twice on time and sent \nto the President.\n  I submit, if my colleagues want to get things done on time, let's \nchange the process and let's not do it every year; let's do it every 2 \nyears. At least if we go over, we will be all right for 2 years rather \nthan have it right back in our laps in 6 months, doing it all over \nagain.\n\n[[Page S11553]]\n\n  In addition, I heard from the other side of the aisle some comments \nabout how difficult it was to meet the caps, how difficult it was not \nto take any money from Social Security, as if it were a Republican \nproblem. One Senator--I will not use names, but the Senator who \nmentioned that was a Senator who came to the floor and asked for $8 \nbillion on an emergency basis for the farm problem in America.\n  If my colleagues are wondering how come we have a difficult time, it \nis because somebody comes down and adds $8 billion that we did not \nexpect to spend and we have to accommodate in some way so we do not use \nSocial Security money, and that does not make it any easier.\n  I am not objecting to that. It will probably come out of the Senate \nand House before long at $7 billion, $7.5 billion, and an overwhelming \nnumber of House Members and Senators will think it is right. I am \nsuggesting it is not always those who are trying to manage things on \nthe majority side who cause the problems that make it difficult to get \nthings done.\n  I do not choose to go beyond that. The President submitted a budget \nto us that was totally in error of the budget caps. It used Social \nSecurity money. And then we are criticized because we are having a \ndifficult time dealing with it. The President had new taxes he added \nand then spent them in his bill. We have chosen to have a policy of no \nnew taxes to meet our appropriations bills.\n  There are a number of things the President did that we cannot do. \nHere is one: The President is talking about Medicare, saying we ought \nto reform it before we have a tax cut for the American people. The \nPresident had $27 billion of cuts in Medicare in his budget. He did not \ntell us about that. We told you about that. It is long forgotten. In \nfact, the number may be higher. It may be 35. Anyway, it is 27 or more.\n  We had to pay for that in our budget; it was not the right thing to \ndo. The President might have thought so, but nobody in the Congress \ndid. It has not been easy.\n  Nonetheless, we are going to have a pretty good year. We are going to \nhave a pretty good year because when we are finished, we will have \ndramatically increased defense, and part of it will be an emergency \nbecause that is what it is. We will get all the appeals done and some \nof the advance funding that is legitimate and right.\n  The President had $21 billion in advance funding, and now there are \npeople on the other side wondering what that is, as if we invented it. \nIt has been around for a long time. In fact, there is $11 billion of it \nin the budget we are living with right now, which means nothing more \nthan, you account for the money in the year in which you spend it \nrather than the year in which you appropriate it. We will have some of \nthat, too--maybe as much as the President had; I don't know. But how \nare we going to meet these targets if we are not permitted to do that, \nwhen the President is challenging us that we are not doing what he \nwanted us to do--that is his big challenge. How can we do that?\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     department of interior funding\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would to address a question to my friend from New \nMexico, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. This continuing \nresolution essentially funds government programs and operations at \nfiscal year 1999 levels under the authority and conditions provided in \nthe applicable appropriations Act for fiscal year 1999. Since Congress \nhas not yet completed its work on the fiscal year 2000 Interior and \nRelated Agencies appropriations bill, I would conclude that Department \nof Interior agencies, programs and activities will be funded under this \nresolution at fiscal year 1999 levels under the policies and \nrestrictions in effect during fiscal year 1999.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his question. I \ntoo believe that this resolution will allow Interior Department funding \nto be continued at fiscal year 1999 levels in accordance with fiscal \nyear 1999 policies through October 21, 1999.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank the Chairman.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on H.J. Res. \n68.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution is before the Senate and \nopen to amendment. If there be no amendment to be proposed, the \nquestion is on the third reading of the joint resolution.\n  The joint resolution was ordered to a third reading and was read the \nthird time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution having been read the \nthird time, the question is, shall it pass? The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the majority \nleader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, may proceed to \nthe consideration of Calendar No. 243, S. 761, under the following \nlimitations: There be 1 hour for debate equally divided in the usual \nform and the only amendment in order to the bill be a managers' \nsubstitute amendment to be offered by Senators Abraham and Leahy. I \nfurther ask consent that following the use or yielding back of time and \nthe disposition of the substitute amendment, the committee substitute \nbe agreed to, as amended, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate \nproceed to a vote on passage of S. 761, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask my \ncolleague from Michigan whether or not this unanimous consent request \ncan be modified to include other amendments; for example, some \namendments that deal with how we improve farm policy or amendments on \nminimum wage?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, at this time I cannot agree to such a \nmodification.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if that is the case, as I explained to \nthe majority leader earlier, I am determined that I am going to have an \nopportunity as a Senator from Minnesota to come out here on the floor \nof the Senate and to fight for farmers who are losing their farms in my \nState, and therefore I object.\n\n[[Page S11554]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, if I may comment, I certainly appreciate \nSenators will differ on issues, and I have talked with the Senator from \nMinnesota. I understand his feelings on the issue he would like to \ninclude, either in the context of legislation I am talking about \ntonight or in some other context. But I point out for the benefit of \nall of our colleagues that the legislation that was the subject of this \nunanimous consent proposal, S. 761, is a very important piece of \nlegislation but not one I believe should become tied up in a variety of \nnongermane amendments and debate.\n  The bill that would have been proposed, S. 761, is essentially a bill \nwhich would seek to make it feasible for us to engage in electronic \ncommercial activities and to provide validity to what we call digital \nsignatures or the authentication of digital signatures to allow for the \nexpansion and continuing development of commercial activities over the \nInternet.\n  This legislation is needed, and it is my understanding, in efforts to \nsecure unanimous consent to go to this, we have found as many as 99 \nMembers in support of this bill. That is not surprising. The States are \nin desperate hope we will pass this legislation and pass it soon.\n  It left the Senate Commerce Committee, as the Presiding Officer \nknows, being a member of the committee, with unanimous support on a \nbipartisan basis. I have been pleased to offer this legislation, along \nwith my colleague, Senator Wyden of Oregon, and a number of cosponsors.\n  It was basically to this point uncontroversial. We have worked \nclosely with Senator Leahy to come forward with a substitute which we \nare prepared ultimately to offer that I think addresses some concerns \nthat had been expressed.\n  The administration has expressed its support for the legislation as \nwell. So I hope that we can, if not in the context of today, then at a \npoint very soon, find some manner or means to pass the legislation and \nmove it forward.\n  Every day, the expansion of those who have access to the Internet is \nincreasing. Every day, the activities of a commercial sort that go on \nthrough the Internet are increasing. What the people who are engaging \nin those commercial activities need is a certainty that their contracts \nover the Internet will be, in fact, authenticated and given full faith \nand credit. The absence of this legislation makes that issue somewhat \nin doubt.\n  So while 42 States, I believe, have now passed their own digital \nsignature laws, no 2 of these are alike. States are working hard at \nthis time to come up with a uniform system and, in fact, a uniform code \nfor digital signatures, and authentication has been developed but it \nhas not yet been passed.\n  In the interim, until that happens, in my judgment, we need to have a \nsystem in place. This legislation would provide it. It is strongly \nbacked by the high-tech industries of our country. I know they will be \ncontacting Members in the hope that we can move this forward because \nthere are so many, as I have said already, increases in the use of the \nInternet for commercial activity going on every single day.\n  So I deeply regret we could not move to this legislation tonight. I \nhope that as Senators with other agenda items consider ways to bring \ntheir items to the floor, they will find germane, as opposed to \nnongermane, vehicles to which to offer their amendments, or at least, \nat a minimum, they will not seek to stall this legislation any further.\n  I think it is an important bill. I do not think it is controversial. \nBut I think every day we go without its passage, we will create the \npotential for greater problems in regard to the expansion of commercial \nactivity that takes place in this country through the Internet and \nthrough electronic means.\n  So, Mr. President, I yield the floor. Hopefully, at a date very soon, \nI will be back so we can successfully move forward on this legislation.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized to speak \nfor up to 30 minutes regarding the agricultural embargo issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/28/senate-section/article/S11554-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11554-S11560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE UNILATERAL EMBARGO ON AGRICULTURAL AND MEDICINAL PRODUCTS\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, as I think everyone in this Chamber \nunderstands, I am advocating that there be sanctions reform with regard \nto the unilateral embargo imposed by this country on agricultural and \nmedicinal products as it relates to sales in other settings.\n  I say ``unilateral embargo.'' This means that the United States alone \ndecides to deprive people in the United States of the right to sell to \nsome other country. So it is not when we are involved in multilateral \nembargoes but unilateral embargoes.\n  Secondly, the kind of embargo we are talking about is an embargo of \nmedicine or agriculture. We are talking about the kind of thing that \nwill keep people from starving or keep people who are in need of \nmedicine from dying.\n  Senators Hagel, Baucus, Dodd, Kerrey, Brownback, and a host of others \nhave joined with me in working on a bill that would lift embargoes of \nthis kind against U.S. farm products.\n  In a sense, the bottom line is this: We offered our embargo proposal \nas an amendment to the agricultural appropriations bill. That is a bill \nthat is supposed to serve the interests of farmers. The result? I have \nto say that the result in the Senate was a heartwarming and commendable \nresult.\n  Senators, understanding that we ought to improve the capacity of our \nfarmers to market their products around the world, and to keep farmers \nfrom being used as pawns in diplomatic disputes through the imposition \nof unilateral agricultural and medicinal embargoes, considered the \nproposal, debated the proposal, and overwhelmingly concluded, in a vote \nof 70-28, that we should stop using our farmers as pawns in the world \nof international diplomacy. Also, the Senate conferees agreed, with a \nvote of 8-3. Furthermore, we had the agreement of House conferees.\n  So what went wrong in the conference committee, after the Senate made \na part of its agricultural appropriations bill a reform in this way, \nwhere farmers have been deprived of their right to market food and \nmedicine--and pharmaceuticals are also marketed--what happened? What \nhappened to us?\n  The reason I am down here today is to talk about that. If there is \nsuch overwhelming support in the Congress for such reform, what \nhappened to the Democratic process here?\n  A few Members of the House and Senate leadership decided that they \ndid not agree, and they basically vetoed something that was passed by \nthe Senate--expressed by those who represent the people as the will of \nthe people.\n  Most of the time, in order to veto the Senate, you have to be elected \nPresident. But apparently sometimes you are going to be able to \noverrule a 70-28 vote in the Senate by just saying that your own \nposition is more noteworthy than that of a virtually overwhelming \nmajority of the Senate. They vetoed the Senate-passed provision and \ninserted their own policy into the agricultural appropriations bill.\n  I am on the floor now to let farmers and ranchers across America know \nexactly what happened.\n\n  First of all, I would like to explain to America's farmers--and \nparticularly to those in Missouri and the Midwest--how I fought for \ntheir interests but was prevented from doing what they wanted because \nof a small minority--from the leadership--who worked against sanctions \nreform.\n  Second, I would like to explain what my colleagues were proposing in \nthe amendment with me, what was the nature of this reform.\n  And then third, I would like to show how it is good public policy to \nhave a reform in sanctions not only to help farmers and ranchers but \nalso how it is good foreign policy.\n  Here are the events of the House-Senate conference committee.\n  Let me be perfectly clear. The Senate voted on agricultural \nembargoes. This was not something that was interjected in the \ncommittee. We agreed, with a 70-28 vote, to end the embargo on farmers. \nAfter I and the other sponsors of the amendment made additional \nconcessions to those opposing sanctions reform, the amendment was \npassed by\n\n[[Page S11555]]\n\nunanimous consent in the Senate. So not only do you have a unanimous \nconsent in the Senate, but it was after a serious negotiation, a good-\nfaith negotiation, that followed a 70-28 vote. So we moved to elevate \nthis from something that was just overwhelmingly supported to something \nthat was passed with unanimous consent.\n  Then the House-Senate conferees began consideration of the \nagricultural appropriations bill. Did they first consider what was \npassed by the Senate? Not really. A select few in the leadership \nunilaterally changed the Senate-passed amendment and imposed their \npersonal agenda into the conference committee.\n  The House leadership offered some sanctions reform but carved out \nCuba. At this point, the Senator from North Dakota stood up for our \nfarmers and for the will of the Senate and asked that the Senate \namendment, as passed, be considered.\n  Very frankly, I would not think it would be necessary to take a \nunanimous consent passage, that had followed a 70-28 vote prior to the \nfinal details being worked out to harmonize things--that it would be \nnecessary to have an extraordinary event in the conference committee to \nask that that just be considered in the committee. But, as I indicated, \nthe Senator from North Dakota stood up for the farmers in my State and \nacross the Midwest and America and stood up for the will of the Senate, \nas expressed in the unanimous consent and the 70-28 vote.\n  So, again, the Senate conferees overwhelmingly voted to reinstate the \namendment we had passed on the floor. The Senate conferees said: Wait a \nsecond. This is an effort by some leaders to substitute their own \njudgment for the expressed will of the Senate that was overwhelmingly \npassed by a vote of 70-28, and then negotiated further to gain \nunanimous consent, and it at least ought to be in the bill.\n  I am grateful to the Senator from North Dakota, and I appreciate his \neffort. At this point, the House conferees were to vote. It was at this \npoint that the democratic process broke down. The conference was shut \ndown for a week because the Senate and the House conferees decided they \nwould stand strong. They made a decision to vote the will of their \nconstituents instead of the dictates of a few leaders in the Congress.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Missouri yield for a \nbrief question?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was in the Chamber and I heard the presentation by the \nSenator from Missouri and wanted to make a brief comment and end with a \nquestion.\n  The proposal that was offered in the Senate by Senator Ashcroft and \nSenator Dodd said it is inappropriate to continue to use food as a \nweapon and that food and medicine ought not be part of embargoes that \nwe apply against other countries for bad behavior. That proposal was \npassed by the Senate overwhelmingly, as the Senator from Missouri just \ndescribed. The Ashcroft-Dodd provision once and for all would break the \nback of those who continue to want to use food and medicine as a \nweapon. What a wonderful thing it would be to have that happen. I was \nso delighted when it passed the Senate. Unfortunately, the Senator from \nMissouri correctly describes what happened in conference.\n  We, in the conference on the Senate side, insisted on the Senate \nprovisions--that is, the Ashcroft-Dodd provision that says no more food \nand medicine being used as a weapon or used as part of embargoes or \nsanctions. We said we insist on that position.\n  It was clear that had there been a vote of the House conferees, they \nwould have voted in favor of the Senate position. That was clear. So \nwhat happened? They decided to adjourn rather than allow the House \nconferees to vote. That was a week ago. A week later, the conference \nhas not met. I have received an e-mail, I say to my colleague from \nMissouri. I will read a sentence or so from it.\n  This is e-mail is from a staff person dealing with the appropriations \nconference. It was sent to me as a conferee: As of this morning, the \nSenate Majority Leader signed off on a plan which was offered by the \nSpeaker of the House to resolve the stalled agriculture appropriations \nconference.\n  It describes what was resolved, one of which was to drop the \nAshcroft-Dodd provision which, in effect, says, let's discontinue these \nsanctions on food and medicine.\n  Then it says: The conference will not reconvene and all items are now \nclosed.\n  My point is, this is not a way to run this place. We didn't have \ninput. We didn't have opportunities, after the first vote in which the \nSenate insisted on the provision by the Senator from Missouri, the \nAshcroft-Dodd provision. After we insisted on that provision, which \npassed overwhelmingly here, the conference adjourned. And then some \nother people who are unnamed and who are unknown to me met someplace--I \nknow not where--and made a decision that we have a different approach. \nThey essentially said here is what you are going to have, and all items \nare closed, and you have no opportunity to debate it.\n  That way of doing things is not good for family farmers, not good for \nthis country. It is not a good way to make public policy.\n  I ask the Senator from Missouri, as I close--and I thank him very \nmuch for allowing me to interrupt his statement--is it not the case \nthat when the Senate passed this with 70 votes and then by unanimous \nvote following that, that we felt in the Senate we had finally broken \nthe back of this effort to always use food and medicine as weapons? We \nfinally said to the country, it is inappropriate; we are going to stop \nit once and for all. Isn't it the case that if we had had a vote in the \nconference, from all that he knows, that that vote would have \noverwhelmingly said we support this position to stop using food and \nmedicine as a weapon, and we can make this public law, but, in fact, it \nwas short-circuited somewhere, and that short circuit really \nshortchanges our country? That it shortchanges the public policy the \nSenator from Missouri was proposing?\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am very pleased to respond to those questions. There \nis a very strange anomaly here. What appears to be fundamentally and \nunmistakably clear is that the conference committee was not shut down \nbecause it couldn't work. The conference committee was shut down \nbecause it was about to work. The conference committee was discontinued \nand suspended in its operation, not because they couldn't come to an \nagreement but because it was on the verge of an agreement. They were on \nthe verge of agreeing how, House and Senate conferees together, this \nimportant kind of reform related to the embargoes of food and medicine, \nthat important kind of reform should be included in what we are doing.\n  It was not the breakdown of the democratic process. It was the \nsuspension of the democratic process. The real threat was not that \ndemocracy doesn't work. The threat was that democracy would work. It \nwas going to work against the interests of a very few people.\n  After all, the vote in the Senate was 70 to 28, before we made the \nharmonizing concessions that brought us to a place of unanimous \nconsent. So there were very few people here who sought to displace the \nwill of what had appeared to be the conference committee and which was \nclearly the expressed overwhelming will of the Senate. This veto power \nis strange indeed, especially when the democratic process was in the \nprocess of working itself.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, is it the case, I inquire of the Senator \nfrom Missouri, that perhaps some were worried the conference was about \nto do the right thing?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. No question in my mind. It was not the threat that the \nconference committee could not function. It was the threat that the \nconference committee was functioning. It was functioning toward an end \nwith which some people were unhappy.\n  That brings us to today's events. A few in the House and Senate among \nthose who oppose this legislation, in the leadership of both the House \nand Senate, got together and made a unilateral decision, as has already \nbeen described by the Senator from North Dakota, to strip out \nprovisions in the bill that had the broad support of Congress and broad \nsupport among the conferees and in the farm community.\n  These were the kinds of things that they wouldn't allow to be voted \non, at which point I began to wonder, with\n\n[[Page S11556]]\n\ngreat seriousness, is this a bill that is right for the agriculture \ncommunity, or is this a bill for special interests, is this a bill for \nsome individuals who want to determine things on their own rather than \nto have the expressed will of the American people, as reflected in the \nSenate and House, become a policy of America, good farm policy, good \nforeign policy.\n  As we all know, the House and Senate leadership are proposing a new \nconference report, a report that hasn't been voted on by any of the \nconferees and a report that is opposed by the farm community. Farmers \nhave repeatedly asked simply that the democratic process be allowed to \nwork. If we vote and lose, then that is what is fair. The American Farm \nBureau has already said it will oppose a conference report that was \nforced on the American farmers without their short- and/or long-term \ninterests in mind and that it did not address the issue of sanctions \nreform.\n  I have a letter signed by Dean Kleckner, President of the American \nFarm Bureau Federation, urging conferees not to sign the proposed \nagricultural appropriations conference report unless, and then listing \nconditions that aren't in the sort of fabricated conference report to \nbe imposed by leadership.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter from the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation be printed in the Record at this point \nin my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              American Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                               Park Ridge, IL, September 28, 1999.\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Conferee: The American Farm Bureau Federation urges \n     you not to sign the proposed FY 00 agriculture appropriations \n     conference report unless:\n       --the amount of emergency weather assistance is increased \n     above $1.2 billion;\n       --it contains language that eliminates agricultural \n     sanctions that includes Cuba;\n       --the bill mandates dairy option 1A, an extension of the \n     Northeast Dairy Compact and the creation of a Southeast dairy \n     compact;\n       --it includes language providing for mandatory price \n     reporting for livestock.\n       The proposed $1.2 billion is not enough to provide the \n     amount of emergency weather assistance needed to help farmers \n     and ranchers. Even before Hurricane Floyd, estimates of crop \n     and livestock losses caused by flood and drought exceeded \n     $1.2 billion.\n       No one can effectively argue that Congress does not view \n     Option 1A as a better and more equitable dairy marketing \n     proposal. Just last week the House voted 285 to 140 in \n     support of Option 1A.\n       Export markets hold the key to future prosperity for \n     farmers and ranchers. Granting farmers and ranchers access to \n     Cuba, a potential market of 11 million people located only 90 \n     miles from our shore, is common sense. The Senate is on \n     record, 70 to 28, in support of lifting all unilateral \n     agricultural sanctions.\n       Consolidation is a serious threat to our market based \n     agricultural economy. Mandatory livestock price reporting \n     will give farmers and ranchers the information they need to \n     market their cattle at the best price.\n       Farm Bureau is convinced that a majority of Representatives \n     and Senators support additional emergency aid for weather \n     disasters, an inclusive agricultural sanctions policy, the \n     implementation of option 1A and dairy compacts, and mandatory \n     livestock price reporting.\n       We ask that you not sign the proposed conference report and \n     that you report a bill that includes these provisions so that \n     Congressional action will reflect the majority view.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Dean Kleckner,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The fact remains that leadership does not want the \ndemocratic process to work because this proposal which they are against \nhas very broad support. This isn't just good farm policy; it is good \nforeign policy as well.\n  Before I explain what the bill does, though, I simply ask that my \nfellow Republicans and Democrats in the Senate and House do what is \nright for farmers. Don't vote for a bill that farmers oppose and then \nclaim you are helping the farmers. Our farmers need money, but the only \nthing that is holding that up, and has been holding it up for a week, \nis a few in the leadership who oppose the will of the farmers and the \nCongress. Our farmers also need open markets, and that is what our \namendment would have done. That was the expressed will of the Senate, \nwhich first voted 70 to 28 and later voted unanimously, by unanimous \nconsent, to be a part of the bill. That opening of the markets would \nhave been fair. We don't just get by by having the freedom to plant. We \nneed to have the freedom to market for our farmers, if we are going to \nbe successful.\n  Let me take this opportunity to summarize briefly what the bill was \ndesigned to do. It was originally entitled ``The Food and Medicine for \nthe World Act.'' I would like, then, to show how our approach to ending \nunilateral embargoes on food and medicine is good policy, both foreign \npolicy and farm policy.\n  The general framework of the bill is what I call a handshake approach \nto sanctions. The bill would not tie the hands of the President, who \nnow has the ability just to snap embargoes into place, but it would \nrequire the President, before he said it was illegal for farmers in \nthis country to sell their goods to certain customers around the world, \nto get the consent of Congress.\n  So instead of tying the hands of the President, it would really \nrequire that the President sort of shake hands with the Congress, make \nsure this is a very serious thing, and if there is a need to embargo, \nin that case an embargo could be achieved. But it could not be achieved \njust on the whim of the executive. It would require the President to \ncooperate with Congress.\n  This bill would not restrict or alter the President's current ability \nto impose broad sanctions in conjunction with others; nor would it \npreclude sanctions on food and medicines. Rather, it says that the \nPresident may include food and medicines in a sanctions regime, but he \nmust first obtain congressional consent.\n  So we really just ask that the President of the United States, before \nshutting off the markets of our farmers, consult with the Congress and \nthat he obtain the consent of Congress. Under the bill, Congress would \nreview the President's request to sanction agriculture and medicine \nthrough an expedited procedure--no stalls in the Congress.\n  Mr. President, the Senate of the United States, offered with the \nopportunity to stop a program of curtailing markets for our farmers--\nthat program called sanctions and embargo--voted 70-28 to change the \nrules about that so our farmers have the right to sell food and \nmedicine--not things generally but food and medicine--around the world.\n  If the President wants to stop the sale of food or medicine, these \nthings that are essential to the existence of people, the things that \nmake America a friend to other people, the things that bind people \naround the world to America, knowing that we have the right motives in \nour mind--if we are going to stop the sale of those things, the \nPresident has to confer with the Congress rather than to do it \nunilaterally. In other words, don't let the farmers of America just be \nused as political pawns in diplomatic disputes, having markets shut \ndown arbitrarily or unilaterally, markets for medicine.\n  The Senate came to the conclusion, by a vote of 70-28, on what was \ncalled the Food and Medicine for the World Act. It was an amendment \nthat I offered to the Agriculture appropriations bill. And then, \nbecause some people in the 28 were not happy about all details, we \nnegotiated with those individuals, so that the next day the Food and \nMedicine for the World Act became a part of the Agriculture \nappropriations bill by unanimous consent in the Senate, and it went to \nconference.\n  Little did we know that some of the leaders would decide to displace \nthis overwhelmingly endorsed item by members of both parties--a \nmajority of Republicans and Democrats, voted with a 70-majority vote, \nand of course everybody agreed to the unanimous consent order. But \ncertain leaders decided they would displace that. So when the bill got \nto conference, this wasn't in the bill. And the Senator from North \nDakota decided to stand up for the farmers of America and stand up for \nthe Senate and what it had decided and say, ``I want that in the \nbill.'' He said, let's vote on whether we would put in the bill what \nthe Senate voted on.\n  You really wonder about things when the conference committee has to \nask permission and vote to have the content of what the Senate enacted \nappear in the conference bill. But it was voted on and put in the bill, \nand properly done so.\n  The House was ready to do the same thing when it became apparent to\n\n[[Page S11557]]\n\nthose who wanted to stop this, curtail it, didn't want this reform to \ntake place, didn't want to offer to American farmers this set of \nmarkets, didn't want to say to them you are free to farm and now you \nare free to market, that they wanted to have these strings still \nattached. So just when the conference committee was about to operate to \nexpress its will, when it was clear how that will would be expressed, \nthe conference committee was shut down for a week and has not been \nreassembled.\n  Today, we learned that the leadership has said to the conference \ncommittee: You are not going to reassemble. All the issues are closed, \nand we have decided this is the way the report will be written. You are \nbeing asked to sign the report.\n  So we find ourselves where the will of the Senate is stripped \narbitrarily from the bill before it goes to conference. It is added \nback in conference, and it is again stripped arbitrarily. The \nconference committee is shut down when the House conferees express a \nsignal of their intent to include that in what they had to say. We \ncollapsed the democratic process and started the autocratic process, \nand we put a conference report before people, asking them to sign it in \nspite of the fact that it wasn't something that had been voted on or \ndiscussed; it was something to be imposed by leadership.\n  That kind of suspension of the democratic process has been injurious. \nIt loses the confidence of very important groups.\n  I have submitted for the Record the letter of the American Farm \nBureau saying that is not the way to run a conference. It is not the \nway to run polic\n  There are some very strong policy considerations that recommend a \nmodification in our approach. Having the President use farmers as a \npawn in diplomatic disputes to open and close markets at will \nundermines the reliability of the American farmer as the supplier of \nfood and fiber. It is very difficult for people to expect to buy things \nfrom you if they never know whether you are going to have them \navailable for sale. Customers like a constant supply.\n  We tried to solve this. We tried to say there wouldn't be this kind \nof arbitrary use of American farmers as pawns. We tried to say that in \norder for the sanctions to be effective and an embargo to be imposed it \nwould have to have the consent of Congress.\n  We have the special provision in legislation with regard to countries \nalready sanctioned so that if there is any need to continue those \nsanctions in effect, the President could come and get those instated \nand up to speed and qualified so we would not have any interruption.\n  The bill wasn't to take effect for 180 days after it was passed. So \nif the President wanted to make sure there were sanctions in place and \nimposed, there wouldn't be any exposure to gaps. Both branches of \ngovernment would be given enough time to review current policy and to \nact jointly.\n  Of course, there are times when the President should have the \nauthority to sanction food and medicine without congressional approval. \nA declaration of war is one of those. The legislation maintains the \nPresident's authority in wartime to cut off food and medicine sales \nwithout congressional consideration.\n  The bill has a few additional provisions that were not addressed in \nprevious agricultural sanctions reform proposals. The first \nspecifically excludes all dual-use items. That means products that \ncould be used to develop chemical or biological weapons. There are not \nvery many agricultural products or medicinal products that have \nmilitary value. But the bill provides safeguards to ensure our national \nsecurity is not harmed.\n  Let me make clear that this is genuinely a bill that supports a \npolicy of putting products which will eliminate suffering and hunger \ninto the hands of those who need these products most. It is not about \nproviding dual-use items for tyrants to use for military or acts of \nterrorism.\n  Second, we make sure that no taxpayer money would be used to go to \nthe wrong people. We specifically exclude any kind of agricultural \ncredits or guarantees to governments that have sponsored terrorism. \nHowever, we allow present guarantees to be extended to people all over \nthe world--to private sector institutions, groups, and nongovernmental \norganizations. This is targeted to show support for the very people who \nneed to be strengthened in these countries--the people, rather than the \ndictators. And by specifically excluding terrorist governments, we send \na message that the United States in no way will assist or endorse the \nactivities of nations that threaten our interests.\n  Now that Senators Hagel, Dodd, and I have explained what we have done \nin this bill, let me explain why it is good foreign policy and why it \nis both good foreign and farm policy.\n  First of all, ending unilateral embargoes against sales of U.S. food \nand medicine is a good foreign policy. As the leader of the free world, \nAmerica must maintain adequate tools to advance security and promote \ncivil liberty abroad. The last thing I want to do is send a message to \nstate sponsors of terrorism that the United States is legitimizing its \nregime. As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, sanctions are \nnecessary foreign policy tools against governments which threaten our \ninterests.\n  Richard Holbrooke, who not long ago was before the Committee on \nForeign Relations seeking confirmation as the U.S. Representative to \nthe United Nations--and we have since confirmed him--explained in his \nbook ``To End a War'' how sanctions on Yugoslavia were essential to \npush Slobodan Milosevic toward peace negotiations in Bosnia.\n  Regardless of whether we agree with U.S. deployment in the Balkans, \neffective sanctions saved American lives. They helped advance American \npolicy without resorting only to the use of military force. So we have \nto have sanctions. But these sanctions must be deployed, very frankly, \nin a realistic and appropriate way.\n  This measure is good policy because we don't want to say to \nterrorists: You can blame starving your own people on the United States \nby saying they won't sell us food and medicine. So we will starve you \nand we will not provide you with food and medicine. We will take the \nmoney we have in our country and buy arms, or explosives, or we will \ndestabilize communities in which we live--world communities in one part \nof the world or another.\n  I think we should deprive the dictator of the right to say, ``You are \nstarving because America won't sell us food,'' because if we ask that \ndictator to spend his hard currency buying food, and we make it \npossible for him to do so, he absolutely cannot spend the same currency \nagain buying weapons.\n  Frankly, our farmers ought to be able to sell their food so that the \npeople in those countries all around the world know that America is not \nin the business of starving people around the world. We are in the \nbusiness of feeding people around the world. That is good foreign \npolicy. If we can encourage people to invest their money in food rather \nthan in armaments, if they will buy medicinal supplies rather than \ndestabilizing various regions of the world, that is good foreign \npolicy. But it is also good farm policy.\n  The sanctions that have been imposed haven't been effective to hurt \nour enemies. They have been very injurious to farmers. I would simply \nrefer you to the so-called Soviet grain embargo of the late 1970s. That \nis perhaps the classic, the biggest, of them all, where the United \nStates of America canceled 17 million tons of contracts that the \nSoviets had to buy from American farmers. It hurt American farmers \nimmensely by not getting the payments for those farm products. We \nthought we were punishing the Soviet Union. They went into the world \nmarketplace and they replaced those purchases and saved $250 million \nfor our adversary at a time when we inflicted the loss of markets on \nour own farmers. It didn't make much sense then, and it doesn't make \nmuch sense now.\n  Policy reform in sanctions protocol would make our efforts in this \nrespect far more reasonable, and it would require the President to get \nan agreement from Congress. It would not put us in the position where \nwe embargo the sale of goods and where our customers start to look \nelsewhere to get their goods supplied. When we stopped the sale of 17 \nmillion tons of grain to the Soviet Union in the 1970s, it\n\n[[Page S11558]]\n\nbrought on new suppliers. Rain forests could then be plowed and \nplanted. Other countries seeing that the United States was retreating \nfrom the major segment of the world markets could say: We can supply \nthat. Those who were in the world marketplace said: We will start \nlooking to reliable suppliers that won't be turning over the supply \ndepending on diplomatic considerations that would, as a result, \ninterrupt our supply.\n  So it is both good farm policy to give our farmers the right to \nmarket, and it is good foreign policy to give our country the right and \nthe opportunity to provide people with food and medicine to signal that \nthe United States of America wants their government to spend money for \nfood and medicine and not for military hardware.\n  So it is in the context of this very substantial reform that would \nhelp the U.S. farmers. It would also help our foreign policy.\n\n  It is in that context that I express my real disappointment in terms \nof what has happened. The conference committee was shut down, the \ndemocratic process suspended, and an autocratic process imposed. As a \nresult, we are unlikely to have in the agricultural appropriations \nconference report on which we will be asked to vote--the kind of thing \nupon which there was so much agreement--a reform in the sanctions \npolicy. The American Farm Bureau is opposed to this agricultural \nappropriations bill conference report unless sanctions reform is \nincluded.\n  I think Members of this body ought to be aware of the fact we need \nsanctions reform. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated there \nhas been a $1.2 billion annual decline in the U.S. economy during the \nmidnineties as a result of these kinds of sanctions. This is a serious \nloss in jobs as well.\n  The Wheat Commission projects if sanctions were lifted this year, our \nwheat farmers could export an additional 4.1 million metric tons of \nwheat, a value of almost half a billion to America's farmers.\n  I want to emphasize, we have missed for the time being a great \nopportunity to reform sanctions protocols regarding our farm products. \nWe have also interrupted what is a beneficial and therapeutic \ndemocratic process in the conference committee. I think Members of this \nbody should seriously consider whether they want to vote for the \nconference committee report when it is the product not of the kind of \ncollaboration that is to be expected in the development of consensus in \nour policy but it is as a result of an effort to impose the will of a \nfew instead of to respect the will of the majority.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I was able to listen to the comments \nthat the Senator from Missouri made regarding the efforts, that have \nbeen now stalled, to lift sanctions against agricultural producers and \nagricultural exports from America. It is very disconcerting that this \nis happening at this point in time in our Nation's history.\n  My family farms. My dad is a full-time farmer, my brother is a full-\ntime farmer, and prices for agricultural products are at rock bottom \nlevels. Compound that with bad weather conditions for some places in \nAmerica, and farmers believe they are getting a one-two punch. To stack \non top of the two punches they are already taking an outdated sanctions \npolicy, which was voted down in the Senate, is beyond unfair. We should \nnot use food and medicine as a political weapon--now we find that these \nsanctions are not going to be lifted. On top of low prices, on top of \nbad weather, a farmer is going to say: Is everybody against me? Isn't \nmy own Government going to help me out?\n  We have been telling people for a long period of time, that for \nFreedom to Farm to work, you have to have freedom to market. We were \nmoving in that direction. It was aggressively going forward in that \ndirection, and all of a sudden out comes a conference report that pulls \nsomething that was passed, as the Senator from Missouri noted, by a \nlarge percentage of people in this body. A farmer has to wonder what is \ngoing on here.\n  I ask people who are part of this process, what is going on? Let's \nlook at getting this back in. It passed with large and overwhelming \nsupport in this body. It is clearly something that the people across \nthe country want. It is clearly something that the agricultural \ncommunity needs. It is the right thing to do. Let's do it. Let's not \nlet it be taken out in some deal that involves a handful of Members.\n  Plus, as people have previously noted for some period of time, \nunilateral agricultural trade sanctions are generally ineffective. They \nare effective in punishing our farmers, but they are not effective in \naccomplishing sound foreign policy.\n  At a time when we are already suffering low agricultural prices, \nsanctions add to this burden. This is truly adding insult to injury.\n  Unilateral sanctions by major agricultural producing countries such \nas the U.S. tend to encourage production in other competitor countries. \nSo, on top of hurting our prices here, hurting our markets here, it \nprobably, and usually does, have the effect of stimulating production \nin other countries. Often the tyrants, which the U.S. intends to punish \nactually benefit financially from these sorts of embargoes.\n  My only point in making these comments in addition to those of my \ncolleague from Missouri is simply to say there is ample ground and \nreason for us to lift these agricultural sanctions. There is not a \nmoral foundation or basis for us to use food and medicine as a \npolitical weapon. It is wrong for our farmers. It is wrong, period, to \ndo that. Yet we are seeing that continuing to take place. Now, after we \npassed something out of this body, with overwhelming support, we find \nit pulled out. That is very disconcerting to this Member, and it should \nbe and is, I am sure, very disconcerting to the agricultural community \nacross this Nation.\n  Please, please, let's reopen this issue and get that agenda item back \nin so we can offer hope and fulfill our promise to farmers. I am not \nstanding here saying it is going to solve our farm crisis or going to \nsolve the problems we have marketing all our products around the world, \nbut clearly here is a positive step we can take and should take. It is \na big agenda item in rural America. People in rural America know these \nsanctions exist, they know they are harmful, and they want them lifted. \nNow is the time to do this. I am very disappointed this provision, \naccording to my colleague from Missouri, has been taken out. I call on \nall Members of this body, let's look at this and let's get this issue \nback in so we can lift these sanctions from the backs of our farmers.\n  I hope a number of my colleagues will become aware of what is taking \nplace here. This is a very important issue to many of our States. It is \ncertainly an important issue to Kansas. I think we need to revisit \nthis, if it has been taken out, so we can get it back in. We must lift \nthese agricultural sanctions and we must do it now.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I take the floor of the Senate tonight to \naddress the same issue that my colleague from Missouri, Senator \nAshcroft, has talked about for the last 30 minutes, and the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Kansas has addressed; that is, the \nAgriculture appropriations bill. It seems to be rather conflicted. I \nsuspect most people in this country believe in the democratic process. \nI suspect most people in this country believe the will of the majority \nand the protection of the minority is rather relevant to our democracy. \nBut we have come upon a fascinating example of that not being the case \nin this Agriculture appropriations bill.\n  Senator Ashcroft laid it out rather clearly, as did Senator \nBrownback. This is not a particularly complicated situation. What we \nhave is the will of\n\n[[Page S11559]]\n\nthe majority in the Senate, expressed by a vote of 70 to 28. That is a \nrather significant majority. As a matter of fact, that is a majority \nlarge enough to override a Presidential veto. The will of 70 Senators \nto support an amendment that obviously 70 Senators thought was \nimportant enough to come out and debate and register their vote and \ntheir will on, representing the constituencies of 70 Senators, said it \nrather plainly: We want the Ashcroft-Hagel-Dodd amendment in the \nAgriculture appropriations bill.\n  So we went to conference with the House. Guess what. The House \nconferees not only agreed that the Ashcroft-Hagel-Dodd amendment \nlifting sanctions for medicine and food against countries where we have \nunilateral, arbitrary economic sanctions was a good idea, they actually \nstrengthened the language. The House conferees actually made the \nAshcroft-Hagel-Dodd language stronger.\n  We progress along up until the leadership enters the picture. I might \nadd so there is no mistake about this--and I will try to speak \nclearly--it was the Republican leadership in the Senate and House that \nsaid: No, a few of us do not care for that. So we are going to do \nsomething that rarely ever happens, and that is we are going to stop \nthat, you see, because technically we have a process, we are the \nleaders, and we can strip that out of the appropriations bill. No \nmatter, of course, that 70 U.S. Senators said, ``No, we want that in,'' \nand the House conferees said, ``No, we want that in; we think it is in \nthe best interests of the U.S. foreign policy and American \nagriculture.'' Disregard that. That does not count.\n  So what we have is an interesting spectacle of the leadership of \nintimidation and the intimidation of leadership--not a pretty sight, \nnot a democratic process. We occasionally question why America is \nbeyond concern with the process, with the leadership, with politics. We \nwonder why. This is a very vivid, clear example of why.\n  We are going through this little mating dance again around here on \nthe budget. I call it a charade. It is a charade. I have even called it \ndishonest. Some of my colleagues said: Senator Hagel, we do not use \nthat terminology in the Senate. I said: I am sorry, but where I am \nfrom, some of the stuff that goes on around here that we think is \npolicy, or we define or defend as a technical adjustment, it is just \nplain dishonest if you are going to live within the caps. If you are \ngoing to spend more than what the caps tell you that we agreed to do, \nthen let's be honest about it.\n  The same thing with this conference committee. There are those among \nus in the media, across this land, who say we should reform our \npolitical process, we should reform Congress. They have a point. But it \nall starts here. It all starts here. If we cannot be held accountable \nand responsible enough to work the will of the majority to do the right \nthing, to be honest, and be open, and be responsible with our \ngovernance, with our leadership, with our legislative process, then to \nwhat can the American people look? What can they trust? What confidence \ncan they have in their system?\n  This Republic is not going to crumble tomorrow, and it will not \ncrumble next year because of the shenanigans we pull around here. But \nwe will pay a high price one of these days in one of these generations \nwhen we continue to define down our expectations and our standards and \nlet a few people, a cabal of a few people take advantage of the system.\n  I am very proud. It is my understanding at this moment that there \nwere two Republican Senators who refused to sign the conference report \ntoday on the Agriculture appropriations bill. To them I say thank you. \nNot only have you done the right thing, but you have shown America and \nsome of us in this body that we, in fact, can do the right thing, and \nthat we are not going to be intimidated by the leadership, by a small \ncabal of people in charge who hold responsibility.\n  There are consequences to this. There are consequences in our foreign \npolicy and in our agricultural policy because they are all connected. \nBut the consequences will come more directly in the breakdown of \nconfidence and trust in this institution. As that erodes, as that \ncontinues to erode, and a few select people in this body play it their \nway and refuse to open the process, then there will be reform. And if \nthe American people have to keep turning over Congresses to get to \nleadership--and we all have to take responsibility in this Chamber \nbecause we elect the leadership--and if we have to continue to turn \nover leadership, we will do that to ensure, if nothing else, that we \ncan openly, honestly debate the important, relevant issues for this \ncountry that affect the world and affect everybody in this Nation.\n  When those decisions are made and when the will of 70 Senators is \nabrogated, is hijacked, it is time for some major reform in this body, \nand I will be one of the leaders to help do that.\n  In conclusion, this should serve as a very clear example of a lot of \nthe nonsense that permeates this process. This is not just about the \nAmerican farmer or the American rancher. This is far bigger than \nAmerican agricultural policy and foreign policy and national security \nand all the interconnects. This is about whether we can trust the \nprocess. More basically, why do we even have authorizing committees in \nthis body if the appropriations process is going to make policy because \nthey have the money? Then the leadership, even a smaller group, decides \nwhat they want to take out of those decisions, so they pick and choose, \nand the rest of us, essentially, are superfluous to the process. Why \ndon't we just have 10 Senators? Why not take a couple committee \nchairmen, the leadership, and the rest of us go home; they can make the \ndecisions.\n  We are walking our way through an early Halloween. We are walking our \nway through a charade, and we should call it that. And, yes, it is \ndishonest. I think there are enough of us in this body who are going to \nsay it straight and call it the way we see it.\n  I hope we will come to our senses before we cross a line from which \nwe cannot come back and allow this hijacking of democratic governance, \nthis hijacking of democratic justice to set an even lower standard than \nwhat we have been doing this year with the budgets and the constant \nback and forth of let's not do anything; let's just go home; let's just \nget out; let's just do enough to get to the next day; let's not take on \nthe real, relevant issues of America; let's not deal with health care; \nlet's not deal with a lot of things.\n  The right way to do this is to come out and debate it, whether it is \ncampaign finance reform or whatever the issue is, debate it, open it \nup. If you lose, you lose; if you win, you win. That is what America \nwants. That is what they will demand, and that is what ultimately they \nwill receive.\n  I am sorry I had to take the floor, as did my colleagues tonight, to \ntalk about this. This is not a proud moment for me. It is not a proud \nmoment for this institution. But if there is anything we have in this \nNation that must be cherished and nourished and formed and shaped and \nprotected and defended at all costs, it is the institution. It is the \nprocess and the institution that allows this self-governance and the \nfreedom to stand on the floor of the Senate, stand anywhere in this \nNation and express ourselves, the minority knowing they will be \nprotected and the majority knowing they can count on a fair shake in \nthat process.\n  That ultimately, as we define the process down, is the most important \ndynamic of who we are as a people and why this Republic has survived \nfor over 200 years. When we discount that, when we discount that \ncurrency, when we abridge that responsibility, then we turn our backs \non everyone who has sacrificed for the freedom that allows us to do \nthis. We are a better country than that. We are a better people than \nthat. We will rise to the occasion to turn this around and hold on to \nthe one currency that counts in all of our lives, and that is trust. \nWhen we debase that trust, we debase the very currency of who we are.\n  I will always throw my confidence, the completeness of who I am and \nwhat I represent, behind the good common sense of the American people, \nand the faith I have in the American people will always dictate the \noutcome of these kinds of exercises, as it was written, as it was \nstated, and as it was the vision of the great men who formed this \ncountry and wrote this Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S11560]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I rise to pay special tribute to the \npassing of a 91-year-old Mississippian whose generosity, hard work, and \ncommitment to education touched the hearts and consciences of many all \nacross this Nation. It is the story of a smalltown laundress, Osceola \nMcCarty of Hattiesburg, MS, who lived a quiet life in the Pine Belt \nregion of my State until her $150,000 donation to the University of \nSouthern Mississippi brought her national attention. McCarty's gift \nestablished a scholarship to be directed to African American students \nenrolling at the University of Southern Mississippi who clearly \ndemonstrate financial need.\n  For a woman who rarely left her home, except for trips to the local \nmarket and, of course, church, the notoriety certainly brought a change \nto the lifestyle of Ms. McCarty. She was featured on a CBS television \nshow as one of the ``10 Most Fascinating people of 1995.'' She received \na Presidential Citizens Medal, an honorary doctoral degree from Harvard \nUniversity, as well as numerous other outstanding citizen awards. She \nwas invited to cities throughout the country to share her story of \nthriftiness and generosity.\n  Ms. McCarty received a sixth grade education and worked her entire \nlife in Hattiesburg, MS, washing and ironing clothes. She has made it \npossible for others to have the education that she never had. In her \nbook, ``Simple Wisdom for Rich Living,'' McCarty reflects on long, hard \ndays of laboring over steaming kettles of clothes and standing over an \nironing board. She stated that she loved her work and she only spent \nwhat she needed to. After all the years of hard work and dedication, \nMs. McCarty managed to donate her significant gift to the University of \nSouthern Mississippi. ``A smart person plans for the future,'' is what \nshe said when she received numerous bits of recognition. Then she said, \n``You never know what kind of emergency will come up, and you can't \nrely on the government to meet all of your needs. You have to take \nresponsibility for yourself.''\n  Osceola McCarty will be deeply missed. She was a humble, modest lady. \nI had the pleasure of bringing her into the majority leader's office. \nShe never got over the fact that people were so surprised and impressed \nthat she saved $150,000 and she gave it to the University of Southern \nMississippi. She thought she was just doing the right thing. Her life \nwas an exemplary one that touched us all. We are very proud of her. God \nrest her soul.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/28/senate-section/article/S11560-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE GREATNESS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

Mr. President, today the Senate was poised to take action \non Senator Abraham's Millennium Digital Commerce Act. This important \nmeasure is aimed at promoting the growth of the ``E-conomy''. Senator \nAbraham has worked tirelessly over the last several months to get this \nbill through the Senate.\n  Unfortunately after gaining agreement to bring this bill to the floor \ntoday, our Democratic colleagues decided to muck up this legislation. \nThey insisted on attaching non-germane amendments to this crucial ``e-\ncommerce'' legislation. Measures that have absolutely nothing to do \nwith Senator Abraham's high-technology initiative. Once again, the ``do \nnothing Democrats'' are at work stopping at every point significant \nlegislative momentum.\n  The Senate could easily pass Senator Abraham's bill. It is simple and \nstraight-forward. It promotes jobs, stimulates the economy, and creates \nsavings and opportunities for America's consumers. Instead, in an \neffort to create yet another log-jam, the Minority Leader is looking \nfor a vehicle to attach every Democratic proposal under the sun.\n  The other side of the aisle, which claims to promote electronic \ncommerce, is doing everything it can to quash Senator Abraham's \nelectronic signatures bill--as well as other important legislation. It \nis a continuing pattern and practice of the Democrats to deny the \nAmerican people any legislative progress. The Democrats claim that they \nwant this bill and that they are pro-technology, yet they are doing \neverything they can to kill this bill.\n  Mr. President, S. 761 establishes the legal certainty of electronic \nsignatures for interstate commercial transactions. It is an interim \nsolution needed until states adopt the Uniform Electronic Transactions \nAct (UETA). UETA was recently adopted by the National Conference of \nCommissioners on Uniform State Laws. Over the next several years, it \nwill undergo state-by-state consideration--similar to the process \nfollowed in implementing the Uniform Commercial Code. The states, high \ntechnology and other commercial sectors support Senator Abraham's \ncommon sense legislation because it validates the use of electronic \nauthentication technology. A tool that will help the electronic \nmarketplace flourish in the 21st Century.\n  The Administration, not once but twice, formally noted its support \nfor the electronic signatures measure reported out of the Senate \nCommerce Committee. Both the Commerce Department's letter of support \nand the Executive Office of the President's Statement of Administration \nPosition were previously entered into the Record. Given the \noverwhelming support for S. 761, I am surprised and bewildered that the \nAdministration has been working behind the scenes to weaken this \nmeasure instead of pushing harder to get the Commerce Committee-\nreported bill, which the White House supported--passed.\n  Every day, more and more businesses and consumers are conducting \ntheir important commercial transactions over the Internet. The World \nWide Web, more than any other communications medium, allows users to \npromptly and efficiently locate vendors, evaluate goods and services, \ncompare pricing, and complete purchases. S. 761 is good for business, \ngood for consumers, and good for the overall economy.\n  I am dismayed and once again disappointed that our Democratic \ncolleagues have thrown yet another monkey wrench into the legislative \nprocess. Let's stop playing games and get the people's business done. \nLet's pass Senator Abraham's electronic signatures bill on its merits--\nwithout tacking on non-germane amendments that they know will kill the \nbill.\n  If my colleagues from the other side of the aisle are really for the \nNew Economy, they will stop these shenanigans and let us pass a clean \nMillennium Digital Commerce Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/28/senate-section/article/S11560-4", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11560-S11561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

The budget levels have also been revised to include \nadjustments made on May 19, 1999, to reflect the amounts provided and \ndesignated as emergency requirements. The estimates show that current \nlevel spending is above the budget resolution by $0.5 billion in budget \nauthority and above the budget resolution by $0.2 billion in outlays. \nCurrent level is $0.2 billion above the revenue floor in 1999. The \ncurrent estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the maximum \ndeficit amount is $56.0 billion, which is equal to the maximum deficit \namount for 1999 of $56.0 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated July 19, 1999, the Congress has passed \nand the President has signed the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small \nBusiness Development Act (P.L. 106-50), the Emergency Steel Loan \nGuarantee and Emergency Oil and Gas Guaranteed Loan Act (P.L. 106-51), \nthe Water Resources Development Act (P.L. 106-53), and the Global \nExploration and Development Corporation Act (P.L. 106-54).

Mr. President, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly \napproved a bipartisan bankruptcy-reform bill on May 5 by a vote of 313 \nto 108. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported a similar initiative in \nApril by a vote of 14 to 4, and my hope is that the full Senate will \nfollow suit before the year is out.\n  Mr. President, most Americans carefully manage their finances, pay \ntheir bills, and never face the prospect of bankruptcy, yet we rarely \nhear about them when bankruptcy reform is debated. These are the people \nwho ultimately bear the cost when others seek bankruptcy protection. \nThey pay in terms of higher interest rates and higher prices on goods \nand services. This bankruptcy tax costs the average household more than \n$400 a year.\n  There will always be a limited number of people who unexpectedly \nexperience some catastrophe in their lives--maybe a death or divorce, \nor a serious illness--that throws their finances into chaos. That is \nwhy we accept as a given that society will bear some of the cost of \nbankruptcy, and why we maintain access to bankruptcy relief for those \nwho truly need it. No one suggests closing off bankruptcy as an option \nfor those who are in truly dire straits.\n  A line does need to be drawn, however, when people, particularly \nthose with above-average incomes who have the means and ability to \nrepay their debts, nevertheless seek to have those debts erased in \nbankruptcy. This is happening more and more often, and unless we get \nthe problem in check, it is going to wreak havoc.\n  Mr. President, there is nothing fair about forcing a single mother, \nwho is already struggling to pay her own family's bills, to pay more \nmerely because someone who can repay his or her debts prefers to escape \nthem in bankruptcy. There is nothing fair about forcing young families \nor seniors on fixed incomes to pay more so that someone can walk away \nfrom his or her debts as a matter of convenience or financial planning.\n  Few bills so clearly protect the interests of consumers, yet the \nbankruptcy-reform bill does have its critics. Much of the criticism, I \nthink, misses the mark. Two professors of law, Todd Zywicki and James \nWhite, wrote to the Judiciary Committee recently about some of the \nclaims that have been made, and what they had to say is worthy of the \nconsideration of every member of this body.\n  I ask Senators to join me in supporting the bipartisan bankruptcy-\nreform bill, and I ask unanimous consent that the professors' letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           George Mason University\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                Arlington, VA, September 15, 1999.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC\n     Re: The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999 (S. 625)\n       Dear Senators Hatch and Leahy: We are writing to express \n     our support for the consumer bankruptcy provisions of bill S. \n     625,\n\n[[Page S11562]]\n\n     the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999 (the ``Bill''). S. 625 \n     provides for balanced bipartisan bankruptcy reform that \n     preserves the integrity of the bankruptcy system for those \n     who need it, but reduces abuse by those who do not. In \n     expressing our support for bankruptcy reform, we share the \n     view of 217 Republican Representatives and 96 Democratic \n     Representatives who passed a similar bill earlier this year \n     by an overwhelming 313-108 veto-proof majority.\n       In an era of unprecedented economic prosperity, growth, and \n     low unemployment, 1.4 million Americans filed bankruptcy last \n     year, costing creditors approximately $40 billion. Smaller \n     creditors suffer the most from a runaway bankruptcy system, \n     as they tend to have the narrowest margins and the least \n     ability to spread those losses among their customers. Support \n     for the Bill comes from creditors across the full spectrum of \n     creditors, but small creditors, such as small retailers and \n     credit unions, are among the strongest supporters of \n     bankruptcy reform.\n       Like all other business expenses, when creditors are unable \n     to collect debts because of bankruptcy, some of those losses \n     are passed on to responsible Americans who live up to their \n     financial obligations. Every phone bill, electric bill, \n     mortgage, furniture purchase, medical bill, and car loan \n     contains an implicit bankruptcy ``tax'' that the rest of us \n     pay to subsidize those who do not pay their bills. We all pay \n     for bankruptcy abuse in higher down payments, higher interest \n     rates, and higher costs for goods and services. It is \n     estimated that by making high-income debtors repay what they \n     can, the Bill will save $3 billion a year, some of which will \n     be passed on to financially-responsible Americans.\n       The Bill will also reinforce the lesson that bankruptcy is \n     a moral as well as an economic decision. Filing bankruptcy \n     reflects a decision to break a promise made to reciprocate a \n     benefit bestowed upon you. The moral element of bankruptcy is \n     reflected in the observation that the English word ``credit'' \n     comes from the Latin word for ``trust.'' Parents seek to \n     teach their children values of personal and financial \n     responsibility, and promise-keeping and reciprocity provide \n     the foundation of a free economy and healthy civil society. \n     Regrettably, the personal shame and social stigma that once \n     restrained opportunistic bankruptcy filings has declined \n     substantially in recent years. We have ``defined bankruptcy \n     deviancy downward'' such that it has become a convenient \n     financial planning tool, rather than a decision freighted \n     with moral and social significance. Requiring those who can \n     to repay some of their debts as a condition for bankruptcy \n     relief sends an important signal that bankruptcy is a serious \n     act that has moral as well as economic consequences. \n     Moreover, reducing the number of strategic bankruptcies will \n     reduce the bankruptcy tax paid by every American family on \n     goods and services, giving them more money for groceries, \n     vacations, and educational expenses.\n       It has been claimed by some that the Bill would negatively \n     impact the ability of divorced spouses to collect spousal and \n     child support. This claim is based on vague, speculative, and \n     inaccurate accusations about how the nondischargeability of \n     certain debts will impact post-petition efforts to collect \n     these obligations. In contrast to these speculative \n     accusations, the Bill offers concrete assistance to non-\n     intact families in several ways. Among its numerous \n     provisions protecting the rights of former spouses and \n     children are the following protections: (1) Extends the scope \n     of nondischargeability of spousal support obligations to make \n     nondischargeable certain property settlement, (2) excepts \n     state child support collection authorities from the reach of \n     the automatic stay, (3) elevates the priority level of child \n     support to first priority, (4) makes exempt property \n     available for the enforcement of domestic and child support \n     obligations. These speculative claims about the negative \n     effects of the bill appear to be simply a concerted effort by \n     the Bill's opponents to distract attention from the real \n     reforms and protections included in the bill.\n       Moreover, the Bill's provisions on credit card \n     nondischargeability merely rationalizes some exceptions to \n     discharge and closes loopholes in the current law relating to \n     the misuse of credit cards. Given this modest aim of simply \n     closing loopholes in the already-existing exception to \n     discharge for credit card fraud, it is difficult to see how \n     this reform could have more than a trivial effect on \n     collection of spousal support payments. Nor have the Bill's \n     opponents supplied any details about the size of this \n     purported effect. Assuming the effect is non-trivial, it is \n     also not unique to make certain debts nondischargeable on the \n     basis of public policy. Current law already makes a multiple \n     of exceptions to discharge, including such things as tax \n     obligations, fraudulently incurred debts, student loans, and \n     victims of drunk drivers. As a result, the bill would no more \n     ``pit'' postpetition child support obligations against credit \n     card issuers than current law ``pits'' child support \n     obligations against the victims of drunk drivers, the victims \n     of fraud, student loan obligations, or taxes obligations. \n     Indeed, the burden on a debtor from nondischargeable credit \n     card debts will be substantially smaller than the financial \n     burden on debtor from the inability to discharge fraud \n     liabilities, tax liabilities, student loan debts, and drunk-\n     driving judgments. That opponents of the Bill have instead \n     singled-out credit card issuers for criticism says more about \n     their desire to demonize the credit card industry and less \n     about their commitment to protecting women and children or to \n     real bankruptcy reform.\n       The Bill establishes a much-needed system of means-testing \n     to force high-income debtors who can repay a substantial \n     portion of their debts without significant hardship to do so. \n     Under current law, there are few checks on high-income \n     debtors seeking to walk away from their debts and few \n     safeguards to prevent bankruptcy fraud. Current law requires \n     a case-by-case investigation that turns on little more than \n     the personal predilections of the judge. This chaotic system \n     mocks the rule of law, and has resulted in unfairness and \n     inequality for debtors and creditors alike. The arbitrary \n     nature of the process has also undermined public confidence \n     in the fairness and efficiency of the consumer bankruptcy \n     system.\n       The Bill narrows the judge's discretion by establishing a \n     presumption of abuse where a high-income debtor has the \n     ability to repay a substantial portion of his debts, as \n     measured by an objective standard. At the same time, the \n     judge will retain discretion to override this presumption in \n     cases of hardship. Means-testing is not a panacea for all of \n     the ills of the bankruptcy system. But by focusing judicial \n     discretion on the existence of real hardship and reducing \n     procedural hurdles to challenging abuse, the Bill's reforms \n     will vindicate the rule of law and reduce abuse.\n       The Bill also targets a whole range of other abuses of the \n     bankruptcy system, including such things as the use of \n     ``fractional interests'' to prevent legitimate foreclosures \n     and abuse of the cramdown provisions of the Code by filing \n     bankruptcy simply to strip down the value of a secured \n     creditor's claim. The Bill also eliminated abuse of unlimited \n     homestead exemptions, a reform advocated by even the Bill's \n     critics. Contrary to the selective outrage of its critics, \n     however, the Bill does not limit itself to reducing abuse of \n     the homestead exemption but takes a comprehensive approach to \n     rooting out all forms of bankruptcy abuse.\n       In contrast to the broad-based support for the Bill, \n     opposition primarily has come from one isolated corner--\n     lawyers. Certainly the opposition of some lawyers is based on \n     sincere, albeit mistaken, beliefs about the content and \n     impact of the legislation. But it is ironic that bankruptcy \n     lawyers have been quick to question the motives of creditors \n     in seeking reform, while remaining slow to acknowledge their \n     own stake in opposing reform. James Shepard, a member of the \n     National Bankruptcy Review Commission, estimates that \n     bankruptcy is now a $5 billion a year industry for lawyers \n     and others. By reducing filings among high-income filers and \n     reducing the cost of bankruptcy cases by making them more \n     predictable and less expensive, means-testing will reduce \n     both the volume and expense of bankruptcy cases. The Bill \n     also will reduce bankruptcy filings by requiring bankruptcy \n     lawyers to inform their clients of availability of non-\n     bankruptcy alternatives, such as credit counseling, and by \n     cracking down on bankruptcy ``mills'' that mass-produce \n     bankruptcy petitions with little regard to the welfare of \n     their clients. Put simply, more bankruptcies means more money \n     for bankruptcy lawyers, and fewer bankruptcies means less \n     money for bankruptcy lawyers. Also to the dismay of \n     bankruptcy lawyers, the Bill elevates child support \n     obligations to the first administrative priority--a position \n     currently occupied by attorneys' fees obligations. Efforts in \n     the bankruptcy bar to downplay the importance of this \n     protection for divorced mothers appear to be little more than \n     a cynical effort to hid the self-interest of bankruptcy \n     lawyers behind the skirts of divorced mothers.\n       Balanced bankruptcy reform preserves the protection of the \n     bankruptcy system for those who need it, while limiting abuse \n     by those who are preying on that generosity simply to evade \n     their financial responsibilities. This Bill brings balance to \n     a consumer bankruptcy system that has become a tool for rich \n     and savvy debtors to evade their financial responsibilities. \n     America has one of the most charitable and forgiving \n     bankruptcy systems in the world and many of those who file \n     bankruptcy truly need it as a consequence of personal \n     trouble. But too many people today are preying on our charity \n     and using the bankruptcy system not because they need it, but \n     simply to evade their responsibilities or to maintain an \n     unrealistic and extravagant lifestyle at the expense of those \n     who live responsibly. Ignoring rampant abuse undermines \n     public support for the bankruptcy system generally, which \n     will eventually hurt those who legitimately need bankruptcy \n     relief. Now is the time to fix the bankruptcy system before \n     more drastic reforms are needed later.\n           Respectfully yours,\n     Todd J.

RES. 187\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I wish to comment on Senator Daschle's \neducation funding legislation, S. Res. 187.\n  The resolution states that the funding level for the Subcommittee on\n\n[[Page S11563]]\n\nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education has been reduced to pay \nfor other programs. I would like to set the record straight. The 302(b) \nallocation that was originally assigned to the Subcommittee was \ntemporarily reduced to permit other subcommittees to mark up their \nbills. This was done with the intention that as these other bills moved \nthrough their conferences, additional dollars would be made available \nto provide the Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee with the necessary \nresources to increase funding for education, health and labor programs.\n  As last evening's Labor-HHS-Education markup proved, there was never \nany intention to cut 17 percent from education programs. To the \ncontrary, the subcommittee actually recommended $35.2 billion for \neducation programs, an increase of $2.3 billion over the fiscal year \n1999 program level and $537.6 million over the administration's budget \nrequest.\n  Instead of reducing Head Start dollars, $5.2 billion was recommended, \nwhich increased the program $608.5 million over fiscal year 1999 level \nand matching the amount requested by the President.\n  After school programs were doubled from $200 to $400 million; aid to \ndisadvantaged children was increased by $320 million over last year \nwhich again matched the President's request.\n  Instead of decreasing technology programs, $550 million was \nrecommended to maintain last year's program level.\n  The resolution also states that a $100 million reduction would be cut \nfrom the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program. The facts are that Safe \nand Drug Free schools, as part of the youth violence initiative was \nincreased by $45 million to provide $611 million for state grants, \nschool coordinators and programs to promote safe learning environments \nfor this nation's children.\n  To provide a free, appropriate, public education to all children, \n$6.035 billion was provided to children with disabilities increasing \nthe program $911.5 million over last year's amount and $585.7 million \nover the President's recommendation.\n  And finally, the subcommittee recommended a $200 increase in the \nmaximum Pell grant to provide $3,325 to help disadvantaged children \nachieve a college education.\n  In closing, I wish to point out that these increases in education \ndollars, have been carefully balanced with savings in other areas in \nthe bill and advance funding. The Labor-HHS-Education bill is within \nthe discretionary spending caps set forth in the budget resolution. \nThis fact points out once again that the findings stated in Senate \nResolution 187 were not factual which is the reason I voted against it \nand led the effort to provide a better formula for Federal funding as \nreflected in the subcommittee bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/28/senate-section/article/S11563-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend title XIX and XXI of the Social Security Act \nto improve the coverage of needy children under the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program (SCHIP) and the Medicaid Program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n          improved maternal and children's health coverage act\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the \nImproved Maternal and Children's Health Coverage Act. I am joined by my \ncolleagues Senator Landrieu, Senator Gordon Smith, Senator Evan Bayh \nand Senator Dianne Feinstein.\n  A similar bill was introduced in the House of Representatives by \nCongresswoman DeGette and Congresswoman Morella.\n  This legislation is intended to help increase the coverage of \nuninsured children under the Children's Health Insurance Program, \nbetter known as CHIP.\n  Right now there are 10.7 million uninsured children in the United \nStates. The goal of CHIP is to insure 5 million children nationally.\n  However, we have only enrolled 1.3 million of the targeted 5 million \nchildren so far. We can do better. We must do better.\n  Let's get rid of barriers to coverage! There are several simple, \nadministrative changes that we can make in this legislation that will \nhelp break down the barriers to enrollment.\n  First, we can reduce the need for excessive documentation. States \nwould be required to develop and use a uniform, simplified application \nform to determine eligibility for both Medicaid and CHIP. This means \nfamilies only have to fill out one form.\n  Second, families would only have to deal with one state agency to \nestablish eligibility for either program. It is unfair to make parents \ngo from agency to agency to enroll for state health insurance coverage.\n  Third, we can do a better job making a greater variety of application \nsites available to families. Rather than only being able to apply at a \nstate agency, states could opt to expand application site options. \nLet's take the application process to the places that parents and their \nchildren go on a regular basis--examples include schools and child care \ncenters.\n  This bill also expands health insurance coverage options to pregnant \nwomen who do not qualify for Medicaid because their incomes are \nslightly above Medicaid guidelines. Thousands of pregnant women earn \njust a bit too much to qualify for Medicaid, but they do not have \nhealth insurance because either their employer or their husband's \nemployer doesn't offer it.\n  We all know the importance of prenatal care to the health of unborn \nchildren. If a mother receives proper prenatal care, her child has a \nmuch greater chance of being born healthy. That is why the National \nAcademy of Pediatrics, the National Association of Children's Hospitals \nand the March of Dimes--just to name a few organizations--support this \nlegislation.\n  In an era of making every federal dollar stretch as far as possible, \nthis provision makes sense. For every $1 we spend on prenatal care, we \nsave $3 later on that would be spent on complicated deliveries and \nserious birth defects. Sometimes you have to spend money to save money.\n  Several years ago, the Arkansas governor and the state legislature \nimplemented the AR Kids First health insurance program for children who \ndid not qualify for Medicaid. AR Kids First precedes CHIP.\n  The statistics for enrollment in the CHIP program in Arkansas are a \nbit ahead of the national curve. So for, AR Kids First has enrolled \nhalf of all eligible children. Over 45,000 now have coverage as a \nresult of the state's proactive efforts and commitment to children's \nhealth.\n  It has been so successful in enrolling eligible children for health \ninsurance that the Department of Health and Human Services recently \ngranted approval to allow AR Kids First to operate as the state's CHIP \nprogram.\n  I applaud their efforts and hope that other states can learn from the \noutreach success of AR Kids First.\n  Finally, this bill eliminates the sunset clause for a pot of money \nthat Congress allocated for states to help them link families leaving \nwelfare with the Medicaid and CHIP programs. As part of the 1996 \nwelfare reform law, Congress gave $500 million to states to see that \nfamilies with children in the welfare system continue to receive health \ncare coverage.\n  Prior to 1996, poor families with children automatically received \nhealth benefits through Medicaid when they signed up for AFDC. Since \nCongress passed welfare reform legislation, Medicaid and TANF are no \nlonger legally connected. States must revamp their eligibility systems \nto see that families with children do not fall through the cracks.\n  There has been confusion between governors and the Department of \nHealth and Human Services about the time period that this money could \nbe spent.\n  States run the risk of losing this money just 2 days from now. On \nSeptember 30th, 16 states are in jeopardy of losing this funding and 18 \nmore states will lose funding by December 31, 1999.\n  So, as you see, this piece of the Maternal and Children's Health \nCoverage Act is critical--and timely.\n  I hope that the Congress and the President will act swiftly to \neliminate the sunset clause and give states more time to spend this \nvaluable pot of money.\n  Mr. President, Congress is currently engaged in a debate over the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. I hope that we don't lose sight of an equally \nimportant goal of seeing that all children in America have health care \ninsurance.\n  I believe this bill takes a positive step forward in helping states \nmove closer to the goal of providing health insurance to 5 million \nuninsured children. We can do this. We must do this.\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues, \nSenator Lincoln from Arkansas, Senator Bayh from Indiana, Senator Smith \nfrom Oregon, and Senator Feinstein from California to introduce the \n``Improved Maternal and Children's Health Coverage Act of 1999,'' that \nwould improve the health coverage of needy children under the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and Medicaid. CHIP was \nimplemented during the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to ensure children \nliving in working families that do not qualify for Medicaid, but still \ncannot afford health insurance, receive the care they need.\n  As part of the 1996 welfare reform law, Congress allocated $500 \nmillion to states to provide children and families access to Medicaid. \nThis fund will expire for 16 states on September 30, 1999, and for 18 \nmore States, including Louisiana, on December 31, 1999. Our proposal \nwould extend the life of this fund to allow states to continue to use \nthese dollars as they carry out outreach efforts for both Medicare and \nCHIP providing our children with health care.\n  Eleven million of the nation's children remain uninsured despite the \npassage of the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Mr. \nPresident, we\n\n[[Page S11567]]\n\nneed to strengthen this essential program. In Louisiana alone, there \nare 268,000 children who still do not have health insurance. About half \nof these children are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, but are not \nenrolled because of the lack of outreach. I know that in my colleague's \nstate of Arkansas, they have insured just over half of the children who \nare eligible. The ``Improved Maternal and Children's Health Coverage \nAct'' will provide better outreach services to those families who may \nnot know of their eligibility. It provides for a simplified and \ncoordinated enrollment process that would determine eligibility for \nboth Medicaid and CHIP.\n  Additionally, the measure gives the states the option to cover \npregnant women. Studies have shown that prenatal care improves the \nhealth of new born children and reduces the risk of birth defects. It \nis so very important that our children have health coverage from the \nfirst day of life.\n  Parents are just beginning to be aware that this special program \nexists and that their children are eligible. It is our responsibility \nas leaders to make sure that our children are given the best possible \nopportunities for success. This means we must provide quality access to \nchildren's health services. We must not let these children fall through \nthe cracks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Gorton, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1648. A bill to amend the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 to \nrequire the Secretary of Agriculture to take certain actions if the \nEuropean Union does not reduce and subsequently eliminate agricultural \nexport subsidies; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n                   AGRICULTURE FAIR TRADE ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Agriculture Fair \nTrade Act of 1999. I am joined by Senator Gorton of Washington and \nSenator Bingaman of New Mexico.\n  I begin by saying I believe the next round of the WTO is vital to \nAmerican farmers. As a Senator who represents Montana, a State whose \nprimary industry is agriculture, this next round will decide the fate \nof our next generation of producers. It is that simple.\n  It is becoming increasingly clear that while the rest of the Nation \ncontinues to experience astounding economic growth and prosperity \nthrough open and global trade, America's farmers and ranchers across \nthe Nation are suffering, and they have yet to reap the fruits of free \ntrade's bounty.\n  During the last several months, we have worked to identify goals for \nagriculture in the next round of the WTO. The consensus is that we must \nstep up our efforts dramatically in order to make genuine progress in \nleveling the playing field for our agriculture industry.\n  It is our intention that this bill will begin this process. The \nAgriculture Fair Trade Act provides a mechanism through which we can \ntarget unfair export subsidies and fight for their total elimination by \nJanuary 1, 2003.\n  It is our hope that such legislation will provide an incentive for \nour trading partners to voluntarily reduce their export subsidies \nduring the next round of the WTO. The elimination of these subsidies \nwill benefit farmers on both sides of the Atlantic.\n  I believe this act provides a powerful two-tier trigger approach to \nthe reduction of export subsidies.\n  First, the European Union must reduce its agriculture export \nsubsidies by 50 percent by January 1, 2002. If the EU fails to do so, \nthe U.S. Agriculture Secretary shall take appropriate measures to \nprotect the interests of American agricultural producers and ensure the \ninternational competitiveness of U.S. agriculture.\n  In particular, the Secretary shall be authorized to target EU's most \nsensitive export market for grains and spend over $1 billion in Export \nEnhancement Program funding in that market.\n  Step 2 requires the EU to enter into an agreement with the United \nStates by January 1, 2003. The EU must agree to completely eliminate \nits export subsidies, and if not, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture \nshall be authorized to, again, target EU's most sensitive export market \nfor grain, double the Export Enhancement Program to $2 billion, and \nincrease and utilize export funding for market promotion and direct ag \nexport credit sales in the best interest of American ag producers.\n  It is high time the Senate takes action to ensure that the next round \nof negotiations result in benefits to our agricultural producers.\n  Why target EU export subsidies? I believe the United States has taken \nthe high road in leading by example. That lead hurts U.S. producers. \nThe United States has long taken the position that if we reduce support \nfor agriculture, especially export subsidies, we will get a fair \ntrading system.\n  That is not the case across the Atlantic, where the EU export \nsubsidies are 60 times greater than export subsidies in the United \nStates. In fact, the EU accounts for nearly 85 percent of the world's \nagricultural export subsidies.\n  I can remember in the 1980s when the U.S. and EU engaged in an \n``export subsidy war.'' At the same time, they both battled to undercut \neach other's prices in the world's wheat export markets. But over the \ndecade, U.S. market share declined while EU market share increased \ndramatically.\n  Europe, formerly the world's largest net importer, suddenly became \nthe world's largest net exporter of agricultural products. It had \nnothing to do with luck. It had everything to do with their aggressive \nuse of export subsidies.\n  How did the United States fight back? We didn't. To date, the United \nStates maintains an anemic Export Enhancement Program. Authorized at \n$500 million a year, EEP operates well below its Uruguay Round \nreduction commitments. If EEP is to be a credible tool in international \ntrade, it is high time we start flexing its muscle.\n  The United States will remain the most open market in the world. I am \ncommitted to that. At the same time, we must do everything possible to \nopen foreign markets. A ``trigger'' is the first step--it has \nleverage--but one that must be taken as a very large stride in the path \ntoward free trade.\n  Again, I thank Senators Gorton and Bingaman for cosponsoring this \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues vested in the future of American \nagriculture to join us in this endeavor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Mack, and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 1649. A bill to provide incentives for States to establish and \nadminister periodic teacher testing and merit pay programs for \nelementary school and secondary school teachers; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                             the merit act\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise with my good friend \nand colleague, Senator Mack, to introduce the Measures to Encourage \nResults in Teaching Act, or as it is frequently and aptly called, the \nMERIT Act.\n  Mr. President, there has been a great deal of discussion regarding \nour nation's schools and the state of elementary and secondary public \nschool education. This country spends $740 billion per year on \neducation. This is more than the Gross Domestic Products of Spain, \nCanada or Brazil. Yet the results of the Third International \nMathematics and Science Study for Eighth Grade Students ranked American \nstudents 28th in science and 17th in math when compared to students in \nother countries. This situation worsens by the twelfth grade, when our \nadvanced students performed at the bottom of international comparisons.\n  Mr. President, 43 percent of our fourth graders cannot pass a basic \nreading test. Our children deserve the highest quality education \npossible and unfortunately, as just even these few statistics \ndemonstrate, we are failing. Neither our children nor our nation can \nsucceed unless we improve our educational system.\n  Without a good education and the strong skills it provides, our young \npeople will not be able to get good jobs at good wages. Without \nskilled, educated workers, our businesses will lose their competitive \nedge in the world marketplace. The prosperity of our entire nation \ndemands that we do more to improve our children's education.\n  The question then, Mr. President, is ``how can we improve our kids' \neducation?'' There are a lot of fancy theories floating about on this \ntopic. But one thing we know for certain: the most important \neducational tool in any classroom remains a qualified, highly trained \nteacher. Teachers play a special and indispensable role in our\n\n[[Page S11568]]\n\nchildren's education. Nothing can replace the positive and long lasting \nimpact a dedicated, knowledgeable teacher has on a child's learning \nprocess. And nothing can compensate for the weak teaching that, despite \nthe best of intentions, can result from a teacher's lack of knowledge, \npreparation, skill and interest.\n  The bulk of our teachers are working hard, under difficult \ncircumstances, to educate our children. Unfortunately, Mr. President, \ntoo many of them have not gained the training they need to succeed in \neducating young people. Currently, the Department of Education reports \nthat one-third of high school math teachers, nearly 25 percent of high \nschool English teachers and 20 percent of science teachers are teaching \nwithout a college major or even a college minor in their subjects.\n  The MERIT Act constitutes an important step toward providing better \neducation. It will ensure that teachers have the training they need to \nsucceed, and that teachers are rewarded for their successes. Common \nsense dictates that teachers should have subject-matter knowledge in \nthe areas they teach. Common sense also dictates that teachers who \nmotivate and inspire their students, and who put forth the extra effort \nto improve and expand upon their own skills and knowledge, should be \nrewarded.\n  The MERIT Act puts common sense into action. It will provide \nincentives for states to establish teacher testing and merit pay \npolicies. Specifically, this legislation would provide that 50 percent \nof the funds provided over the Fiscal Year 2000 appropriation level for \nthe Eisenhower Professional Development Program will be made available \nto any state that has established periodic assessments of elementary \nand secondary school teachers, and implements a pay system to reward \nteachers based on merit and proven performance.\n  Mr. President, I'd like to be particularly clear on one point: This \nbill will not result in any reductions in funding for the Eisenhower \nProfessional Development Program. This is an incentive program, not \nanother Washington-knows-best mandate. No state will be penalized for \nits decision not to participate in the MERIT Act program. In fact, \nshould the appropriation level for the Eisenhower Program increase, so \nwill the amount provided to each state.\n  What this legislation will provide, Mr. President, is an important \nincentive for states to make certain that our kids are taught by \ncommitted teachers who have received the training they need to succeed. \nDay in and day out, teachers make a real difference for our kids. They \ninspire children to dream, and to work to make those dreams come true. \nThey help our young people realize their full potential and work to \nachieve it. Their contributions are invaluable and their efforts demand \ncommendation. The MERIT Act would reward these teachers for their \ncommitment and ensure that our children will be taught by the most \nqualified and knowledgeable individuals available.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and a section by \nsection analysis, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1649\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Measures \n     to Encourage Results in Teaching Act of 1999''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) All students deserve to be taught by well-educated, \n     competent, and qualified teachers.\n       (2) More than ever before, education has and will continue \n     to become the ticket not only to economic success but to \n     basic survival. Students will not succeed in meeting the \n     demands of a knowledge-based, 21st century society and \n     economy if the students do not encounter more challenging \n     work in school. For future generations to have the \n     opportunities to achieve success the future generations will \n     need to have an education and a teacher workforce second to \n     none.\n       (3) No other intervention can make the difference that a \n     knowledgeable, skillful teacher can make in the learning \n     process. At the same time, nothing can fully compensate for \n     weak teaching that, despite good intentions, can result from \n     a teacher's lack of opportunity to acquire the knowledge and \n     skill needed to help students master the curriculum.\n       (4) The Federal Government established the Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower Professional Development Program in 1985 to ensure \n     that teachers and other educational staff have access to \n     sustained and high-quality professional development. This \n     ongoing development must include the ability to demonstrate \n     and judge the performance of teachers and other instructional \n     staff.\n       (5) States should evaluate their teachers on the basis of \n     demonstrated ability, including tests of subject matter \n     knowledge, teaching knowledge, and teaching skill. States \n     should develop a test for their teachers and other \n     instructional staff with respect to the subjects taught by \n     the teachers and staff, and should administer the test every \n     3 to 5 years.\n       (6) Evaluating and rewarding teachers with a compensation \n     system that supports teachers who become increasingly expert \n     in a subject area, are proficient in meeting the needs of \n     students and schools, and demonstrate high levels of \n     performance measured against professional teaching standards, \n     will encourage teachers to continue to learn needed skills \n     and broaden teachers' expertise, thereby enhancing education \n     for all students.\n       (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To provide incentives for States to establish and \n     administer periodic teacher testing and merit pay programs \n     for elementary school and secondary school teachers.\n       (2) To encourage States to establish merit pay programs \n     that have a significant impact on teacher salary scales.\n       (3) To encourage programs that recognize and reward the \n     best teachers, and encourage those teachers that need to do \n     better.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and \ncolleague Senator Abraham, to introduce the Merit Act, which is \nlegislation to ensure that every classroom in America is staffed with a \ncompetent, qualified and caring teacher. Last Congress, the Senate \ndebated a number of initiatives to further this goal and passed this \nlegislation as an amendment to a comprehensive education reform bill, \nwhich was vetoed by the President. Earlier this year, I joined Senator \nGregg in cosponsor the Teacher Empowerment Act. Both the TEA, and the \nMERIT ACT are important reform bills to enable local schools to staff \ntheir classrooms with the best and brightest teachers.\n  The 21st Century begins in just under 100 days. If our children are \nto be prepared for the challenges ahead, educational excellence must \nbecome our first order of business. As Congress continues to focus on a \nnumber of important reforms to federal K-12 education policy, I \nstrongly believe that any real education reform must confront the most \nbasic, the most important, and the most neglected aspect of public \neducation: the quality of instruction in the classroom.\n  Parents all over the state of Florida, and I imagine the same is true \naround the country, are concerned that the success --or failure--of \ntheir child's entire academic year will be determined by the quality \nand expertise of their child's teacher. Studies show that the most \nimportant factor in determining student success on standardized tests \nis the teacher's ability to present the material. Studies also show \nthat when a student is assigned an ineffective teacher, the damage is \nnot limited to one year. In fact, student test scores do not recover \nfor three years, even if their subsequent teachers are excellent.\n  America's classrooms are staffed with many dedicated, knowledgeable, \nand hardworking teachers. Nevertheless, the case for sweeping reform is \nnot difficult to make. While the United States already spends more \nmoney per pupil than virtually any industrialized democracy in the \nworld, our children frequently score near the bottom in international \nexams in science and math. Without exceptional teaching, no amount of \nresources will be able to turn bad schools into good schools. Throwing \nmore money at the problem is no longer the answer.\n  Our schools and classrooms should be staffed with teachers who have \nthe appropriate training and background. Students deserve teachers with \na thorough knowledge of the subjects they are teaching and the ability \nto convey complex material in ways that students can understand. One \nway to determine the competency of teachers would be to test them on \ntheir knowledge of the subject areas they teach.\n  At a time when states are raising the bar for student achievement, \nfew are raising standards for teachers. Today, seven states have no \nlicensing exams for new teachers, and of the 43 states that do have \nlicensing exams, only 29 require high school teachers to pass an exam \nin the subject they plan to teach. However, in many cases, these \nrequirements are waived when there is a shortage of qualified \ncandidates.\n\n  We have a clear interest in ensuring that beginning teachers are able \nto meet high standards and are knowledgeable about the subject matter \nthey are presenting, and a number of states have taken the initiative \nto test their prospective teachers. However, when you consider that \nmany teachers--especially teachers in low income districts--do not even \nhave a minor degree in the subject they teach, it is important to \nperiodically evaluate the performance of all teachers. Schools are \noften strapped for good teachers and will simply staff a science class \nwith a math teacher. These are cases where testing could provide \nvaluable insight as to the mastery of the teacher in additional \nsubjects, and would identify those teachers who need additional \nencouragement.\n  Common sense also dictates that we should not concentrate all our \nattention on under-performing teachers. We must also recognize that \nthere are many great teachers who are successfully challenging their \nstudents on a daily basis. Today, our public schools compensate \nteachers based almost solely on seniority, not on their performance \ninside the classroom. Merit-pay would differentiate between teachers \nwho are hard-working and inspiring, and those who fall short.\n  The legislation we are introducing today, known as the MERIT ACT--\nwhich stands for Measures to Enhance Results in Teaching --is the same \nlegislation that passed the Senate last Congress with bipartisan \nsupport by a vote of 63-35. It rewards states that test its teachers on \ntheir subject matter knowledge, and pays its teachers based on merit.\n  Here is how it works: we will make half of any additional funding \nover the FY 2000 level for the Eisenhower Professional Development \nProgram available to states that periodically test elementary and \nsecondary school teachers, and reward teachers based on merit and \nproven performance. There will be no reduction in current funding to \nstates under this program based on this legislation. As funding \nincreases for this program, so will the amount each state receives. \nIncentives will and should be provided to those states that take the \ninitiative to establish teacher testing and merit pay programs.\n  Again, I want to emphasize that all current money being spent on this \nprogram is unaffected by this legislation. Only additional money will \nbe used as an incentive for states to enact teacher testing and merit \npay programs.\n  Finally, this legislation enables states to also use federal \neducation money to establish and administer teacher testing and merit \npay programs. This broad approach will enable states to staff their \nschools with the best and most qualified teachers, thereby enhancing \nlearning for all students. In turn, teachers can be certain that all of \ntheir energy, dedication and expertise will be rewarded. And it can be \ndone without placing new mandates on states or increasing the federal \nbureaucracy.\n  It is interesting to note that as Governor of the State of Arkansas, \nBill Clinton enthusiastically supported teacher testing, and as \nGovernor of South Carolina, Secretary of Education Richard Riley \nadvocated a merit-pay plan. In fact, then-Governor Clinton in 1984 said \nthat he was more convinced than ever that competency tests were needed \nto take inventory of teachers' basic skills. He said, ``Teachers who \ndon't pass the test shouldn't be in the classroom''. While President \nClinton vetoed this legislation last year, I am hoping he will stand by \nhis State of the Union address where he stated that new teachers should \nbe required to pass performance exams and all teachers should know the \nsubject matter they are teaching.\n  I would also like to mention the important steps being taken by \nschools around the country to address the need for merit-based pay. \nMost recently, in Denver, Colorado, schools have reached an agreement \nwith the unions to commence a two year demonstration program which will \npay teachers based on\n\n[[Page S11570]]\n\nperformance. It is important to note the two largest unions, the \nNational Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, \nhave approached the Denver plan with an open mind. In this program, \nteachers can earn an additional $1500 by the end of an academic year if \na majority of the teacher's students ``improve.'' I am encouraged by \nthe initiative taken by Denver's schools to implement innovative \napproaches to teacher compensation, and I look forward to the continued \ncooperation of America's teacher unions. Without their cooperation, \nreforms to education in America are often frustrated. In the end, I \nbelieve teachers, administrators, parents and students will be able to \ndevise a system that is fair and one that works to improve teacher and \nstudent performance alike.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues as we continue the fight \nto give dedicated professionals who teach our children a personal stake \nin the quality of the instruction they provide. I hope there will again \nbe broad, bipartisan support for this bill.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues, \nSenators Abraham and Mack to introduce legislation today which will \nhelp ensure that our children are being taught by the best, brightest \nand most component teachers.\n  ``A teacher affects eternity; they can never tell where their \ninfluence stops.'' I share this sentiment of Henry Adams--\nknowledgeable, enthusiastic teachers play a critical role in the \ndevelopment of our children.\n  Personally, I can attest to the lasting mark teachers can have on a \nchild, for my life has greatly benefitted from the guidance, \nencouragement and support of many teachers. As many of my colleagues \nknow, my years in school were not notable for individual academic \nachievement, but I was fortunate to have been taught by some of the \nfinest leaders and role models our nation could offer a young person. \nTheir efforts helped prepare me for the experiences and obstacles I \nfaced later in life.\n  It is important for us to continue to work to ensure that all \nchildren have access to wonderful, intelligent and inspirational \nteachers. It is my strong belief that testing our teachers and \nproviding merit pay for those that excel is critical for retaining \nsmart, enthusiastic and talented teachers in our nation's classrooms. \nThis is why I cosponsored this measure last year and have joined my \ncolleagues again this year to reintroduce this legislation.\n  Too many teachers are receiving salaries which are not commensurate \nwith the invaluable service they provide. It is unconscionable that a \nbad politician is paid more than a good teacher. I will continue \nfighting for better pay for our nation's teachers, but I will also \ncontinue fighting for programs which encourage our states to provide \nmerit-based pay, and periodically test teachers for competence. By all \nmeans, we should reward good teachers. They have answered one of the \nhighest callings in our society, and they should be honored for the \nsacrifices they make on our children's behalf. But we should also weed \nout problem teachers who have lost the desire to teach or who have \nfailed to improve their teaching skills in this high tech age.\n  The fact is that teachers who refuse to demonstrate their competency, \nare probably not competent to teach. Every child in every classroom \ndeserves a teacher who is qualified and enthusiastic about teaching. \nSome people just aren't meant to be teachers, and we should help them \nfind another line of work.\n  There are thousands of dedicated teachers around our nation working \nwith parents, school officials and local communities to guide our \nchildren and provide them with the highest quality education necessary \nfor ensuring the youth of our country have both the love in their \nhearts and the knowledge in their heads to not only dream, but to make \ntheir dreams a reality. These are precisely the teachers whom we should \nbe fighting to keep in our schools and merit pay is crucial towards \nachieving that.\n  America's teachers are helping our youth develop the personal, \nprofessional and emotional skills necessary for successfully defining \nand achieving their goals. The impact of quality teachers on our \nchildren and our nation's future is immeasurable and irreplaceable, and \nwe must continue developing and strengthening programs which encourage \nthese teachers to continue teaching our children and building a better \nfuture for all of us. I urge my colleagues to support this measure we \nare introducing today and work with us to ensure the best teachers with \nthe best skills are teaching our children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Craig, \n        and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1651. A bill to amend the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 to \nrequire the Secretary of Agriculture to take certain actions if the \nEuropean Union does not reduce and subsequently eliminate agricultural \nexport subsidies; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n                agricultural trade fairness act of 1999\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Agriculture Fair Trade Act of 1999.'' I am pleased to be joined in \nthis bipartisan effort by the bill's leading cosponsors, Senator \nGorton, Senator Bingaman, Senator Craig and Senator Murray. The measure \nis also supported by the Montana Grain Growers and the Montana Farm \nBureau.\n  Let me begin by saying that this next round of WTO is vital. As a \nsenator who represents Montana--a state whose primary industry is \nagriculture--this next round will decide the fate of our next \ngeneration of producers. It is becoming increasingly clear that while \nthe rest of the nation continues to experience astounding economic \ngrowth and prosperity through open and global trade, America's farmers \nand ranchers across the nation suffer. They have yet to reap the fruits \nof free trade's bounty.\n  During the past several months, we in the Senate, the Administration \nand farmers and ranchers back home have worked to identify the goals \nfor agriculture in the next round in the WTO. And the consensus is that \nwe must step up our efforts in order to make any genuine progress in \nleveling the playing field for the agricultural industry.\n  It is our intention that this bill will begin this process. The \nAgriculture Fair Trade Act provides a mechanism through which we can \ntarget unfair export subsidies and fight for their total elimination by \nJanuary 1, 2003. It is our hope that such legislation will provide an \nincentive for our trading partners to voluntarily reduce their export \nsubsidies during the next round of the WTO. The elimination of these \nsubsidies will benefit farmers on both sides of the Atlantic.\n  I believe that the Agriculture Fair Trade Act provides a powerful, \ntwo-tiered ``trigger'' approach to the reduction of export subsidies.\n  First, the European Union must reduce its agricultural export \nsubsidies by 50 percent by January 1, 2002. If the EU fails to do so, \nthe U.S. Secretary of Agriculture shall take appropriate measures to \nprotect the interests of American agricultural producers and ensure the \ninternational competitiveness of United States agriculture.\n  In particular, the Secretary shall be authorized to--\n  Target the EU's most sensitive export market for grains, and\n  Spend $1 billion in Export Enhancement Program funding in that \nmarket.\n  Step two requires the European Union to enter into an agreement with \nthe United States. By January 1, 2003, the EU must agree to completely \neliminate its export subsidies. If not, the U.S. Secretary of \nAgriculture shall be authorized to--\n  Again, target the EU's most sensitive export market for grains,\n  Double the Export Enhancement Program to $2 billion, and\n  Increase and utilize export funding for market promotion and direct \nag export credit sales in the best interest of American ag producers.\n  It's high time, we in the U.S. Senate take action to ensure that the \nnext round of negotiations results in benefits to our producers.\n\n\n                    Why Target EU Export subsidies?\n\n  I believe that the U.S. has taken the high road in leading by \nexample. That lead hurts U.S. producers. The United States has long \ntaken the position that if we reduce support for agriculture we will \nget a fair trading system. That is not the case across the Atlantic, \nwhere the EU export subsidies are 60 times\n\n[[Page S11571]]\n\ngreater than export subsidies in the United States. In fact, the EU \naccounts for nearly 85 percent of the world's export subsidies.\n  I can remember the 1980s when the U.S. and EU engaged in an ``export \nsubsidy war.'' At that time, both countries battled to undercut each \nother's prices in the world's wheat export markets. Over the decade, \nU.S. market share declined while EU market share increased \ndramatically. Europe, formerly the world's largest net importer, \nsuddenly became the world's largest net exporter. It had nothing to do \nwith luck. It had everything to do with their aggressive use of export \nsubsidies.\n  And how did the United States fight back? We didn't. To date, the \nUnited States maintains the anemic Export Enhancement Program. \nAuthorized at $500 million a year, EEP operates well below its Uruguay \nRound reduction commitments. If EEP is to be a credible tool in \ninternational trade, its high time to start flexing its muscle.\n  The United States will remain the most open market in the world. I am \ncommitted to that. At the same time, we must do everything possible to \nopen foreign markets. A ``trigger'' is the first step--but one that \nmust be taken as a very large stride in the path toward fair trade.\n  I again thank Senators Gorton, Bingaman, Craig and Murray for \ncosponsoring this important legislation. And I urge my colleagues \nvested in the future of America agriculture to join us in this \nendeavor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Lott, Mr. Daschle, \n        Mr. Warner, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Domenici, \n        Mr. Moynihan, Ms. Collins, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 1653. A bill to reauthorize and amend the National Fish and \nWildlife Foundation Establishment Act; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\n national fish and wildlife foundation establishment act amendments of \n                                  1999\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nreauthorize the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act \nof 1984. This legislation makes important changes in the Foundation's \ncharter, changes that I believe will allow the Foundation to build on \nits fine record of providing funding for conservation of our Nation's \nfish, wildlife, and plant resources.\n  The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation was established in 1984, to \nbring together diverse groups to engage in conservation projects across \nAmerica and, in some cases, around the world. Since its inception, the \nFoundation has made more than 3,400 grants totaling over $435 million. \nThis is an impressive record of accomplishment. The Foundation has \npioneered some notable conservation programs, including implementing \nthe North American Waterfowl Management plan, Partners in Flight for \nneotropical birds, Bring Back the Natives Program, the Exxon Save the \nTiger Fund, and the establishment of the Conservation Plan for Sterling \nForest in New York and New Jersey, to name just a few.\n  Mr. President, the Foundation has funded these programs by raising \nprivate funds to match Federal appropriations on at least a 2 to 1 \nbasis. During this time of fiscal constraint this is an impressive \nrecord of leveraging Federal dollars. Moreover, all of the Foundation's \noperating costs are raised privately, which means that Federal and \nprivate dollars given for conservation is spent only on conservation \nprojects.\n  I am proud to count myself as one of the ``Founding Fathers'' of the \nNational Fish and Wildlife Foundation. In 1984, I, along with my \ncolleagues Senators Howard Baker, George Mitchell, and John Breaux, saw \nthe need to create a private, nonprofit group that could build public-\nprivate partnerships and consensus, where previously there had only \nbeen acrimony and, many times, contentious litigation.\n  The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation has more than fulfilled the \nhopes of its original sponsors. It has helped to bring solutions to \nsome difficult natural resource problems and is becoming widely \nrecognized for its innovative approach to solving environmental \nproblems. For example, when Atlantic salmon neared extinction in the \nUnited States due to overharvest in Greenland, the Foundation and its \npartners bought Greenland salmon quotas. I and many others in Congress \nwant the Foundation to continue its important conservation efforts. So, \ntoday I am introducing amendments to the Foundation's charter that will \nallow it to do just that.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is quite simple. It makes three key \nchanges to current law. First, the bill would expand the Foundation's \ngoverning board of directors from 15 members to 25 members. This will \nallow a greater number of those with a strong interest in conservation \nto actively participate in, and contribute to, the Foundation's \nactivities.\n  The bill's second key feature authorizes the Foundation to work with \nother agencies within the Department of the Interior and the Department \nof Commerce, in addition to the Fish and Wildlife Service and the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Mr. President, it is \nmy view that the Foundation should continue to provide valuable \nassistance to government agencies within the Departments of the \nInterior and Commerce that may be faced with conservation issues. \nFinally, it would reauthorize appropriations to the Departments of the \nInterior and the Department of Commerce through 2004.\n  Mr. President, last year this bill passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent, but unfortunately the House was unable to duplicate our \nefforts. I believe that this legislation will produce real conservation \nbenefits and I strongly urge my colleagues to once again give the bill \ntheir support.\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in 1984, Congress created the \nNational Fish and Wildlife Foundation, a charitable, nonprofit \ncorporation with the mission of conserving our nation's fish, wildlife, \nplant, and other natural resources. The Foundation's creation was \nchampioned by congressional members from both sides of the aisle, \nincluding my esteemed colleague on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Chairman John Chafee. The bipartisan support the Foundation \nreceived in Congress reflected broad agreement that additional efforts \nwere needed to protect and manage our natural resources.\n  Over the past 15 years, National Fish and Wildlife Foundation has \nestablished a solid track record. The Foundation has achieved on-the-\nground results. It has also stretched federal dollars and built public-\nprivate partnerships essential to conservation efforts. The Foundation \nhas provided more than 3,500 grants to over 940 private local \norganizations, state and county governments, tribes, federal and \ninterstate agencies, and colleges and universities in all 50 states. By \nrequiring grantees to match Foundation grants with non-federal funds, \nthe $135 million in federal funds invested by the Foundation have been \nleveraged to deliver more than $440 million to natural resource \nconservation efforts. Significantly, these funds are used to help build \npublic-private partnerships among individual landowners, government and \ntribal agencies, conservation organizations, and business. The result \nis the development of consensus, locally-driven solutions to the \nchallenges involved in protecting and managing fish, wildlife, plants, \nand other natural resources.\n  In my home state of Montana, where fishing, hunting, and the \nenjoyment of our natural resources are deeply ingrained into our way of \nlife, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation has made important \ncontributions to conservation efforts. These contributions include \nsupporting environmental education, habitat restoration and protection, \nresource management, and the development of conservation policy. For \nexample, public-private partnerships have been established to restore \nand protect native fish species, such as Arctic grayling, bull trout, \nand cutthroat trout, prized by anglers. Working with landowners, \nthousands of acres of lands have been purchased and easements acquired \nto benefit elk, bighorn sheep, mule deer, other game animals. Support \nhas been provided to county and tribal efforts to control the spread of \nnoxious weed species that threaten farms, rangelands, wildlife habitat, \nand recreation areas. In total, the Foundation has funded 187 projects \nand delivered a total of almost $13 million to conservation projects in \nMontana.\n\n[[Page S11572]]\n\n  Mr. President, even with the accomplishments of the National Fish and \nWildlife Foundation, the need to conserve the nation's natural \nresources remains. Today, in too many areas of the country, the health \nand sustainability of fish, wildlife, and plants, and the habitats on \nwhich they depend, are threatened. Bitter disputes continue to arise \namong interests when solutions to difficult natural resource problems \nare sought. Tight budgets often severely limit the ability of \ngovernments and private entities to adequately address conservation \nchallenges. Because of this, the need for an organization such as the \nNational Fish and Wildlife Foundation, which promotes conservation, \nbuilds partnerships and consensus, and stretches dollars, is as clear \ntoday as it was in 1984\n  The bill we are introducing today, the National Fish and Wildlife \nFoundation Establishment Act Amendments of 1999, will increase the \nFoundation's ability to continue to carry out is important mission. \nFirst and foremost, the legislation authorizes federal appropriations \nthrough 2004 to support the Foundation's work. The legislation also \nstrengthens the Foundation by increasing the size of its board of \ndirectors and allowing board members to be removed for nonperformance. \nFinally, the bill broadens the Foundation's authority by allowing it to \nwork with all agencies within the Departments of Interior and Commerce. \nThis legislation is nearly identical to the legislation passed by the \nSenate last year.\n  Mr. President, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation has provided \nvaluable assistance to this nation's natural resource conservation \nefforts over the past 15 years. If the legislation we are introducing \ntoday is passed, I have no doubt that the Foundation will continue it \nsolid record of accomplishment. I urge my colleagues to join the \nbipartisan group of cosponsors and support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today Chairman Chafee has introduced \nlegislation providing for the reauthorization of the National Fish and \nWildlife Foundation. I appreciate the leadership that the chairman has \ntaken in sponsoring this bipartisan bill, and anticipate that it will \nmove quickly through the legislative process.\n  I have been a strong supporter of the Foundation and the programs and \nactivities it undertakes to further conservation and management of our \nnation's fish and wildlife resources from the beginning. Created by \nCongress in 1984, the Foundation has used its relationship with \ngovernment, private, and corporate stakeholders to foster interagency \ncooperation and coordination. It has also brought private sector \ninvolvement, initiative, imagination, and technology to bear in solving \nconservation problems.\n  Mr. President, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation \nEstablishment Act requires that all federal money appropriated to the \nFoundation be matched by contributions from non-federal sources, such \nas: corporations, State and local government agencies, foundations and \nindividuals. The Foundation's operating policy is to raise a match of \nat least 2 to 1, to maximize leverage for our federal funds. The \nFoundation takes the appropriated money and places it directly into \nconservation projects. What does this mean? This means that for every \nfederally appropriated dollar we give the Foundation, an average of \n$3.17 in on-the-ground conservation takes place. This is something we \nall should take credit for.\n  Mr. President, one of the things that distinguishes the Foundation \nfrom other conservation groups, is that its efforts yield results in \nthe field, and that its projects include its trademark characteristics \nof partnership building, public-private coordination, community \ninvolvement, and sustainable economics. The Foundation has worked with \nover 700 agencies, universities, businesses and conservation groups, \nboth large and small, over the last decade. These factors have helped \nthe Foundation become one of the most effective conservation \norganizations in the nation. The Foundation's projects are all peer \nreviewed by agency staff, state resource officials, and other \nprofessionals in the natural resource field, and there is a process to \nsolicit comments from members of Congress concerning grants in a \nmember's district or state.\n  In Mississippi the Foundation has supported many local habitat \nrestoration projects aimed specifically at helping private landowners \nrestore wetlands and riparian areas to improve habitat for waterfowl \nand shorebirds. Further, the Foundation is an important partner in the \nwork that local groups are going to market the conservation programs of \nthe farm bill in Mississippi. With funds from the Foundation, local \nconservation groups are partnering with the USDA Natural Resources \nConservation Service to reach farmers who had not participated in \nconservation programs. Finally, the Foundation is playing a key role in \nrestoring bottomland hardwood habitats critical to migrating \nneotropical songbirds and other water-dependent wildlife species by \nworking with utility companies to support tree planting throughout the \nregion. These efforts all help in regaining some the state's original \nwetlands habitats.\n  Mr. President, we are all aware of our deficit reduction challenges \nand the needs and concerns of our many constituencies. The Foundation \nprovides us with a unique opportunity to meet these challenges and \nneeds.\n  Mr. President, this bill should be acted upon quickly, and the \nchairman can count on my strong support for the bill's adoption.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MACK (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 1654. A bill to protect the coast of Florida; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  florida coast protection act of 2000\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, Senator Graham and I rise again to introduce \nthe Florida Coast Protection Act of 2000. This legislation will amend \ncurrent law to give states the ability to have all pertinent \nenvironmental information on hand before they are forced to rule on oil \nand gas drilling development plans, and it would also implement a \npermanent ban on leasing in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico.\n  Mr. President, Floridians have always been justifiably concerned \nabout the prospect of oil and gas exploration in the waters off our \ncoast. We are well aware of the risk this activity poses to our \nenvironment and our economy because, in Florida, a healthy environment \nmeans a healthy economy. Millions of people come to Florida each year \nto enjoy the climate, our beaches, and our fine quality of life. The \ntourism industry in Florida provides millions of jobs and generates \nrevenues in the billion of dollars. It would take only one disaster to \nend Florida's good standing as America's vacationland. We cannot afford \nto let that happen.\n  Throughout my tenure in the Senate I have opposed exploration and \ndrilling off Florida's coasts. My goal--and the goal of the entire \nFlorida Congressional delegation--is to permanently remove this threat \nfrom Florida's coast. In recent years, we have stood together in \nopposition to drilling and have successfully extended the annual \nmoratorium on all new leasing activities on Florida's continental \nshelf. While the opposition of Floridians to oil drilling is well-\ndocumented, the reality remains that leases have been issued, potential \ndrilling sites have been explored, and it is likely that actual \nextraction of resources could take place within the next few years.\n  In order to prevent a repeat of the past mistake of leasing in the \nOCS off Florida, our legislation makes permanent the ban on any new \nleasing activity within 100 miles of our coast. In addition, it gives \nstates the flexibility to make a determination regarding the \nconsistency of oil and gas development and production plans as required \nby the Coastal Zone Management Act after an environmental impact \nstatement detailing the direct and cumulative impacts of the project is \ncompleted by the Minerals Management Service.\n  It is this second provision which is so important. Many in this body \nmay not be aware that my state is currently engaged in a battle to keep \ndrilling rigs off its coasts. In the process, the government of the \nstate of Florida was forced, by current law, to make a consistency \ndetermination on a pending development plan without the benefit of the \nenvironmental impact statement. In fact, the state was forced to \nconclude that the plan is inconsistent with its own coastal zone \nmanagement\n\n[[Page S11573]]\n\nprogram months before the environmental impact statement was concluded. \nAs I stand here, the EIS for this development plan is still not \nfinalized and its draft is currently the subject of public hearings. \nWithout the benefit of this detailed study, the state is unable to \naccurately assess the primary, secondary and cumulative impacts \ndrilling will have on our coast, estuaries, marine life and our \neconomy. No state should be put in a similar position and our bill \nseeks to correct this.\n  Mr. President, removing the threat of oil and gas exploration \npermanently from Florida's coast will require responsible leadership \nfrom the Congress. This reasonable legislation, in my view, will \nprovide states with critical information needed to assess risks to my \nstate's economic and environmental well-being. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this worthwhile effort. We look forward to working with Senator \nMurkowski, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, to meet this goal. I thank the Chair and ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1654\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nMack, to introduce legislation that will protect the coast of Florida \nin the future from the damages of offshore drilling.\n  I introduced similar legislation in last year's Congress that sought \nto codify the annual moratorium on leasing in the Gulf of Mexico and \nensure that states receive all environmental documentation prior to \nmaking a decision on whether to allow drilling off of its shores. That \nlegislation did not pass in the 105th Congress.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that takes these steps, plus \nseveral others. The Florida Coast Protection Act of 2000 will protect \nFlorida's fragile coastline from outer continental shelf leasing and \ndrilling in three important ways.\n  First, we transform the annual moratorium on leasing and preleasing \nactivity off the coast of Florida into a permanent ban covering \nPlanning Areas in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Straits of Florida, \nand the South Atlantic Planning Area.\n  Second, the Florida Coast Protection Act corrects an egregious \nconflict in regulatory provisions where an effected state is required \nto make a consistency determination for proposed oil and gas production \nor development under the Coastal Zone Management Act prior to receiving \nthe Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) from the Mineral Management \nService.\n  Our bill requires that the EIS is provided to affected states 6 \nmonths before they make a consistency determination, and it requires \nthat every oil and gas development plan have an EIS completed prior to \ndevelopment.\n  Third, our bill corrects the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and \nensures that oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico are subject to \nthe same rules and regulations that apply to oil and gas leases in \nother areas.\n  What would this bill mean for Florida? The elimination of preleasing \nactivity and lease sales off the coast of Florida protects our economic \nand environmental future.\n  More than 100 years ago, my grandfather settled in Northwest Florida. \nMy mother grew up near the Gulf of Mexico in Walton County. For years, \nI have taken my children and grandchildren to places like Grayton Beach \nso that they can appreciate the natural treasures and local cultures \nthat are port of both their own heritage and that of the Florida \nPanhandle.\n  We have a solemn obligation to preserve these important aspects of \nour state's history for all of our children and grandchildren. Much of \nour identity as Floridians is tied to the thousands of miles of \npristine coastline that link Jacksonville to Miami and Key West to \nPensacola.\n\n  The Florida coastline will not be safe if offshore oil and gas \nresources are developed. For example, a 1997 Environmental Protection \nAgency (EPA) study indicated that even in the absence of oil leakage, a \ntypical oil rig can discharge between 6,500 and 13,000 barrels of waste \nper year. The same study also warned of further harmful impact on \nmarine mammal populations, fish populations, and air quality.\n  Nor are leakages or waste discharge the only drilling-related \nenvironmental consequences. Physical disturbances caused by anchoring, \npipeline placement, rig construction, and the resuspension of bottom \nsediments can\n\n[[Page S11574]]\n\nalso be destructive. Given these conclusions, it isn't hard to imagine \nthe environmental havoc that oil or natural gas drilling could wreak \nalong the sensitive Panhandle coastline.\n  Because the Gulf of Mexico's natural beauty and diverse habitats \nattract visitors from all over the world and support a variety of \ncommercial activities, an oil or natural gas accident in the Gulf of \nMexico could also have a crippling effect on the Northwest Florida \neconomy. In 1996, the cities of Panama City, Pensacola, and Fort Walton \nBeach reported $1.5 billion in sales to tourists. That same year, the \nPanhandle's five westernmost counties generated more than $8 million in \npublic revenues from visitors paying the state's tourist development \ntax. And Florida's fishing industry benefits from the fact that nearly \n90 percent of reef fish caught in the Gulf of Mexico come from the West \nFlorida continental shelf.\n  Florida's fishing industry benefits from the fact that nearly 90 \npercent of reef fish caught in the Gulf of Mexico come from the West \nFlorida continental shelf.\n  For the last several years, I have been working with Senator Connie \nMack, U.S. Congressman Joe Scarborough, and others to head off the \nthreat of oil and natural gas drilling. In June of 1997, we introduced \nlegislation to cancel six natural gas leases seventeen miles off the \nPensacola coast and compensate Mobil Oil Corporation for its \ninvestment. Five days after the introduction of that legislation and \ntwo months before it was scheduled to begin exploratory drilling off \nFlorida's Panhandle, Mobile ended its operation and returned its leases \nto the federal government.\n  While that action meant that Panhandle residents faced one less \neconomic and environmental catastrophe-in-the-making, it did not \ncompletely eliminate the threats posed by oil and natural gas drilling \noff Florida's Gulf Coast. Florida's Congressional representatives fight \nhard each year to extend the federal moratorium on new oil and natural \ngas leases in the Gulf of Mexico. But that solution is temporary. So in \nJune of 1998, we introduced the Florida Gulf Coast Protection Act to \nprevent the federal government from issuing leases in the future.\n  This legislation did not pass during the 105th Congress. Today we are \nintroducing the Florida Gulf Coast Protection Act for the year 2000. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee to move this legislation forward and protect the \ncoast of Florida for our children and grandchildren.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1656. A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \npermit children covered under a State child health plan (SCHIP) to \ncontinue to be eligible for benefits under the vaccine for children \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              KEEPING CHILDREN HEALTHY WITH IMMUNIZATIONS\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill \nto clarify that children receiving health insurance under the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in states like California \nare eligible for free vaccines under the 1993 Federal Vaccines for \nChildren (VFC) program.\n  I want to especially commend the leadership of Congresswoman Nancy \nPelosi who is introducing a companion bill in the House today.\n  I am introducing this bill because the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services has interpreted the law so narrowly that as many as \n528,000 children in California have lost or will lose their eligibility \nto receive free vaccines, under California's Healthy Families program. \nApproximately 169,000 kids have lost eligibility to date.\n  California ranks 37th overall among States having children fully \nimmunized by the age of 18 to 24 months. From 1993 to 1997, Orange \nCounty, California, had 85 hospitalizations and four deaths related to \nchicken pox. Across the State in 1996 there were 15 deaths and 1,172 \nhospitalizations related to chicken pox. More recently, the \nImmunization Branch in California reports that in 1998 over 1,000 \nwhooping cough cases, including 5 deaths, were reported--the largest \nnumber of cases and deaths since the 1960's. Whooping cough and chicken \npox are diseases for which there are vaccinations. We must do more to \nincrease access to vaccinations for our nation's children.\n  The Federal Vaccines for Children program, created by Congress in \n1993 (P.L. 105-33), provides vaccines at no cost to poor children. In \n1998, as many 743,000 poor children in my state, who were uninsured or \non Medicaid, received these vaccines. This number is down by \napproximately 32,000 children in comparison to the 1997 immunization \nfigures for California's poor children. California received $80.3 \nmillion in 1999 from the Federal Government to provide vaccines.\n  Mr. President, what can be so basic to public health than \nimmunization against disease? Do we really want our children to get \npolio, measles, mumps, chicken pox, rubella, and whooping cough--\ndiseases for which we have effective vaccines, diseases which we have \npractically eradicated by widespread immunization? Every parent knows \nthat vaccines are fundamental to children's good health.\n\n  Congress recognized the importance of immunizations in creating the \nprogram, with many Congressional leaders at the time arguing that \nchildhood immunization is one of the most cost-effective steps we can \ntake to keep our children healthy. It makes no sense to me to withhold \nthem from children who (1) have been getting them when they were \nuninsured and (2) have no other way to get them once they become \ninsured.\n  According to an Annie E. Casey Foundation report, 28 percent of \nCalifornia's two-year old children are not immunized. Add to that the \nfact that we have one of the highest uninsured rates in the country. \nOur uninsured rate for non-elderly adults is 24 percent, the third \nhighest in the U.S., while the national uninsured rate is 17 percent. \nAs for children, 1.85 million or 19 percent of our children are without \nhealth insurance, compared to 15 percent nationally, according to \nUCLA's Center for Health Policy Research. Clearly, there is a need.\n  In creating the new children's health insurance program in \nCalifornia, the state chose to set up a program under which the state \ncontracts with private insurers, rather than providing eligible \nchildren care through Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California). Unfortunately, \nHHS has interpreted this form of ``health insurance'' as making them \n``insured,'' as defined in the vaccines law, and thus ineligible for \nthe federal vaccines. I disagree.\n  It is my view that in creating the federal vaccines program, Congress \nmade eligible for these vaccines children who are receiving Medicaid, \nchildren who are uninsured, and native American children. I believe \nthat in defining the term ``insured'' at that time Congress clearly \nmeant private health insurance plans. Children enrolled in California's \nnew Healthy Families program are participating in a federal-state, \nsubsidized insurance plan. Healthy Families is a state-operated \nprogram. Families apply to the state for participation. They are not \ninsured by a private, commercial plan, as traditionally defined or as \ndefined in the Vaccine for Children's law (42 U.S.C. sec. \n1396s(b)(2)(B). On February 23, the California Medical Association \nwrote to HHS Secretary Donna Shalala, ``As they are participants in a \nfederal and state-subsidized health program, these individuals are not \n``insured'' for the purposes of 42 U.S.C. sec. 1396s(b)(B).''\n  The California Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board, which is \nadministering the new program with the Department of Health Services, \nwrote to HHS on February 5, ``It is imperative that states like \nCalifornia, who have implemented the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram (CHIP) using private health insurance, be given the same \nsupport and eligibility for the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program at \nno cost as states which have chosen to expand their Medicaid program.'' \nThe San Francisco Chronicle editorialized on March 10, 1998, ``More \nthan half a million California children should not be deprived of \nvaccinations or health insurance because of a technicality . . .,'' \ncalling the denial of vaccines ``a game of semantics.''\n  Children's health should not be a ``game of semantics.'' Proper \nchildhood\n\n[[Page S11575]]\n\nimmunizations are fundamental to a lifetime of good health. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in enacting this bill into law, to help me keep \nour children healthy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url":

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nUniversity of Michigan Medical School as it celebrates its 150th \nAnniversary. On October 1, 1999, its faculty, staff, alumni, students \nand friends will gather to celebrate the Medical School's distinguished \nhistory and reputation.\n  Since its founding in 1850, the men and women of the University of \nMichigan Medical School have been pioneers in the practice of medicine. \nWith over 18,260 M.D. degrees awarded since the first graduating class \nin 1851, the Medical School's alumni and faculty have left an indelible \nmark on the course of medical history. With leading roles in the field \ntrials of the Salk polio vaccine, pioneering cancer treatments, \ninnovative uses of new technology in medicine and much more, it has \ngreatly impacted the health of our entire nation.\n  In addition, the University has a remarkably long list of innovative \nfirsts. It opened the nation's first university-owned hospital in 1869, \nthe first department of pharmacology in 1891, the first university-\noperated psychiatric hospital in 1906, the first children's psychiatric \nhospital and the nation's first Human Genetics Department. It has been \nan impressive century and a half indeed.\n  According to statistics recorded by the Center for Disease Control, \nin the last century alone, the average life expectancy has increased \nnearly 30 years, from approximately 47 years in 1900 to more than 76 \nyears today. Medical advances have not only added years to the lives of \nAmericans, but have also added quality to those years. Among those \nleading the way to longer and healthier lives have been the faculty and \nalumni of the University of Michigan Medical School. The value of their \ncontributions to the practice of medicine in America over the past 150 \nyears is incalculable, and I am confident that they will continue to be \non the cutting edge of medicine advances in the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, the faculty, staff, alumni and students of the \nUniversity of Michigan Medical School can take pride in their many \nimportant achievements of the School's first 150 years. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in saluting the accomplishments of the Medical \nSchool's first century and a half and in wishing it continued success \nfor the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/28/senate-section/article/S11577-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DOMINICK GIOVINAZZO\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes \nto say a few words about a good friend of mine upon his retirement.\n  I have known Dominick Giovinazzo, the retiring Executive Director of \nthe Greater Nashua, NH, Boys and Girls Club, for many, many years. \nDuring that time, I have regarded him as one of the finest people I \nknow. For the past 28 years, he has worked at the Greater Nashua Club \nand has dedicated himself to serving the kids who are members there. He \nis a passionate advocate of child safety and has worked to ensure that \nno child in the city of Nashua has to spend his or her afternoons and \nweekends on the streets or doing drugs. He has become an advisor and \nmentor to the staff of all of the New Hampshire Clubs; his wisdom and \nexperience have guided each Boys and Girls Club in the State to become \nstrong pillars of their communities. Most importantly, he has been a \ngood friend to his own community and to his fellow public servants. \nOver the years, I have appreciated his friendship, support, and \nguidance. I can only hope that others will follow his example of \ncharity and dedication.\n  Rarely does one come across another human being who so fully \ndedicates himself to a life of helping others. It was Dominick who \nbrought the importance and success of the Boys and Girls Clubs to my \nattention many years ago. And it was because of his tireless advocacy \nfor the Clubs that I have worked so hard to ensure that the federal \ngovernment helps fund the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. Dominick \nshowed me the importance of giving our youth a safe place to go and \ndependable, responsible friends to lean on.\n  No other person so richly deserves an easy retirement than Dominick \nGiovinazzo. I wish him luck in his future endeavors, and I am sure that \nhe will never stop caring about and lending his talents and civic-\nminded wisdom to his community. He is a valuable resource who I know \nthe City of Nashua, the Greater Nashua Boys and Girls Club, and his \nother friends and admirers will rely on for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/28/senate-section/article/S11577-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE DEDICATION OF THE SECOND TEMPLE PERIOD TRIPLE GATE MONUMENTAL \n                      STAIRS AND OBSERVATION PLAZA\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to honor the dedication of \nthe Second Temple period Triple Gate Monumental Stairs and Observation \nPlaza which will take place this weekend in Jerusalem. This is a new \nsite in the Jerusalem Archaeological Park which has been developed by \nthe Israel Antiquities Authority, focusing on the southern wall of the \nTemple Mount Enclosure. This restoration project has been dedicated and \nsupported by Dorothy Davidson Gerson and Byron Gerson in loving memory \nof Sarah and Ralph Davidson. The dedication ceremony for Gerson \nObservation Plaza will take place on Sunday, October 3 and will be \nattended by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the Mayor of \nJerusalem Ehud Olmert among many others.\n  The Triple Gate and the Double Gate, also known as the Huldah Gates, \nwere a key entrance to the Temple Mount for pilgrims during biblical \ntimes. This area of the southern wall was badly damaged following the \ndestruction of the Second Temple. The western Huldah Gate, or Double \nGate, now lies below the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The eastern Huldah Gate, or \nTriple Gate, consisted of three arched entryways at the time of the \nSecond Temple. Now parts of the threshold and the doorjamb are all that \nremain of the Triple Gate. In front of the Triple Gate was once a \nmonumental staircase. Much of this staircase has now been reconstructed \naffording visitors the opportunity to envision the southern entrances \nto the Temple Mount during the Second Temple period.\n  This important archaeological restoration effort would not have been \npossible without the generous support of Dorothy Davidson Gerson and \nByron Gerson. They have made possible an extraordinary view of an \nancient treasure which has transcendent meaning.

Wood County, WV, is \ncelebrating its bicentennial and a two-hundred year history of \nimportance and progress thanks to the continual spirit of its leaders \nand citizens.\n\n[[Page S11578]]\n\n  Over the past year, through the Wood County Bicentennial Commission, \nevents and activities have taken place to commemorate the county's rich \nhistory and install a spirit of excitement about the years to come. \nPeople of all ages, throughout the county, have been involved in \nhistoric exhibits, contests, and special ways to share the past and \nprepare for the future.\n  With this statement in the Congressional Record, I will make this my \nsubmission to the next major event in the bicentennial celebration--the \nplacing of a ``Time Capsule'' at the Wood County Courthouse. With my \nfellow West Virginians in Wood County, I envision the day one hundred \nyears from the day this capsule will be stored when a future Senator of \nWest Virginia will be presented this piece of history. I am confident \nthat in October of 2099, Wood County will continue to be a center of \neconomic progress, community spirit and commitment, and other features \nthat have defined this corner of the nation for two hundred years \nalready.\n  Wood County has a long history, in particular, in playing a major \nrole in the development of the oil and gas industry in the State and \nthe county. through its resources and industrial progress, Wood County \nhas been the source of fuel for prosperity and growth way beyond its \nborders.\n  The county is also proud to house a significant chemical industry, \nmanufacturing the critical components of products world-wide and \ninvolved in path-breaking research and development. For example, the \nlargest DuPont facility in the corporate structure resides outside of \nParkersburg on the land that George Washington once owned.\n  Wood County has tremendous treasures in the form of both its people \nand its material assets. I join its leadership and citizens in \ncelebrating this bicentennial year, and playing my part in the time \nCapsule that will reappear another century from now. And I know that \nAll Americans wish Wood County continued prosperity and \nprogress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/28/senate-section/article/S11578-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           KEEPING KIDS ALIVE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last week in Michigan, a coalition \nof members in the House of Representatives introduced a comprehensive \npackage of gun safety legislation. The principal sponsors of this \npackage are State Representatives Laura Baird, Gilda Jacobs and Samuel \nThomas II, three leaders in the state of Michigan on making our state \nsafer for children.\n  The legislation introduced in the Michigan State House is designed to \nkeep kids alive in Michigan and safe from gun violence. It would create \ngun-free zones in areas such as schools, day care centers, churches, \nlibraries, hospitals and sports arenas; make Michigan the eighteenth \nstate to enact a child access prevention law, requiring that trigger \nlocks be sold with handguns; close the gun show loophole by requiring \nthat unlicensed dealers be subject to the same standards as licensed \ndealers; and limit individuals to one handgun purchase a month.\n  This legislation, if enacted, would make Michigan one of the most \nresponsible gun safety states in the country. By taking firearms out of \nthe hands of minors and closing loopholes that permit criminals easy \naccess to weapons, Lansing will send a clear message to Michigan \nmothers and fathers that the state is acting to protect children from \ngun violence.\n  This legislation is a far cry from the legislation the Michigan \nLegislature moved forward with last spring. That NRA-backed \nlegislation, designed to loosen the state's law on carrying concealed \nhandguns sailed through the state Legislature only to be rejected by \nthe citizens of Michigan. Michigan's citizens demanded that their \nlawmakers, enforce stricter, not looser laws, when it comes to gun \nsafety and the protection of their children. The people in Michigan \nunited to reject that bill last spring and I hope they will again unite \nto seek action from their lawmakers, and urge them to pass this \nimportant legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/28/senate-section/article/S11578-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11578-S11580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCACY REVIEW PANEL TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. HAGEL.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect upon the expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nSmall Business Advocacy Review Panel Technical Amendments Act of 1999, \nS. 1156. This bill was approved by the Committee on Small Business \nwhich I chair, with unanimous bipartisan support. Senator Kerry, the \nRanking Member of the Committee, was the lead cosponsor of this \nimportant small business legislation.\n  Our bill is simple and straightforward. It clarifies and amends \ncertain provisions of the law enacted as part of my ``Red Tape \nReduction Act,'' the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act \nof 1996. In 1996, this body led the way toward enactment of this \nimportant law. With a unanimous vote, we took a major step to ensure \nthat small businesses get an opportunity to participate in the \nrulemaking process when their input can have the greatest impact, and \nthat they are treated fairly by federal agencies.\n  The overall purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, is to identify and \nminimize the burdens of the regulations on the small businesses \naffected by the agency's actions, and to help the agency make the rule \nas effective as possible when it is implemented.\n  Under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, \nwhich amended the Regulatory Flexibility Act, each ``covered agency'' \nis required to convene a Small Business Advocacy Review Panel (Panel) \nto receive advice and comments from small entities that will be \naffected by the regulation being developed. Specifically, under section \n609(b), each covered agency is to convene a Panel with representatives \nfrom the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within the Office \nof Management and Budget, the Chief Counsel of Advocacy of the Small \nBusiness Administration, and the covered agency promulgating the \nregulation, to receive input from small entities prior to publishing an \nInitial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for a proposed rule with a \nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. \nThe Panel produces a report containing comments from the small entities \nand the Panel's own recommendations. The report is provided to the head \nof the agency, who reviews it and, where appropriate, modifies the \nproposed rule, Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis or the decision \non whether the rule significantly impacts small entities. The Panel \nreport then becomes a part of the rulemaking record.\n  Under current law, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are the only \nagencies covered by the Panel process. So far, the results are \nencouraging with these agencies clearly benefitting from the input of \nthe small entities that have participated in the review panels. In \naddition, the bill will bring the Internal Revenue Service, the agency \nthat has perhaps the most pervasive impact on small businesses, into \nthe Panel process by mandating the agency to convene panels for certain \nproposed rulemakings that will impact small businesses.\n  Our bill also clarifies how the Regulatory Flexibility Act generally \napplies to the IRS. In 1996, Congress expressly included the IRS within \nthe coverage of the Red Tape Reduction Act which amended the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act. However, the Treasury Department has interpreted the \nlanguage in the law in a manner that essentially writes them out of the \nlaw. The Small Business Advocacy Review Panel Technical Amendments Act \nof 1999 clarifies which interpretative rules involving the Internal \nRevenue Code are to be subject to compliance with the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act. As I noted previously, for those rules that will \nimpose a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small \nentities, the IRS will also be required under our bill to convene a \nSmall Business Advocacy Review Panel as required by SBREFA.\n  If the Treasury Department and the IRS had implemented the Red Tape \nReduction Act as Congress originally intended, the regulatory burdens \non small businesses could have been reduced, and small businesses could \nhave been saved considerable trouble in fighting unwarranted rulemaking \nactions. For instance, with input from the small business community \nearly in the process for their 1997 temporary regulations on the \nuniform capitalization rules, the IRS could have taken into \nconsideration the adverse effects that inventory accounting would have \non farming businesses, and especially nursery growers. Similarly, if \nthe IRS had conducted an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, it \nwould have learned of the enormous problems surrounding its limited \npartner regulations prior to issuing the proposal in January 1997. \nThese regulations, which became known as the ``stealth tax \nregulations,'' would have raised self-employment taxes on countless \nsmall businesses operated as limited partnerships or limited liability \ncompanies, and also would have imposed burdensome new recordkeeping and \ncollection of information requirements.\n  Specifically, the bill strikes the language in section 603 of title 5 \nthat limits inclusion of IRS interpretative rules under the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act, ``only to the extent that such interpretative rules \nimpose on small entities a collection of information requirement.'' The \nTreasury Department has misconstrued this language in two ways. First, \nunless the IRS imposes a requirement on small businesses to complete a \nnew OMB-approved form, the Treasury Department contends that the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act does not apply. Second, in the limited \ncircumstances in which the IRS has acknowledged imposing a new \nreporting requirement, the Treasury Department has limited its analysis \nof the impact on small businesses to the burden imposed by the form, \nignoring the more substantive and complicated burdens. As a result, the \nTreasury Department and the IRS have turned Regulatory Flexibility Act \ncompliance into an unnecessary, second Paperwork Reduction Act.\n  To address this problem, our bill revises the critical sentence in \nsection 603 to read as follows:\n\n       In the case of an interpretative rule involving the \n     internal revenue laws of the United States, this chapter \n     applies to interpretative rules (including proposed, \n     temporary and final regulations) published in the Federal \n     Register for codification in the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n  The remaining provisions of our bill address the mechanics of \nconvening a Panel and the selection of the small-entity representatives \ninvited to submit advice and recommendations to the Panel.\n  Coverage of the IRS under the Panel process and the technical changes \nI\n\n[[Page S11580]]\n\nhave just described are strongly supported by the Small Business \nLegislative Council, the National Association for the Self-Employed, \nand many other organizations representing small businesses. Even more \nsignificantly, these changes have the support of the Small Business \nAdministration's Chief Counsel for Advocacy.\n  Our mutual goal is to ensure that the views of small entities are \nbrought forth through the Panel process and taken to heart by the \n``covered agency''--in short, to continue the success that EPA and OSHA \nhave shown this process has for small businesses. I thank the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts for his support, and I look forward to seeing the \nSmall Business Advocacy Review Panel Technical Amendments Act of 1999 \nsigned into law at the earliest possible date.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendments be agreed to, the bill be read a third time and passed, as \namended, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at-long last the Congress is approving and \npassing S. 249, the Missing, Exploited and Runaway Children Protection \nAct, which will reauthorize programs under the Runaway and Homeless \nYouth Act and will authorize funding for the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children. I have been working since 1996 to get \nthis legislation reauthorized. For each of the past several months I \nhave come to the floor to express my disappointment over how long it \nhas taken to pass this noncontroversial legislation.\n  I had some minor concerns with the House amended version of S. 249, \nbut as I said in my statement June 30 of this year, after receiving \nsome clarification and assurances from Secretary Shalala on these \nconcerns, I decided that the House amendments should not keep this \nimportant piece of legislation from passing. I am pleased that we could \nfinally clear this bill on the other side of the aisle.\n  The Missing, Exploited and Runaway Children Protection Act of 1999 \nreauthorizes programs under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and \nauthorizes funding for the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren. Both programs are critical to our nation's youth and to our \nnation's well-being.\n  In addition to providing shelter for children in need, the Runaway \nand Homeless Youth Act ensures that these children and their families \nhave access to important services, such as individual, family or group \ncounseling, alcohol and drug counseling and a myriad of other resources \navailable to help these young people and their families get back on \ntrack. As the National Network for Youth has stressed, the Act's \nprograms ``provide critical assistance to youth in high-risk situations \nall over the country.''\n  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children provides \nextremely worthwhile and effective assistance to children and families \nfacing crises across the U.S. and around the world. In 1998, the \nNational Center helped law enforcement officers locate over 5,000 \nmissing children. The National Center serves a critical role as a \nclearinghouse of resources and information for both family members and \nlaw enforcement officers. They have developed a network of hotels and \nrestaurants which provide free services to parents in search of their \nchildren and have also developed extensive training programs.\n  I do want to thank the many advocates, who have worked with me over \nthe years, for their tireless efforts to improve the bill. In \nparticular, I must mention the members of the Vermont Coalition of \nrunaway and Homeless Youth Programs and the National Network for Youth \nfor their dedication throughout this process.\n  This bill, S. 249, should have been enacted last year. It should have \nbeen enacted when the Houses finally sent it back to us in May of this \nyear. There was absolutely no reason to stall on this noncontroversial \nlegislation. I am pleased that we were finally able to pass it so these \nimportant programs can continue to succeed.\n  I reincorporate my remarks from June 30, July 15 and August 5 and I \nask unanimous consent that a copy of my letter to Secretary Shalala and \nthe response that I received be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             United States Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 26, 1999.\n     Hon. Donna Shalala,\n     Secretary of Health and Human Services, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Shalala: I am pleased that we are close to \n     enactment of S. 249, the Missing, Exploited, and Runaway \n     Children Protection Act of 1999, which will reauthorize \n     programs under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHYA) and \n     authorize funding for the National Center for Missing and \n     Exploited Children. The Senate passed the Leahy-Hatch \n     substitute to S. 249 on April 19, by unanimous consent. \n     Yesterday, the House passed its version of this legislation.\n       I am concerned about language inserted into the bill during \n     House consideration upon which the Senate was not consulted. \n     That language provides for a ``consolidated review of \n     applications'' of RHYA grants. Before agreeing to the new \n     language, I need to be assured that this could in no way be \n     construed as consolidating any of the RHYA programs under a \n     single formula allocation.\n       As you know now, under the RHYA, each year each State is \n     awarded at a minimum $100,000 for housing and crisis services \n     under the Basic Center grant program. Effective community-\n     based programs around the country can also apply directly for \n     the funding available for the Transitional Living Program and \n     the Sexual Abuse Prevention/Street Outreach grants.\n       I hope that you can clarify that the new language inserted \n     by House will do nothing to collapse the distinct programs \n     authorized under the RHYA. These programs are very important \n     and I would like to see the legislation passed without \n     further delay.\n       I have been working since 1996 to enact this reauthorizing \n     legislation. I worked to have the Senate pass this \n     legislation during the last Congress and again earlier this \n     year. With your assurance that Vermont and other small states \n     will not be disadvantaged by the language inserted by the \n     House in competing for national grant funding, I will seek to \n     expedite enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Department of Health\n\n\n                                           and Human Services,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 1999.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: You have asked us to consider the \n     impact of certain language recently inserted into the House \n     version of S. 249, the ``Missing, Exploited, and Runaway \n     Children Act of 1999''. Specifically, you have asked us to \n     consider whether proposed section 385, Consolidated Review of \n     Applications, will adversely affect the eligibility of small \n     States to receive Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHYA) \n     funding above the minimum grant allotment of the RHYA Basic \n     Center Grant program.\n       I am advised by General Counsel that currently the \n     Secretary has wide statutory discretion to prescribe the \n     procedures which will be used in awarding various grants \n     under the RHYA. The Secretary presently exercises this \n     discretion by choosing to include in a consolidated grant \n     announcement several discrete funding opportunities with \n     distinct application requirements. After studying the \n     pertinent language in S. 249, General Counsel has concluded \n     that the proposed legislation provides for a similar level of \n     discretion with respect to procedures to be\n\n[[Page S11584]]\n\n     used for various grant awards under the RHYA. Therefore, \n     since the proposed legislation does not require the Secretary \n     to change in any way her current procedures for awarding RHYA \n     grants, it will not require the Secretary to commingle the \n     current separate and discrete RHYA funding opportunities so \n     as to adversely affect the eligibility of small States to \n     receive RHYA funding above the minimum grant allotment of the \n     RHYA Basic Center grant program.\n       I hope this information is helpful to you as you proceed \n     with final consideration of S. 249. The Department deeply \n     appreciates all your efforts to reauthorize the Runaway and \n     Homeless Youth Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Richard J. Tarplin,\n                              Assistant Secretary for Legislation.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate agree to the \namendment of the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
